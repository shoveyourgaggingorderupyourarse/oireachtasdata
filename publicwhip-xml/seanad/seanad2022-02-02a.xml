This matter relates to the commitment given to tender publicly for what was supposed to be an independent chair for the three-year review of the abortion legislation.</p><p>On 8 December, prior to the launch of the three-year review, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, confirmed publicly, as he had on several occasions, that an independent chair would be appointed to lead the review.  In an address by the Minister to a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health on 8 December, members were informed that legally the appointment of a chair must go to an e-tender as the cost involved may be up to &euro;100,000.  A statutory requirement in respect of appointments costing in excess of &euro;25,000 required the post to be put out to tender, as acknowledged by Ms Geraldine Luddy from the Department.  The Minister said that, following advice, he was instructed that, if he were to make an appointment without undertaking an e-tendering process, he would be acting illegally.  The Minister also claimed that his Department would issue the tender for the chair on the Government's eTenders website in the coming days, although he later said that he had asked officials to ensure a tender was issued in the next two weeks.  He noted that all of this was unfortunate because a number of excellent candidates had been identified and that he &quot;would much rather be announcing a chair today&quot;.  He later contradicted himself, claiming: &quot;We have also put out the tender for the chair today.&quot;  </p><p>It is interesting that a press release went out that day saying that an e-tender had been put out for the appointment of an independent chair.  That was sent to all media but it did not happen.  Later that day or, perhaps, later on, another press release was put up on the Department's website, we might say secretly, removing the reference to an independent chair.  Of course, that was not circulated to the media.  </p><p>On that day, Ms Luddy confirmed that the e-tender would go up within a week or so of the date of that meeting of the committee.  It was acknowledged by the departmental official that the existing e-tender on the website dealing with the research element was not the tender for a chair.  Over the course of December and into January, no e-tender seeking applications for the position of independent chair was posted on the website.  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i>on 13 January claimed that &quot;a request for tender for a chair to carry out research into the views of service providers was published last December&quot;.  That was not the case.  The Minister was quoted as expressing his desire that the process to select an independent chair would be got through quickly.  He wanted it to be completed by the end of January.  However, it was only in response to a parliamentary question on 19 January that the Minister acknowledged that he had, in fact, contacted a small number of candidates and invited them to apply for the position of independent chair.  The commitment given and repeated publicly that there would be open recruitment for an independent chair was not fulfilled.  It seems it was not intended to fulfil that commitment and nobody was told that was the case.  </p><p>We now have to say we suspect dishonesty.  There is no other word for it.  There has been a failure on the part of the Minister and his officials.  I have raised this issue several times.  People have sought to communicate with the Minister.  The Minister of State has very wittily said here previously that she would not be here if there was any good news to give.  This is the same thing.  The Minister of State and I would both tell our visitors in the Gallery that they are very welcome.  If that young man in the Gallery ever goes into politics, I hope he will treat his colleagues better than the Minister for Health is treating us on this issue because this failure to be truthful and upfront is a bad reflection on the Minister and his Department.  </p><p>A closed number of candidates were contacted.  We do not know who they were.  Subsequently, it was announced that a person had been appointed as an independent chair.  It is vital that an independent chair is somebody who can look at the workings of this abortion legislation from the point of view of those who have concerns.  An example of such a concern from a pro-life perspective it that there is not adequate pain relief for late-term abortions.  It is appalling to even have to talk about such issues.  There are also issues with regard to the rise in the number of abortions.  There are also those who favour abortion who would like there to be fewer obstacles to getting abortions.  We need someone who does not have skin in the game and yet Ms Luddy said at that meeting of the Joint Committee on Health that it needed to be somebody with a reproductive rights-based approach.  All this time, we have had people talking out both sides of their mouths.  They have been talking about independence while not acting openly or in a trustworthy way and not communicating that they had changed their mind and were going back on their commitment or that they were never sincere about it in the first place; I do not know which was the case.  However, it was done secretly and, in the end, somebody who expressed views in favour of repeal before any of this happened was appointed.  It is a shambolic situation and I hope the Minister of State has some answers for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-02a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022020200002#B00100"><p>As the Senator will be aware, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act was signed into law on 20 December 2018 and commenced on 1 January 2019.  A review clause was included in the Act to facilitate monitoring of the impact, operation and effectiveness of the legislation in practice, as well as the delivery of services in this area.</p> <p>The review of the operation of the Act has commenced and will comprise two phases.  During the first phase, information and evidence on the effectiveness and operation of the Act will be collected from women who use the service, health professionals who provide the service and from the public.  Independent research commissioned to inform the service user and service provider strands will form key elements of the review.</p> <p>Research to inform the service user strand has been commissioned by the HSE.  The large-scale qualitative research will generate an in-depth understanding of the experiences of women who have accessed services since the commencement of the Act.  Independent research is also being commissioned on service providers' views on the operation of the legislation.  The tender process for the research is in train.  A request for tenders was published on the Government's eTenders website in December.  The Minister for Health also announced a public consultation to inform the review on 8 December and the consultation will be open until I April.  Everyone who would like to express their views on the operation of the Act should participate.</p> <p>The second phase of the review will be led by an independent chairperson.  As the Minister stated during his appearance before the Joint Committee on Health on 8 December, since the costs involved in contracting an independent chairperson to conduct the review were estimated as exceeding &euro;25,000, the advice he received from his officials was that the Department was obliged, under procurement rules, to tender for the appointment.  Under that procurement process, given the expertise required for the position, a small number of candidates, identified as having suitable experience, were contacted and invited to submit a tender to take on the role of independent chairperson.  I am delighted to confirm that the Minister has appointed the barrister, Ms Marie O'Shea, as the independent chairperson.  Ms O'Shea has significant legal expertise, as well as experience in project management and healthcare sector research.  As independent chairperson, Ms O'Shea will assess the extent to which the objectives of the Act have been achieved, analysing the findings of the three strands of phase one of the review as part of it.  She will also assess the extent to which the Act's objectives have been achieved and make recommendations to address any barriers identified.  The chairperson will also draw on the findings of other relevant peer reviewed research and consult further with stakeholders as necessary.</p> <p>Concerning the press release issued on 8 December, this was reissued to clarify that the tender, which had issued on that date, was for the research component of the review.  The Minister is confident that the chairperson, Ms O'Shea, will conduct this important work thoroughly, efficiently and in a fair and transparent manner.  The Minister also looks forward to receiving Ms O'Shea's final report in which she will set out her conclusions, and any recommendations, later this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-02a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022020200002#B00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her response but, as predicted, she has been mistreated as well as the rest of us by being given what a rather duplicitous text to read because the import of it is that they acknowledge that they knew they had to tender.  I have read the transcript of the health committee meeting and they were committing to openly tendering.  Now what they are trying to do is to cover their tracks afterwards by claiming what they meant by tender was this secret process of contacting a small number of suitable candidates.  For all we know now they were actually looking for a crony or somebody who actually was, if you like, on the abortion side of the argument because we have had no honesty and no reassurance.</p> <p>I am sure that the person they have appointed intends well but that person, on several occasions, engaged in a patter of tweeting tending to support the repeal side of the argument.  That is why I called in the Seanad last week for her to honourably withdraw.  How can the public have confidence in a Minister and a Department who say that they are going to appoint somebody independent and then they appoint somebody who can be proven was supporting abortion at the time of repeal?  They say that they were going to tender openly and they do not do it.  They tender secretly and they never tell us that they are going to do that.  Then they change a press release but they do not alert the media to the fact that they have done so.  It is nothing but dishonesty, I am afraid.  It is an apology that they owe us, and it is not the Minister of State who should have been asked to come in and answer this today.</p></speech>

All indications are that these services are both operating and available, and they are delivered in hospitals and community settings.  The Minister is determined that the review will be undertaken in a fair and transparent manner.</p> <p>As I outlined in my opening remarks, a three-part approach will be taken to reviewing the operation of the Act with strands focusing on service users, service providers and a public consultation.  Independent research is being undertaken to inform the services users and the service provider strands.  It is the Minister's hope and, indeed, my own that all those interested will take the time to voice their views as part of the public consultation.</p> <p>The second phase of the review will be led by the independent chairperson.  We have now conducted the procurement process for the position of the chairperson.  The Minister is confident that the person appointed, Ms Marie O'Shea, bachelor of law, has the experience necessary to carry this very significant work thoroughly, efficiently and in a balanced and fair manner.</p> <p>As I have previously clarified, the press release issued on 8 December was reissued to explain that the tender, which had issued on that date, was for the research component of the review.  The Minister is confident that the information gathered during the review of the operation of the 2018 Act will provide us with the evidence as to how to proceed in the future.  It is essential that we continue to ensure that the services mandated by the people in May 2018 operate effectively.</p></speech>

The last time that I raised this question was in 2019 and at that stage, seven children in the mid-west were awaiting permanent long-stay beds.</p> <p>I am working with a family who have a daughter aged 11 who is non-verbal and bedridden, and they have carers who come to the house.  The family cares for their daughter in the best way possible but, unfortunately, as the girl gets older it is getting more difficult to provide care.  The parents must now use a hoist and it takes several people to lift the child.  These are not ideal circumstances.</p> <p>I acknowledge that the Minister of State is committed to her children because of all that she has done since taking up office.  On her latest visit to Limerick she visited St. Gabriel's and, in fact, that is where she met the child.  The family is very much reliant on the wider family.  The family provides care 24-7 and the only time they get a break is when they get a night's respite in their house.  While they love their child dearly it has come to a stage where the mother is in need of an operation on her back and the parents are physically not able to provide care any more.  This is a very serious situation but it is not just this case.  A business case has been made to the HSE in CHO 3 regarding the provision of long-stay beds because many children find themselves in a similar situation.</p> <p>When I raised this issue in 2019 there were seven children on the waiting list and I understand that that number has increased.  A solution must be found.  Somebody said to the mother that she should leave her daughter at the University Hospital Limerick, UHL, as hospital staff would have to deal with her.  Parents love their children so much that they do not want to do that.  Instead, they want to do what is right by their child and ensure that their child gets the care and attention that is needed.  Unfortunately, no beds have been provided in Limerick that I am aware of since the last time that I raised this matter.  The number of children in need of such care are growing and it is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>As I have mentioned, recently a case was made to the HSE and the parents had to fill out forms, complete a survey and so on.  There still has been no answer and there is no light at the end of the tunnel currently for these families.  The issue needs to be addressed and I have every faith that the Minister of State will do her best.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I look forward to hearing what she has to say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-02a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022020200002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity to provide an update on the matter.  As the Senator knows, this Government is committed to empowering people with a disability to live independent lives and giving them the ability to choose the supports that most meet their needs where possible.  This ensures that people with a disability can make a real, tangible difference in their lives.</p> <p>Reflecting the strength of this Government's commitment in this area, significant additional funding was provided in the 2021 and 2022 budgets for disability developments, which will see the budget for specialist disability services exceeding &euro;2.3 billion.  This includes provision of more investment in residential support services and supports, which enable the HSE to increase residential capacity in a planned way; continue providing crisis residential placements; continue the decongregation programme; and provide more intensive support packages to enable those with complex needs to remain at home with their families.  </p> <p>The HSE is currently supporting in the region of 8,100 residential places across the country for people with a disability.  Residential services make up the largest part of the disability funding dispersed by the HSE, at more than 60% of the total budget of the &euro;2.2 billion in 2021.  </p> <p>For the House's information, the HSE disability services use a system called the disability support application management tool, DSMAT, which enables the community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas to record and manage requests for support to ensure that the application process is equitable and transparent.  It is important to note that the DSMAT is not a chronological waiting list.  Rather, it supports and informs the CHO's decision-making process around prioritisation of services within appropriate budgets.  The aim is to ensure that services are allocated on the basis of greatest presenting need and associated risk factors.  </p> <p>Specifically relating to the mid-west, or CHO 3 area, I am advised by the HSE that there are two children on the priority waiting list for approval for business cases for residential placements, and that two children have been approved for residential placement and are awaiting placements to commence.</p> <p>The HSE acknowledges that demographic challenges associated with the increase in the number of people living with a disability, the increase in age and life expectancy and the changing needs of people with a disability have all led to the need for increased residential facilities.  In this regard, the HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need.  To the end of November 2021, the HSE delivered 77 emergency residential placements, which is 33 places in excess of the number profiled for the year.  </p> <p>The national service plan, NSP, 2022 will soon be finalised.  I would hope, when the HSE service plan is finalised, that those two children, who are at the top of that list, will be supported and the needs of the child and family will be met.  I would like to acknowledge the wonderful work of the management team and the staff in St. Gabriel's and the local community in the development of that project.  </p> <p>I was working with the good Senator and other elected representatives in the mid-west and we were able to identify and source the funding to the respite piece of it.  On first allocation, it was &euro;5 million over seven years, and now we have gone to &euro;7 million over seven years.  That &euro;7 million over seven years will come, hopefully, when the NSP is published.  Perhaps that will give the family a little bit extra respite while the house is being sourced and built and while the allied support care for putting in place a residential solution is pursued.  </p> <p>The most important thing is the communication between the HSE and that family; the reassurance that they are one of the two.  I think that is what the Senator really wants to know.  While we do not talk about individual cases, having had dealings with Maurice throughout the past two years, I have no doubt that Maurice will engage with the Senator and the family to ensure there is a pathway to support this young individual and that family to meeting their residential expectations in the area.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the child is one of the two children.  I am glad to hear that it is down to two because it was seven originally, the last time I tabled this question.  This child I am referring to is certainly in need of a critical care bed. The family has been told that is what they have been put forward for.</p> <p>Certainly, it has gone on so long at this stage that I believe that, as the Minister of State said, the family needs reassurance and they need an answer.  It would be good even if they knew they will get a bed a year down the road; it is about that reassurance.  The only way I can describe it is that they are very worn down.  </p> <p>It is not from lack of care or anything like that.  They provide care 24-7 and they do absolutely everything for that child.  It is just that they are not physically able anymore.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for her commitment.</p></speech>

That is what Covid taught us, when we saw how the Department of Health could work with the local HSE areas that could work with the various providers.  However, during all that working arrangement, families had no access to respite.  That is why families are coming through that phase at this moment exhausted, tired and needing to know the pathway.  They realise that they, perhaps, cannot be able to do this day in, day out, without knowing for how long.  That is the concern that families have.  We are very fortunate in the mid-west with St. Gabriel's, in that we have that established respite piece.  However, respite is only one part of the gamut of suites that is required for people with disability.</p> <p>We talk about alternative respite care and permanent respite care.  We then have to talk about phased residential care, full residential care and how to support the needs of the individual - the person-centred approach - and the families.  At the centre of that is good communication.  It is no good not knowing if you are one of the two involved.  People need to know where they are.  </p> <p>On the other side of it, my job for 2022 is to spend the money wisely with the HSE to ensure we build that capacity, not just in CHO 3, but in every CHO around the country.  I look forward to the NSP being announced, because my will, preference and desire is to build that capacity to ensure that we leave no CHO behind and we address the whole suite of measures that families want.  This Government has a commitment to funding and it is my job to ensure I see delivery for families on the ground.  </p> <p>I thank the Senator for her question.</p></speech>

She is a frequent visitor and will be very much aware of the issue and challenges of the Commencement matter that I have tabled.</p><p>I live in a part of west Clare where there is a significant amount of forestry.  The west Clare municipal district goes from the Burren down to Kilrush and there is much forestry in that area.  There is also much forestry that is ready to be cut over the next couple of years.  </p><p>The problem is when Coillte, for example, goes in and fells trees, unfortunately the roads, which are largely built on bog, are not able to handle the heavy goods vehicles that are transporting the timber.  This has caused a major problem for people who live in the area, such as farmers and families who use the roads and the local authority.  The issue is that the local authority could have resurfaced one of these roads.  Coillte is then granted a licence to proceed to do its tree felling and to, essentially, wreck the road.  There is no comeback for the local authority, whatsoever, in terms of compensation.  </p><p>There are examples in Mayo where Coillte came in to the local council chamber and gave commitments in a specific area.  That was because a councillor just kept highlighting the issue.  Something similar happened in Kerry.  Really and truly, we cannot have <i>ad hoc</i>solutions such as that.  We need a proper plan to deal the reconstruction of these roads post-felling.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am proposing that if and when a licence is being issued to Coillte or any other party to fell trees, there would be a condition built into that licence for a before-and-after road condition survey to be carried out and there would be an agreement beforehand on the condition the road is in before the tree felling starts and on what condition it should be in when it finishes.  To ensure that what exists now will exist after felling, there must be a commitment of funding, compensation or whatever word one wishes to use, and that commitment must be there in black and white.  Perhaps the compensation could be lodged in an account and if the road is only in need of X amount of the money when the post-felling survey is done, that is all that would be used and the rest would be returned to the forestry operator.</p><p>There is an environmental issue here as well.  We must ensure there are no difficulties.  These State agencies and private companies have to work in tandem.  We must ensure that everybody knows what is happening, what the protocols are and what is required of them, so that when Coillte and other operators are budgeting for the felling of trees they know they must build a compensation package into their budgets to restore the roads to the standard that existed before the exercise began.  It is a very reasonable proposal.  It came from the engineers at municipal district level in Clare County Council.  It would solve a lot of problems and would ensure that the local authority funding provided for roads is used for the roads for which it is needed, not roads that are destroyed as a result of tree felling.</p></speech>

Forestry plays a very important role in our rural economy and in climate change mitigation efforts and supports thousands of local rural jobs, directly and indirectly.  Following recent improvements made to the forest licensing system, my Department issued 4,050 forestry licences last year, a 56% increase on 2020.</p> <p>The increased supply of licences to the industry over the past 12 months has allowed processors to rebuild their inventories, putting them in a much better position to respond to fluctuating demand from customers and to build confidence about the future.  We have worked hard to enable this.  During 2020 and 2021, my Department undertook significant and difficult work to incorporate complex ecological, appropriate assessment and public consultation requirements into the current licensing system.  With regard to roads, the Department is not seeking to involve detailed public road management issues within the current felling licensing processes.  There are a number of safeguards and measures in place to protect the public road network, and good communications, planning and management are central to implementing these.</p> <p>Currently, all applications involving clear-fell are referred directly to the relevant local authority for comment.  Where felling licences are issued, once a licensee or the licensee's haulier has accessed the public road network, the safe use and prevention of damage to the road are seen as matters exclusively for the local roads authority, the county council, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the licensee or the licensee's haulier.  All this is guided by a publication entitled "A Good Practice Guide, Managing Timber Transport" and the road haulage of round timber code of practice 2017.  These guides were prepared by the forest industry transport group, which included representatives from the stakeholders in timber transport, including the local authorities.  The guides propose a preventative approach to many issues of concern.  Adherence to the guides will generate solutions based on good communications, planning and management; optimum vehicle selection and-or procurement; and compliance with legislation and guidelines.  My Department supports further practical measures aimed at protecting the public road network, including the provision of support for variable tyre pressure systems on timber transport vehicles and the use of optimal routing technology by operators.</p> <p>Additional consultation and referrals with local authorities are provided for in the development of new forest roads and entrances.  Following the introduction of the Forestry (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, S.I. No. 39 of 2020, my Department now acts as the consent authority for applications for forest road works licences, where the forest road provides access to a public road other than a national road or there is material widening of an existing entrance.  These amendment regulations are on foot of the commencement of section 8 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018.  Forest road projects that provide access to a national road still require planning permission from the relevant roads authority.  For other road types, a mandatory standardised consultation process with the relevant roads authority is implemented.</p> <p>To summarise, there is a strong need to ensure that the new requirements for consultation are implemented properly by all parties.  Sufficient safeguards and measures exist to protect the public road network, and all stakeholders need to focus on the implementation of these to ensure that timber transport can be conducted sustainably on and off our public roads.</p></speech>

Frankly, however, I am disappointed that it is not stronger.  I believe this is a problem.  While proper communication, safeguards and so forth work in many places, there are areas where they do not work.  Where is the penalty or the consequences when there is no proper communication?  Are there situations where these companies are fined if they do not comply?  What are the safeguards?  What is the auditing of these organisations?  Are they spot-checked?  Are the local authorities communicated with post the tree felling to see if they are satisfied with the level of communication?  I am told that certainly in parts of Clare the communication is practically non-existent and that the local authority executive and engineers have to chase it.  They get word that this is happening and will not be told.  There is no commencement date and they are chasing or essentially fire fighting, using money that should be used for local road improvement schemes, other local community roads, improving footpaths, disabled access, improving car parking and so forth.  Unfortunately, too often too much money is spent cleaning up after these companies when they have completed their tree felling.</p></speech>

In parts of my constituency, roads are founded on peat as well and it is a problem for any transport, not just timber transport but also agricultural transport and movements.  However, the management of public roads is outside the remit of my Department.  We try to operate the licence consent and grant schemes and to improve the communication with the public roads networks and the roads authorities.  Perhaps there is scope to explore how that communication is working - whether there is feedback, whether the local authorities are responding in an appropriate way and whether there is communication between the hauliers and the local authorities - but they should certainly be trying to adhere to the advice that comes with the code of practice relating to managing and moving timber.  To be honest, we are going to have more movement of timber in the next decade and it is something that needs consideration.</p></speech>

He is aware we are in the middle of a period of radical technological transformation, where we are seeing a convergence of a range of new technologies from artificial intelligence to blockchain to 6G and the Internet of things.  Today I want to talk about the metaverse, an augmented and virtual reality, and the extent to which the State is prepared to operate in such a sector.</p> <p>As there always is with new technologies and opportunities, there are disputes about the value of the market and what will happen in that space.  Bloomberg, for instance, estimates the market will be worth approximately $800 billion by 2024.  Facebook has rebranded as Meta, and it has already committed $10 billion to the project, including the hiring of 10,000 workers for its European operations.  Mr. Bill Gates last December predicted most meetings within two to three years will take place in the metaverse.  We have gone from Zoom to appreciating a few meetings as we get back but this will be transformational.</p> <p>To give a picture of what we will see happening, we will have immersive shopping experiences.  Rather than Members necessarily having to go to stores on the main street, they may be able to put on augmented and virtual reality devices to carry out shopping.  In education, learning will be done in that way so if we want to learn about the events of 1922, we will be able to put on a headset and immerse ourselves in the experience.  I even suggest that at some point in the future, we could hear Commencement Matters where my avatar in a virtual parliament could pose questions to the Minister of State's avatar.  That might cause a few frights around this House where, during the Covid-19 pandemic, there was an insistence on Members being on the parliamentary campus.  I am not sure how such people might react to this.</p> <p>Some people might think this is far-fetched but much of this is happening.  In the gaming world, Minecraft has a 140 million monthly active users.  The biggest gig in the world last year, when we were pleading to keep theatre and arts venues open, had 12 million people on Fortnite at the same time.  Seoul has already committed as a city government to operate in the metaverse as part of South Korea's digital new deal.  In November, it announced that a variety of its public services and cultural events will move to the metaverse.  We have seen the rise of crypto assets and non-fungible tokens.  The key for Ireland is a need to strategically respond to some of these.</p> <p>I welcome the Government's digital strategy that was published yesterday, although there is no mention of the metaverse in it and there is no real mention of augmented and virtual reality.  There is much positive stuff nonetheless.  It is key for us to see a whole-of-government approach in this area.  I want to see us exploring how this will happen.  The Government's digital strategy talks about nurturing digital start-ups and we need to see how we can support start-ups and existing companies that may want to do business within the metaverse.</p> <p>We must address a series of matters around regulation and these are similar to challenges we are facing in other aspects of technology.  These concern questions of privacy and cybercrime, and there has already been a case of sexual harassment in the metaverse.  We must look at the potential impact on social engagement as we do not want people behind screens and headsets all the time.  We must be able to interact on a one-to-one basis.  We will need upskilling and reskilling.</p> <p>We must be ambitious.  Our strategy in dealing with new technologies must be about looking at where we will be in 2030 and 2040.  At times I wonder if the Government is underestimating the speed of change we are experiencing in technology and the scale of the challenge and opportunity ahead of us.</p></speech>

He has correctly said that the digital world is growing and is very much a part of our everyday lives.  It is important that the Government and all of us as legislators are responsive and, crucially, future-proof our laws, society and economy to keep pace with future developments as they happen.</p> <p>The metaverse is still a relatively new concept in its early stages of development.  The full gamut of opportunities, challenges and risks that it is likely to present are still emerging.  We can only begin to identify the range and type of measures and regulations that may be needed at this stage.  That said, when it comes to seizing the opportunities of digital developments and the mainstreaming of disruptive technologies, we are working on a number of fronts which I believe will also be relevant to the metaverse.</p> <p>Our new national digital strategy, alluded to by the Senator, is entitled Harnessing Digital: The Digital Ireland Framework and was published yesterday.  It is the Government's vision for Ireland as a digital leader at the heart of European and global digital developments.  The strategy recognises the importance of measures such as skills policies and infrastructure.  These will be vital if Irish enterprise is to seize the opportunities of digitalisation overall, including any that the metaverse will open.</p> <p>Another important aspect is likely to be setting standards, both within the EU and for the world, to ensure products made here can compete internationally across all realms as well as the metaverse.  When it comes to regulation, many of the rules we are devising now have been shaped with future-proofing in mind.  For example, the Digital Markets Act prohibits certain behaviours by large gatekeepers that can be added to or reduced if necessary.  Similarly, the Digital Services Act establishes a liability regime for providers of digital services, which has stood the test of time and furthermore obliges very large platforms to identify and mitigate risks.  Where new risks are created by the metaverse or other virtual realities, they will still need to comply with those provisions.</p> <p>Of course, the specifics of the metaverse are likely to raise a variety of other issues.  Cryptocurrencies, privacy, safety, competition in the market and content moderation are just some of those.  Our approach to any new regulation in those areas will be the same as it has been to other digital laws; we will seek rules that are balanced and proportionate, take an ethical approach, promote fair competition and foster innovation.</p></speech>

Yesterday I spoke about the approach of the Central Bank, for example, to fintech and financial services companies.  We saw the decision by Revolut to move its operations to Lithuania.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many fintech companies do not believe that the regulatory sandbox that is required to allow these companies to start is being pursued here.  There are many problems with cryptocurrencies but we are moving towards the era of digital currencies.  There is a clear decision on the part of the European Central Bank, ECB, that we are moving into a digital euro.  I worry that we are not availing of all of the opportunities that are presented.  How are we going to ensure that our small enterprises are going to be able to compete in the metaverse?  Will we be able to seek those 10,000 jobs for Ireland that Meta or Facebook are going to create?  I have a general concern that in many areas of technology we spend our time trying to catch up in the area of regulation, rather than trying to look at what is coming down the line and avail of the opportunities while facing up to the challenges.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to regulation that addresses the issues technology has posed in a coherent way and takes the interests of users and providers into account for a balanced result.  Yesterday we published our national digital strategy.  We have committed to a digitalisation fund of &euro;75 million to help enterprises.  Some enterprises are not even digitally literate at the moment.  There is a way to go to bring them to the standard they need to reach in the current market.  There are also other enterprises which are much further advanced.  It is important that we take guidance and work with those enterprises to ensure that our regulation is responsive to their needs and protects the users.  In that context, as part of our artificial intelligence strategy, we have committed to establishing a digital enterprise forum which will bring leaders in that field together on a quarterly basis to advise the Government on the policy required to support job creation in this area.  I welcome any suggestions Members may have in that area.  It is an area that offers significant opportunities and we must seize those opportunities, and work collectively to ensure we do so.</p></speech>

I would award that to my great friend Fritz Senn in Z&uuml;rich who is 90 years old and still keeping his students happy.  It is a very important and happy day.  As Samuel Beckett might have replied, it is a happy day because it is the 100th anniversary of the publication of <i>Ulysses</i>.  In the early 1920s James Joyce was in Sylvia Beach's bookshop, Shakespeare and Company, bemoaning the fact that he could not find a publisher for <i>Ulysses</i>.  I remember Sylvia Beach very well.  She was a tiny bird-like little American woman, but a woman of great fortitude and steel.  She offered to publish it and Joyce took up her offer.  So it was that 100 years ago today <i>Ulysses</i>was published.</p><p>What a remarkable book.  Virginia Woolf had outlined the design for stream of consciousness in, I think, <i>The Common Reader</i>.  However, she never did it herself.  She wrote the prescription; Joyce fulfilled the medicine.  He was very superstitious and so it was published on his birthday, 2 February 1922.  Sylvia Beach went to the railway station and collected the first two copies, one for the window of her shop and one for James Joyce.  When Joyce opened it, he discovered that the printer in Dijon, Daranti&egrave;re, had decided to correct Joyce's manuscript.  For example, there was a list of characters, famous Irish characters ranging over the centuries, including Michael Angelo Hayes.  Daranti&egrave;re thought &quot;Michelangelo?&quot; and so put &quot;Michelangelo, Hayes&quot;, not realising that Michael Angelo Hayes was a real person known to Joyce and had founded the Dublin Photographic Society.  That partly explains the 5,000 errors that were claimed to be in <i>Ulysses</i>.  Whatever about the errors, it is a wonderful life-enhancing book and we should give thanks to James Joyce for having written it and having given us so much pleasure.</p></speech>

We thank him for all that work and all his work in bringing to a wider audience the work of James Joyce.  We take great pride in him and the work he has championed including that great work of art, which is one of the greatest artistic achievements of any Irish person.</p> <p>I now revert to the normal Order of Business and call on the acting leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il group this morning, Senator O'Loughlin.</p></speech>

No matter what, he is our Joycean scholar and we are all incredibly proud of him both for his work on Joyce and literature and for the work he has been doing in the Seanad.  In addition to celebrating the 100th anniversary of the publication of Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>, it is also important to note that he was 40 on the day it was published so today would have been his 140th birthday.  There is no doubt that the world of literature was changed forever.  It is terrific to see how our culture and our literature are yet again being celebrated around the world.</p><p>In particular, I wish to mention Susan Leybourne who at this moment is in the Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris having published an e-book.  In celebrating the 100th birthday of <i>Ulysses</i>, she has organised a birthday cake to come from Trieste and has organised school competitions in Italy, France and Ireland.  How we handle our literature and our understanding of literature are important.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, for her and support on that.  Long may we live to read the works of Joyce and celebrate them.</p><p>Yesterday, I spoke about a bridge between the pagan world and the Christian world and that bridge was St. Brigid.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I want to talk about another bridge today and that is Caragh Bridge in Kildare.  For the second time since 2016, the bridge has been substantially damaged.  This means a large part of the population of Caragh has been cut off from the other part.  It is causing absolutely huge disruption in getting to school and getting to work.  It is also causing huge disruption to the businesses in Caragh which do not have passing traffic.  As this is an historic monument permission must be sought from the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  I have written to both to ask them to give their permission very quickly for the work that needs to be done.  Tenders are being sought at present.  There is a bigger issue here.  The bridge is not fit for purpose with regard to the quality and quantity of vehicles traversing it.  There should be another bridge.  I also ask for an assessment of the bridges in Kildare.  There is a huge number of bridges because of two canals, various rivers and our railway works.  I am very concerned not only about Caragh Bridge but also Moore's Bridge and, of course, I also have to mention the necessity for a new bridge crossing in Newbridge.</p></speech>

We have had 1 February and St. Brigid's Day and now we have the Ulysses centenary.  I am glad the winter is behind us.  We all seem to be feeling a bit more upbeat.  Today I want to focus on neurological services and the shortage of neurological nurses nationally.  It is a worry.  The Neurological Alliance of Ireland has said we need an extra 100 neurological nurses.  In Beaumont Hospital there should be 15 but there are ten.  In St. James's Hospital there should be 14 but there are only four.  They cover epilepsy, migraine, brain and spinal cord injury, long-term neurological conditions such as stroke and Parkinson's disease, and life-limiting neurological conditions such as motor neurone disease.  There is not a family in Ireland that is not affected by neurological needs.</p> <p>The HSE has advised that plans will be developed to incrementally increase their overall numbers.  There has been an overall increase in nursing and midwifery but this needs to be a priority.  It is about having the right care in the right place.  Having neurological nurses takes pressure off consultant neurologists and allows us to build up what we need for community care in nurse-led clinics, liaison services and outreach programmes.  I experienced this recently when meeting Acquired Brain Injury Ireland, which does incredible work.  A total of 19,000 people per year are affected by brain injury.  Acquired Brain Injury Ireland provides neurorehabilitation.  It takes an holistic approach with wraparound services not only for those who suffer a brain injury but also their families, on whom it also has an impact.</p> <p>We put much emphasis on acute care and care in hospitals but people start a whole new chapter when they leave hospital.  There are too many people in the wrong place such as nursing homes.  Acquired Brain Injury Ireland takes the care into the community and provides to people in their homes multidisciplinary support including occupational therapists and social workers and psychologists who support the families.  It is a no-brainer.  This is exactly the kind of service we should support and that the HSE should support.  We need to have a conversation about Sl&aacute;intecare now that we have come through Covid.  It would be an apt time for a debate on it.  This is exactly the kind of service the HSE needs to support and fund.  I call on the HSE to speak directly to Acquired Brain Injury Ireland.  Let us improve services.</p></speech>

Spring is in the air and it is a time of renewal.  A great new energy is rising.  It is a time of planting and many farmers throughout the country will shortly begin to sow seeds.  Calving and lambing are under way, the days are lengthening and there is evidence of new growth.  Imbolc is also about the seeds of new ideas.  We are one of the world's top agricultural producers but we have one of the lowest rates of organic production in Europe.  Organic farming is still a new idea to many.  While many of the practices are similar to those our grandparents used, we have become dependent on chemical inputs and solutions to produce our food.  Consumer attitudes are changing and we need to work with natural systems for all the food we produce.</p> <p>The market for organic produce is growing and support for organic farming is also growing.  Next week I will reopen the organic farming scheme for the second time in as many years with an additional &euro;5 million.  It will be more accessible to a greater number of farmers.  The scheme will open every year for the next five years and, hopefully, beyond.  I ask farmers to please consider it.  Organic farming will be a big part of our future.  As it happens, tomorrow I will launch Ireland's first ever master's programme in organic agriculture at Waterford Institute of Technology.  It is designed to upskill farmers and growers in organic farming practices.  This is an important step not only for climate action, biodiversity and water quality but also for soil health.  Our soil holds the key to many of the problems we face and we need to nurture it.</p> <p>Yesterday we celebrated St. Brigid's Day.  While she is much associated with Kildare recently I found out she also has Offaly connections, having been made a nun at Croghan Hill.  Brigid is well recognised as a patron of all things nature and agricultural.  I pay tribute to all of the women in agriculture and science who work so hard in sectors dominated by men.  As someone with a science background, I encourage more women to take up careers in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, agriculture and, like all of the women in the Chamber, in politics.  We need more women in politics in every party and at every level.  This week, I was delighted to welcome a young woman in County Laois into politics.  Rosie Palmer from Ballinakill is playing her part not only in a greener future for Laois but in increasing female representation in politics in Ireland.  I welcome Rosie on board.</p> <p>I also applaud two young scientists, granddaughters of farmers, who recently presented a project on milk quality at the BT Young Scientist exhibition.  Caoimhe O'Grady and Clodagh McGauran from Navan compared the quality and yield of milk produced from mixed species sward to that coming from a rye grass sward.  This is a topic close to my own heart and the results were encouraging.  Encouraging too is the fact that young women such as Caoimhe and Clodagh are pursuing science and agriculture with such a progressive topic.  I am sure Brigid would be very proud of them both.</p></speech>

We know Ireland is a complete laggard when it comes to organics.  It can only help when more farmers are encouraged to go into organic farming.  It links into what I want to raise this morning on the biodiversity crisis we have in the country and what I believe is a complete lack of respect for protecting habitats and wildlife.  In some parts of government there is not just a lack of respect but contempt for our natural environment, particularly for those who seek to protect it.  We often see that those who seek to protect the environment are treated as pariahs while those who flout the laws through illegal burning, hedgerow cutting and badger baiting rarely go punished.  In some cases it can be State bodies that carry out the breaches of the law.</p> <p>I have good reason to believe that in one case the OPW carried out works on Emo Court that disturbed a bat roost, knowing full well it had no derogation licence for the works and that the assessment carried out in advance warned that those works could not be done without significant disturbance to the bat roost.  Last weekend, Friends of Tymon Park brought me to the park in Tallaght to see a badger sett that was completely flattened by park staff to make way for a cross country running track.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The community group has tried without success to get answers from South Dublin County Council on the works that were carried out.  There appears to be no evidence of any environmental assessment and no public consultation on the location of that cross country running track in Tymon Park.  If our badger setts are not even safe within our parklands, what hope do they have when they are on private land?  It is hardly surprising then that when an EU official, Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea, spoke at a Friends of Irish Environment conference he slammed Ireland&rsquo;s track record and pointed out that only 15% of our terrestrial habitats are in favourable condition; 50% are suffering decline; rarely, if ever, are environmental impact assessments carried out on peat extraction and afforestation; and we are bottom of the Natura 2000 network with only 2.5% of our marine waters protected.  Likewise he pointed out that the penal and uncertain costs associated with bringing environmental court cases is a clear attempt to try to chill and deter environmental cases being taken.  We are the most expensive State in the EU in which to take an environmental claim before the courts and those who do are slated in the media and by some politicians who have castigated them and have openly threatened to cut the funding of environmental NGOs.  It is a damning account of access to justice in Ireland.  It is exacerbated by the fact that our National Parks and Wildlife Service was so under-resourced for years that it too lacks the capacity to uphold the law and it has no legal status to properly meet its current obligations in protecting the habitats.  I ask the Leader if we could have a debate on the biodiversity crisis in the country and on the National Parks and Wildlife Service review, particularly on access to justice and Ireland&rsquo;s lack of compliance with the Aarhus Convention.</p></speech>

That happened in January and follows the death of a woman known as Izabela in December.  As many people would know, the supreme court in Poland rowed back on its abortion laws, as have states such as Texas.</p> <p>I want to raise the issue of the abortion review that is ongoing here.  I am quite concerned that it is being set up to not address the wider issues which need to be addressed such as rogue pregnancy agencies, the 12-week limit and the medically unnecessary three-day wait.  I listened to the Minister for Health when he addressed the Joint Committee on Health last December and he continually said that service users would be at the centre of the review.  I have gone looking for that and how service users or people who have either accessed abortions in Ireland or have had to travel to access abortions can engage with the review and all I can find is the general online public consultation that is happening.  That is quite insulting to women who have been impacted by our abortion laws either in accessing them and the problems they encountered or the nearly 400 women who have to travel every year.</p> <p>I welcome the appointment of the chair of the review but I am very concerned the review will not have the impact we thought it would have or address the issues of limitations to abortion.  Abortion will always be contested.  People will always try to row back on abortion rights and sometimes they succeed after waiting for a very long time.  It is very important that the women who have been denied abortions, have had to travel or have accessed abortions here are included in the review.  I cannot see how they will be included in the review other than an online public consultation process, which the review reminds us can be subject to the Freedom of Information Act.</p> <p>I want to raise a second issue, that of the Minister of State, Deputy Burke's comments on thousands of housing units being delayed by judicial reviews.  I find it quite concerning that there seems to be some kite-flying in ways to eliminate judicial reviews, public participation and access to the courts for proper and sustainable planning.  While on the other side developers are using what are called SLAPP lawsuits, strategic lawsuits against public participation.  I also find it quite concerning that Fine Gael sources have been reported in newspapers today as saying the chairman of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Matthews is not allowing a review of that, which is not true.  We must have a proper debate .  We need to go back to the source as to why judicial reviews are succeeding.  That is because An Bord Plean&aacute;la is granting permissions which contravene development plans.  If we had not messed with the planning system back in 2018 we would not be in this position now.</p></speech>

I am very disappointed I will not be able to be here tomorrow due to another commitment but I will be here with her in spirit.  The Bill addresses outdated references to child pornography in Irish legislation and seeks to replace the term with child sexual exploitation material.  These words really do matter, especially when we are talking about something as heinous as the abuse and exploitation of children.  I am proud of Senator Flynn and the work she and Ms Jessica Bray in her office have undertaken in preparing this Bill, which will bring the language we use when referring to child sexual exploitation and abuse up to international best standard.  </p> <p>I also want to raise the topic of Amnesty International's damning report on the situation in Palestine - Israel, Palestine and the Occupied Territories - which was published yesterday morning.  The report prepared by Amnesty has resolutely determined that Israel's institutionalised and systematic discrimination against Palestine and the Palestinian people amounts to apartheid under international law, which is a serious human rights violation and a crime against humanity.  This report lays bare in great detail yet again what Palestinians have said for decades, namely, that they are living under a system of apartheid.  Last year Israel&rsquo;s biggest human rights organisation, B'Tselem, said the same.  As Ireland has stood up for human rights and played such an important role in opposing apartheid in South Africa in the 1980s, I think we have an obligation to act on this report.  We need to move beyond words of condemnation and begin to take a concrete action.  Our inaction on this issue has become even more unjustifiable.  I believe enacting my Occupied Territories Bill is a swift and decisive action we could take in Ireland, an action that could perhaps promote the international community to finally hold the Israeli state to account for the human rights violations it is perpetuating against the Palestinian people.  I ask that some time be set aside to debate this issue in the Chamber and that the Minister would come into the House to update us on what the Government will do about this in order that we can determine how best we can use our political influence to bring peace and prosperity to all people in the Palestinian territories.</p></speech>

We heard discussions about Zurick, Trieste and Paris.  It is worth noting that Joyce was a UCD graduate and that the Museum of Literature Ireland, MoLi, as part of UCD has programme plans for this year, including an interactive programme that needs to be acknowledged.  Part of that international  expanse of Joyce and his influence are the links MoLi have developed with the University of Buffalo in New York.  In particular, that university has a very strong Joyce collection.  One of the strongest advocates of links between Ireland and the United States in celebrating that Joyce collection is New York State Senator Tim Kennedy from Buffalo.  We need to look at the extent to which our literature influences and shapes international discussion.  I would join everybody else in saying that this is a great day to be able to celebrate the centenary of <i>Ulysses</i>.</p><p>I also wish to raise the issue of Garda numbers.  I tried to raise the issue by way of a Commencement matter but was advised that as it is an operational matter, it was not possible to do so.  According to figures for the end of last year, in the Wexford -Wicklow Garda division currently there are 333 garda&iacute; based in Wexford and 306 based in Wicklow.  Traditionally, and historically, those have always been low numbers.  Taking account of comparable counties in terms of size, Tipperary has 398 garda&iacute;, Waterford has 372 and Kerry has 351.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Along with the fact that there are fewer garda&iacute; in Wexford there is also the challenge of the expansion of Rosslare Europort.  Rosslare has had a good Brexit but that places additional resource pressures on the Garda and customs.  That comes from the existing Garda base and it is something about which the chief superintendent has asked.  I also ask that the Leader raises with the Minister for Justice the concern regarding the low numbers of garda&iacute; in counties Wicklow and Wexford, and particularly the fact that the increased numbers must be diverted to Rosslare.</p></speech>

When the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, decided that primary school children should be masked back at the start of December, the National Parents Council was flooded with calls from concerned parents.  They did not feel that they had been given enough information to understand why their children now needed to wear masks when all through the pandemic mask wearing had not been required.  Perhaps since then that information has been given but certainly since then that information has changed.</p> <p>It has been over a week since restrictions have been lifted and it has been so good to see so many people around the country.  However, children as young as eight years are being told to keep their masks on for hours on end during the school day even as us adults are out enjoying meals and spending time in pubs.  I think that it is wrong.  When the whole population was unvaccinated and hospitals were bursting at the seams, parents were told that it was inappropriate for under-13-year-olds to wear face masks.  Now that is where we are but out of it, we still subject children to stricter restrictions than adults.</p> <p>Dr. Jeanne Noble directs the Covid response for the University of California, San Francisco emergency department.  She is part of a group of physicians and scientists who have announced a national campaign in the US to restore normalcy to children's lives by putting them first in line for the lifting of mask wearing mandates and other restrictions once the Omicron surge passes.  I know that the mask mandate is due to be reviewed at the end of February but I strongly believe that we should do this before that date.  We can bring a smile back to our children's faces.  They also need a plan for exiting the pandemic and we should allow them to get back to normal life.</p></speech>

He was an extraordinary successful politician.  Mr. Treacy was first elected in a by-election in 1982 and he retired in 2011.  Recently he fought a battle with illness and when I spoke to him four weeks ago he was in great form.  He served in a number of junior ministries and was a very active politician.  He was one of the best politicians that ever came into Leinster House.  I know that he would have engaged with this House on many occasions, particularly in his role as a junior Minister.  I want to remember his wife, children, grandchildren and his extended family this morning.</p> <p>To conclude, yesterday's clarification regarding the leaving certificate was a good day for students.  I listened to some of the second-level student representatives last night and they seem to be quite happy now that we have had clarification and they can move ahead.  Some very important changes will result from the decision made by the Department and the Government that will help students through what will be a different type of leaving certificate in more difficult times.  However, this matter again raises an issue, on which the Leader will have strong opinions as well, which is that we need to have a major conversation about the effects the Covid epidemic has had on young people.</p> <p>I recall that the other evening I left my son and his nephew to a disco, which was the first time in almost two years that they had been at the disco.  When I collected them at 2.15 a.m. I asked them how the night went and they just said okay.  I said to them that they did not seem to be in great form, to which they replied they were not because they knew hardly any of the people.  They said that a new generation of young people were at the disco and nearly all of their friends had gone.  It was then that I was struck by the fact that young people have suffered and yet they have been great.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate and bring in some of the youth groups.  A debate would afford us an opportunity to could listen to their representatives, discuss how we can move forward to re-engage with youth and, maybe, in some way compensate them for the loss of two valuable years.</p></speech>

He was a gentleman to his fingertips and always had a great word for everyone.  He knew everybody's name, which is a great gift.  As I know very well, he had a huge amount of filing cabinets apparently; he had a file on every issue.  He worked diligently on behalf of his community and on behalf of this Oireachtas.

Noel Treacy was an excellent contributor in this House as well and attended here on a regular basis.  He was always very cheerful.  I wish to extend my sympathy to his wife and family.</p> <p>I wish to raise an issue with the Leader, namely, the recent huge increase in ESB bills and the ever-present public service charge that still features on every single bill issued.  The public service charge was brought in to extend the service to remote and rural areas.  There are not that many remote or rural areas nowadays because as the population has dramatically increased over the last 50 years, the service has been provided to nearly single corner of the country.  Anybody who seeks an ESB connection must now pay a hefty price to the ESB yet the public service charge is still being paid.</p> <p>I would ask that the public service charge be examined.  I suggest that it could be used to pay a loan to the householder or householders to install solar panels or do something of that nature on their premises.  I ask that the Leader invites the Minister responsible for energy to come into this House to debate these issues.  We must ensure that the public service charge is not just added to the bill but that is pays for something or be used to pay a loan to retrofit houses by installing solar panels or some energy-saving mechanism.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It seems to me that the public service charge is an extra charge that is taken for granted and included in the householder's bill month after month.

I have visited Palestine and seen first-hand the horrors of apartheid.  Let me be clear, it is an apartheid state.  Many fine Jewish activists also acknowledged that, including organisations like B'Tselem.  We know what we need to do, and Senator Black has called it out.  When we have a seat at the UN, it would be wonderful if we took action and supported the occupied territories Bill to make concrete moves to support the Palestinians in the way they desperately need.</p> <p>I welcome the joint committee report on pensions being launched at 12.30 p.m.  It is a comprehensive report.  It is great to see the report has been delivered on an all-party basis.  It makes clear calls regarding keeping the pension age at 66.  It gives clear alternatives on how to fund pensions into the future.  It would be very useful if we had a debate in the wake of this report so that we could engage on this issue in a way that is helpful.</p> <p>As part of the committee, I discovered that each year we sign off on &euro;2.4 billion of a subsidy for private pensions and, shockingly, 50% of that amount, or &euro;1.2 billion, benefits just 5% of people utilising those subsidies.  The richest 5% of the population takes &euro;1.2 billion each year in taxpayer subsidies.  If we are serious about pensions justice, surely we should start with recognising that as fundamentally unfair, standardise reliefs and use the money to support our social welfare system.  I call for a debate on the matter.</p></speech>

He was an outstanding politician and very active and successful Minister.  He was popular with all sides of the House and a good pal of mine.  I was very sorry to hear the news as I came into the Chamber.</p><p>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach and Independent Group for arranging for our colleague, Senator Norris, to address us today on a subject about which he has been so erudite and entertaining all his life, namely, <i>Ulysses</i>and James Joyce.  It is a privilege to listen to him.  In fact, it has been a privilege to have been his colleague for the past 15 years.</p><p>Is it possible to arrange for the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, my colleague and county woman, to come before the House and update us on her recent announcement regarding leaving certificate 2022?  I commend the Minister on having the courage to make a very clear decision, and the right decision.  The leaving certificate is a standard in education, examination and evaluation that is second to none in Europe.  It is important we protect it and its integrity.  Due to the Covid situation, the Minister had to reinvent the wheel for last year's leaving certificate students.  Despite all of the shouting and roaring, she succeeded in getting the balance right and succeeded in getting the balance right again this year.  Obviously, evaluation could not continue on the same basis because there were no junior certificate results on which to base an evaluation.  She ensured there would be a wider choice of questions and fewer questions to answer.  She has also pledged to upgrade the overall results if that proves to be necessary.  At the same time, she has secured and underwritten the integrity of our leaving certificate process.  That is most important.  I taught leaving certificate English for many years and was also an examiner of leaving certificate scripts for many years.  I know what I am talking about when I say that one of the few things in this country which is fair and equitable and has stood the test of time is our leaving certificate.  The Minister must be commended on what she had said.</p><p>I do not intend to have cross words with any of my colleagues, but I take a totally different view to Senators Black and Gavan on the attack by Amnesty International on Israel.  It was a completely uncalled for and unbalanced statement.  It brings into question what Amnesty is all about, what its underlying philosophy is and to whom it is answerable.  I look forward to further debate on the core question of Israel and Palestine.  It amazes me, given this is the one country in the Middle East where there is democracy, women are treated with respect, there is social justice, people have freedom of speech and there is a social platform that many countries would envy, that we in this Chamber and country attack that particular country in light of all of the transgressions and outrages we see in Russia, China, Cuba, Korea and elsewhere.  We need to have a serious debate on this issue and address it in a whole new way.</p></speech>

There has been a process and we now have a report.  I look forward to reading and dissecting the report from the joint committee so that we can have a debate that involves both reports, which would be beneficial.  The concerns I am hearing in my office relate to a proposal in the report of the Pensions Commission to impose PRSI on occupational pensions.  A concern that is being raised in letters, phone calls and by people I meet in communities is that there were no pensioner representatives on the Pensions Commission, yet decisions or suggestions were being made regarding pensions.  Where was their voice?</p> <p>The report uses terms like "gesture of intergenerational support" and "social solidarity", and states that the commission considers that everybody, including existing pensioners, ought to contribute by paying more PRSI on other income they might have.  People who are occupational pensioners, in particular those in receipt of a State or semi-State pension, did not have an opportunity to pay into a scheme over the years.  It is as it is presented to them.  As a consequence, their pensions have been frozen for a number of years, albeit for all the right reasons during a time of crisis in our country.  They already pay PAYE and contribute.  It seems a little unfair.  I would like an exploration and understanding of that and have the opportunity to discuss the report in the House.</p></speech>

I ask the Leader to arrange an expression of sympathy for the late Noel Treacy.  I will provide some context and background.  Noel was a political giant in Galway and was successful in every general election.  He ran in eight in total, which is a reflection of his appetite for hard work and the esteem in which he was held by his constituents.  He first won a by-election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1982, one of only two in the past 40 years that the Government succeeded in winning.  He was an able and capable Minister of State across a number of Departments.  More importantly, I knew him as a kind and genuine person.  He was interested in people and put people first.  You had his undivided attention and he made a significant impact in this House and across his political life.  He held a deep and passionate interest in the GAA, especially his club, P&aacute;draig Pearses, and went on to serve as five years as chairman of Galway GAA.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ollie Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He was utterly dedicated to people and communities.  On a personal level, when I entered politics in 2009 he was a fantastic support to me.  I remember his passion and his very helpful advice..  He was an orator.  As outlined by Senators O'Sullivan and Murphy, I always got from Noel that his family came first.  There was nothing more important than his family.  He was a real Galwegian and a great educator.  I send my sincere sympathies to his wife, Mary, his four children, Joan, Emer, Lisa and Rory, and the extended family.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a ainm.</p></speech>

Ronnie worked in the Traveller movement for better positive social change for our community and with our community.  She was the director of Pavee Point for more than 35 years.  Ronnie was a true ally of the Traveller community.  This morning, I am thinking of Philip, her children and her extended family and, of course, all at Pavee Point.  Ronnie will be greatly missed by the Traveller movement.  As Martin Collins said, Ronnie left a great legacy and the fight has to go on for equality for the Traveller community.</p> <p>I call for a debate on the report by Amnesty International.   Senator O'Sullivan questioned the goodness of Amnesty.  For me, as an activist involved with civil society for the past 15 years, Amnesty is an organisation that stands for freedom, justice and equality.  Unfortunately, we as politicians or the society in which we live may not like the truth.  However, I believe in the report Amnesty has launched and I think there is a need for greater debate on it.</p> <p>Yesterday was World Hijab Day.

Prior to entering politics, Noel was an auctioneer and sold a lot of sheep.  My father and uncle were two of his better customers, so I knew him for a long time outside politics.  The Cathaoirleach rightly said, among Noel's many gifts and talents, his ability to remember faces and names was unbelievable.  I was introduced to him by my father on one occasion in what was a very brief encounter.  When I met him several years later, without any prompting he greeted me as "Young Daly".  I do not have to explain that it was not today or yesterday that he made that comment.  It was an unbelievable gift he had, along with many others.  Go nd&eacute;arna Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam uasal.</p> <p>I wish to raise a pressing matter relating to the Waste Management Act (Prohibition of Waste by Burning) Regulations 2009.  Under these regulations, household or industrial waste may not be disposed of by burning.  However, there was, and is, an exemption to allow farmers to burn bushes.  Unfortunately, this exemption was allowed to expire on 1 January and this is causing significant concern among the agricultural community.  Farmers are only allowed burn during the season in which they are allowed to cut, that is, from 1 September to 28 February.  Due to the nature of the dampness of and sap in bushes, many farmers cut early in the season and then stockpile the cuttings, let them dry out and then burn them before the season expires on 28 February.  They do so under licence from the environmental section of their local council and in compliance with a condition under which they have to inform the local fire brigade.  However, nobody was informed this exemption was being allowed to expire.  It has come as a shock to environmental sections within county councils across the country, which now find themselves unable to issue the said licences.  There are stockpiles of bushes all over the country that cannot be disposed of in any other fashion.  This is vital.  I have contacted the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Environment, Climate and Communications but I think we need to put the weight of the House behind the request.  It is a narrow window.  The season will expire on 28 February anyway but, as of now, councils are at a loss as to what they can or should do.  They cannot even inform farmers of any alternatives.  Those who have stockpiled have no alternative.  I would greatly appreciate the House getting behind the push to get the exemption reinstated in light of the urgency of the matter.  The exemption will expire on 28 February anyway with the end of the cutting season.</p></speech>

There are farmers in County Tipperary who got letters from the county council, as they do every year, to say they were exempt in the context of controlled burning on their farms.  They were then sent letters stating that, unknown to them and certainly unknown to us as public representatives and the council, as a result of a directive from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications the extension in respect of burning until 28 February would not happen.  This happened without consultation or any information whatsoever being provided to councils, public representatives or farmers.  If the Department and the Minister want the farming community to support his measures to reach our carbon targets and the role agriculture plays in that, doing something like this does not help.  It creates division between the agricultural sector and the Minister.  The least he could do is to inform us this might happen so that we could communicate with farmers when it is happening and why.  There has to be some sort of understanding in respect of farmers.  These are farmers who were seeking permission to carry out controlled burning.  We know there are many people who carry out burning without looking for any exemption.  These are farmers who are looking to do things right and correctly.  I call on the Leader to contact or write to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on this issue.  There are several issues on which he has taken action in recent months as Minister for Transport or as Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications without any consultation whatsoever.   The very least we should expect in this House as public representatives is to be informed and given clarity.  I ask the Leader to do that.</p></speech>

It is quite bizarre that in this day and age we were given an indication that this exemption would be extended but, unfortunately, it has not been.  Time is ticking.  There are only a few weeks to get this sorted.  I appeal to the Leader to engage directly to try to get movement on this issue.</p> <p>One of the big issues I have encountered in recent weeks is that of digital hubs.  The digital hubs network is really important infrastructure that has been put in place, particularly in recent months and years.  National policy has been to push the proposal of having people working from home or from spaces in clusters.  Digital hubs are a really important part of that.  For it to work, everyone must play their part.  We now have a bizarre scenario where local authorities are levying rates on digital hubs, which is making them nearly unaffordable.  Exceptional pressure is being placed on the digital hubs and making it difficult for them survive.  We often hear about a whole-of-government approach on issues.  That is what is required here.  This needs a whole-of-government approach such that everybody can work together to make sure we have sustainable rural hubs and digital hubs that will be effective for communities.  Unfortunately, if rates are going to be imposed on the hubs, that will make them unaffordable and we will not have the successful digital hubs we need.  What we need is for everyone to work together, including is local authorities, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department led by Deputy Humphreys that provides such valuable money for these digital hubs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If all three could work together, we can solve this issue.  If not, the rates that will be put on these units will effectively mean that in time they will close, and they will be unaffordable for the person who really needs them.

I have raised this issue twice in January.  One of the most important functions and powers that we have as Senators is to shine a light in a dark place.  I have said this very often, and I use this analogy because I believe it to be true.  The association have been in touch with me, and in touch with all Oireachtas Members.  I have seen the correspondence flowing backwards and forwards.  Some Members have responded and some have chosen not to do so, which is their call.  I appeal not only to the Leader today, I also wish to appeal to every Member of these Houses of the Oireachtas.  Most parties have parliamentary party meetings on Wednesday evenings.  I call on Members to ask genuinely and highlight the plight of these people.  It is nearly 60 years ago.  Ireland is one of the last jurisdictions in the world where litigation around the damage done by the morning sickness drug is still ongoing against Gr&uuml;nenthal.  It is very sad.  I spoke with a woman recently who said that all her life she wanted the wrong that had happened to her to be recognised.  She did not really want redress but she wanted some explanation for her family.  She said that she had always struggled to get a job and among all of the people in her community, there was enormous bias against the "little person" as she described herself, and people had said they would not have work suitable for her.  How does this make one feel?  Many of the people who were affected have struggled to have relationships too.  I have had long conversations with many of these people; but there are not too many of them there.  We all want to be loved, we all want to be respected and we all want to be valued.  These are innate requirements for us all, whatever our choices and whatever our options.  These people are crying out for support.  We are the Oireachtas and we are the Parliament.  Their simple request today is to meet the Minister for Health.  He has agreed but today I contacted them and still there was no proper date or appointment for a meeting with the representative body.  I ask colleagues to please use their power and their voice to undertake to raise this issue at their parliamentary party meetings this evening in order that we can have a meeting with the association and the Minister, and chart a course with them as they wish to proceed, and put this behind us.  While many of these people were not lucky to have the opportunity to have a family, some do have families, and they all need our support. Let us stand in solidarity with these people and their association.</p></speech>

It is an essential component to the future development of the airport.  The Government also decided at Cabinet to support this with &euro;5 million in capital support from the State, to be matched by &euro;5 million in private investment and &euro;2 million from the local authorities.  As I said, that application was made in July 2020.  A decision is due to be issued by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in February 2021.  We are now in February 2022 and a decision has not yet been issued by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is wholly unacceptable that such critical and strategic infrastructure would be held up in An Bord Plean&aacute;la for such a lengthy period.  I am slow to criticise the board, and I appreciate that it has been inundated with applications, particularly for strategic housing developments that it has had to prioritise.  This is critical infrastructure and I ask that a decision made urgently by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to allow the airport board progress with investment plans it has for the airport. You cannot consider locking down and finalising investment proposals with a private investment if you does not have certainty in planning.</p><p>I am sure that all Members will join me in condemning the vile racist abuse experienced recently by cast and crew of <i>The Lion King</i>when they were going home to their accommodation after performing a fantastic production at the Bord G&aacute;is Energy theatre.  It is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age that people who bring so much joy with their performances to individuals and families right across this country, would be subject to such racist abuse.  We should all condemn it in the strongest terms possible.</p></speech>

It is a really sad loss.  He was a proud student at Garbally College in our town.  He was an auctioneer and a public servant for his community and this country through the 1980s and 1990s for Galway East.  He was also an advocate for the west.  He never forgot where he came from.  Locally in Ballinasloe there is a lot of recognition for Mr. Noel Treacy's achievements.  As our local <i>Ballinasloe Life</i>magazine has said, he was a very gregarious, affable and generous east Galway man who never turned away a constituent or an organisation.</p><p>The leaving certificate examination is a very difficult time for students.  It is very important that measures have been put in place by the Department of Education to offer extra questions and to reduce the amount of time.  This is crucial to ensuring that our students will be prepared for life after college.  I note that in the CAO form now there is, thanks to the Minister, Deputy Harris, all the further and higher education options and all the apprenticeship posts, and under the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, more than 6,000 places were provided in the past two years to increase the numbers of places at third level institutions.  I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Harris, will be doing his utmost to ensure that higher education institutes will be able to provide more places also.</p></speech>

The Minister made the point that the report, which many of us do not accept, now concluded the matter.  There was some reference to the fine, or the request, to the then Secretary General of the Department to make a contribution of &euro;2,000.  This was supposed to be it, that it was all over and done with and we will move on, thank you very much.  The Secretary General moved from his position to one of the most luxurious ambassadorial posts this country has.  He moved with his salary of &euro;213,000 per year, which is about one and a half times or twice the salary paid to any other ambassador.  The Minister spoke about reputational damage and that the former Secretary General would have to live with reputational damage.  But I do not believe it will do him any harm where he is.  I also do not believe that he will be too worried about the &euro;2,000 he has to pay.  There was a strong case made to put this behind us and to move on but it is not that easy.  Many families in the State suffered horrendously over the period of Covid.  I do not believe it is good enough to say that it is over and done with now.  Of those who were there at the time, two have been appointed into ambassadorial roles at a salary much higher than any other ambassador.  Six of the people out of the 25 who were there have been promoted.  This really does not bode well for this organisation.  It suggests that something in what Deputy McGuinness said in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>some weeks ago is actually true: that we are not in charge of the organisation, that somebody else is, which is the permanent government.</p><p>I have said it at the committee and I will be saying it again, that Mr. Burgess must come before the Oireachtas joint committee and explain himself, as must Mr. Rogers and Mr. Concannon who were the senior people there on the night.  It is not good enough to just wipe it away and forget about it is not that easy.</p><p>Finally, I would like to join in with the remembrance of Mr. Noel Treacy.  He was a giant of man in Galway, not just in the county but also in the city.  He was an extremely pleasant man to meet.  Even though all of my family were Fine Gael, he was always decent to us when he met us.</p></speech>

I acknowledge all the contributions that have been made by those who were clearly Noel's friends.  I extend my condolences to Noel's wife, Mary, and all his children and family, and, indeed, the Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues he had and the odd Fine Gael colleague he had.  He certainly sounded like a wonderful man.  I will organise a service and statements here to honour his service to the State as soon as possible.</p><p>Senator Flynn raised this morning the passing away of Ms Ronnie Fay in the past couple of days.  She was widely known and highly regarded and respected within the Traveller community because of her human rights campaign, which she championed over 35 years.  She was a very proud Skerrieswoman.  She taught camogie and mentored the girls' teams for donkey's years.  Above all, she was a wonderful, kind-hearted, generous, sweet, sweet lady.  I extend my condolences and those of all the Senators to her family and children and the wider community who are mourning her loss today.</p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the report that the Minister for Foreign Affairs acknowledged on the radio yesterday.  The Taoiseach did make a statement regarding it yesterday, outlining that the Cabinet, in so far as it was concerned, had answered the questions that needed to be answered.  I am quite sure, however, that the Oireachtas committee will bring forward the Senator's request.  I believe there is a private meeting today and I am sure the Senator will be at it.  If other questions need to be answered, I have no doubt that the committee will address them, as is his wish.</p><p>Senator Cummins talked about Waterford Airport.  I was actually at the Cabinet table the day the then Minister, Mr. Shane Ross, announced the funding.  That is not today or yesterday.  Therefore, what the Senator is saying really is striking.  I am not sure whether we can blame Covid, judicial reviews or the possibility that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is under-resourced, but there is certainly something wrong when there are strategic developments such as Waterford Airport and sizeable housing projects of 200 to 1,000 houses being delayed for unknown reasons.  I will certainly make inquiries today.  I agree with the Senator that what he is calling for is long overdue.</p><p>I am really sorry that Senator Boyhan has had to raise again today, very sincerely, his commitment to supporting the Thalidomide Association of Ireland.  I assumed a couple of weeks ago, when he came in here really happy that the Minister had acceded to meeting him, that a meeting would happen within days.  I will follow up with the Minister's office today.  A response referring to a meeting at some unknown point in the future is not really a response, and it is not good enough.  I am probably one of the people who did not reply to the email.  I have not seen it yet so I apologise.  I certainly will make the representations today and revert to the Senator later.</p><p>Senators Lombard, Ahearn and Paul Daly all raised the exemption that seemed to have quietly slipped under the radar on 1 January.  I will write to the Minister today and ask what the plan is.  It certainly needs to be addressed.  If the exemption is not going to be reintroduced, something else needs to be done, and done very quickly.  I will do that today and revert to the three Senators.</p><p>Senator Lombard spoke about our digital hubs and the proposals by our local authorities to impose rates.  All I could think about was the fact that it is such an Irish thing for us to get in our own way; it really is.  It seems like a ludicrous thing to happen.  Again, I will raise the issue with the Minister and revert to the Members later.</p><p>Both Senators Seery Kearney and Gavan sought a debate on the pending publication of the social welfare committee's view on the pensions commission's report, in addition to the report it published a couple of months ago.  I will organise that as quickly as I can.</p><p>Senator Ned O'Sullivan spoke about the announcements on the leaving certificate yesterday, as did Senator Aisling Dolan.  I must be very sincere and say I am not sure I  completely agree with the Senator's synopsis of what happened yesterday.  I suppose we have to see the lighter side of these things.  I have a young man at home who will be 18 in a couple of weeks and he will have his first vote in the next election.  I have lost it.  That is pretty much the feeling in our household at the moment.  The sad reality for most young 17- and 18-year-olds, who comprise a sizeable group of 60,000, is that they feel we have not listened to them.  They feel that we, as grown-ups, have told them yet again that their voices do not matter, what they think and feel does not matter and what they have gone through in recent years is irrelevant, and that it is more important for us to all get back on track.  What is really dispiriting is that, in recent weeks, two teachers' unions that have been vehemently opposed to change and that said the past couple of years did not have any implications for students and their educational experience are now heralding that the changes that have to be made by the Department to the examinations need to take into account the educational interruption of the past two years.  It is incredibly disingenuous.  That is not to say that the Minister was not between a rock and a hard place.  I admire her calm, measured tones.  She really did manage it as best she could.  I am just not sure that the outcome is the appreciated outcome that the young students wanted.  I acknowledge that this raised the matter this morning.  I will try to have a debate on it as quickly as I can.</p><p>Several colleagues, including Senators Gavan, Flynn, O'Sullivan and Black, raised the Amnesty International report.  I will try to arrange a debate with the Minister as soon as I can on that issue.</p><p>Senator Burke raised the public service charge and the increase in our household bills, particularly for electricity and gas.  He mentioned connections to grids and how expensive they are.  He implied that it all seems to be about money and questioned why the public service charge must be paid when a connection fee is paid.  The Senator has raised some very valid points, which I will bring to the attention of the relevant Minister.</p><p>Senator Murphy talked about the great need for leaving certificate reform.  He also called for a debate on the impact of Covid and young people.  I will certainly organise that as quickly as I can.</p><p>Senator Keogan asked when we will finally be able to allow our children to see the happy, smiley faces of their friends and teachers.  The Chief Medical Officer announced this morning that NPHET would make a recommendation in this regard on 17 February.  I realise it is not much sooner than the end of February, as alluded to by the Senator, but at least it is a couple of weeks sooner.  By Jove, it cannot come soon enough.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</p><p>Senator Kyne talked about Rossaveal.  He has been raising the matter in question for the past several weeks.  The development is going to be a game changer.  I acknowledge the Minister's announcement yesterday of the deepwater harbour for that part of the world.  The region is going to have a bright future owing to the development of wind energy, which will be great.</p><p>Senator Moynihan talked about the abortion review.  When I see the terms of reference, I believe we will have a short debate here on the review of the legislation that we passed some years ago.  We will keep a close eye on the matter and come back to it.</p><p>Senator Boylan asked for a debate on biodiversity.  She spoke of the crisis regarding what is probably our lack of respect for nature and habitats.  I will organise the debate as soon as I can.</p><p>Senator Hackett talked about the time of year that it is.  It is time for planting.  The Senator referred to her organic farming scheme, which is really worthwhile.  While &euro;5 million might seem like a small amount, it is only the start.  This will be consistent and very much part of our future.</p><p>Senator Currie spoke about the neurological nurse shortage.  The best thing for us to do is to try to have a debate with the relevant Minister by way of statements.  I will arrange that for the next couple of weeks because there is probably not an acute hospital in the country that does not have a shortage of neurological nurses.</p><p>Senator O'Loughlin referred to the damage to Caragh Bridge and the impact it is having on County Kildare.  She is seeking an assessment of all the bridges in the area.  I will certainly ask the relevant Minister to consider that for us.</p><p>Today we were very privileged to have our proceedings opened by Senator Norris.  <i>Ulysses</i>is one book that I could not read until very recently.  Another book has been written to show you how to read it.  I know that probably sounds like a somewhat stupid thing but I am probably not the brightest.  <i>Ulysses</i>is a difficult book but it is so worthwhile and rewarding.  There was a lady on the radio yesterday trying to explain to us how, when you get to a difficult part, you should just leave it and come back to it.  The book is one of the most worthwhile, well-respected, world-renowned pieces of literature.  There is a whole culture and movement behind it, which is wonderful.  It is such a pleasure to listen to Senator Norris, who nearly goes into a different zone or world when he talks about <i>Ulysses</i>, because it is in his genes.  It is so lovely to hear him and to have him here this morning.  I acknowledge the other Senators' great welcome for him today.</p></speech>

I wish to talk about the merits of the Bill very briefly.  The purpose of this Bill arose from a directive from the European Union on the basis that our regulatory system was combined with the part of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, that looks after the regulatory standards and the regulations that all of our licence holders have to work under, and the commercial division which its revenue sources were derived from.   It made no sense to the European Union to have both of those under the same umbrella.  That is where the directive came from that gave rise to the bulk of this Bill.</p> <p>The Bill is really welcome, but I must say that if putting one part of the regulatory authority in one room and another part in another room, when we still have exactly the same source of funding, appeases that directive and the concerns that were raised by the European Union, I have to question the directive.  However, it is where it is, and a huge amount of work has been done by the Minister of State to bring forward this Bill.  While I am supportive of the Bill as it stands in the main, I have huge concerns about what is absent from the Bill.  The reason we are here, and the reason there has been such a delay in reconvening Committee Stage of the Bill since the last time the Minister of State was here, is because of the considerable unease and unrest among the Members of this House and all of those who own the licences that operate the aviation industry in this country.  We have an aviation industry that is absolutely crying out to be regulated.  It is pointing out at every possible turn and opportunity what is wrong with regard to the safety and the lack of regulation in this country and what needs to be done to address that safety and lack of regulation.  It has painstakingly highlighted and provided details of the amendments to the legislation that it would like to see its own members be adjudicated under and be subject to.</p> <p>The course of lobbying has gone literally full circle around the House, with the Minister meeting those licence holders yesterday evening.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we have met the CEO-designate of the IAA.  We have met the Minister of State and her officials on numerous occasions.  I have met Rose Hynes, who is the chair of the IAA.  We have attended these meetings to absolutely and fundamentally make the case that this is a most bizarre situation whereby an industry is crying out for regulation and more rules for it to be governed under, but the officials in the Department, the Minister and, most disturbingly, the regulator think we do not need those rules.  I am here today to talk about various sections of the Bill and different amendments.  I will have objections to further groupings of amendments as we go along.</p> <p>The first amendment today, which is in my own name and those of my colleagues, concerns the licence holder forum.  The purpose of this meeting is absolutely sacrosanct-----</p></speech>

The issue of peer support is perhaps even more important than that of the licence holder forum.  At one of the meetings we had with the Minister, we were given a glimpse of hope that peer support would be addressed.  The recognition of how important who the peer actually is, and who she he or she is chosen by, is paramount to the success of this programme.  In order for any issues in this industry to be brought to bear so that they can be assisted, helped, alleviated and dealt with, peer support and the programmes that have been initiated by some of our aviation airlines over the last number of years are hugely important.  However, they only work when operators in the industry feel comfortable and confident with giving information pertaining to themselves, their ability to do their job or any of the things that are hindering them.  There are many such issues in every single walk of life and in all of our jobs.</p> <p>Fatigue is probably one of the biggest issues in the airline industry.  Those working in the industry are not unique in suffering from all of the other afflictions that every other worker suffers from, including marital difficulties, problems with their children, mental health issues, alcoholism, addiction to drugs, or just being exhausted and over-rostered.  There is a myriad of things that make this industry incredibly unsafe.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A peer support programme only works in a situation where, if I feel so vulnerable that I am not able to do my job, I can trust the person I go to and tell him or her I need help with something that is inflicting pain on my career, income and ability to do my job.  Of most importance is that I be able to trust that peer, that there be confidentiality in our engagement and that I get the assistance, guidance and action I need.</p><p>The single greatest problem with the peer support programme as it is at the moment, and obstructed by the current regulator, is that the airlines appoint the peers.  There is a perception within all of our airlines that the appointment is made by management on behalf of management to ensure that, if anything happens, management will be able to react to it.  I made the plea to the CEO designate that a peer should not be chosen by management because that immediately creates mistrust, and if there is no trust, then the whole engagement falls apart because there will be no engagement.  His answer was that, since the airline would have to pay for the requisite action and take immediate steps, the organisation had to appoint the peer.  That is a fundamentally flawed argument.</p><p>While I appreciate that airlines will have their own peers and their support programmes will not be the exact same as one another's, the success or death of this will come down to trust.  No matter how much money Aer Lingus or Ryanair puts into its programme or how much training it gives Regina Doherty to be the peer, if the person who is selected is not trusted, the airline will never get the information that will allow it to make adaptations and provide the necessary assistance to ensure that the person can do his or her job effectively and manage the difficulty, be it fatigue, alcoholism, a problem with drugs, mental health issues or any of the afflictions that are prevalent in today's life.  If there is not that trust, there will be no information and we will be carrying on blindly.  Although we will have this peer support programme and it will tick a box wonderfully, people will be left scratching their ears wondering why no one is coming forward saying that he or she has a problem in his or her marriage, a problem with a few pints too many on a Sunday or whatever myriad of issues there may be.  If there is no trust, there will be no peer support programme.  All of the palaver from the IAA will amount to nothing because the peer will not get the information if there is no trust.</p><p>Given the context of the amendment we have put down, it is fundamental that a peer be selected by his or her peers.  It does not make sense otherwise.  It is vital that each airline be instructed that-----</p></speech>

It must complete this Stage before it goes anywhere.  The committee has the power to recall the Bill if it wishes.  The very most on offer with regard to my power today is a suspension of the debate to allow the hearings that are taking place to finish.  We can come back and pick up proceedings from there.  The Bill is currently on Committee Stage here in the Seanad and will stay at that point until it is completed.</p></speech>

I am a member of the transport committee and one of the amendments being sought by IALPA relates to licence holders' forums and the right to be heard and be part of the conversation.  The very first point made in the letter is that the Minister of State only met representatives of IALPA last night for a half hour.  There has not been proper consultation.  Many of us as elected representatives have been very frustrated trying to make the case for IALPA so it is disappointing they only got a meeting with the Minister of State last night for only half an hour.  The group is bringing very significant concerns.  It is worth putting them on the public record.</p> <p>The air accident investigation report on R116 was published after the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020 passed through initial stages in the Oireachtas.  IALPA believes, therefore, that representatives of the D&aacute;il and particularly those on the Select Committee on Transport and Communications did not have the opportunity to scrutinise the Bill through the prism of that accident report.  IALPA indicates that when it raised that matter with the Minister of State, she deferred to her departmental official, who replied that the Department had sight of the draft final R116 accident report and decided on necessary amendments arising from that.  The report references a lack of technical expertise in the Department, so although it proposes to make amendments, it does not have the technical expertise to do so, according to IALPA.</p> <p>These are very serious concerns and the only proper course of action now is to suspend our consideration of the Bill and allow people time to reflect on the concerns raised in the letter to the committee.  The committee should hear from IALPA before the Bill goes any further.</p></speech>

We do not want to in any way frustrate the work she is doing.  There is an effort being made by IALPA and its members, and they really have no vested interest in this other than to be assured that the passage of this legislation meets the highest possible standard.  In light of events that have taken place elsewhere over recent years, it would be prudent for us at least to be seen to be judicious in the work we do and give the greatest possible consideration to this Bill.</p></speech>

I happen to be a member of the transport committee, although I am neutral when chairing the Seanad.  I understand totally the concerns coming from IALPA and members of the committee.  If I were sitting down there instead of up here, I would probably be saying some of what is being said by others.  It is fair to allow the Minister of State to contribute and I have a proposed wording, if the Leader wishes to use it, that would allow us to articulate the views we have heard.</p></speech>

It is important to say, however, there has been extensive engagement between me, IALPA, my Department, the regulator, Deputies and Senators.  There have been more than ten different engagements since last year on this legislation.  IALPA's proposed amendments have been tabled as part of the legislation, and I have come to the Seanad today to discuss the exact issues being raised.  Again, if the Seanad wishes to defer its consideration today, I completely respect that decision.  I came here to discuss the very issues highlighted.  If the Seanad wishes to delay this for whatever reasons, I completely respect that.</p></speech>

The biggest problem is that although there might have been ten Zoom meetings, there is no listening going on.  There is not one iota of an acceptance of what is being asked for by the people who own the licences and operate the planes, the aviation industry and the safety and security of all the millions of passengers on a daily basis.  Not one example of acquiescence is apparent for anything that has been asked for.  There might have been extensive engagement but there certainly has not been sincerity in the interactions.  There certainly has been no listening.  On the basis, I will certainly use any proposed wording to facilitate a suspension of consideration and look to refer this matter back to the committee for further discussion.</p></speech>

</blockquote>acknowledges that: <blockquote> 	- a Government decision was taken on 27th July, 2021 to commence the formal procurement process for the next Irish Coast Guard: Search and Rescue Aviation Project for Ireland in line with EU procurement law governing the European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2019 (Statutory Instrument No. 284/2016);<br /><br />- the Government decision was based on a detailed appraisal and business case prepared by KPMG, with the assistance of Frazer-Nash Consultancy, for the Department of Transport;<br /><br />- on 22nd December, 2021, the Government commenced the first stage of the tender process by releasing a Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) and Response document;<br /><br />- on 23rd and 24th December, 2021, following queries from the market, several addendums to the PQQ were published;  </blockquote>notes: <blockquote> 	- the PQQ states that the minimum requirement is three helicopters and a fixed-wing aircraft on standby for Coast Guard aviation tasking;<br /><br />- the number of bases and their location are not specified in the PQQ - instead it states that proposals will be reviewed on their merits and ability to respond in a timely manner, thereby placing the onus on the tendering company to configure the base structure for the national search and rescue provision; </blockquote>expresses its concern that: <blockquote> 	- there is an inherent contradiction in paragraph 1.6 of the PQQ which, while including a provision to potentially issue a separate contract for fixed-wing as an &lsquo;administrative&rsquo;measure, the stated intent is to ultimately select just one proposal to provide the whole service, thereby effectively precluding the Irish Air Corps from providing any part of the next search and rescue service contract; <br /><br />- the failure of the Department of Transport to clearly state its strategic requirements may result in legal action from a failed tendering entity and also lead to the closure of at least one of the current bases;<br /><br />- the Department of Transport fails to recognise the Report of Economic and Financial Evaluation Unit which agrees that a four-base structure including Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo is optimal for Ireland; <br /><br />- there is also no evidence, as recommended by the Economic and Financial Evaluation Unit, that the appraisal process for the next search and rescue contract has been significantly improved or that a full value-for-money analysis of the existing contract has been carried out;<br /><br />- the completed acquisition by CHC Group LLC of Offshore Helicopter Services UK Ltd., Offshore Services Australasia Pty Ltd., and Offshore Helicopter Services Denmark A/S (previously part of Babcock International plc&rsquo;s corporate group), may reduce the number of companies eligible to tender for the next Irish Search and Rescue and may limit competitiveness in tendering;<br /><br />- despite the Frazer-Nash Consultancy Report 2019 on the operation of Irish National Search and Rescue identifying several weaknesses and proposing thirteen specific actions, just four have been completed and published to date;<br /><br />- the Service Level Agreements with the Department of Defence for the provision of fixed-wing Search and Rescue top cover on an &lsquo;as available&rsquo; basis was a serious flaw in the last Search and Rescue arrangement as it did not require or guarantee the 24/7/365 capability required by the Irish Coast Guard;<br /><br />- not having a 24/7 manned helicopter base in Waterford would result in extended travel times for helicopter transfers, further reducing treatment options and outcomes for south east patients, as the present Waterford based R117 service is used as an emergency helicopter patient transfer vehicle for acute heart attack treatment at Cork University Hospital from University Hospital Waterford (UHW) when the UHW Cath lab is closed 129 hours each week; </blockquote>and calls on the Government to: <blockquote> 	- suspend the PQQ and tender process pending full implementation of the recommendations made by the: <blockquote> 	- Economic and Financial Evaluation Unit, <br /><br />- Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General,<br /><br />- Report on the fatal crash of Helicopter R116,<br /><br />- Frazer-Nash Consultancy Review of the Irish National Search and Rescue Framework; </blockquote>- fill the vacancy for an aviation expert in the Irish Coast Guard as a matter of urgency;<br /><br />- lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a copy of the business case for the Irish Coast Guard, Search and Rescue Aviation Project;<br /><br />- lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a copy of the submission made by the Air Corps on the fixed-wing part of the search and rescue contract and the rationale for its rejection by Department of Transport;<br /><br />- lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a copy of the submission made by the Air Corps to provide for one helicopter base for Search and Rescue, the critique of the submission by Aerossurance Ltd., and the rebuttal made by the Air Corps; and<br /><br />- fully evaluate the expertise of aviation consultants Aerossurance Ltd., which in 2017 was a one-person operation trading for just three years with no staff member who was a Search and Rescue pilot and/or had worked in a Search and Rescue environment. </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

It is vitally important that she listens very carefully to my every word.  If she believes there is any part of what I say that she cannot personally defend, I advise her to throw away the speech, stop the tender process for the next search and rescue, SAR, helicopter service and order an immediate review.  </p><p>This is my second motion on the helicopter SAR contract since the start of the Government.  My first was in May 2021, and outlined the serious flaws, weaknesses, omissions and absences of best practice in the awarding and management of the current SAR contract.  My concerns were based on the serious findings of several reports, not least Rescue 116.  </p><p>We are now in a new year and at the start of a new SAR tender process.  Not only has everything I called for during my first motion fallen on deaf ears, but the Department of Transport is proceeding once again with what can best be described as wilful ignorance.  In her speech on the final report into the Rescue 116 air accident, the Minister of State stated that the main conclusion of the air accident investigation unit, AAIU, was that it was "an organisational accident".  We know from the report that a contributory cause of the tragedy was confusion at the State level regarding responsibility for the oversight of SAR operations in Ireland and that this included the Department of Transport.</p><p>Ultimately, the AAIU concluded that neither the Department of Transport nor the Coast Guard had aviation expertise available within their resources and lacked the capacity to remain an intelligent customer.  Regarding contracted helicopter operations that we are auditing, this is a damning conclusion and goes to the heart of the competence within the Department, the same Department that is advising the Minister of State today.</p><p>In turning to the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency for solutions, the Department found a template of total civil commercial control which could be easily copied without scrutiny for use in Ireland.  It beggars belief that the existing competencies within the Defence Forces Air Corps were not rigorously explored before adopting the British commercial model, including seeking further advice from UK consultants Frazer-Nash which at the time was a wholly owned subsidiary of Babcock, a commercial SAR company and likely bidder for the current competition.</p><p>Despite asking for it on numerous occasions, I have yet to see the Department's evaluation of the expertise of aviation consultants Aerossurance which, in 2017, was a one-person operation, trading for just three years with no staff member who was an SAR rescue pilot or had worked in an SAR environment.  We are now in a situation whereby a single British commercial perspective on the provision of SAR has taken root.  This placing of all our eggs in one basket is fundamentally flawed as it fails to recognise that SAR is best delivered through the co-operation of professional, voluntary and public service efforts.  It also offers better value for money to the taxpayer. </p><p>Multiple providers of SAR is the answer, and the Irish Air Corps had the skills and know-how to operate one SAR base.  This would not only provide value for money, but would also provide a secure backup for all bases.  The idea caught on and in November 2020 the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, supported the idea of a role for the Air Corps in the new SAR service, a position that was endorsed by the Taoiseach.  </p><p>The Air Corps made a submission to provide one base on the east coast, which was critiqued by Aerossurance limited.  I have already pointed out in this House that the company is a one-man operation and that the man is question is not qualified to undertake SAR missions.</p></speech>

The critique was sent back to the Air Corps for comment, and it is my understanding that it was comprehensively rebutted.  I have asked for the submission, critique and rebuttal, and the business case, to be made available to me, but to date I have received none of them.  However, I am confident that when these documents are published I will be vindicated for the position I have taken.</p><p>It is important to put on the record of the House the comments of the general officer commanding of the Air Corps regarding SAR.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	I feel obliged to reiterate concerns in relation to value for money given the potential significant duplication of resources and the duplication of tasks that will likely arise from two state agencies operating aircraft with similar capabilities. </blockquote> <p>Notwithstanding this, the Department moved forward with its flawed philosophy and presented a business case to the Cabinet which was approved in July 2021.  I believe that the business case was manipulated to provide the desired outcome and, at worst, is a blatant effort to defraud Irish taxpayers.  I wish to invite the Minister of State to reflect on the business case and consider certain questions which trouble me greatly, as they indicate a concerted effort to rule out any involvement from the Irish Air Corps.  The business case compared the costs of a commercial company akin to the current service and a service supported by the Air Corps.</p></speech>

In every choice available, the commercial costs were trimmed and the Air Corps costs were increased.  For example, the commercial aircraft were made smaller and cheaper in the business case than the current S-92 helicopter, while the Air Corps helicopter was made bigger and more expensive.  It was not allowed to use the current AW139 helicopters, despite the fact they are used in SAR all over the world.</p> <p>The costs of the current service are &euro;650 million over ten years.  How is it that the business case initially assessed the commercial contract cost at &euro;400 million, yet when the pre-qualification questionnaire, PQQ, was released the valuation of the contract had increased to &euro;1 billion, including VAT?  How can costs be so inconsistent in the three steps?  Was the aim to exclude the Air Corps from providing any part of the SAR service?</p> <p>The number of flying hours proposed for the fixed wing contract was not revealed outside the Department.  It was, I believe, deliberately withheld.  How could any organisation provide a proper estimate without this information?  The Air Corps fixed wing proposal was prepared based on incomplete information, something which is only now coming to light.  Why was it then subjected to an extra &euro;40 million surcharge that was not applied to the commercial contractor?</p> <p>The initial set-up costs for the next operator were costed.  The Air Corps, as we know, continually trains its staff in all aspects of aviation.  It has been established in the State for 100 years.  It has been training with night vision technology for many years, unlike the current SAR contractor.  It has a state-of-the-art winch training facility at its base.  Why, then, did the business case price set-up costs for the Air Corps at an arbitrary &euro;4 million for one base, while pricing the set-up costs for a foreign commercial operator at just &euro;4.1 million for four bases?  We need to remember that this is a notional commercial operator without any ties to or facilities in this country.</p> <p>The optimal configuration for SAR in Ireland is four operational bases with five helicopters, including one in reserve.  Given this requirement, why did the business case require the Air Corps to provide three helicopters to support its single base at Baldonnel?  This would mean there would be seven helicopters where there are currently five.</p> <p>Commercial providers are expected to provide the service on a 95% availability basis, but the Air Corps was expected to provide 100% availability.  Why was that the case?  I understand the business case for SAR involved bases in Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo.  That is the optimal situation. When the PQQ was published, why was this changed to three bases?  How does the fact that the Government has now revised that to four bases change the entire business case?  It has had to extend the PQQ period because of that change.</p> <p>Why must the next SAR operator have regulatory approvals, exemptions, alleviations, permits and licences necessary to provide the service in Ireland and the UK, a third country outside the EU?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

Why is that the case?  Why were the Air Corps spare parts scandalously costed in the business case at almost 60% more than the exact same parts to be used by the commercial operator?  Where specifically will the fixed wing aircraft be on standby?  Will it be located in Ireland or in the UK?  If the latter is the case, an aircraft with sophisticated surveillance equipment would be located full-time in a non-EU country.</p><p>The obvious solution is, and always was, for the Government to task the Air Corps with the fixed-wing element of the upcoming contract once it gets its new C295 aircraft.  This will ensure that any intelligence that is gathered will remain within the State or, at least, within the EU.  Does the Minister of State accept that in the context of the basis on which the PQQ has been published, it seems clear no Irish consortium could ever tender for this operation given the caveats contained in the document?  Why is that the case?  What statutory authority is the Minister invoking to provide helicopter transport for armed officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a commercial airline?  I would love to see the statutory element of that.  The original business case did not require availability for daytime fire-fighting operations within four hours of tasking, yet when we went to the PQQ, fire-fighting was included.  This used to be done by the Air Corps.  How has this changed the business case that was presented to the Minister by Frazer-Nash, the wholly owned subsidiary of Babcock?</p><p>As a matter of urgency, the business case must be examined and its assumptions tested.  The brief provided by the Minister's Department and the Coast Guard to those who drafted the business case must be released immediately.  The companies or organisations involved in making submissions and-or assessing every part of this pre-tender process, including Aerossurance, KPMG, Frazer-Nash and the Air Corps, must all be brought before the relevant Oireachtas committee to allow for a transparent assessment.</p><p>To conclude in the words of Shakespeare, something is rotten in the state of Denmark.  This is taxpayers' money the Minister is spending and those taxpayers deserve an open and transparent process.  It is time for the Oireachtas and its committees to examine all that has led us to this point in the process.  The Minister must do the right thing now and not follow a flawed plan into the dark night.  It is no secret that I do not have the business case.  I have been refused it by the Department, which is an outrage.  I am a Member of the Oireachtas and my job is to hold the Government to account.  To withhold the business case is unacceptable in any guise and to hide behind commercial sensitivity when the decisions have already been taken is an outrage.  I will pass over to my colleague, Senator Keogan.</p></speech>

I do not wish to take too much away from Senator Craughwell.  I commend my good Independent colleague on his tenacity and doggedness in pursuing this issue.  "Doggedness" is the right word because he is a dog with a bone, an army attack dog, and he has not let go of this issue despite all the obstacles and opposition he has faced.  I am sure there are people who would rather that this issue be dropped and I am sure there have been many efforts to that effect but we are still here because Gerard Craughwell believes in something and follows it through on principle.</p> <p>This is not some trendy issue that is going to get retweets and lead to an invitation to appear on RT&Eacute;.  It is an unglamorous and serious issue that on the surface appears niche but is profoundly symptomatic of a broken system with which we have lived for far too long.  This is not just about search and rescue.  It is about public procurement as a whole and the structures in place that shape and decide it.  It begs the question of what are the standards.  Are there sound principles and a logical fiscal approach to procurement?  The Government has a contract with the people that their tax money will be spent in the manner that serves them best.  If one looks at this single issue of search and rescue, SAR, however, one will see the mishandling that has occurred and that thousands of euro have been spent in ludicrous ways.  One has to wonder why that attitude would be limited to this issue alone.</p> <p>The obvious questions are how this can be allowed to happen and what we can do to change it.  It is all well and good to ask those questions but there does not appear to be much sense in tasking a system with changing itself when that change is inconvenient.  Public procurement has been a disaster for this country.  I refer to motorways estimated to cost &euro;5.7 billion that end up costing &euro;16 billion.  The national children's hospital, estimated at &euro;640 million, has now passed &euro;1.7 billion.  As Deputy McGuinness, a Fianna F&aacute;il colleague of the Minister of State, stated last week, that culture is not easily challenged or changed.  Its ruling class is formidable and powerful and a network of connections with vested interests will spring to its defence.  Is it any wonder there is such disillusionment with the political system?  The perception is that there is an in crowd, an old gentlemen's club of untouchable figures who make decisions behind closed doors.  The cumulative effect of ducking and diving and denying what the public has seen in various scandals in the past decade has been very damaging to its reputation and exposed a culture that is not becoming of this House.</p> <p>For several years, the Department has deferred responsibility for the chairmanship of the national SAR committee to the former head of the UK coast guard.  Consequently, I believe the decisions taken in the process to date have been weighed of the grief from the R116 tragedy, alongside a reported lack of competence that allowed a singular British commercial perspective to take root.  When one looks at the facts of this case and all that Senator Craughwell has outlined, it is clear something is not working and deep change is urgently required.  Former US President John F. Kennedy wrote on learning that, "The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds."  That has application to the Department of the Minister of State as report after report in the past five years has confirmed systematic inadequacies and failure.  The passing of this motion will send a strong message that positive change is desired by the Seanad.  I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

The sector depends on the reliability and professionalism of the Irish Coast Guard and all its component parts &ndash; including the Coast Guard aviation service &ndash; to offer a service which can deploy at a moment&rsquo;s notice to rescue people in distress and bring them to a place of safety;<br /><br />- the aviation service contract allows the Coast Guard meet its obligations as prescribed in the National SAR Plan, the National Oil/ HNS Contingency Plan and its capacity to support other State agencies, in particular inland SAR support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and provision of Air Ambulance services to HSE, including day and night support to the island communities;<br /><br />- the current aviation service is due to expire in July, 2024; <br /><br />- the procurement process is being undertaken in line with the Government Decision of 27th July, 2021, and with EU procurement law, most notably European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016 (Statutory Instrument No. 284/2016.);<br /><br />- a Steering Group was established in 2019 comprising a range of stakeholders and independent experts to bring a whole-of-Government approach to the process; <br /><br />- on 27th July, 2021, the Government agreed to commence the formal procurement process for a new Coast Guard aviation service and agreed to proceed to the planning/ design stage.  The decision was based on a detailed appraisal and business case prepared in accordance with the public spending code;<br /><br />- on 20th December, 2021, the first stage of the process commenced, with the release on eTenders of a PQQ and Response document for candidates to complete;<br /><br />- on 25th January, 2022, the Government decided to include, as part of the PQQ clarifications, additional information specifying the four bases provided for in the original contract, i.e. Dublin, Shannon. Sligo and Waterford;<br /><br />- Stage 2 of the process involves a detailed Request for Tenders (RFT) specification which will be released to the selected candidates in late March;<br /><br />- the reports of the Economic and Financial Evaluation Unit, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the AAIU Report on the R116 accident, and the Frazer-Nash Consultancy Review of the Irish National Search and Rescue Framework were considered in framing proposals for the project; <br /><br />- the Frazer-Nash Report preceded a comprehensive review of SAR arrangements in Ireland.  This process, which was independently chaired, resulted in the publication of the National SAR Plan in 2019.  The SAR review process included a detailed review of the Frazer-Nash recommendations.  Delivery of the National SAR Plan is monitored by the National Search and Rescue Committee, a body that is also independently chaired.  All of the actions set out in the report have been addressed and if not fully closed out, have been significantly progressed. </blockquote>recognises: <blockquote> 	- the business case was formulated following a rigorous and robust process under the direction of the Department of Transport and involving all key stakeholders.  The business case and associated analysis is an integral part of this process and is not publicly available as it contains commercially sensitive information and forms part of a wider deliberative process for the procurement which is currently underway;<br /><br />- the procurement process is being managed in accordance with the requirements of the public spending code to deliver VFM and in accordance with the requirements of public procurement law;<br /><br />- the current contract is kept under constant review.  It was subject to a mid-term assessment. Any lessons learnt from the existing contract and its operation are being addressed in the development of the procurement strategy and governance arrangements for the next contracted service;<br /><br />- the Department of Transport and its project team has appropriate expertise available to it, including independent experts and a process auditor to ensure compliance;<br /><br />- provision of a dedicated fixed wing asset to the Coast Guard has been included in the procurement plan for the next Coast Guard Aviation service contract and there has been appropriate engagement with Department of Defence.  There is no contradiction in how this is reflected in the PQQ.  The stated intent is to select just one contractor until the third anniversary of the contract when the Air Corps, if willing and capable, can take over the fixed wing element.  The PQQ reserves the possibility of two contracts but that is for administrative purposes only since both contracts will be awarded to the same entity, the successful tenderer. </blockquote>welcomes: <blockquote> 	- the recent announcement by the Department of Transport that it has notified the market of an amendment to a PQQ, which was published by the Department on 20th December, 2021;<br /><br />- that the PQQ has been amended to specify the number and location of helicopter bases to reflect the existing configuration, namely four bases at Dublin, Shannon, Sligo and Waterford;<br /><br />- that the amendment will ensure the delivery of wider Government policies concerning balanced and even distribution of State services and investment, particularly the needs of island and rural communities.  It will also support and protect other public policy priorities, such as the State&rsquo;s response to emerging trade patterns post-Brexit, and priorities under the Climate Action Plan; <br /><br />- the fact that the continuation of the current base configuration will reinforce the Coast Guard&rsquo;s capability to meet its obligations in the National SAR Plan, the National Oil/ HNS Contingency Plan, and its capacity to support other State agencies, in particular inland SAR support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and provision of Air Ambulance services to the HSE, including day and night support to the island communities.  </blockquote>highlights that: <blockquote> 	- the Irish Coast Guard (IRCG) has a distinguished record in delivering SAR services for many decades including the coordination and management, as appropriate, of aviation services delivered by the Air Corps and civil operators;<br /><br />- the IRCG retains the services of an aviation consultant to assist in various aspects of its work; the current consultant was procured by open competitive tender in 2017 and they have provided an excellent level of service across a wide range of technical issues, including the current procurement process; its technical expertise and experience embraces all relevant matters, including Coast Guard and SAR-related issues internationally; <br /><br />- there is no doubt in relation to the capability and expertise of the Air Corps in aviation matters; it is precisely for that reason that they have been involved as a strategic stakeholder in the development of this project;<br /><br />- following detailed examination of proposals from Department of Defence, it was agreed with the Department of Transport that the next services contract will provide that the fixed wing element will cease on the third anniversary of the commencement of the services contract in the event the Air Corps is in a position to provide the fixed wing element.  This will allow for the Irish Air Corps to provide the fixed wing element of the service when it has capacity to provide the specified level of service. </blockquote>notes the Government commits to: <blockquote> 	- allowing the tender process to proceed as decided by Government in July, 2021, and for the process to progress through all stages to completion without further delay;<br /><br />- ensuring a competitive process by not publishing the business case, or other financial analysis associated with the procurement, at this stage, as this would jeopardise the integrity of the process and also undermine the ability of the contracting authority to achieve the best deal possible for the Coast Guard and the taxpayer;<br /><br />- ensuring that the competition will continue to be run in accordance with the public spending code and procurement law; and<br /><br />- ensuring that a suitable contract is in place quickly to meet our obligations to protect lives, to support communities and the maritime sector, to deliver on the National SAR Plan and to provide value for money services to the citizen. </blockquote>  </blockquote></speech>

I very much support the Government counter-motion.  The provision of an effective maritime search and rescue service is critical to Ireland as an island nation with a strong maritime sector.  The sector depends on the reliability and professionalism of the Irish Coast Guard and all the component parts, including the Coast Guard aviation service, to offer a service that can deploy at a moment's notice to rescue people in distress and bring them to a place of safety.  I know full well the benefits of that, coming from a county such as Clare that has a very significant coastline.  Tulla, where I live, is on the flight path of the search and rescue aircraft based at Shannon as it heads towards the west Clare area.  It flies that route almost daily, either on training or a live mission.</p> <p>I and others must recognise the debt of gratitude the State owes to the people who put their lives at risk day in, day out to save the lives of others, such as fishermen or people who have been overcome by an accident off the west coast or any other coast.  In my opinion, the motion contains factual inaccuracies and some of the information it contains is out of date.  It calls for the suspension of the tender process for a new SAR contract.  That would leave a significant gap in the availability of a SAR service and that has to be taken into account.  The current Coast Guard aviation service contract is due to expire in 2024 and the procurement process for the next contract is now well under way.  The reports of the economic and financial evaluation unit and the Comptroller and Auditor General, the accident investigation report on the R116 tragedy and the Frazer-Nash consultancy review of the national search and rescue framework were considered in framing the proposals for the procurement process.  Of course, we all rightly share the deep sympathy to the families of those who were lost in the R116 accident.  The information around that was harrowing to read in the aftermath of the various reports.  I have every expectation, based on what the Government has stated, that the learnings from that event have been taken into consideration in the procurement of the next service.  However, for the reasons I have outlined, it would be entirely wrong to shelve the process that is under way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To say that it is just a value-for-money issue is wide of the mark when we consider that we, as Members of the Oireachtas, have access to the Committee of Public Accounts, which will always review matters at a later stage and go through in detail the outcomes of various procurement processes and the spending of money.  We should be assured that as the Oireachtas functions, the checks and balances are there.</p><p>It is difficult from this vantage point in advance the full procurement process to know what the cost of anything will be.  I accept that there are indicative figures that those in the industry will know, but the purpose of having a competitive tendering process is so that those who have the skills, expertise, knowledge and know-how are able to bid to offer a service.  It is then up to an evaluation committee to look at it in every respect.  It is not just about value for money for me.  While I accept that is important, of greater importance are the safety and lives of people who carry out the service and the ability of the service to meet the needs of a diverse area, particularly on the western seaboard where our requirements to travel very considerable distance out into the Atlantic Ocean happens almost daily.  It is not just about the cost; it is about the capabilities, experience and wherewithal of the ultimate winner of that contract to meet the needs of the service.</p><p>It is also important to recognise the tremendous work that is being done at the four bases.  I am very familiar with the one at Shannon and the personnel there.  They are people of the highest standards and skills.  They deploy at a moment's notice and they deliver a phenomenal service.  While they are not State employees, they are under a State contract.  They are not part of the Army.  Many of them are former members of the Defence Forces and would feel they can deliver a far better service through the company they work for - with the UK model of privatisation of the service through an independent contractor - rather than through a State agency.  We should also take those views into account.</p></speech>

It creates a dangerous precedent that this House can be used to threaten and undermine the integrity of the public procurement process.  Senator Craughwell should know better than to be looking for commercially sensitive documentation during a tender process.  He also made some very serious allegations both on the record of this House just now and also in an email to all Members a short time ago when he said, "I believe that at best this business case for the next Search and Rescue (SAR) contract was manipulated to provide a desired outcome or at worst it was a blatant effort to defraud the Irish taxpayers".  Given that he circulated that email to all Members, I look forward to him providing evidence to that effect.</p> <p>Some of the points in the motion are simply not factually correct and other arguments raised have been overtaken by events since the publication of the initial procurement documents and the recent clarifications that have been issued.  I am sure Senator Craughwell is aware of last week's Government decision to clarify that there will be four bases, the existing four bases of Waterford, Shannon, Sligo and Dublin, as part of the procurement process.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and the Government on taking a proactive approach on this to clarify the matters.  Uncertainty was created as a result of tweets that were issued, including one by Senator Craughwell saying: "I see the tender is out.  Clearly, one station is not being renewed.  I expect Waterford is gone."  That poured fuel on the rumour that Waterford and the south east were going to lose such a vital service.  It also caused considerable distress and upset in the communities where I live - coastal and inland communities.  The Senator should know better than to be tweeting out comments like that.</p> <p>I conclude by echoing the comments of Senator Dooley regarding the crew of Rescue 117 in my own area who do a fantastic job day in, day out.  They have been rewarded for their bravery.  Those four bases, including the base at Waterford, have served the State well in recent years and will serve the State well for many generations to come.</p></speech>

It is entirely inappropriate that we have facilitated this debate when a tender process is under way.  In the face of some of the proposers' talking about the importance of not undermining the procurement process, we then proceed to have a debate about a procurement process while it is under way.  I think it is entirely inappropriate and should not have been facilitated.  In addition, all kinds of unsubstantiated allegations have been thrown out there without any evidence or backup.  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.</p> <p>I fundamentally disagree with Senator Craughwell.  We are talking about an Irish company that has in recent years saved literally thousands of lives around the coast of Ireland.  This is not a new thing in this House.  The Senator has repeatedly pushed this issue despite his own history with the Defence Forces.  For starters, the Air Corps is not the right body to carry out search and rescue missions.  It is a military body and search and rescue is a civilian function, as it is in the majority of countries around the world.  The Air Corps is a body which is totally unregulated.  Senator Craughwell is suggesting that the Air Corps, which is subject to regulation, take over search and rescue exercises.</p> <p>This compares with the current Coast Guard operation with more than 130 Irish jobs.  It is run by an Irish company and regulated under extremely strict civilian parameters through the IAA and through European regulators.  It is regulated and has provided an exceptional service to the people.</p> <p>Instead, we have bluster and unsubstantiated allegations.  We have claims without evidence and a general thrust which is without basis whatsoever.  The reality is that an excellent service is being provided by a group of civilians who are expert in this area, are regulated and are highly qualified.  We owe them an enormous debt of gratitude.  The Coast Guard provides a service along with volunteers in organisations like the RNLI, mountain rescue and other bodies which deserve our thanks and not our criticism.  I regret I do not have more time but I put my support behind the Government amendment.</p></speech>

As has been stated by other colleagues, I am constrained by procurement law in publicly discussing matters relating to a live procurement process.  For this reason, I will not be in a position today to disclose any information relating to the procurement specifications or anything that is commercially sensitive or integral to the process.  In any event information regarding the procurement process must be directed to prospective candidates through eTenders.</p> <p>I also completely reject any suggestion that civil servants have set out to deliberately defraud the State and the taxpayer.  The Government is acutely aware that all major procurement projects must be managed in a compliant manner and, to that end, safeguards are in place to ensure the process is undertaken in conformity with procurement law.</p> <p>A representative of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is a member of the Department's project team, and a procurement process auditor has been appointed with the express task of providing assurance to the Secretary General, as Accounting Officer, as to the conduct of the procurement process.  The Government's amendment provides an accurate reflection of the current position, while also observing the communication constraints, and the need to safeguard the integrity of the overall procurement process.</p> <p>There is one important point that we can all agree on.  The provision of an effective maritime search and rescue service is critical to Ireland as an island nation with a strong maritime sector.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The sector depends on the reliability and professionalism of the Irish Coast Guard and all its component parts, including the Coast Guard aviation service, to offer a service that can deploy at a moment's notice to rescue people in distress and bring them to a place of safety.  The Irish Coast Guard has a distinguished record in delivering search and rescue services and a wide range of other essential aviation services for many decades, including the co-ordination and management, as appropriate, of aviation services delivered by the Air Corps and civil operators.  The aviation service contract allows the Coast Guard meet its obligations as prescribed in the national search and rescue plan, the national maritime oil and HNS contingency plan, and its capacity to support other State agencies, in particular inland search and rescue, SAR, support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the provision of air ambulance services to the HSE, including day and night support to our island communities.</p><p>The current Coast Guard aviation service contract is due to expire in 2024 and the procurement process for the next contract is now well under way.  There is no basis to support calls for the Government to suspend or further delay the process.  Furthermore, if the procurement process does not continue, then the Government will be in breach of public procurement law when the current contract expires.  Moreover, lives could be put at risk if Government allows the current contract to expire without a replacement contractor being appointed.</p><p>The business case will not be published as it contains information which, as highlighted by colleagues, is commercially sensitive or could prejudice the outcome of the procurement process.  However, details of the business case are available as part of the information documentation for the procurement.  It is a requirement that all tender competitions must be competitive.  The greater the level of competition, the higher the likelihood of a fit-for-purpose and affordable outcome.  It makes no sense, therefore, that the contracting authority should reveal its entire cost, risk and operational strategies in the tender documents or through the release of the business case or subsequent analysis of fixed-wing proposals.  Publishing the business case would not only jeopardise the integrity of the process but also tie our evaluators' hands in striking the best deal possible for the Coast Guard and the taxpayer.</p><p>I would like to update the House on the procurement process.  In November 2019, the Department of Transport commenced a process to prepare for the next iteration of the Coast Guard aviation service in line with the public spending code.  An initial strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal report was prepared by the Department and brought to Government by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in July 2020, following approval by the steering group.  This report included a strategic assessment setting out the context for the Coast Guard aviation programme, an organisational overview, and a survey of existing policies and strategies relevant to the programme.  The report took on board key learnings from the existing service and contractual arrangements.  It identified the spending objectives of the programme, including existing arrangements and relevant business needs.  It also included an appraisal of various service delivery options, including the State assuming full responsibility for the service either through the Air Corps or a dedicated Irish Coast Guard aviation branch.  Both were ruled out for a variety of reasons, including the significant challenges of establishing such a service before the current contract expires and the level of risk that would be assumed by the State.</p><p>The process then moved to detailed appraisal and business case stage.  A multi-criteria analysis was used to determine the shortlist of options for consideration on the basis of five criteria: deliverability and implementation, integration and interface, market interest and operator capacity, operator capability and enhancement of State aviation emergency capacity.  A detailed financial and economic appraisal of the shortlisted options was also conducted.  The detailed appraisal provided a framework to assess costs, benefits, affordability, deliverability, risks and sensitivities associated with the shortlisted options to guide the approving authority through gate 1 of the public spending code to the planning and design stage.  While it was acknowledged in the preliminary report that the Air Corps would not be in a position to take full responsibility for the service, the Department of Transport agreed to explore the viability of the Air Corps providing some element of the SAR aviation service at the request of the Department of Defence as part of this phase. The Air Corps proposal received in March 2021 was considered in the business case as part of a so-called hybrid option whereby the Air Corps would provide one helicopter base with a fixed-wing component, which would then require a civil operator to provide the remaining element to meet the specification for the national service.</p><p>The business case analysis demonstrated, among other things, that there is an inherent cost implication in splitting the helicopter service between two or more providers.  The single provider option can achieve economies of scale and address availability requirements more cost effectively.  There is flexibility in how the fixed-wing element, which would be a new element of the service, could be provisioned.  The service scoped, costed and recommended in the business case is similar in many respects to the current service but would include a dedicated fixed-wing element.  This would provide the Irish Coast Guard with an on-call marine environment monitoring and high endurance search and top cover capability.  It also has the potential to allow a more innovative helicopter fleet.  The strategic research and analysis division within the Department of Transport conducted a technical assessment of the appraisal that determined its compliance with the public spending code.</p><p>Stakeholder engagement, including market interest engagement, has been extensive.  The steering group includes representation from all relevant Departments and agencies, including the Departments of Transport, Health, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Defence, and agencies such as the HSE, the National Ambulance Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Irish Aviation Authority.  There was also extensive consultation across the search and rescue domain, including the many voluntary organisations involved.</p><p>On 27 July 2021, the Government approved the detailed appraisal and business case for the next Coast Guard aviation service and agreed to proceed to the planning and design stage, including the procurement of the service outlined in the business case.  It also agreed that the Department of Defence, working in conjunction with the Irish Coast Guard, would examine whether the fixed-wing element of the proposed service could be delivered by the Air Corps in line with the requirements and parameters set out in the business case and would provide the Department of Transport with a costed proposal by October, which would then determine whether this aspect of the new service could be provisioned by the Air Corps or should be procured as part of the procurement plan described in the business case.</p><p>On 3 December 2021, the Government noted proposals to allow the possibility of Air Corps involvement within a reasonably short number of years.  The review of the Air Corps' capability to provide the fixed-wing element concluded that the proposal, as framed, would represent a significant expansion of Air Corps capacity beyond that envisaged at the time of the Government decision of 27 July.  However, it was agreed that the next Coast Guard aviation services contract will provide that the fixed-wing element will cease on the third anniversary of the commencement of the services contract in the event the Air Corps is in a position to provide the fixed-wing element.  This will allow for the Irish Air Corps to provide the fixed-wing element of the service if and when it has capacity to provide the specified level of service. This provision is reflected in the procurement documents.</p><p>On foot of a decision taken by Government last week, my Department has notified the market of an amendment to a pre-qualification questionnaire, which was published by the Department on 20 December 2021.  The questionnaire is amended to specify the number and location of helicopter bases to reflect the existing configuration, namely, four bases at Dublin, Shannon, Sligo and Waterford.  The amendment will ensure the delivery of wider Government policies concerning balanced and even distribution of State services and investment, particularly the needs of island and rural communities.  It will also support and protect other public policy priorities, such as the State's response to emerging trade patterns post Brexit and priorities under the climate action plan.</p><p>I thank Senators for tabling this motion today and for providing me with an opportunity to discuss what is a most important issue.  However, I cannot agree to calls for the suspension of this procurement process or for the release of commercially sensitive information that is central to the integrity of the competition.  I reject the motion on behalf of the Government.  I have proposed a countermotion and call on the House to support it.</p></speech>

As an island nation, the search and rescue helicopters provide essential cover around our coast.  Around 800 tasks are carried out every year and the service is responsible for covering a huge area of ocean.  The occupation is a dangerous and selfless one.  It is also important we acknowledge the sacrifice of the crew in the R116 disaster, who lost their lives off the coast of County Mayo in 2017, and that we think of their families.  We know many lives have been saved through rescues and patient transfers.  The motion highlights the lives that were saved in the south east by the Waterford-based R117 service.</p> <p>I welcome the Government decision to change the specifications for the next phase of the search and rescue tender to include retention of the existing four bases.  It is essential that search and rescue is maintained in County Waterford.  It reflects the strong representation from the south east when members across counties and parties have come together to say the existing bases are needed.  It is right to point out that Senator Craughwell has been a tireless advocate for the service and was out front and centre on saving that base in Waterford, along with my colleague, Deputy Cullinane.</p> <p>We know the Defence Forces have already suffered blow after blow to morale.  They have been hollowed out and asset stripped.  It is evident from the number of Defence Forces personnel on payments such as the family income supplement.  We have heard reports about workers sleeping in their cars and the current pay and conditions not being good enough considering the service the personnel and the Defence Forces provide.  That must be improved.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Today's debate concerns important and urgent issues for the future of the Defence Forces but also for the matters that Senator Craughwell brought into the public domain in his introductory statement.  People might not like or agree with what he had to say, but the points he raised are deeply concerning for members of the Opposition.  The only way in which the Minister of State and her Department can put those concerns to bed is by publishing the business case.</p><p>From the information that is available, it appears that the business case was designed in a way to ensure that the Department got its preferred choice.  This raises serious concerns.  We have seen time and again public procurement contracts not delivering good value for money for the public, who pay their taxes and expect the Government to be prudent with how that money is spent.  We only have to look to the children's hospital and the roll-out of the national broadband plan to see how we must fight for transparency and details about how their procurement processes were conducted.  From what we have heard today, it seems that the business case was deliberately designed to inflate the cost to the Defence Forces of providing the services while playing down the cost to the commercial provider.</p><p>Will the Minister of State confirm whether it will be the case that weapons will be carried on commercial flights?  I am sure she is aware that that is illegal.  Will she clarify this point about the business case saying that helicopters will be carrying armed garda&iacute;?  We have seen evidence of breaches of this law at Shannon Airport with US troops passing through it on commercial carriers.  Photographs have been taken of them carrying weapons but nothing has been done about it.  If the business case is being designed to break the law and public money is to be invested, it raises serious questions.</p><p>Senator Craughwell has made compelling arguments about how public money is being spent under this contract.  They deserve more detailed answers than have been given.  The main way to do that would be through publishing the business case and meeting the request that all stakeholders involved be brought to the committee for full scrutiny by committee members so that these questions can be teased out, we can get answers and we can ensure that the SAR services to be provided under the new contract are fit for purpose, good value for the taxpayer and include a role for the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

I would love for them to specify what they are.</p> <p>The Committee of Public Accounts was mentioned.  It is interesting to note that it and the Comptroller and Auditor General carry out retrospective analyses of badly planned and badly implemented public procurement.  We never have a chance to do the job we are supposed to do in the Oireachtas.  I was shocked by my two colleagues across from me who spoke about bringing this matter into the public domain.  Our job is to oversee what goes on with public procurement.  I make no apologies whatsoever.</p></speech>

I have taken two already.  To come in here and suggest that the civilian provider was subject to rigorous regulation is a nonsense.  Go back and read the report on R116 to see what it says.</p> <p>The bottom line is that there is a business case, which sets out what this contract is expected to do.  There is no reason the business case cannot be published.  This nonsense that the Government goes on with from time to time about not being able to release something because it is commercially sensitive is rubbish.  Mark my words - I will be proven right in this.  Not for one minute should the Minister of State tell me that, with the level of responsibility she has over a number of portfolios, she could take the time to analyse this.  She simply took her Department's word.  She could not possibly have analysed this herself.  The Government brings in a company to advise KPMG that is a subsidiary of a potential bidder yet the Minister of State tells me that this is an open and transparent process.  How can it be?  Aerossurance, the company that the Government brought in to oversee search and rescue services, is one man with three years of trading and no creditors or debtors on his balance sheet.  From where is the expertise coming?</p> <p>As far as I am concerned, the rescue services save lives all the time, and by God we are grateful for them, but it does not matter to the people in the sea who is coming down to collect them and whether that person is from a private operator or a public one.</p> <p>Senator Ward spoke about the company involved.  It sought chapter protection.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-02a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1692" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022020200002#MM00400"><p>I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House.  That we have the senior Minister to discuss the motion is an indication of how seriously he takes the matter.  We appreciate him being here.  I thank Members also for being here in good numbers.  I invite Senator Ahearn to speak to the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-02a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1629" speakername="Garret Ahearn" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022020200002#MM00500"><p>I welcome to the Minister to the Chamber and thank him for taking the motion.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Colm Brophy and his staff, the staff at the Passport Office, and the Minister's own staff, including Ms Laura McGonigle, who has done incredible work, especially on passports that are difficult cases.  As public representatives we all deal with cases that are difficult.</p> <p>We must recognise that of the volume of passports that go through the Passport Office, the vast majority go through without any problem whatsoever.  If one looks back on 2021, more than 600,000 passports were completed by the office.  This is more than 50,000 per month, and the vast majority are processed without any issue at all.</p> <p>It is also important to recognise that although passports have become a big issue in the past weeks because of the reopening of the country, the Minister and his Department have recognised this for quite some time.  This is why he secured an extra &euro;10 million in this year's budget for passport services.  This is why there is a major reform in the core technology being used by the Passport Office, which hopes to come into play in 2023.  This will be very important.  Most importantly, this is why the Minister has increased the numbers of staff working in passport services.  Last June there were 450 staff working in the Passport Office.  As of yesterday I believe that number is now at 760.  By the end of March it is hoped to be 900  This is a doubling of staff numbers.  It shows to us the importance the Minister places on the office and the role it will have during 2022.</p> <p>It is important also to recognise the reopening of the urgent passport service.  That happened in the Cork and Dublin offices in September and October.  I believe just over 2,300 passports have been facilitated through that process.  This is a really important system because, for whatever reason, many people realise their passports are out of date only when they are packing a few days before they leave.  That service is there for them.  It is there primarily for emergency cases, but it is important the service is there.  I am aware it was closed during Covid . I believe that it should have been seen as an emergency service during that time, and it was disappointing that it was closed.  It is now open and working well, which is very important.</p> <p>A number of people spoken about new locations for printing machines.  An obvious thing that politicians sometimes say is, "We should have one in the west of Ireland" or "We should have one in Cork".  The priority is not the location; the priority is whether we can facilitate demand in 2022.  I would like the Minister's view on that.  We have three printing machines at the moment, two of which are in Balbriggan, I believe, and one in Lower Mount Street.  Do we have the capability and the facilities to meet that demand?  The number of passport applications anticipated in 2022 is approximately 1.7 million, which is huge.  The demand has never broken 1 million before.  Back in 2019 it was just under 1 million and last year it was 650,000 applications.  It is a huge increase and it is about whether we can facilitate that.</p> <p>A number of people have also asked why we are not prepared for 2022, which is a fair question.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The honest answer, and I think the Minister prepared as best he could, is that we did not know when the country would reopen.  What we learned in the past three weeks is that once the Taoiseach announced that the country was going to reopen and that almost all Covid-19 restrictions were ending, people felt excited about going back to normal.  Part of that involved being able to take summer holidays.  What has happened since is many people who had not applied for passports, predominantly for children, over the past two years, when there was no need to apply because nobody could go anywhere, have now decided that this summer will be an opportunity for them to go on holiday.  It might well be the first holiday for their children.  That is why people applied for passports quite quickly after the Taoiseach's announcement.  Large numbers of people, higher than ever before, have applied this month.  Most of them, we hope, are applying for passports to enable them to go on summer holidays, so it gives them ample opportunity to receive their passports.  The context here may be the campaign by the Minister&rsquo;s Department and the passport service to remind people to apply for passports.</p><p>We should, however, look at several things that we could change in the service and, in a broader context, in businesses such as how the system can better facilitate first-time passport applicants and those seeking passport renewals.  One suggestion from the Fine Gael group of Senators tabling the motion is a reminder service in the form of an email that would be sent to people whose passports are out of date.  It would be like the process undertaken with motor tax payments.  Many people, including myself, would not pay their motor tax, if they did not get the email to remind them that it is due at the end of the month.  If we could have a system where a similar reminder is issued to notify people that their passports will be out of date in six months, then that would give people ample opportunity to act.</p><p>There is also an opportunity here for businesses in the aviation sector, such as Aer Lingus, Ryanair and travel agencies, to make changes to their processes.  When people book holidays and flights, they should be requested to enter their passport number and the expiry date.  Such a mechanism would give people ample opportunity to renew their passports, if need be.  A requirement to enter passport details, including the expiry date, will mean that people will have to go and find their passports to complete a booking.  It would mean that people would find out then and there that their passports are not in date or might have less than six months' validity remaining.  These are all new ways of reminding people of the need to renew their passports and of alerting them to problems that might arise before it is too late.</p><p>Another issue we as public representatives sometimes have concerns people waiting on passports.  The passport has been printed by the Passport Office, but it goes into the post on a Friday.  Someone may be flying out on a Saturday, but the passport will not arrive until Monday.  A central base where passports could be collected, a kind of public passport service area, would be hugely beneficial.  We often have situations where people are trying to ring An Post to find out where their passport is, and if it can be found and removed, this might be a simple way of solving that problem.  Another possibility, if staff numbers are increased in the Passport Office, might be to explore a seven-day rota system.  It might certainly be necessary for a short time while we are dealing with the kind of demand that we expect to have in 2022.</p><p>Overall, however, it is important to recognise that every issue we are going to discuss for the next hour and a half or two hours are issues the Minister saw coming down the track six months ago.  We will also discuss the measures and decisions he made six months ago in the context of this predicted challenge.  I acknowledge the hard work undertaken by him, his staff and the staff of the Passport Office and the great deal of work they will also be doing in 2022.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Seanad agus comhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il leis as an m&eacute;id oibre at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Roinn, ag a oifig f&eacute;in agus ag oifig na bpasanna freisin chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an bhfadhb agus leis na hiarratais ar phasanna a thagann isteach.</p> <p>As we heard from Senator Ahearn, the extraordinary demand for passports recently has been a problem on one hand, but also, on the other, a challenge that the Minister&rsquo;s Department has met.  I congratulate him for having the foresight to put in place measures to deal with this demand.  I also congratulate the people who work in the Department, and specifically those who work in the Passport Office.  During the lockdowns, especially, a coterie of staff, from clerical officers up to management, had to deal with the demand for passports and put in long hours to respond during difficult times when restrictions were in place in workplaces.  This motion specifically acknowledges and praises the work done by all these people.  It is appropriate to praise all the staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Equally, it is not just the Passport Office facilities in Dublin and Cork that have dealt with this issue, but also our embassies and consulates around the world.  They have dealt with people, my family included, applying for passport renewals or passports for new children.  It is appropriate that the House records its recognition of the level of work done in this regard.</p> <p>Like Senator Ahearn, I acknowledge to the foresight that was evident in recognising that a demand would be coming down the line to a degree that has manifested.  For example, in the aftermath of Brexit, for example, there was a great demand for passports from people who wanted to register themselves as Irish.  Equally, as we emerge from the restrictions that were in place, and as people look forward to travelling this summer, and even before that, many people who may not have thought about it for some time must now renew their passports.  I welcome the Minister securing funding from the Government to ensure that the necessary resources and personnel are in place to meet future demand.</p> <p>The motion also seeks to explore how much more we can do to streamline the process and ensure that procedures are in place to respond to this increased demand.  There is also a focus on eliminating bureaucracy.  The motion calls on the Minister to examine the application process to see if there are elements of bureaucracy that can be removed or streamlined in some way to ensure the process of getting a passport is as easy as it can be.  From speaking to people who have applied for passports, I am aware that difficulties can arise with the process, perhaps with a missing document or one not fully compliant, etc.  The tracking service online is excellent and gives a good picture of when people can expect to get their passports.  However, a notification concerning of a problem should be sent to people as soon as possible.  In recent times, I am aware of people who said that the passport application had been with the Passport Office for a while.  Even though the application may have had a document signed by the wrong category of person or a photograph that did not meet the requirements, the applicants were not notified about the problem until later.  The delay then led to a scramble to get the proper documentation in order.  I wonder if the Minister could put some measure in place to ensure that there is an opportunity for the officials to identify potential problems early in the process and allow them to be remedied earlier rather than later.</p> <p>In that regard, there is a twofold challenge.  The Department faces a challenge because it is incredibly difficult, on the one hand, to marry the efficiency and speed involved in getting the passport application fulfilled and the document back to the citizen, while, on the other, ensuring that we maintain the highest standards of security and protect the status of our passport, which is one of the more valuable passports for access around the world.  For example, and the motion also calls for this, it would be appropriate to run an information campaign to ensure that people know exactly what is required of them during the passport application process.  Now, it might well be said that all that information is contained on the forms, and of course it is.  As people who fill out forms regularly, the Minister and I know that forms are not always as clear as they might be.  Even though people read them carefully, they might still make a mistake.  Therefore, there is room to mount social media and public information campaigns and for online videos, etc., to help people to prepare passports applications and to ensure that those applications are successful and processed as quickly as possible.</p> <p>In that regard, I also endorse the idea advanced by Senator Ahearn of reminders or alerts for people.  They exist in many other contexts.  Unlike Senator Ahearn, I very diligently pay my motor tax and I would never be so flippant about it.  There are many ways in which the relevant systems can alert people of an upcoming problem.  There is a similar opportunity to do that with passport applications to ensure that people will be aware of a potential problem coming down the line.</p> <p>I also want to raise with the Minister something that is not specifically mentioned in the motion, but it is an issue that many people who travel with children have come to me with.  It concerns a situation where the children may not have the same name as the parent or guardian.  Women can be particularly affected by this problem when they are travelling under their maiden name, while their children might carry their husband&rsquo;s name.  Indeed, it could also be an issue for a man travelling with the children of a woman to whom he is not married and those children have the woman&rsquo;s name.  A parent or guardian travelling with a child with a different name encounters myriad problems going through passport control.  Not unreasonably, the officer carrying out that control check wants to establish that the children are legitimately travelling with a person and that they are his or her children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I understand most of the people in that situation now carry birth certificates with them but I do not think that is what they should do.  I know this is not just an Irish problem and, presumably, it exists with passports in every jurisdiction.  One of the solutions that has been suggested to me is that children under 18, or up to a certain age, should have their parents&rsquo; or guardians&rsquo; names printed into their passports so it is very easy to identify who that person is.  That may create other problems that need to be addressed but it is something we could put in place to make it easier for citizens to cross borders when going on holidays or travelling for whatever reason with their children.  As I said, it affects a not insignificant number of citizens travelling with children under 18 and there is an artful solution.</p><p>I know from speaking to the Minister's office that this may create other problems because it is not standard across systems, for example, travelling through a border in Germany when people there do not know about this system might create problems.  I wonder if the Minister's office and the very experienced and professional people in the Department could put their heads together to find some solution to ensure there is a facility so guardians and parents travelling with children do not have to go through the rigmarole of establishing that the children travelling with them are their children.  It would just make everything easier.</p><p>In seconding and supporting this motion, it is important to acknowledge the amount of work that is done by the Minister's office in that regard and the foresight shown.  We hope the measures the Minister puts in place now will deal with the anticipated demand as restrictions are lifted and people return to travel, which we all welcome.  In that way, we can ensure the Passport Office is equipped to deal with that anticipated demand.  I congratulate the Minister on the work done so far, which is to his enormous credit, and we hope we will see exactly the same kind of work continue into the future.</p></speech>

I thank Fine Gael for bringing forward this Private Members&rsquo; business.  There is nothing unusual in this, nothing exciting about it, and it is very obvious.  Clearly, I took some time to look through the parliamentary questions.  The Minister has answered a hell of a lot of parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il in regard to all of this, and all of these things are replicated here.  He has done an awful lot of work and he has got a lot of queries about it.</p> <p>Why are Deputies and Senators spending so much energy and time chasing passports?  It is ridiculous.  I have made representations myself.  We come under pressure and we are asked to speed up something, and I always say that I can speed up nothing.  I can drop a letter or an email and I can make an ask but, ultimately, it is very important that we ensure the integrity and the safety of our passport system.  I do not doubt its integrity as it is an excellent system but we need to use this opportunity to spell it out.  Let us try to move away from the parochial nature of lobbying on behalf of people for passports or, dare I say it, making representations.  I accept we are very close to the people and that one of the great things about Irish politics is that we live within our constituencies, close to the people we represent.  That is a good thing and I do not want to knock that in any way.  However, if we are reviewing the whole passport issue, it is time that we clearly identify and be up straight and honest with the citizens of this country about the functions and powers we have, and this is one of them.  That is a common view among people on all sides of the House who have discussed this matter with me.</p> <p>I want to thank and acknowledge the Minister and his staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and our network of embassies and consulates which meet the ever-growing demands associated with passports.  I welcome and fully support this Private Members&rsquo; motion and have no difficulty with it because it is timely that we are having this discussion.  The motion calls on the Government to redouble its efforts to ensure that the passport service is functional, effective and efficient as anticipated demand rises.  I think it is functional, effective and efficient and I would not like anyone to suggest it is not.  We had Covid and we had issues, and staff in the Department suffered the same set of circumstances that we suffered.  Yes, there are difficulties and frustrations, but I know from checking through on a number of these that when we actually go back to people, we find they did not provide the proper details, did not fill out the form completely, the photograph was slightly incorrect or there were issues.  We all make mistakes and I make mistakes, but it is important to acknowledge this.  I want the message to go out loud and clear to the Department that it is effective, efficient and functioning, and that should be acknowledged.  Yes, there were setbacks and difficulties, but I want to point that out.</p> <p>The motion refers to increasing the number of administrative and managerial staff within the passport service.  That is a functional matter for the Department, not a matter for us.  The operations of the Department and the deployment of its staff are wholly an internal matter for the Department.  The motion also refers to engaging in a public information campaign.  That makes very good sense, as does having the alert systems in place that Senator Ahearn talked about.  It is a very good idea.  If most of us were asked where our passport is now, we would most likely say it is somewhere in a bedroom or in a drawer, and we could not say when it expires.  I do not even know when mine expires but I will be checking that when I get home this evening.</p> <p>I want to suggest a few things.  The eight-week period for the An Post mail Passport Express service is too long.  It is a good service.  At a time when many people do not have IT skills and there are many who do not have IT systems, the role of the post offices, or the few that are still left around the country, is important for people who like to do their business there.  It is a good mechanism but eight weeks is a long time.  As Senators Ward and Ahearn alluded to earlier, the issue was one of validating the passport.  From my experience of the people I have made representations for, the problem is that weeks go by and then they open up this An Post mail service and discover there are some shortcomings in the application and they go back to nought again.  Early validation of applications and renewals is critical, and both Senators make that point.</p> <p>In regard to the issue of fraud detection, it is vital that we maintain the integrity of the Irish passport system to ensure its security for travel across the world.  In one of the responses last year in the D&aacute;il, the Minister elaborated on the need for reform.  He mentioned in the D&aacute;il that he was putting emphasis on core technology and underpinning that technology in the passport service.  He said that the current system was originally launched in 2004 and that it was due to be replaced with the more modern integrated system by the end of 2023.  I do not know how that is progressing because, obviously, everything has fallen back a bit.  The Minister might elaborate about that in his response.</p> <p>I thank the Senators and I fully support this timely motion.  My real call today is for us to get away from making representations on passports and let us get a system that is faster.  That is the problem.  We need a speedier system.  If there is a flaw or a shortcoming in the application, early validation and early confirmation is the key to addressing this issue.</p></speech>

As colleagues have said, none of us necessarily wants to be having this debate but I commend the Fine Gael group on putting forward the motion.  It is an issue that has been raised in a cross-party way across the House.  I commend the Minister and his officials on the efforts they have been making to address this.  It is important to put on the record our appreciation of his work on a number of international issues in recent weeks.  It is also important to acknowledge the work of his officials.  The officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Passport Office do a good job.  It is particularly important at the moment, when there are criticisms of the Department of Foreign Affairs and certain actions about which we know they were wrong, but it was a moment and it was a mistake that was shortlived.  Those who are trying to conflate those actions with planned parties in Downing Street, while at the same time not apologising for organised military parades on the streets of Belfast, are not showing respect to the officials within the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p> <p>We need to commend the Passport Office.  Renewals are very quick and people talk about 24 hours or 48 hours for a renewal.  In the case of compassionate applications for passports, they are often handled very sensitively.  Our big difficulty, and the issue on which many of us tend to raise concerns, is around first-time applications for new passports.  We know that in the Bible, in Genesis, when God destroyed the world with water, it rained for 40 days and 40 nights, when Moses was on Mount Sinai, it was for 40 days and 40 nights, and Jesus was tempted in the desert for 40 days and 40 nights.</p></speech>

These were all periods of suffering.  It seems that the approach of the Department of Foreign Affairs when it comes to first-time applications is that you are going to have to wait for 40 days and 40 nights before you have any chance of your passport being processed.  If people think about it, that is 40 working days.  We are talking about three months.  If a family is looking for a passport now for a newborn baby, they cannot realistically consider travelling any time before May if they are to hope to have the passport application processed.  We are not seeing it done in the eight to 12 week period that has been talked about.</p> <p>I spoke here about Councillor Rachael Batten from Dublin City Council, who posted a tweet with the photo of her baby that was sent to the Passport Office, alongside a photo of the baby now, and you can see how the child would not be recognisable on the passport some months later.  This is of concern.  It is not just last-minute applications.  These are people who are thinking weeks in advance that they are going to go on holidays and they need to get their first-time passport, but it will only take a few weeks and then they discover that they are waiting months.  They take out their frustration on some of us.  You could say that they are passport-aggressive.  It is clearly not something that we, as Deputies and Senators, should be doing.  As colleagues have indicated, I find that it is now becoming one of the most common issues we are addressing.</p> <p>Before raising potential solutions, I wish to refer to one other problem, which is the delay around foreign birth registrations.  It is related to this question.  During the entire Covid period, even when we were reopening marts and nightclubs, the foreign birth registration process in the Department was kept closed.  There was already an 18 month delay in foreign birth registrations pre-Covid.  Now, people are looking at a two-year plus delay in foreign birth registrations.  In many cases, there were problems arising from the fact that people had sent in their passports as part of the process and then they had to try to retrieve them.  In addressing the issue, I ask the Minister to look at the related question of foreign birth registrations and if we can speed up this process.</p> <p>The drop-in passport emergency service has been a benefit in the past.  I agree with Senator Ahearn's point that it does not really matter where the passports are processed, but there was always a benefit that people could go to the office in Dublin or Cork if there was an emergency.  People do not mind waiting for hours if they can provide all the documentation and they know at the end that they are able to get their passport.  I remember from personal experience that when my passport was stolen, I sat in the Passport Office just on the corner of Molesworth Street and it got sorted.  That would be helpful in emergency cases.</p> <p>In planning for the future, we need to look at how blockchain technology will allow us to develop a digital identifier.  We are going to be able to travel with some sort of document that is blockchain enabled that will not necessarily need to be constantly renewed.  We can control the release of our data.  I hope that we are looking at that kind of technology in the future, which may solve a lot of the problems.</p> <p>The internal design of the Irish passport is beautiful and it is something of which I am very proud.  I commend those within the Department who are responsible for that creativity and use of Irish design.</p></speech>

As Senator Boyhan has already noted, the Minister has had a huge volume of parliamentary questions on this matter.  He has also responded to quite a number of Commencement matters in the Seanad on it as well since I became a Member in 2016.  There is universal recognition across the Chamber that this is an issue that needs to be sorted because, as I stated last week on the Order of Business - I say this respectfully, fully conscious of our role as Members of this House -  we are not the Passport Office and the difficulty for us is that due to the issues that have been readily identified by previous speakers and the motion we are debating tonight, in effect, we are becoming the Passport Office.  I agree with the sentiment that has been expressed in terms of commending the staff who work in the Passport Office, who do first-class diligent work, not least in the context of the past two years and the added burden and stress that was on them.  I echo the words of thanks to them for everything they do.</p> <p>Many of the points I wish to raise have already been covered by colleagues.  While I appreciate that there is an increasing demand for passports, in this instance Irish passports, there are a number of points set out in the motion with which I hope the Minister will be agreeable.  In working with him and his officials, I hope we can contribute to trying to resolve the outstanding issues.</p> <p>I do not mind lobbying on behalf of people when it comes to a problem with their passport application, no matter what it is - whether it is a delay, a technical issue, the wrong box ticked or whatever else.  Very often, the great difficulty for me is to get someone to engage with me.  The problem is that while I accept and agree to an extent, that it does not really matter where the printing facilities are, there needs to be service provision that is accessible to the public, no matter where they are.  An element of the work can happen and is very effective online, but there also needs to be an element of infrastructure and service delivery that is physically present across the entirety of the country.  I agree with Senator Malcolm Byrne.  I know many people who are desperately sending messages or calling me on the phone to say they will go to Dublin or Cork.  They say they will wait there for however long it takes as long as they know they will get it.  Increasingly, if it is an emergency situation, if there is short notice, if you live in Strabane, Enniskillen or Ballycastle and you have work, childcare commitments or other caring commitments, then you cannot always necessarily just jump in the car and go to Dublin or Cork.  There is a clear, logical argument anyway, added to by the huge volume of increased demand that, at the very least, no matter where the printing facilities are, there would be human beings, representative staff from the Passport Office, to engage with the public and with us.</p> <p>When the Passport Office is good, it is absolutely first class.  It is brilliant.  I have seen its staff assisting many people who have been under real pressure - they might have been a bit lacklustre and like Senator Ahearn said, perhaps forgot, and they are under time constraints.  We have all dealt with people who have been dealing with tragic and unfortunate circumstances and have needed to obtain a passport quickly and the staff have been able to do that.  I recently renewed my passport online and got it in a couple of days.  If it was just me I was dealing with I would be content, but because we are dealing with so many people, we know these problems exist and that is why we are making the case to the Minister tonight.</p> <p>Jim, in my office, has found the existing hub for Oireachtas Members helpful in terms of the volume of issues that we deal with.  I urge the Minister to make the hub and facility available to our MLA and MP colleagues in the North, because they deal with just as many passport applications and problem as we do.  There should be a dedicated hub for all elected representatives across the country.</p> <p>In terms of my earlier point, I heard the Minister and others tell us that the Passport Express office is very good and when I make the case, as I regularly do, for a new facility in the North, it is said that the post office service is sufficiently good.  That is probably fair enough to say if this process was just that first step alone, because very often that is grand.  You go into the post office and give in your passport application form, and it is sent away in the post and that process is accessible and good.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The problems arise when that goes into the system.  There is no point in one going back into the post office and saying one has a problem with a passport application.  The staff will look at you and ask what that has to do with them.  The problem is there is a deficit of infrastructure and service provision for people to go in and engage with a human being.  That is why it makes sense that we would do what is laid out on this motion, particularly on the education, marketing and PR campaign, which should also be all-island.  There is a clear case for the west of Ireland and the North of Ireland needing a facility where the public can go in and engage, not least in the context of the huge increase in the volume of applications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-02a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1672" speakername="Rebecca Moynihan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022020200002#QQ00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I always think that debates like this are among the best examples of the Upper House in how passionate people get about passport administration.  I thank the Fine Gael Senators for bringing this motion and I commend all the staff in the Passport Office, and across the public service, for their hard work in delivering a timely and efficient service during the pandemic.  We all focus on stories where there have been problems and issues, and there have been more problems and issues due to Brexit and the pandemic, but every day thousands of people get their passports done in a timely and efficient manner.  For example, just before I came in I was talking to a friend who is getting his child's first passport within a six-week period.  I also know someone else who applied on Sunday and got the passport delivered today.  During the summer we needed to get my husband emergency travel and we had the passport within two days, which allowed us to travel.  I want to put on record how important the work the Passport Office is and how well it manages that work.  I particularly want to pay tribute to the clerical officers, who are among the lowest paid in the Civil Service, for putting in the hours and the work and for providing an excellent and efficient service.</p><p>I want to focus on one specific aspect of this motion, namely the calls for the Passport Office:</p> <blockquote> 	-to consider options that will facilitate the identification of errors in the application in a timely manner allowing for the notification to the applicant of any errors so that they can be remedied quickly; [and]<br /><br />-to implement a system that allows for the fast processing of additional documents requested by the Passport Service, ensuring that applications that are incomplete are processed within three weeks once the required additional documents are submitted; </blockquote> <p>That is where people sometimes run into huge difficulties.  We know that many people in this Chamber have been contacted by members of the public in recent months who have struggled to get passports, particularly first-time passports, where there have been errors in applications and where people have had great difficulty in moving the process along.  In addition, where people are requested to provide additional documentation, including their passports, these documents should be returned promptly.  One person who contacted our offices submitted a first-time passport application in April 2021 and she still has not received her daughter&rsquo;s passport.  She has contacted the Passport Office numerous times about this and representations on her behalf to the Minister have not yet been answered.  In her words:</p> <blockquote> 	It has been 8 months since the original application was submitted and 4 months since the additional documents were added to it.  I find such waiting time for verifying documents and issuing a passport as simply unreasonable and unacceptable.  I have been talking to many people who are similar to me, and applied for their child's first passport.  In each case, their applications were processed within 3-4 months - also during the time of COVID pandemic.  I do not understand what would be the reason why the application I submitted takes more than twice this time.<br /><br />I have been contacting your department many times, more times than I could recall, via phone and webchat.  Every time when I tried to follow up on the application status, I have been informed that it &quot;is in progress&quot; [and to] ''keep an eye on the passport tracker'', without any solid explanation why the progress is so unbelievably slow.  It's really disappointing that your officers could not even tell me what stage my daughter's application is at.  I am left with endless waiting and frustration.  As you can see on the screenshot attached, the last update of the passport tracker was two months ago, which is useless as any point of reference.<br /><br />While applying in April, I would have never thought that my daughter's passport would still not be issued 10 days before Christmas.  Because of the sluggishness of your service, we will not be able to reunite with the rest of the family, especially upsetting since my family has never seen my almost 2 years old since she was born. </blockquote> <p>I mention another incident where I was told the following:</p> <blockquote> 	I am emailing you regarding my daughter's passport which I submitted on 7th of August.  Your office contacted the passport office a few times in writing and by phone, they were informed that the passport will be ready in the first week of December. <br /><br />Please bear in mind that I lost my uncle during this wait (September).  I asked the passport office to return my passport and explained to them that my uncle is on his deathbed.  They told me they will be able to return my passport but it will mean the application will be paused, and upon my return I have to resubmit it again.  My father is quite old and I have not seen him for almost two years (due to COVID19 ongoing restrictions on travelling and due to this unexplained delay in my baby's application).  This is affecting me mentally as I am living in a fear that I might lose another member of my family without being able to go and see them. <br /><br />I expected the passport office to return back the additional documents, especially the original ones as they are valuable pieces of documents.  I do not think there is a need for retaining additional documents for this long period of time. </blockquote> <p>When we run into situations and difficult circumstances like that, one can understand some people's frustration with the passport service.</p><p>I want to end by commending public servants, including clerical staff and those in the Department of Foreign Affairs, for the efficient service they provide.  We are fully supportive of this motion and it is worth bearing in mind how excellent our passport service is.  We need to focus on additional information and requests and make sure people are replied to in a more timely and efficient manner because that seems to be where there is a big backlog.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-02a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022020200002#QQ00400"><p>I thank Members for their engagement on this important topic and for the opportunity to provide an update on the work of the Passport Office.  I know this is an issue that many public representatives have spoken about and it is a service they engage with regularly.  The passport service is facing its busiest year to date with an estimated 1.7 million passport applications expected this year.  This is due to pent-up demand following Covid-19 public health restrictions over the past two years.  I will put that figure of 1.7 million into context.  The previous highest year was in 2019 when under 1 million applications were made but before that the figures show that there were between 400,000 and 600,000 or sometimes up to 700,000 applications per year.  If anyone wants to see evidence of that this year, in January alone there were 137,452 passport applications made.  The highest month on record before that was March 2019, when it reached about 115,000.  The highest January on record before this year had just under 100,000 applications.  We have had about 35,000 more passport applications this January than in the next highest previous January and in many other years it was half of what it was this January.  If we had the number of applications we had this January for every month of this year, we would have 1.65 million passport applications.</p> <p>I want to give Members a sense of the scale-up we are planning for in applications by outlining how we are planning for and responding to that task.  This volume of passport applications represents a significant increase from the previous high numbers of applications.  As I have said, the figure in 2019 was 935,000 passports issued.  However, my Department has been proactively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet this extraordinary level of demand.  Thanks to an additional &euro;10 million allocation for the Passport Office service in budget 2022, my Department is making an unprecedented investment in the service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.  We are confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first-time applications, which is what most Members have raised.  This will assist the Passport Office in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.  As I have said over 137,000 applications were received in January 2022, the highest ever number received in any month previously.  These applications are all being processed in the usual way.  There are approximately 66,000 complete applications with the passport service being processed, while 49,000 are waiting for applicants to submit the necessary documentation required.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is therefore clear that while the passport service is dealing with very high demand for passports, there is not a backlog as such; there are simply passports in the system.  Some of them are waiting for documentation to come in to finalise the system and others are moving through the process.  </p><p>My Department is actively working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive that has been under way for several months.  Since June of last year, 300 members of staff, at all grades, have been assigned to the passport service.  Additional staff are being assigned on a weekly basis, with a goal of reaching staff numbers of 900 by the end of March.  This represents a doubling of staff numbers over the course of the past nine months. </p><p>Along with many Government services, passport operations were disrupted over the past two years by the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions linked to that.  The passport service maintained operations throughout the pandemic, despite these disruptions.  In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport, the processing of passports requires physical attendance on-site.  The Passport Office simply cannot work from home.  This is not work that can be carried out from home, primarily for security reasons, where we must have a network within the Passport Office that is seen as safe and incorruptible.  </p><p>In 2021, the passport service issued over 634,000 passports; processed over 7,000 foreign birth registration applications; and dealt with over 175,000 queries by phone and webchat from members of the public.  </p><p>I would like to take this opportunity - as others have in the House this evening, which I appreciate - to recognise and thank the staff of the Passport Office, who continue to work on-site to deliver this essential service to our citizens.  The head of that team is with us here this evening; Ms Siobhan Byrne is sitting behind me.  She has one of the most challenging jobs in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  She is constantly under pressure, seven days a week, to deliver passports on time.  </p><p>With the recent ending of many Covd-19 public health restrictions, all passport service sites in Dublin and Cork are now operational at full capacity and have fully assumed all services that were in place pre-pandemic.  Additionally, a new passport service site in Swords, County Dublin, opened in November, and can accommodate 140 staff.  Many of our recently recruited staff members have been assigned to that location, where they are processing online applications. </p><p>I have heard calls for the passport service to work seven days a week.  Through the provision of overtime to passport service staff, this was done for an extended period last year.  From this week on, we will recommence overtime in a structured and targeted way, focusing primarily on fist-time applications, which has been the main concern outlined this evening. </p><p>Since September of last year, the passport service public office in Mount Street, Dublin 2, has provided appointments for urgent passport renewals.  The Cork Passport Office has been open since October.  More than 2,500 citizens who required an urgent requirement have been accommodated by the Passport Office sites in Cork and Dublin since they reopened.  As Senator Boyhan said earlier, that system is there so that people do not have to go to public representatives to get passports at short notice.  Instead, they can book an online appointment that can allow them to go in and get an extremely fast turnaround time. </p><p>This week, the passport service has increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 appointments per week.  Citizens availing of the urgent appointment service can renew their passport within one or four days, depending on the circumstances. </p><p>In addition, the passport service will continue to assist those who require passports for emergency travel by facilitating collection of passports at its public offices in Cork and Dublin.  The Passport Office continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applications.  Along with significantly increased staffing levels, the passport service is implementing a number of further measures that would positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service.  Some of these reforms have come from suggestions from public representatives who have engaged in the process. </p><p>First, intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is under way to increase the resources that can process complex applications, and we get some very complex passport applications.</p><p>Second, the passport service is actively prioritising first-time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications, with a view to reducing the current turnaround times.</p><p>Third, a new document management process is being put in process that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documentation.  Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised.  Complete applications will be processed in three weeks.  This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application.  A number of people have raised the issue with me that somebody submits, potentially, a paper or an online application, and a month later they get informed that there is something missing in the application that they have to resolve and send in.  Then the assumption is that the clock starts over, which certainly was not the fault of the applicant who did not know there was something missing.  We are trying to address that now to allow sort of a roll-over of the clock, if you like, that can allow those applications, particularly first-time applications, to be dealt with much quicker. </p><p>Fourth, public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports will continue during this busy year.  In addition, the passport service is working on public education resources, including video tutorials to assist applicants in correctly completely their applications.  This is a two-way process.  For the system to work, the applicant needs to make a proper application, and we need an efficient system that can then get it done as quickly as we possibly can.  We need to work on both sides of that equation, otherwise we will continue to have a frustrated public. </p><p>In the longer term, and in the context of the national development plan, my Department is making a significant investment in the future of passport services.  A major reform currently under way is the replacement of the core technology underpinning the passport service.  The current system was launched in 2004 and will be replaced by a more modern, integrated system.  This complex project officially commenced in November 2021 and is currently at an early stage.  Extensive detail, design, testing and phased implementation are to follow over the remainder of this year and much of 2023.  This new system is intended to be substantially operational in the passport service by the end of next year, which is what I outlined to this House last time I was in speaking about this issue.  The new system will ensure the passport service benefits from a resilient future-proof IT platform, capable of handling increased application volumes while maintaining the high standard of security that is the hallmark of the Irish passport. </p><p>I am aware that due to the recent lifting of many Covid restrictions, Irish people are considering travelling abroad for the first time in two years or more.  More than 570,000 adults and children whose passports have expired since January 2019 have still not renewed those passports.  There are also many young children and babies who have never held a passport and whose families are looking forward to a foreign holiday or a trip to see relatives overseas.  Currently, 45% of adult online renewal applications are processed in one working day.  I will repeat that because we are talking about 140,000 applications in January, and currently 45% - almost half - of adult online renewal applications are processed in one working day.  Some 99% of online child renewal passports are issued within the advertised processing time of 15 working days. </p><p>First time passport applications take longer and there are a number of reasons for this that I wish to put on the record.  It is important to check the applicant&rsquo;s identity and their entitlement to Irish citizenship.  The Irish passport was ranked at No. 5  in the world in the Henley Passport Index, as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries around the world, which is virtually every country.  This is something that we can be proud of.  However, in order to maintain this ranking, it is necessary to conduct the thorough identity and citizenship checks currently undertaken by the passport service.</p><p>In the case of children, it is essential that the passport service verifies the consent of the child&rsquo;s guardians before a passport can issue.  This ensures that the passport service protects the rights of children and their guardians.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It also ensures against child abduction, fraud and much else to which passport systems are vulnerable if one does not have the kind of checking systems we have in place.  I have been in the Passport Office on numerous occasions.  Trust me, the anti-fraud systems we have in our passport systems are very comprehensive from a technological point of view but are also very effective.  There are plenty of examples of them preventing the issuing of fraudulent passports.</p><p>Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly-trained and experienced staff, first-time applications take 40 working days to process, but we do want to get that time down and we will.  The passport service continues to prioritise the reduction in processing times for first-time applications, in particular.  The measures outlined here this evening, including the assignment of additional staff, training and upskilling of staff and improvements to the application process and customer communications will greatly assist with this.</p><p>I will give Senators a comparator in terms of how we are doing, versus our closest neighbour, which is an often-used comparator.  Online simple adult renewals have a guidance of ten working days but often happen within 48 hours.  Our guidance time is ten working days and in the UK it is 14 days.  We are 50% faster.  Child renewals have a guidance of 15 working days here and 15 working days in the UK, too, but it often happens quicker here.  Those are actual times in the UK where they have live information.</p><p>There is a difference in first-time applications.  The UK is at just over 20 days and we are at 40 days.  We are now focusing our resources, training and systems on reducing that time.  There is this idea that even with the significant volumes, there is something fundamentally wrong with the Irish passport system, when actually we compare very well internationally on turnaround times.  Of course, there is always an expectation we can do it better and there will always be problem passports that take far too long.</p><p>We need to make sure we have consistency in the system and that, most important, people who make applications understand that if mistakes are made, there will be delays and that is predictable and they can get on the phone to somebody or on a web chat system to understand where the passport system stands.  I take the point Senator Moynihan made earlier on individual cases but, in general, our system is efficient, compares very well internationally, has been put under extraordinary stress over the past six months, in particular, and has responded to that, by and large, very well.</p><p>For the problematic passports or those for which people realise they need faster turnaround times than is possible or recommended and political intervention is needed, we have set up an Oireachtas call line specifically for Oireachtas Members and their officers to try to help them with those individual cases.</p><p>I take the point on public representatives in Northern Ireland looking for access for Irish citizens to passport services there.  I do not want to make a commitment on my feet on that but I will take a look at it.</p></speech>

I cannot emphasise that point enough.  If an application is online, we can do all sorts of things with the system when there is an urgent need to get that passport through the process, quickly.  If it is a paper application, it is a much more complicated process and it stalls the whole system when we try to find a paper application that is out of the ordinary.  Online applications are what we need to do.</p> <p>In order to ensure their applications are complete and that their passports can be issued without delay, citizens should pay close attention to the instructions provided and submit the correct supporting documentation to the passport service in a timely manner following their online registrations.  In the case of children, these important documents include witnessed identity and consent forms.  The passport service cannot process an application without these supporting documents and, unfortunately, applications that are incomplete will, for obvious reasons, take longer to process.</p> <p>All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world.  Passport online can also be accessed by first-time applicants, irrespective of age, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US.  More than 90% of applications are now made online, compared to 47% of applications received online in 2019.  It is a dramatic change.  In the space of two years, despite Covid, we have gone from just over 45% to 90% online which means we can put much more streamlined and efficient systems in place to respond to increased demand.</p> <p>The passport online service is four times quicker than paper-based applications for adult and child renewal applications and is the fastest, easiest and safest way to apply for a passport.  I thank Members of the Seanad for their interest in the further development of a modern and responsive passport service.  I know we still have work to do.  We are putting a whole new system in place which will be in place at some point next year, but this is a bit like reform in the health service.  One has to keep the system running efficiently with a dramatic increase in demand, while designing and putting in place an entirely new system.  That is the challenge for us over the coming 15 months.</p></speech>

It comes to all our offices.  I thank Siobhan Byrne and all her staff for the efficient service most of the time.  The odd time one comes across an issue that might cause a delay.  The longest time we waited in our office was approximately five months, but it was a very complicated situation.  Sometimes there are issues when one of the parents is not Irish and the passport service has to make sure everything is in order.  However, when one parent is not Irish, it adds to extra delay and the passport service could look at that.  The Oireachtas line that has been put in place has been very helpful.  The staff in the Minister's office when there are very complicated or real emergency situations have intervened from time to time, as well, for which I thank them.</p> <p>I advise everybody to apply online where possible, but some older people are not used to online applications and I understand why they put in the paper copy, but they cannot understand when they are wasting the extra time.  In terms of the educational aspect being put out there, perhaps one could ask advertising how we get across to people to keep applying online.  It is about educating people that they need to apply online.</p> <p>I have had complicated passports and because the applications were online, they were able to be sorted out, certainly.  Overall, our experience has been very positive, but is just the odd passport.  I know there always will be, when one hears the volume of passports being applied for in such a short space of time.  The emergency application or appointment is mainly in Dublin.  Is there hope of getting emergency appointments back open in Cork?  Maybe they are open.</p></speech>

I acknowledge and compliment all the staff in the passport services for the processing of applications that takes place and the officials in the Minister's office who are of assistance.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is quite clear that online is best.  The Minister stated that 90% of applications are made online.  I have said previously that Passport Express is a misnomer because it is not express.  Online is express so that should be changed and, indeed, phased out.  The best way of forcing change is to tell people they have to do it online.  There are people who are not tech-savvy and there are older people.  It is not beyond the bounds of State resources with all the State offices around the country to come up with some system whereby the elderly or those who are not tech-savvy can make appointment, get their photos taken and upload the information.  It is done through the NLDS for driving licences.  That model should be examined.  If we did away with paper applications, we would not have problems and it would improve the efficiency of the service.  </p><p>Regarding the reminder system, the Minister mentioned that more than 570,000 adults and children whose passports have expired since January 2019 have still not renewed them.  He knows they have expired.  The question is whether the people themselves know they have expired.  Some of them may know they have expired while others may not and will not know until they pick it up two weeks before going to get their flight so there needs to be some sort of system whereby they can be notified.  The only downside I can see is that we would be inadvertently writing to someone who is deceased.  I can see Joe Duffy's phone lines lighting up with Mary ringing to say they wrote to Patrick who died last year.  I can see that happening but there needs to be a system akin to that for motor tax or motor insurance where people get a notification by text or email and respond to that.  </p><p>People can book a flight and not be asked for their passport.  They do not show a passport until they go through security.  My poor brother had a passport but picked up the expired one and it was only when he was boarding the flight that he discovered that it had expired so he had to go home again.  He got going a few days later.  Is there any way of asking airlines to notify people about the expiry date at an early date when people are booking?  If someone is asked for the expiry date for his or her passport in the same way as for his or her bank card, he or she must look for it and can see if it is out of date.  I acknowledge the investment and work that has been done to improve the system but more changes could be made to streamline it even further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-02a.288" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1658" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022020200002#TT00200"><p>I also acknowledge and ask the Minister to pass on my appreciation for the hard work of staff in the Passport Office.  There are two ways of looking at this - glass half full or glass half empty.  The Minister outlined in great detail the positives, of which there are many, particularly online renewal.  The turnaround time inside 48 hours is hugely impressive.  This compares favourably with any other country.</p> <p>Unfortunately, where we seem to be falling down a bit is in the area of first-time applications.  I note that in his contribution the Minister used the term "frustrated public".  Many of us are dealing first-hand with many very frustrated individuals, particularly children going on school trips.  I have dealt with a few who did not get as far as the airport because of this.  What I am hearing is that they are contacting the Passport Office but nobody is answering the phone.  That is one problem.  I appreciate that staff are under serious pressure.  It is difficult to get a response through the web chat.  While I appreciate fully why we are in this situation and that there is such a backlog because of Covid, it is clearly something that needs to be looked at.  I know the Minister is trying to address that.  Hopefully, by the end of March, the number of staff will have doubled to in excess of 900.  I hope this alleviates the problem for many frustrated people.  </p> <p>Another issue I continually hear about is the validation process.  I spoke to a woman a number of weeks ago who after she applied for a child passport for the first time, it did not arrive on the due date.  She rang the office the following day to be told that a document was missing.  This was after more than eight weeks.  She then submitted the document the following day but four or five days later, it was still not updated on the system.  I will use the example of a planning application to a local authority.  If someone wants to build a house, he or she sticks up the site notice and lodges the documents and somebody from the local authority validates that application.  The decision date is based on that validation date so no matter what happens within that timeframe, if the application is validated, the person will get the answer within seven to eight weeks and that will not change.  If a system like that could be incorporated in the Passport Office, at least people would know that if their application is validated, they will get their decision within weeks and if there is a problem, their documentation will be returned and the clock will not start ticking.  It would appear to me to be a simple solution that might alleviate a lot of the problems.  Perhaps it is not that simple but I ask that it be looked at.  </p> <p>I thank the Minister for providing a line for Oireachtas Members when people cannot get through to the Passport Office for one reason or another.  It is vital that Members retain that because at the end of the day, Members of this House or the Lower House are representatives of the people and when people are in difficulty, they contact their local Oireachtas Member and this facility should always be there.  I thank the Minister for bringing that in.  </p> <p>Members spoke about the office in Dublin and the office in Cork.  The old argument is that if a line is drawn from Dublin to Galway, most services are located south of that line.  As someone coming from a northern part of the country, is there any reason we cannot have an outreach office in County Monaghan?  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke about the North.  Monaghan is fairly centrally located whether that be from counties Donegal, Tyrone, Armagh or Fermanagh and could save people from having to travel to Dublin or Cork to get an emergency appointment.  I would appreciate if the Minister would consider this.</p> <p>Another issue raised with me is the fact that the tracking system is not accurate.  I spoke to somebody who has been told by the system that their passport has been printing for the past four days and has still has not been delivered.  Issues like this lead to a frustrated public, to use the Minister's phrase.  I appreciate that there are 113,000 passport applications in the system.  Perhaps 40% of paper applications are not filled in correctly and hence there is a problem.  We have a problem that needs to be sorted because people are getting angrier by the day.  I would appreciate it if additional staff could be provided to address that pinch point.  If we get over this pinch point and get another month or two, we will be out the other end.  I thank the Minister for allowing Oireachtas Members to be able to work on behalf of the people we represent.</p></speech>

Indeed one could say that this is parliamentary party business masquerading as parliamentary business.  I thank Ms Siobhan Byrne and all the staff in the passport service and recognise the incredible pressure they are working under.</p> <p>A number of Senators mentioned the relaxation of the checks and balances relating to children's passports, particularly first-time passports.  I would not recommend any easing of those restrictions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Protecting our children is clearly very important and the last thing we want to see when there are difficulties or break-ups in marriages is our children being abducted. </p><p>For two years, we have had very limited travel so it does not take a rocket scientist to prepare for what is coming in the next six months.  However, this motion is a waste of the Minister's time.  It is clearly an echo chamber for this Government on an issue that has already been well thrashed out on "Morning Ireland".  I would have understood a motion by the Minister's Fine Gael colleagues on the vulnerability of our nation, on defending our skies or water spaces.  I would understand if time were dedicated in this House to explain the champagne jolly in the Minister's Department while loved ones could not say goodbye to those dying in our hospitals.  I would have liked the Minister's Fine Gael colleagues to bring in the Minister for Health to speak about children with spina bifida or scoliosis who are awaiting surgery.  I would have liked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to come in to address the homeless who are still dying on our streets.  The Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Byrne, has spoken about the digitisation of our data as regards passports.  Could the data that was obtained by the Department of Health be used by the Minister's Department in the future?  The EU Covid digital pass is still in operation.  What role will the Minister's Department have in that, going forward?  I look forward to the Minister's comprehensive response on that issue.</p></speech>

I have the ultimate respect for Senator Keogan and many of the viewpoints she brings to this Chamber so I do not mean this contribution in a negative way or anything like that.  However, I feel it is my duty to respond from a Fine Gael perspective.  We have been here for two years.  If one looks at the list of speakers who will contribute to this debate, the majority are Government speakers.  At no stage over the past two and a half years have we all been in the Chamber at the same time because of Covid-19.  We have all been moving in and out of the Chamber.</p> <p>I have been in this House for eight years.  The Minister has been here a lot longer than I have.  He has been here since 1997.  He and anyone else can attest that Members come into the Chamber, make a speech and return to their offices.  Much of the time, they have their televisions on and are listening to contributions in their offices.  There have been plenty of times I have decided not to take part in a debate only to come down in the middle of a contribution because of something I heard on the television.  It is disingenuous, with all due respect, to say Senators are not in the Chamber.  It would be a ridiculous use of our time to sit through a two-hour or three-hour debate, listening to every single contribution after we have made our own speeches.  I know I am going off on a tangent and I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.</p></speech>

I make that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-02a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1670" speakername="John McGahon" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022020200002#UU00500"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence in allowing me to make those points before I move on to talk about passports, which is an important issue.  The other issues that Senator Keogan raised are also important issues.  At every stage, important issues are being discussed.  I would never consider saying to a Sinn F&eacute;in Senator, an Independent Senator or any other Senator that the issue they wish to bring up in this House is invalid or is not of importance compared with other issues.  Senators have the right to raise issues and they are all of equal importance.  Every issue that is brought up in this House, regardless of who says it or brings it up, has the same level of equity.  To turn around and say that an issue is not important based on one's personal view is deeply unfair and goes against the spirit of the House.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence in allowing me go off on that point.</p> <p>It is difficult to come into this debate after the Minister has supplied a comprehensive 15-minute reply.  I appreciate it.  Some of the points I wish to make have already been made.  I will try to reiterate them briefly.  I thank the Minister for the engagement he has had with us in recent weeks.  One of those engagements was about the 40-day turnaround for first-time applications.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister is putting a lot of investment into the passport service to try to reduce that 40-day turnaround time.  I have spoken to the Minister on this point.  I believe it is inherently unfair that if one makes a mistake on an application, the process goes back to the very start and the 40-day turnaround time starts again.  I acknowledge that the Minister has said he is trying to rectify and change that.  That is a positive step.</p> <p>One other thing I will say about first-time passport applications is that where a passport is coming to a child, the parents' passports tend to follow a couple of days or a week later.  It would make absolute sense for all of those passports to come back at the same time.  In my experience, a child's passport often comes back in time for the date of travel but the parents' passports do not.  We are then left struggling to get the parents' passports out to them as well.  The point is that the parents' documentation comes back a few days after the child's passport.  It would be useful to try to get them back at the same time.</p> <p>The Minister set up an Oireachtas line a number of months ago and I have found that extremely useful.  I would like that to continue in some guise for the next couple of months until the passport service is up to the standard the Minister would like in terms of the level of retraining and everything else we want to do to make it a more efficient and smoother service.</p> <p>I worked for former Senator Paul Coghlan for a couple of years and I had the pleasure of sharing an office with Ms Karen Warren who works for Senator Paddy Burke.  She was the absolute passport expert.  I learned more about passports through Karen Warren in those three years in that office than at any other time.  Perhaps that is testament to why Senator Burke has not lost an election in 30 years.  Ms Warren has been a super font of advice for all of us in this House who are not members of political parties.  I learned so much from her.  The point is that Karen and people in this House know the passport system inside out.  The general public do not know the passport system in and out, and it can be very daunting when they make a mistake on an application and are then trying to find out from the Passport Office what the problem is.  That is why it is important for those lines of communication from the Passport Office to be open to the public.</p> <p>The Minister mentioned the number of applications in 2019.  I feel for the Passport Office staff who have been under immense pressure over the past 18 months while having to deal with Covid at the same time.  It must have felt like a tsunami of applications coming at them.  I know it felt in our office as if we were dealing with those issues every day.  I pay tribute to the Passport Office staff for dealing with such an exceptional and totally out of the norm level of passport applications.  I am pleased to say that in the House.</p> <p>We have provided a lot of anecdotal evidence in this debate.  We have offered some views as to how we can make the system more efficient.  I am confident that the Minister wants to make the system more efficient than it is already.  He wants to streamline it a bit more and hopefully when that happens, we will not be annoying his good office or the offices of anyone else as much as we are now.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House and providing a robust outline of this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-02a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022020200002#UU00600"><p>The Minister is welcome to the House.  This has been a constructive debate and I would not describe it as a waste of time.  All of us, on a cross-party basis, have faced challenges relating to this issue.  It is difficult because there is, at times, a sense of powerlessness, or there has been, as to whether we can help to get someone sorted with a passport.  It is also important to recognise the challenges the Passport Office has faced.  I salute all of the staff of the Passport Office.  I cannot imagine how difficult the past year has been.  The staff have gone to enormous lengths in terms of their hours of work and dedication.  The reality is that at times they have faced a tsunami of applications, which has proven incredibly challenging to them and frustrating to the public.</p> <p>I want to be constructive so it is important to acknowledge the steps that have been taken to hire additional staff.  That is essential.  The only point I would make in that regard is perhaps it could have been anticipated and those steps could have been taken a little sooner.  I take the point the Minister made that this is something that must be done physically on-site.  That is a valid point and shows the challenges the Minister has been facing over the past considerable amount of time.</p> <p>I am no different from anyone else in that I have experienced people who have been unable to get passports in urgent situations.  It has been incredibly upsetting for them.  The key thing is to see what lessons we can learn.  This does not happen often but I want to compliment Fine Gael because the wording of this motion is good and detailed.  I particularly highlight the section which calls on the Government "to implement a system whereby citizens can collect their passport from a Passport Service public office on request, in cases of emergency and urgent travel, where the passport will not be received in time for travel through the postal system".  That is key.  The lesson that must be learned is that the Passport Office, which has done tremendous work in incredibly difficult circumstances, needs to find better ways of being accessible to the public.  We all know that one of the biggest frustrations has been that people cannot get through to the office and, in fairness, that is why the Oireachtas line has been so useful.  At least we can try to make contact that way.  My colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, made the most important point.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When people are really stressed and are struggling to get a passport that it is urgent - and it is always urgent - they really want to talk to a human being, but even in the best circumstances, that has not always been possible.  I understand why it has not been possible but that leads to huge frustration.  If we are to accept the spirit of the point in the Private Member's motion, then we should be calling on the Passport Office to look at where it can open additional offices for outreach.  The other difficulty, and we have all experienced this, is that when people have to come to Dublin to collect a passport in person, the Passport Office is probably one of the hardest places to get to.  When people get to the M50, it still takes them another hour to get to the office.  Why do we not make more use of Cork?  I note the point that 2,500 emergency appointments have been facilitated but why not see if we can do more?  Why not finally embrace the idea of opening an office in Northern Ireland?  Why would we not do that?  Is that not the right thing to do anyway in terms of where we are with the peace process and reaching out to people?  It would make sense.  Again, people do not want to be travelling from Donegal to Dublin in an emergency and they should not have to do so in this day and age.  It should be possible to do as I suggest.  I ask the Department to take on that particular point in the motion and see how we can develop the service to make it easier for people to speak to a human being in emergency situations.</p><p>As has been mentioned previously, it has been a particularly challenging time for those with foreign birth certificates and the process involved there.  Since Brexit, very many people want to get an Irish passport and there have been difficulties.  Members of my own extended family had the experience of being locked in the system without a response for a year and then being told the original certificate sent in does not look like an original.  There was a huge sense of powerlessness for many.  That said, I must acknowledge that when I reached out to the Minister's office, there was delivery.  It is important to acknowledge that people at all levels have done their best to respond.  That is the fairest thing to say.  We can learn lessons from this, which is important because, let us be clear, the foreign birth registration office is going to be nothing but busier in the next couple of years.  Let us make sure it is fully resourced and that the timeline of two years is cut down substantially.  That is in our interests.  We want people who want to get Irish passports to have a good experience so that they feel welcome and feel this is something the country wants to see.  There are lessons to be learned in relation to this process.</p><p>I want to recognise and support this motion on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.  I hope this debate will lead to broader thinking on the issues I have raised.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the commitment in his statement to increasing staff at the Passport Office to cater for the expected increase in passport applications to some 1.75 million this year.  That is a staggering figure when one considers the highest number ever dealt with previously was around 1 million.  There is a challenge there, undoubtedly, but the Government is responding to it by increasing staffing levels in the Passport Office considerably.</p><p>This is a very welcome debate, as others have said.  It has drawn attention to this matter and has received quite a bit of media attention today.  It has encouraged people to check their passports and to make their applications online in a timely fashion.  That is a useful exercise in and of itself.</p><p>It is important to say that many thousands of passport applications are dealt with in very timely and diligent fashion by the Passport Office every day but we do not hear about those cases.  They are not the cases that come to our constituency offices.  It is the difficult ones we hear about.  That said, I put up a social media post on this issue earlier today and was heartened to see many people posting complimentary comments about the quick turnaround times they experienced recently.  Unfortunately of course, as with everything, there were some bad experiences too, including one case where a passport was delivered to the wrong address and was only located a week later.  It also had the wrong date of birth on it, which is obviously a very serious issue.  I do not expect the Minister to comment on an individual case but I will talk to him about it later.  I would emphasise again that many people had very positive experiences and it is important to put that on the record.</p><p>I want to raise an issue I have raised with the Minister previously, both inside and outside the House.  I refer to first-time applications for children where one or both parents are not originally from Ireland.  While many people are looking forward to an overseas holiday for the first time with their child, there are many others who are looking forward both to being reunited with family and to grandparents meeting their grandchildren for the very first time.  Unfortunately, there is a particular issue in those cases.  While I understand there must be additional checks <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>consent and there is a need to verify the passports of the parent or parents, these applications are taking an inordinate amount of time to be processed.  I have examples of cases from last August and September that are still not resolved, including one where a child's Indian grandparent abroad is very sick in hospital.  There are issues with those passport applications that we must get to grips with, but I appreciate the staff in the Passport Office are doing their utmost to work through the backlog.</p><p>As other Members have said, early validation is key.  Documents only being checked and verified after seven or eight weeks and applications then going back to the end of the queue has caused a lot of frustration.  That problem is now being addressed, which I welcome.  I also want to reference the reminder.  The Fine Gael group has suggested that an early notification be provided, as is the case with motor taxation.  Senator Kyne referred to the difficulties that may arise where a reminder is issued to somebody who is deceased.  However, the reminder system does work for motor tax renewal and I know that without the reminder email I get, I would forget.  A reminder would be a useful addition.</p><p>I compliment the Minister, his team of officials and the team at the Passport Office on the diligent work they do every day to respond to so many requests.  Invariably there are difficult cases which the Minister's office and the Passport Office try their utmost to resolve and we very much appreciate that, as do all of our constituents.</p></speech>

He has worked hard on behalf of this State since entering political life, but he has done a huge service to our country recently and it is important to put that on the record.  I also acknowledge the work of the staff in the Passport Office in extremely difficult circumstances.  They are the subject almost daily of negative media commentary in newspapers and on the radio.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important to put on record that this work could not be done off-site.  The vast majority of people probably would not know that.  It had to be done within the confines of the building to make sure it was within a secure network because of GDPR issues and because it related to people's private business.  I do not think a lot of the general public know that so it is important to get that out there.  I welcome the Oireachtas line that was set up.  I thank the people who work on that line and I thank the Minister's office for the help I received in sorting out numerous difficult cases.  I got a WhatsApp message from Dublin Airport at 8 a.m. on Friday 24 December.  A lad from Belfast sent me a picture with a pint, a boarding pass and his passport.  He was heading off to New York for Christmas and it did not look like he could go two or three days earlier.  There are lots of good results and good stories.</p><p>A couple of points have been made during the debate.  The issue of passports for children being issued and the supporting passport of the parent not coming with them must be looked at.  That passport should go with the child's passport when it is being posted out.</p><p>The reminder, by text message or whatever, is an excellent proposal.  The reality is, and I am guilty of this myself, that it is only when people go to get their passport when booking something that they realise it is out of date.  If we got a reminder it would make us deal with it.  Only yesterday evening my wife said to me that we have to get the kids' passports in place, because of the discussion we are having today.  We have no travel planned for the foreseeable future but we are going to get it done so we have it done.</p><p>As the Minister knows, I am a postmaster by profession.  For many years, the passport express service provided an excellent service to the Passport Office and the general public.  However, we have now been sidelined by the online service, which has been promoted.  There are probably very few passport applications going through the post office system now.  When people come in with a passport application I ask them when they need it for, and I have told some people not to do it through that service but to go online to make sure they have it back in time.  There is still a significant role for the post office with regard to passports, such as in applications for first-time passports and so on.  We could look at doing online applications for customers within the post office, where we would enter the details onto the system and scan whatever documentation that is needed straight to the Passport Office.  That is already in place with the likes of Western Union.  Many of the issues with the backlog within the Passport Office relate to documentation being sent in but if that documentation were physically checked by a person, be they a postmaster or a clerk, who knows what documentation is needed, the chances of there being a mistake in that documentation would be significantly reduced.  That would be a way of clearing the backlog and helping people who are not in a position to make an application online.</p><p>I was chatting to a garda the other day who told me about the significant number of people now going into his Garda station looking to get documentation signed.  With a minor passport application, I as a postmaster can sign, verify and witness the parent's signature for a child's passport, yet I cannot verify the actual passport application for the same signature on the other page.  It would make sense if postmasters could verify all of that and would also reduce the workload for the local Garda stations.  Much of their work involves verifying those applications whereas we would be in a position to do so as well.</p><p>Roughly 4,000 to 5,000 passports are issued each day.  Passports issued on a Friday evening are in the postal system for the weekend and on a bank holiday weekend they could be in the postal system for three days.  There have been situations where people were flying on a Sunday but their passport was issued on a Friday.  Luckily, a staff member within An Post was able to get it to them so they could fly.  I ask that something be put in place for these situations, such as a delivery on a Saturday morning to sub-offices etc.  Something should be put in place with An Post that would allow those passports to be delivered on a Saturday, or people could get a notification that they could collect it in their local office.  That would alleviate a lot of problems for people, particularly with regard to passports issued on a Friday evening.</p><p>I again thank the Minister and the staff of the Passport Office for the work they have done in difficult times.</p></speech>

It is always a good sign when Senator Gavan is agreeing with the motion and welcoming it.  In fairness, he and his colleague Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile brought up some very good points about MLAs and people in Northern Ireland who would like to use the passport service.</p> <p>The Minister perfectly explained in his contribution the demands facing the passport service over the next year.  Over 100,000 applications are being processed very month.  It is a phenomenal number of passports to be dealt with.  The service the Passport Office provides is hugely significant and hugely important to everyone.  This debate has raised awareness for people who might not be aware of the importance of getting a passport.  The Department is also running a campaign reminding people of that.  The increase from 47% to 90% in the percentage of people applying for passports online shows that people listened to the advice given.  We need to get that information out there and remind people that it is much easier to do an online passport application.  It is certainly much easier to facilitate and help when there is an issue, as opposed to paper applications.</p> <p>This has been a welcome and informative discussion.  The Minister has given some new information that we were not aware of about the immediate pressures and demands the Passport Office is under.  The news of the staff out in Swords and the ramp-up of staffing levels is welcome.  I acknowledge the announcement the Minister made about the service operating seven days a week.  That happened during periods of 2021 but from this week on overtime will again be facilitated within the Passport Office, which is hugely important.  If the public representatives here today have one objective, it is to try to get a contact number for Ms Byrne, now that we know she is actually the key person here as opposed to the Minister himself. </p></speech>

I would remind everybody the protocol is part of an international agreement.  It was agreed and ratified by the UK and the EU and its implementation is not only part of an international treaty but is also part of international law.  To deliberately frustrate obligations under that treaty would be a very serious matter indeed.  It is essentially playing politics with legal obligations and I certainly hope it does not happen as has been threatened and described.  We will follow that closely and we should also put on the record that the protocol was designed, conceived and agreed to protect the Good Friday Agreement at the time, in the context of the fallout on this island from Brexit.  All of its dimensions fully recognise the constitutional position of Northern Ireland as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>I would encourage those in positions of responsibility and decision-making to allow the negotiations to continue between the British Government and the European Commission, the process led by Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi and the British Foreign Secretary, Elizabeth Truss.  We are part of that process which is working towards compromise and agreement this month, if possible, so to make an intervention like the one that is being suggested will happen at midnight tonight is really unhelpful.  I suspect it is far more about politics than it is an effort to try to find compromise, a middle ground position and agreement through flexibility and pragmatism.  Let us wait and see what happens later on this evening.  International law matters and it should guide us all, as lawmakers, in terms of our responsibilities in the context of Brexit and the protocol.</p></speech>
