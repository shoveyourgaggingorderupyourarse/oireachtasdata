There are men and women going about their normal daily business in the midlands today who would not be with us were it not for the fantastic service provided by the Irish Air Corps, the National Ambulance Service and the AC112 air ambulance helicopter, based in Athlone, since 2012.  Similarly, men and women are going about their daily business today unaware of the fact that they may one day need these services.  The service is called upon on a nearly daily basis.  Last year alone, it responded to 159 serious car crashes and 146 other medical emergencies, and provided 15 urgent transports of children to hospitals.  The Minister of State will understand that there is a degree of concern in my home town of Athlone and the surrounding counties regarding any threat to the future of this service.</p> <p>I understand the current situation and ongoing HR challenges faced by the Air Corps, particularly with regard to the recruitment and retention of pilots.  I also understand that for training reasons, the Air Corps will not be in a position to accept emergency aeromedical requests by the National Ambulance Service for four days per month between now and the end of February 2020.  Furthermore, I accept that the Irish Coast Guard will provide reserve cover to the National Ambulance Service for the 16 days during which the Air Corps is not accepting taskings, and that further backup from the Cork-based Irish Community Rapid Response, ICRR, helicopter has been explored.</p> <p>I am not happy that we are in this situation.  I have been a constant thorn in the Minister of State's side regarding funding for the Defence Forces.  I accept that this training is necessary and that the cover arrangements put in place aim to provide the best service possible using all available resources.  However, there is fear in the midlands, particularly in Athlone, that this is the thin end of the wedge, which might signal the winding down of this very valuable service.  This fear has been stoked by certain public representatives for their own political purposes, but is nonetheless causing concern among the general public.  I would like the Minister of State to allay those concerns.  I ask him to address only one issue, namely, the future of this service.  I do not need to hear an explanation of the current situation or the provisions put in place to address it.  I have heard and understand the assurances from the Department in that regard.  I am asking the Minister of State to make an unequivocal statement in this House that the service provided by the air ambulance helicopter in Athlone will not be wound down or reduced in any way and will continue to be based in Custume Barracks in Athlone.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-11-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019111900002#B00600"><p>I thank Senator McFadden for raising this important matter.  The emergency aeromedical support, EAS, service based in Custume Barracks in Athlone is an important service provided by the Air Corps.  Notwithstanding the well-documented ongoing HR challenges in the Air Corps, particularly the recruitment and retention of pilots, the EAS service has been delivered without interruption since it was put in place by the Fine Gael-led Government in 2012.  I have prioritised this service and will continue to do so into the future.</p> <p>I have received military advice that the Air Corps will not be in a position to accept EAS taskings from the National Ambulance Service for four days per month for a period of four months, from November to February 2020.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paul Kehoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is regrettable but necessary for safety and governance reasons.  During this time there will be a training surge to produce a new cohort of aircraft commanders for the emergency aeromedical service, EAS.  This will ensure the long-term viability of the service provided by the Air Corps.</p><p>The safety of personnel, HSE staff and patients is paramount to me and our foremost shared priority.  Our focus is on returning the EAS to full capacity from the end of February 2020.  During the 16 days when the Air Corps will not accept taskings, the Irish Coast Guard will provide reserve cover for the National Ambulance Service.  This is in line with the Government's decision in 2015 to establish the emergency aeromedical service.  The Irish Community Rapid Response, ICRR, emergency medical service has agreed to provide additional cover using a second helicopter which will be based in Roscommon on the days when the Air Corps will not be in a position to accept taskings for the EAS.  The ICRR will also continue to be available in the south of the country.  I am focused on returning the EAS to a full service and full capacity.  A number of measures are being pursued, including the reintroduction of the service commitment scheme for pilots, the recommissioning of former Air Corps pilots and the training of junior pilots during that time.</p><p>The emergency aeromedical service provided by the Air Corps has completed more than 2,600 missions since it commenced operations in 2012.  I pay tribute to the professional and effective service provided by Air Corps personnel.  I acknowledge the support of the Irish Coast Guard and the ICRR during this challenging period.  The shared priority is to provide the best available service using all available resources during the four days in each month when the Air Corps will not be available for EAS taskings.  This interruption is regrettable but necessary, as I stated, from a safety and governance perspective.  The emergency aeromedical service operated by the Air Corps will continue.  It is not being wound down.  The service will continue to be provided by the Air Corps.</p></speech>

However, it is disappointing in this day and age that we have to rely on a helicopter provided by a charity.  I thank the Minister of State for his assurance that the service will continue to be provided.  However, he did not mention Athlone.  In 2012 when Deputy Coveney was then in the position of Minister, I lobbied hard to have the air ambulance pilot scheme remain in place in Athlone.  I have been happy with and proud of the service provided since, but there was no mention of it being maintained in Custume Barracks in Athlone.  Will the Minister of State assure me that it will be maintained there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-11-19a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019111900002#C00300"><p>I do not think there was any question that it would be relocated to any other location.  The service will be maintained in Athlone.  The ICRR helicopter is based in County Roscommon because it is a community service, while Custume Barracks is a military barracks.  I hope the Senator understands the reasons we cannot have a community service helicopter operating out of a military barracks.  If anyone has given her the idea that the service will be moved, I would appreciate it if she would go back to that person to say the service will continue to be based in Athlone, except for four days in November, December, January and February.  It is not regrettable that we have a community service helicopter.  It is happening all over Europe.  It is a considerable feature in England where community and voluntary organisations provide helicopter ambulance services.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paul Kehoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not see why we should not be able to do that in Ireland as well.</p><p>I very much welcome the help and assistance of the Irish Community Rapid Response helicopter.  It is a fabulous service in the south of the country and covers a vast region.  The service has two helicopters and the helicopter provided out of Roscommon is the second helicopter.  The ICRR will continue to operate in the south of the country in addition to the service it provides in Roscommon.  While I am not sure exactly from where in Roscommon the service is provided, it is to be very much welcomed that the ICRR came on board.  When asked, it was available and willing to assist.</p><p>I can confirm to the House that, once the training is provided over the four days per month for the four months of November, December, January and February, it will be back permanently in Custume Barracks, Athlone from 1 March onwards.  The service does a fabulous job there and has saved many lives, not just in the midlands or the west, but as far down as my own constituency in County Wexford, where a very important service is provided.</p><p>I remind the House there was a lot of pressure over a long number of years to have this service but it was a Fine Gael-led Government that introduced this scheme in 2012 and put it on a permanent footing in 2015, when a memorandum was brought to Government.  I want to reaffirm that commitment.  While we have our challenges, this service will return to full service from 1 March 2020, apart from four days per month in November, December, January and February, when the ICRR will provide a service for those four-day periods.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, for taking the time to come to the House to give us an update on the issue of staffing levels in Kenmare Community Hospital.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the hospital has been open since 2013 and, in fact, the official sod-turning by Senator Reilly, then Minister for Health, happened on 3 February 2012.  Yet, despite the Government spending &euro;8 million on this new facility, only 19 of the beds are open at this stage and 21 remain to be opened.  We must bear in mind we have been waiting six years for the opening of the second floor of the hospital.</p> <p>The excuse that has been given time and again in this House is the issue of recruitment.  We are producing far more nurses per head of population than most European countries yet we are exporting most of them.  They are being offered jobs in England, Australia and the Middle East, and they are taking up those jobs.  For some reason, the offers that are being put out by the Government every year or six months are not being taken up, and that reason is that the pay and conditions are simply not good enough.</p> <p>The excuse applies not only to Kenmare Community Hospital but also to Dingle Community Hospital, on which &euro;14 million was spent and where 60 beds were provided but only 43 are open, again, due to the lack of nurses being recruited by the HSE.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope the Minister of State does not give me the same reply I got six months ago, a year ago, two years ago, two and a half years ago or any time I have been allowed to ask this question that it is still trying to recruit.  It is six years on and if it is still trying to recruit for this hospital and all the other hospitals that have vacancies, the Government obviously has not identified the true problem, which is the Government, in that it is the one that is not giving the proper terms and conditions, and that is why people are not taking up the positions in this hospital and in all the other ones.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</p></speech>

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  Residential care is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private provision.  It is worth highlighting that the net budget for long-term residential care in 2019 is &euro;985 million, and more than 33,000 clients on average at any one time will be in receipt of financial support.  Over the last two years, an additional &euro;45 million has been provided to the nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, budget.  In 2020, the NHSS will see a further investment into its budget of &euro;45 million, bringing the total annual budget for the NHSS to &euro;1.30 billion.</p> <p>Public residential care units such as Kenmare Community Hospital, County Kerry, are an essential part of our healthcare infrastructure.  In total they provide about 5,000 long-stay beds, amounting to 20% of the total stock of nursing home beds nationally.  There are also about 2,000 short-stay community public beds.</p> <p>The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social care services, including the Kenmare Community Hospital.  HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4, which includes County Kerry, is committed to delivering services for older persons through a community-based approach that is supporting older people to live in their own homes and communities and when needed in residential care, such as Kenmare Community Hospital.</p> <p>Currently, there are 19 beds open at Kenmare Community Hospital with the potential to open up another further 21 in the future.  While the HSE had planned to open a number of additional beds at the community hospital on a phased basis, it has unfortunately faced challenges in recruiting the extra nurses needed.  The existing nursing staff complement for the 19 existing beds is 8.66 nursing whole-time equivalents along with 7.86 healthcare assistants.  However, in order to open an additional nine beds, a further 5.11 nurses, whole-time equivalents, WTEs, are required, so another five nurses are required to open the nine beds.</p> <p>I have been assured that the increasing capacity of Kenmare Community Hospital remains a priority for the HSE and that it is continuing to make intensive efforts to recruit nursing staff.  I am also informed that the executive has run three recruitment campaigns in the last year alone, the most recent recruitment campaign being in September 2019, when every effort was made to recruit the necessary staff.  Unfortunately, no suitable candidates were recruited at that time.  The HSE fully understands the importance of Kenmare Community Hospital to the local community and appreciates the excellent care provided by the staff there.</p> <p>I note that the recent inspection report published earlier this year by the Health Information and Quality Authority acknowledged that the centre was warm, bright and comfortable and met the needs of the residents, so we have great confidence in the hospital.  In general, the inspector observed that the care and support given to residents was respectful, relaxed and unhurried.  Staff were familiar with the residents' preferences and choices and facilitated these in a friendly and respectful manner.</p> <p>The local HSE management has assured the Department of Health that it will continue to work to extend the services in Kenmare.  The HSE has informed the Department that the hospital has an excellent reputation locally as a care facility and that the welfare of its residence is a priority for staff and management and that they are deeply appreciative of the support the hospital receives from the families in the wider community.</p> <p>In line with the usual process, the HSE will continue to review all of its services to ensure the continued provision of high quality, value-for-money residential care with the older person at the centre of all decisions made.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I will bring the Senator's genuine concerns back to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.</p></speech>

I will focus on the value-for-money element.  There is no value for money in having a facility that cost &euro;8 million with half of it empty for six years.  While the Minister of State pointed out that no suitable candidates were recruited at the time, the real issue lies with the terms and conditions the HSE is offering staff.  This is not just an issue for Kenmare or Kerry, but is nationwide.  In talking about value for money, agency nurses are being brought in at a cost of hundreds of millions of euro per annum to fill the void in the hospital services.  The terms and conditions for nursing staff is the problem for Kenmare community hospital.</p> <p>People in Dingle are being sent outside the peninsula.  A 90 year old woman cannot be cared for in her local community because the beds are not opened.  The beds are not opened because the nurses are not hired.  The nurses are not hired because the terms and conditions are not as they should be.  Britain, Australia and other countries are benefiting from the nurses we are training but not willing to pay adequately.  That will continue and I will be back here in six months, but hopefully not asking the same question and getting the same answer.  I again thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.</p></speech>

I acknowledge, as does the HSE, the importance of the role facilities like Kenmare community hospital provide to the people in the region.  The welfare of residents is a priority for the staff and management who are very appreciative of the support the hospital receives from families and the local community.  However, the HSE cannot open additional beds unless the appropriate level of nursing staff is in place to ensure the service provided is safe and of the optimum quality for elderly residents who require professional nursing care.</p> <p>I take on board the Senator's point about highly trained nurses leaving the country along with his value-for-money economic argument on the &euro;8 million it cost to build the hospital with the wards half-empty.  He also spoke about the nurses' terms and conditions, and the high cost of agency nurses.  I regularly say to Government that a lot of the resources could be spent in that direction.  I will bring the Senator's concerns back to the Minister of State.  The HSE will continue to make every effort to recruit the nursing staff for Kenmare community hospital.</p></speech>

As he will be aware, I wish to raise the very important issue of educational supports for children who have been affected by failings in the audiology service in community healthcare organisation area 2 and, specifically, counties Roscommon and Mayo.  I have been working with the parents of several children who have been affected by this issue for some time.  The parents, who have been through a very difficult time, have done everything feasible in terms of their dedication and efforts to get the best for their children.</p><p>It is very important that we have a co-ordinated approach for these children.  I am not satisfied with the way in which they and their parents have been treated.  As the Minister will be aware, I am very dissatisfied at the level of cross-departmental co-operation in terms of securing supports.  I was initially involved in the setting up of a cross-departmental approach but I am not satisfied with the results to date.  During the summer, the parents worked extremely hard to secure chair silencers for classrooms.  We were told there was no funding available and that it should come from a minor works grant.  It is unbelievable that there is no funding within the Department to provide chair silencers for children who have been affected by an audiology misdiagnosis.  After much back and forth between the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE, we finally got approval for chair silencers.</p><p>Some children have been approved for one sound field system, but many need two because they receive resource teaching in another room.  Some have been approved for two.  There is real inconsistency.</p><p>The HSE allowed for educational psychological assessments to take place and recommended iPads for some children but these requests have been refused by the Department.  The result is that applications are made to the Department, refused and appealed, and the correspondence then goes to the HSE.  The Minister will understand that by that stage one is many months down the road.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maura Hopkins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2478"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2478&amp;amp;pid=MauraHopkins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Obviously it is important that we support those children dealing with the challenges and difficulties of which I have spoken.  It is critically important that we support them as they transition from primary to secondary school.  I am not convinced, based on the evidence I have, that there will be long-term supports in place for these children.  Their parents are not looking for extra supports.  They have been let down by the State and have worked extremely hard since they received the letter of apology for having been let down.  It is important that we support those children and their parents. </p><p>As a public representative in Roscommon I am very annoyed and dissatisfied with the way in which those children have been treated.  I want to see a co-ordinated approach between the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills and for supports to be put in place as quickly as possible.  I have reams of correspondence about what the Department and the HSE are doing but I do not have adequate evidence that enough support is being put in place.  I know the Minister is aware of these issues but ask for an urgent approach to dealing with the additional supports that are required.</p></speech>

It was agreed that where the affected children had special educational needs due to a hearing impairment, special educational needs supports could be provided in line with the various schemes operated by both my Department and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. </p> <p>My Department agreed to review the special educational supports provided to the affected children, to ensure that they are in receipt of supports in line with Department schemes and that supports provided are based on the children's individual needs.  The HSE sought consent from parents and guardians to share affected children's details with my Department and the NCSE.  To date, the details of nine children have been provided to my Department.</p> <p>As a matter of priority, my Department in conjunction with the NCSE, completed its review of the special educational supports in place for each of the nine children and has now ensured that they are in receipt of appropriate special educational needs supports in line with the terms of various schemes.  Supports available include: special education teaching support in schools; funding for assistive technology such as soundfield and FM systems; and guidance from the NCSE's visiting teacher service on classroom adaptation and school staff training.</p> <p>All children are in receipt of special educational needs teaching support under the new model introduced in 2017 and revised in 2019.  The new special education teaching allocation provides a single, unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on that school's educational profile, to allow schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools.  Schools deploy additional teaching resources based on each pupil's individual learning needs.  The visiting teaching service has assessed the educational needs of all nine children and made recommendations to their schools.  In accordance with the visiting teachers' service referral process and procedures, children with mild or unilateral hearing loss are placed on the "On Request" caseload and children with moderate-profound hearing loss are placed on the "Active" caseload of the visiting teacher.  The visiting teachers have assessed the acoustic conditions in the schools and made recommendations to schools to put in place appropriate measures to cater for the children's needs.</p> <p>All nine children have received assistive technology, in accordance with the criteria of the scheme.  With regard to teacher training, the NCSE can provide direct support to the schools and individual teachers in as flexible a way as possible.  Schools can apply for support through the NCSE's online application system, which is accessible via the NCSE website.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The NCSE offers telephone advice, school visits by a member of the team, in-service courses for individual teachers or whole-school training.  Whole-school training will ensure all teachers are equipped to cater for children's educational needs as they progress through school.</p><p>Schools have been instructed to continue to engage with their local special educational needs organiser, SENO, and visiting teacher on the special educational needs of the children identified in the HSE review.  Parents or guardians may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs using the contact details available on the NCSE's website.  My Department has made direct contact with both schools and parents/guardians.  A representative of my Department also met a group of affected parents/guardians in November 2018 and March 2019.  The HSE and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, as well as the NCSE, were also represented at those meetings.</p></speech>

There are, however, several issues that I want to clarify.  The Minister has stated the supports include assistive technology.  I am in contact with many parents of children who have been affected.  The assistive technology being provided is not adequate to meet their needs.  I gave the examples of the soundfield system and iPads.  School staff training is not available in all schools.  Parents are seeking access to the Jumpstarting literacy course which would help teachers to work with children affected, but that has not happened to date.  There are several difficulties in the provision of support by the Department. although I acknowledge some supports have been put in place.  However, we are not dealing with normal circumstances.  We are talking about children who have been misdiagnosed.  It is imperative that every possible additional support be put in place to allow the children who have had such a difficult start to make the greatest possible progress.  There are several inaccuracies in what the Department has stated about assistive technology and school staff training.  Will the Minister take these concerns on board?  Will the Department respond urgently?</p></speech>

If there are additional support requests on behalf of the nine children, my Department will prioritise them.  If there are other children identified by the HSE who require support or some assistive technology or funding, we can only work on the basis of consent.  We will, however, continue to provide support for the nine children in question.  If there are future applications, we will prioritise them.  If the HSE identifies other children who need support and gives consent to the Department, we will also be in a position to support them.</p></speech>

The Minister of State may remember that earlier this year, it was reported by the World Health Organization that levels of nitrogen dioxide, which comes from dirty diesel, were exceeded in Dublin and two other locations.  Many of our rural towns are still burning dirty coal.  By early next year, there is no doubt that we will be in breach of the EU safety levels for nitrogen dioxide.  This is already having a serious health and environmental impact on the citizens of Dublin.  I do not think it is a case of being found to have exceeded levels because I have spoken to the EPA, which told me that it is a matter of time as it has increased its monitoring within the capital.  The EPA expects to have the results of this monitoring early next year and expects that we will be in violation of the limits.  Where that has happened previously in other European countries, hundreds of millions of euro in fines have been levied.</p> <p>We need to put a plan in place.  We do not need to get official notification that the air quality in our cities is poor.  We know that for a fact.  It is within this Government's gift to start protecting our citizens.  We should not necessarily be worried about the hundreds of millions of euro in fines this country could face but the fact that the EPA says that 1,180 people die prematurely because of poor air quality in our cities, mainly in Dublin, not to mention the number of families with young children that are affected leading to increased use of medication and illness.  We must put a plan in place to improve our air quality.  This decline in air quality has been caused by Government policy that encouraged people to drive cars running on dirty diesel.  Those decisions were made in 2007 and 2008.  We are losing over 1,000 citizens through premature death due to poor air quality.  </p> <p>Is the Government prepared to tell the four local authorities in Dublin to put a plan together to ensure that air quality does not breach EU standards?  As I said, it has already breached World Health Organization standards.  There is only one answer I need from the Minister of State - "Yes" or "No".  If the answer is "No", the likelihood is that another 1,180 citizens will die in the next year.  This number is far higher than the number of people who die through road traffic accidents.  Must we say to affected families that their parent, brother or sister has to die because we have not been prepared to take preventative action now?  We should not wait but do it now.</p></speech>

The report indicated that air quality levels at monitoring sites in Ireland were below the EU legislative limit values in 2018.  However, it also showed that the stricter World Health Organization guideline values, which are lower and, therefore, offer greater protection, were exceeded at a number of monitoring sites for fine particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, N02. The report also indicated that EU limit values for N02 are likely to be exceeded in the near future at recently installed traffic monitoring sites in Dublin.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2432"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2432&amp;amp;pid=SeanCanney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--><font color="#2F2F2F">The main pollutants of concern are particulate matter from the burning of residential solid fuel and N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">from transport in urban area.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> These findings were consistent with those that emerged from an earlier monitoring report from the EPA, Urban Environmental Indicators - Nitrogen Dioxide Levels in Dublin, which was released in July this year.  It also indicated that some areas around certain heavily trafficked roads in the Dublin area may have higher levels of air pollution than previously indicated.  These higher levels are due primarily to traffic and some locations are at risk of exceeding the statutory EU limit for the pollutant nitrogen dioxide or N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">is an air pollutant associated with urban areas and is strongly linked with traffic emissions.  Diesel vehicles have historically far higher N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">emissions than other combustion engines, especially for older vehicles.  Exposures to high levels over short periods can give rise to acute health effects, while long-term exposure to elevated concentrations of N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">may contribute to the development of asthma and potentially increase susceptibility to respiratory infections.  People with asthma, as well as children and the elderly, are generally at greater risk from the poor health effects caused by N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> Because of these health effects, N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">is a controlled pollutant under the clean air for Europe directive, which sets limits on N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">levels in the ambient air.  An annual average limit value of 40 </font>g<font color="#2F2F2F">per cubic metre is in place to protect against the human health effects of long-term exposure and an hourly limit value of 200 </font>g<font color="#2F2F2F">per cubic metre protects against acute exposure.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> While previous EPA reports had indicated that N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">levels were potentially problematic in Ireland and approaching EU limit values in urban areas, the July report in particular presented new evidence that N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">may exceed the annual EU limit value on certain city centre streets, along the M50 motorway and around the entrance and exit from the Dublin Port tunnel.  It should be noted that the report also indicated that levels of N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">fall with distance from roadways and are well within EU limits away from busy roads and in many residential areas.  Around the M50, the highest concentrations are within 10 m of the motorway edge, with levels falling to background levels at a distance of 50 m to 75 m.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> The matter of air quality and particularly the potential human health effects of poor air equality are a matter of serious concern to this Government.  This is why considerable support is being provided by my Department to roll out the national ambient air quality monitoring programme, under which additional air quality monitoring stations are being installed in Dublin and across the country.  This programme is already providing better quality real-time information on localised air quality, which is very useful in the context of the development of air quality policies by my Department and in ensuring that local authorities take appropriate actions to tackle the challenge within their area of responsibility.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> For example, preliminary results from one of these new stations, at St John's Road West, near Heuston Station, indicate that Dublin is on course to exceed the annual N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">limit value by the end of the year.  If this happens, local authorities in Dublin and its suburbs will then be legally required to prepare air quality action plans to bring pollution levels back within the limit values in their area of responsibility.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> The findings of the report are very concerning and only highlight the need to implement the climate action plan.  This plan includes a number of actions which will have a significant impact on reducing emissions and improving air quality.  These include the development of a regulatory framework for low-emission zones and providing local authorities with the power to restrict access to certain parts of a city or a town to zero-emission vehicles only.  We are also committed to reaching 180,000 electric and hybrid vehicles on our roads by 2025 and nearly 1 million by 2030.  Electrifying our private and public transport fleets will have a highly positive impact on air quality, particularly on N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">levels in our towns and cities.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> In the meantime, the Government is, as a priority, establishing an inter-agency group whose membership will include the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Transport, Tourism and Sport, four Dublin local authorities, the EPA, and other stakeholders as necessary to, </font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">inter alia</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">, consider a range of options for potential measures to improve air quality and any associated actions and supports required to facilitate their effective uptake to address N0</font><sub><font color="#2F2F2F">2</font></sub><font color="#2F2F2F">and other air pollution and identify measures most suitable to Dublin, as well as in other urban locations in Ireland generally.  A first meeting of this group is being arranged for the coming weeks.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> This work will complement the work already under way by my Department's development of the whole-of-government clean air strategy, which will provide an overarching policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national, EU and international policy considerations and priorities.  The clean air strategy will address priority air pollutants in Ireland, including vehicle emissions, in an integrated manner.</font><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2432"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2432&amp;amp;pid=SeanCanney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister intends to launch the strategy at the earliest opportunity.

The EPA told the Minister what it told me, namely, that Dublin is already exceeding the limits.  Owing to the increase in monitoring we know that the limits are being exceeded.  What was not mentioned in the Minister of State's analysis is that not three metres from the street on which the monitors are to be installed there are homes which are going to exceed the limits.  The Minister of State is correct in saying that the local authorities in Dublin suburbs will then be legally required to prepare an air quality action plan.  The experts have told this Government that we are going to exceed the limits.  Why are we waiting?  Why are the four local authorities not being instructed to prepare an air quality action plan to bring pollution levels within their areas of responsibility back within the limit values?  That is the law.  What we are seeing is an avoidance by Government of its responsibilities in that it is waiting for the EPA to install monitors, review them and then produce the proof that the limits are being exceeded, following which the four local authorities will be instructed to meet their legal requirement and bring forward a plan to reduce those limits.</p> <p>I am calling on the Government to take its responsibilities seriously and to instruct the four local authorities to get working on the issue now because too many people are dying as a result of poor air quality.  There are too many children in my constituency who are not able to go to school because they are suffering from asthma.  Their medication is being increased on a regular basis in an effort to deal with this problem.  It is not good enough to say that we have to wait until next year to prepare a plan.

As I said earlier, the Government, as a priority, is establishing an interagency group, whose membership will include the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the four local authorities and other agencies, to consider a range of options and potential measures.  It is accepted that we have a problem.  In raising the issue today Senator Humphreys has highlighted that it is an issue that needs to be tackled.  I want to assure him that measures in the climate action plan will have a significant co-benefit to the work of this action group for air quality.  An important investment in improvement of our national air quality monitoring capacity is under way, which is already yielding results that will help inform the most cost-effective and impactful policy measures that we need to take.</p> <p>The results of the interagency group on urban transport-related air pollution and the forthcoming launch of the clean air strategy will build on this work and will help ensure that we achieve lasting reductions in the health environmental impacts of pollution in our city.</p></speech>

It should serve as a reminder to every person in this city and country of how poor our Government is and how badly it deals with increasing crime levels and out-of-control criminals.  How many times have I raised gun crime, knife crime, stabbings and shootings in the capital?</p><p>I know the Minister for Justice and Equality was busy yesterday not dealing with gangland crime or tackling these criminals but using his position to help a by-election candidate in Wexford.  Does he know how many gangland-related murders have happened on his watch?  Just like housing and health, the Government's on crime in Dublin and in the country is appallingly poor.  It is failing people miserably when it comes to tackling law and order issues in the capital and on our borders.  From anti-social behaviour and home burglaries to these murders, there seems to be no respect for the rule of law because the Government is letting these criminals get away with it.  I call on the Minister to come to the House to address this issue and what he is doing about the increase in crime.</p><p>On Saturday, I attended a day of action with parents in Dublin 12 to support their efforts to progress their campaign for autism supports for their children.  More than 80 children in the Dublin 12 area have not had formal in-school education.  The Minister for Education and Skills admitted last week that there are serious discrepancies and inadequacies in autism spectrum disorder, ASD, supports for children, especially because of the lack of specialised units in mainstream schools.  There is a notion that schools may have to be forced to provide supports under section 37 of the new Act.  Last Saturday, we campaigned outside Scoil Colm on Armagh Road.  This is a beautiful large school, which is now closed and lying empty.  It would be perfect to retrofit for the use of the children of Dublin 12 who need a specialist school with ASD supports.  I call on the Minister to come to the House to address exactly what he plans to do to help these children.  We have let them down.  It is devastating to listen to parents who are at home day in, day out with children, while their neighbour's children are going to school.  Their children are not getting the formal education that we promised and that they deserve.</p><p>I wish all of my male colleagues in the Chamber a happy International Men's Day.</p></speech>

For the joint Defence Forces and Department of Defence annual reports in 2015 and 2016, high-level groups were put together to report on the emergency air ambulance service.  The Minister of State and the Department, and everybody and anybody under the sun, were aware of the fact there would be serious shortcomings down the line.  The recommendations of those two groups were ignored completely and were totally and utterly rejected.  The Minister of State then went on to say a number of pilots had been recommissioned into the Air Corps.  The truth is that one is a lieutenant-colonel who will not fly because he has an administrative rank, and the second is a captain who, I am sure, is not going to be given the keys of a helicopter and told, "Good lad, off you go and fly helicopters for us".  At the end of the day, I am afraid that is not good enough.</p> <p>I could go through a plethora of issues.  The Leader is smiling away.  One of the places we might look is in his own backyard in Cork, where two ships costing millions of euro are tied up with no crew to sail them.  The announcement yesterday, which was cynical to say the least, of the tax relief that has been provided for sailors was a 12th-hour announcement.  The truth is that most seagoing people have had that allowance for years.</p> <p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business: "That the Taoiseach and Minister for Defence, if possible, or the Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Kehoe, be brought to this House today at 6:15 p.m. to deal with the issues raised on the "Saturday with Cormac &Oacute; hEadhra" programme and a plethora of other issues in regard to the Defence Forces."</p></speech>

He was in Leinster House to hand in a letter to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  I am referring to a topic that has been raised countless times in this Chamber, on all sides, which is the despicable treatment meted out to community employment, CE, supervisors in regard to their pensions and entitlements and rulings by the Labour Court that have been ignored by the Government.  Looking back at the record, I see this was raised last February and last April, and I am going to raise it again today.  I cannot begin to express the level of frustration and anger that union members and CE supervisors feel.  Here is the level of contempt - that is the only word I can use - that the Government has for these people: it refuses to even engage in correspondence or to acknowledge getting letters requesting meetings.  As I pointed out previously, and as other Members across the Chamber have pointed out, these are not well paid staff.  These are staff who have given tremendous service across the country in all constituencies, and they have been completely ignored by the Government.</p> <p>These recommendations go back to 2005 and 2008.  The message that the Government sends to private sector employers is that it they are the subject of a Labour Court recommendation, they can ignore it because it is ignoring these recommendations.  The letter refers to the high-level forum established by the previous Government under the Lansdowne Road agreement to deal with these matters.  The agreement states that the high-level forum will be convened by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, involving the relevant Departments and agencies, and will meet on a quarterly basis.  That is pretty straightforward, except it has not met since December 2017, almost two years ago.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That shows absolute contempt for the workers and the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The Department does not even have the decency to reply to letters, which is the reason a number of people hand delivered them this morning to the office of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  I am seeking a debate on the matter.</p><p>The second issue I want to raise is the change to the retirement age from 2021, from when people will have to work until the age of 67 years.  As the contracts of many will expire when they reach the age of 66 years, they will have to sign on for one year, resulting in a weekly cut in their income of &euro;45.  Is this the way we should be treating people who have worked for a lifetime in the State?  It speaks to the constant theme of contempt of the Government for trade unions, working people, employment rights and so on.  We need to debate this matter.  It is not fair or proper that workers, on reaching the age of 66 years, should be forced to sign on for one year and take a cut of &euro;45 per week in comparison to their pension payment.  These changes have been proposed, but there has been no proper debate about them.  I want to hear what Members on each side of the Chamber have to say aobut the proposed increase in the retirement age.  Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to this measure.  We call on the Government to leave the retirement age at 66 years.  Let us have a proper debate on to fund social services and pensions.  I would welcome the opportunity to debates on both matters.</p></speech>

The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations are to be referred without debate to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  While I do not propose an amendment to the Order of Business, I ask the Leader to provide an opportunity at some point to debate policy on the horse and greyhound racing fund, a substantial and guaranteed fund of &euro;55 million per annum.  Approximately &euro;80 million was allocated for the fund last year.  It is a huge subsidy that, legally, is automatically built in every year.  We need to debate if it is the best use of public funds.  In previous debates following calls for support on key issues, including animal welfare and social welfare payments, we were asked to point to areas in which changes could be made.  This is one area in which we may need to make changes.  We need to consider if it is the best use of public resources and whether it should be reviewed and revised.  While I am happy to support the proposal that the motion be referred to the joint committee without debate, I ask that when it is returned to the Seanad, or perhaps in advance of the taking of the Finance Bill 2019, we be given an opportunity to debate it.</p> <p>I also ask the to Leader schedule a debate on the issue of child homelessness.  The number of children experiencing homelessness now stands at 4,000.  Last week two reports on the issue were published, namely, the report on family and child homelessness by the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and the report on the impact of homelessness on children by the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  The joint launching of the reports was unprecedented.  This shows that the issue is emerging as a source of massive concern and that homelessness is affecting, in particular, the next generation and their opportunities.  The model in place is creating intergenerational poverty and inequality.  We need to address the issue.  I would, therefore, welcome an opportunity to debate both reports and, in particular, child homelessness.  The reports acknowledge the long-lasting detrimental effects of homelessness on children which extend into their adult lives.  They also contain a number of recommendations.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to come to the House to debate these issues as a matter of urgency?</p> <p>I have just returned from the 25th International Conference on Population and Development, ICPD, which was held in Nairobi.  It was an incredible summit which brought together 9,000 activists working on women's health and women's rights across the world.  The issues discussed include child marriage, female genital mutilation, maternal mortality, access to contraception and health clinics.</p></speech>

It is extraordinary to me that population is very rarely mentioned at such things.  It is a subject about which I have been talking for many years and I wish people would take it seriously.</p> <p>Unlike Senator Craughwell, I am not greatly concerned by the torturous progress of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill through this House.  I have rather enjoyed it.  I think we have done quite a good job on the Bill and have provided the Government with an opportunity to produce no less than eight pages of its own amendments.  The Seanad has played a very useful role there.</p> <p>I raise a situation that has been brought to my attention.  A gentleman contacted me who was an elder of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.  After the passage of the marriage equality legislation, he married his partner.  This was subsequently discovered and anonymous communications were sent to the Presbyterian Church, enclosing a copy of his marriage certificate, photographs from social media of him with his new family, enjoying himself on holiday and so on.  A commission was then established.  The identity of the accuser was never made clear and this gentleman has now been deposed from his position as an elder of the Presbyterian Church.  It seems extraordinary to me.  I wonder where marriage equality has got us on this one.  I understand that churches are exempt from some of these operations but it is great pity.  It is extraordinary to me and I wanted to register a protest on this matter. </p></speech>

We are heading into the Christmas season.  It is extraordinary how Christmas comes around earlier and earlier.  One of these days, it will start before the Listowel races in September with the way it is going.  I wish to remind people around the country about the importance of shopping locally at a time when so much money will be spent.  I am not saying that I am opposed to online shopping; we live in the real world.  People from the country like to have their big days out in Dublin, Cork or wherever they go.  I was in the drapery trade for many years, however, and we all know that Christmas shopping is the lifeblood of the small or medium retailer.  Such retailers need a good Christmas to get through the year.  I would like to uphold the good service that people are accustomed to getting in their own towns from long-established firms such as mine used to be.  People should shop locally and be patriotic.  We need jobs in small towns.  We are trying to regenerate rural Ireland.  This is time for people to put their hands in their pockets and support local industry.  They will get value and service.</p> <p>On a more serious note, we had an important event in the D&aacute;il last week when all the young people gathered and had a wonderful debate on climate change and so on.  It was great to see young people having an interest in politics, which I have always encouraged.  Now I am not so sure.  I am not a child and I know that politics was never the boy scouts.  I do not want to be too po-faced about it since we have to have the cut and thrust.  I am personally becoming alarmed, however, at the standards that obtain at present in politics in Ireland.  I do not point a finger at any single individual or party.  It is quite the opposite but I think a race to the bottom has been going on in these Houses in recent months, as well as in comments in the media, from all parties and addressed against all parties.  It is suddenly no longer about policy or the economy but seems to be about what one did or said, or what one can be caught doing.  I dread what will happen between now and when the election is called in May or whenever, if we spend all the time trawling and digging and having our officers and backroom staff at that kind of game.</p></speech>

We are all decent people.  I have met very few people in politics who I do not like or admire.  They are all doing a hard, thankless job.  People think we are well-paid and so on but they do not look at the work rate that is involved.  Why are we, as politicians, attacking each other on small personal issues which, though important in their own way, are relatively trivial in the overall scheme of things?  I encourage Members, for the remainder of the by-elections and going into the next general election, to get on with the business of real politics and to stop going back to such mudslinging.  Are we picking up the American example?  No one knows what is news, fake news or bad news.  I am not a holier than thou fellow.  I have played a few good tricks and pulled a few good strokes in my time.  There is no denying that and I would not be here if I did not.</p></speech>

The trivialisation and denigration of politics that flows from personalised attacks on individuals is damaging and corrosive of the whole legislative process and the democratic process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People may have made mistakes in the past and do stupid things; as far as I am concerned, they do stupid things every day on social media.  I really think we should lift our eyes from the trivia and deal with the important issues.<br/><br/>I second Senator Craughwell's proposed amendment to the Order of Business.<br/><br/>Will the Leader ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House to have a discussion with us on the State's attitude to the Palestinian settlements, especially in the light of what Secretary of State Pompeo has announced as America's position, namely, that contrary to all rubrics of international law, America is taking an exceptionalist and unilateral position that the settlements are not unlawful.  Of course, America can do what it likes in some respects and can state what it does or does not consider to be unlawful.  However, if there is to be complete demolition of the concept of international law rules, if the idea of occupation and settlement of territory seized in war and expulsion of the people in it is to be legitimised and regarded <i>de facto</i>with impunity as a state of affairs, that is a serious matter, on which Ireland should take a stand.  The T&aacute;naiste should come to the House to explain to us where Ireland really stands on it and whether it has the guts to state twe object strongly to this d&eacute;marche by the Americans.<br/><br/>I want to add one footnote, without naming the writer.  In the last week a letter writer to <i>The Irish Times</i>who is probably known to most Members of this House wrote to the effect that the rendering illegal of settlement goods produced in the Occupied Territories was of a piece with requiring Israelis, if they came to Ireland, to wear the Star of David.  That is deeply offensive to those of us who supported the Bill, who strongly support the right of the state of Israel to exist and who agree with the many people in Israel who oppose the occupation of the Palestinian territories.  It is deeply offensive for a former Member of the Houses to equate support for the Bill with a mentality that would ask Israelis to wear the Star of David in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is the biggest investment in rural Ireland and every farm, home, business and school will be connected.  It is due to start in eight weeks' time.  Rural Ireland will not be left behind and the Government has made a significant gesture to help it to get on its feet.  Some 90% of businesses and houses in the State will be covered by the plan.  This is a great day for rural Ireland.  People can complain all they want about the cost of the plan and so on, but it is an investment in from where I come and every business, school and farmhouse will be connected.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the air ambulance service.  I remind people that in 2011 there was no air ambulance in the country.  The emergency department in Roscommon was downgraded.  Fine Gael in government, with the Labour Party, put an air ambulance service in place in Athlone.  The Ministers involved were former Deputy Alan Shatter and Senator James Reilly.  I was also involved.  Hundreds of lives have been saved as a result.  As I said, there was no air ambulance in the country, except for the Irish Coast Guard helicopters.  Yes, there are issues that need to be addressed.  Use of the Irish Coast Guard is one option and the air ambulance service in Cork another, but the position is not ideal.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frank Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to work together.

I am not sure what the reason is but the My World 2 survey, carried out by UCD in conjunction with Jigsaw, tried to build up a picture of our youth and their mental health and well-being.  It recently conducted this survey of almost 20,000 young people between 12 and 25 years of age.  Under 25 years of age is the peak time for the onset of mental health issues.  This was the largest survey of its kind, and the number of people suffering from anxiety has doubled since the last survey in 2012.  Some 22% report severe and very severe anxiety in the 12 to 19 age bracket, and 26% report the same in the 18 to 25 age bracket, with females most likely to suffer.  All described being overwhelmed with fear and panic.</p> <p>I would like the Minister of State to address two specific issues regarding services for our young people.  There is a by-election in Wexford and the paucity of mental health services there is proving to be a key issue.  They have had no child psychiatrists and no child psychologists for the past 18 months except on a Saturday, for which one needs to make an appointment, because all the other staff have resigned.  The day services in Linn Dara closed last summer.  I was promised, and I have a letter to prove it, that it would be opened in September or in October at the latest but lo and behold, there is not a peep or a word about it.  All those places are lost to our young children.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, could come into the House to answer some questions.</p></speech>

The scheme itself had been shut since 2015.  Some 225 farmers and growers applied for the scheme last November.  They did not take this decision lightly.  They thought long and hard about it.  They did the prerequisite organic courses, paid organic certification membership fees and many hired advisers to do this.</p> <p>Almost a year through the two-year conversion process, having spent much money and time on this conversion, whether it was buying organic seed or converting farm buildings, 175 of them found out in the last week or so that their applications had been unsuccessful.  This is totally unacceptable.  I believe only one out of 50 successful applications was actually in horticulture.</p> <p>I do not know what sort of message this sends out.  We are in the midst of a climate and biodiversity emergency.  We have rising emissions from the agriculture sector and farmers are lining up and crying out for nature-friendly opportunities across all farming enterprises.  This Government has effectively starved the organic sector of funding, so much so that Ireland wallows at the bottom of the European Union table for land being farmed organically, at around 2%, whereas the European Union average is closer to 7% and more progressive countries are up at around 20%.</p> <p>Organic farming is well known for its benefits for biodiversity, water quality and so forth.  It lowers emissions and it also increases farm income.  What is not to like about it?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pippa Hackett:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=0000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government likes to talk the talk, but its actions speak louder than words.  The organic sector deserves better and Irish consumers deserve better.  We import vast quantities of organic produce, much of which could be produced here thereby supporting Irish farmers and creating Irish jobs.  However, the Government would rather use our hard-earned taxpayers' money to support big agribusiness at the expense of many of our farming families and our environment.</p><p>I call on the Leader to urge the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, to direct their Department to review and reassess these applications and do what they can to facilitate these progressive farmers who are looking to improve their farms and farm incomes while at the same time benefiting our challenged and damaged environment.</p></speech>

As we are all aware, it is a very important service and saves many lives.  Earlier this afternoon, Senator McFadden raised this directly with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  It is very disappointing that a community rapid-response charity helicopter would be required to fill the gap of what should be a fundamental service provided by the State.  Obviously, it is positive that the second helicopter will be based in Roscommon.  However, at a wider scale, it is a fundamental service which has saved many lives and has the potential to save many more.  It should be fully provided by the State.</p> <p>As the Minister of State said this afternoon, there are difficulties with staffing.  He referred to the recommissioning of former Air Corps pilots, the reintroduction of the service commitment scheme for pilots and the training of junior pilots.  This crucial service should be provided by the State.</p> <p>The road ambulance service has particular challenges and black spots.  While there have been some positive developments with the Loughglynn ambulance base operating on a five-days-a-week and two-nights-a-week basis, we were told it would operate on a 24-hour basis for seven days per week, but that has not happened.  We need to ensure we support people to get to a centre of excellence or hospital as needs be as quickly as possible.  We need to ensure our road ambulance service functions fully.  I specifically mention Loughglynn as an example where we have not got it on a 24-hour basis for seven days per week.</p> <p>We have difficulties now with the air ambulance service.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, reiterated and emphasised to Senator McFadden this afternoon that it will continue to be based in Athlone, but there are issues with the staffing of that service.  We also have issues with our road ambulance service.  We certainly need a debate in the House because both of those services are fundamental to saving people's lives and reducing disability.</p></speech>

I had many disagreements over the policies Mary Harney implemented, but the development of certain centres of excellence in cancer treatment has saved many thousands of lives.  However, we need the services to ensure people can get to those centres of excellence quickly, safely and on time to get a good outcome.  We should ensure that for all our citizens.</p> <p>I wish to speak about funding of local government.  It has again become a serious issue for the capital city.  Dublin City Council failed to pass a budget last night.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One of the many problems in regard to the funding of local government is the commitment that was given that the transfer to Irish Water would be revenue neutral, and we now find it is not.  This happens over and over again in regard to local authorities, especially within the Dublin area.  I sometimes wonder what Fine Gael has against Dublin or what Dublin has done to Fine Gael to be treated in such a manner.  We see the same thing in regard to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, where there was a commitment that it would not be a drag on the local authority.  We now see it is a drag, with the loss of services which other Senators have raised in regard to the cost of support for the harbour.</p><p>There is a big, crying issue in regard to the funding of local authorities.  It does not matter what political party anyone comes from but, at this time of the year, as the councils are passing their budgets, we see clearly the difficulties and, in many ways, the contradictions.  For example, councillors vote for a decrease in the property tax and are prepared to vote for an increase in social housing rents.</p><p>I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business calling on the Minister to attend today to discuss in detail the funding of local government.  Local government is the bedrock of Irish democracy and it is the closest interface with the citizens.  It is not right that councillors should be put in this position due to decisions that are made by the Government.  They were given a clear commitment that the transfer of Irish Water would be revenue neutral but it is not.  I formally move that amendment.</p></speech>

To be fair, right across this House, among Senators on all sides, there is a desire to have the report published so we can have a discussion on what is in it.  I read the Leader's response last week and he said it should be published, and rightly so.  We need the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to come to the House.  I was talking to Councillor Joe Malone from Kilkenny, who is in the Visitors Gallery and is very welcome.  The Minister of State, who is from Councillor Malone's constituency, has responsibility for local government.  There is anxiety throughout the country to get this report published, for good or for bad, whatever is in it.  I do not think it is going to contain what most people want, and I say this as somebody who was lucky to be on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for 12 and a half years.  I identify with the issues Senator Humphreys and other Senators have raised in regard to local government.  I could talk about the property tax all day but I will not as I will do that on another day.</p> <p>On the Moorhead report, people need to appreciate that councillors in 2008, 2009 and 2010 took hits.  They took a class of PRSI they had never paid before, a 4% super-tax that has been somewhat dealt with in terms of the class S measure, a USC charge of 5.5% and a cut of 25% in their travel and subsistence.  This was all taken at the time and most of it was not really reinstated in any meaningful way.  Many of us have been councillors in the past and we know councillors work extremely hard, with long hours on top of trying to have family balance, work-life balance, hold down a career and so on.  A huge amount of time is put in.  Let us have a look at this report.  It was promised 21 months ago and there was an interim report last Christmas.  Although I will not put down an amendment to the Order of Business without talking to the Leader, we need the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, or the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to come to the House to tell us what is holding it up and when it is going to be published.  The Leader is nodding and I thank him for that.  Let us get a date for when it will be published or a reason it cannot be published.</p></speech>

Previously, schools were given an option of 40% of the marks being allocated to an oral exam.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, is very enthusiastic about oral exams because he made a significant effort to learn oral Irish when he became Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I ask the Leader to ask him to come before the House to discuss this matter.  If we are to encourage Irish as an oral language, we should do so in schools.  If we do not, it will be back to prose and rote learning.  There is a question in the sample exam paper regarding a film entitled "A Star is Born".

There is a crisis in that regard.  The issues in Dublin City Council became clear last night.  It has a shortfall of &euro;80 million.  Several councillors on Waterford City and County Council contacted me today regarding the cost-neutral or benefit-neutral situation in respect of the assets of Irish Water and its rates liabilities.  They were of the understanding that the Government would sort this out but it has not been resolved.  This is a recurring theme across the country.  I have been specifically asked by Waterford councillors who contacted my office to raise the matter with the Leader.</p> <p>On an issue that is closer to home for the Leader, I spoke to four councillors who moved from Cork County Council to Cork City Council regarding their remuneration or, shall we say, their gratuity package and who is liable to pay for it.  I spoke to officials in the Department to seek clarification.  The issue of who is liable to pay these gratuities is of concern to the Department and the Minister.  The four councillors, three of whom are aged over 50, are concerned about their gratuity.  Two of them are Fine Gael councillors, one is a Fianna F&aacute;il councillor and one is an Independent.  This issue needs to be considered.  I am not necessarily asking the Leader to bring the Minister to the House to discuss it.  Does the Leader wish to say something?</p></speech>

The US is demonstrating yet again that it is determined to rip up decades of carefully developed international law and human rights protections.  It is frightening, not because of some obscure legal argument but because it paves the way for formal annexation of the West Bank and for immense suffering on the ground.  The Geneva Convention is absolutely clear that transferring civilians to occupied territory seized during war is illegal.  It is a war crime, under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and there is overwhelming international legal consensus on this point.  It has been reaffirmed time and again by the UN, the EU, the International Court of Justice and the Government.  In Europe, we need to recognise that we are at a crossroads.  If we maintain the policy of the past decades, which is essentially to criticise the Israeli occupation but support it financially, we will facilitate annexation.  We have been copying and pasting the same statement of concern for years.  If we carry on down this path, we will drive past the last exit on the road to annexation and the possibility of an independent Palestinian state will be gone.  We will not be able to say we did not see it coming.  Last year, I tabled the Occupied Territories Bill so that we could take a meaningful, peaceful, concrete step against this process and the settlements.  We famously stood up and offered leadership on apartheid South Africa in the 1980s and I call on the Government to show some bravery and do the same in this regard.  We can pass this Bill tomorrow with its support.  I call on the Government to drop the pretence of legal opposition to the Bill and listen to the UN human rights rapporteur, Michael Lynk, who just last month urged the international community to end its financial support for the illegal settlements and ban the import of settlement goods.  I urge the Government to read the letter published in <i>The Guardian</i>this week from a group of eminent Israeli citizens, including former ambassadors, attorneys general, speakers of the parliament and recipients of the Israel Prize.  They say:</p><blockquote>We believe that the occupation is morally corrosive, strategically shortsighted, and thoroughly detrimental to peace. The international community has taken insufficient action in addressing this reality. Europe continues to support the occupation financially by allowing trade with Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.  . . . <br /><br />As Israelis who care about the future of our country, we ask the European Union to ban the import of settlement goods in order to support a just future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.</blockquote> <p>This Government needs to realise that the<i>status quo</i>has not worked and it will only lead to annexation.  It has a choice to make; it can take meaningful action or it can let the Pompeos of this world have their way. </p></speech>

E. Ahmad Abdelrazek.  He is retiring after six years of service in Ireland and 46 years' service to Palestine's diplomatic efforts around the world.  This is a most important week for the Palestinian people, given the further devastation and injustice inflicted on them, not only by the remarks of the US Administration but by further violence from Israel.  It is now crucially important that we pass the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill through the Oireachtas.  Ireland must also use its place in the EU to stand up for justice and international law.</p> <p>The Finucane family have campaigned for truth and justice regarding the murder of their husband and father, Pat, for 30 years.  They have gained international renown for their dignity and grace in the face of constant obstacles and barriers.  They have support from across the political spectrum in these Houses, as well as the support of the Government in securing an inquiry into the murder of human rights lawyer, Pat Finucane.  His son, John Finucane, is our first citizen in Belfast and he has been a fantastic example of the Good Friday Agreement generation.  Despite being a victim of the conflict himself, he has shone as a beacon for a new Belfast and a new society that is peaceful, cohesive, and respectful.  I do not expect colleagues to involve themselves in party political cheerleading for John or for our party, but it would be remiss of us not to stand firmly against the toxic, sectarian and vile campaign being led against him, not only in the constituency of North Belfast where he is seeking election, but throughout the Six Counties.  As people who value the democratic and electoral process, and who think it a good thing that people put their names forward for election to represent the people, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that a clear message goes out from both these Houses and the Government that we continue to stand in solidarity with John and his family.  We must stand with them and face down anyone who seeks to attack and retraumatise the Finucane family or broader victims across our society in the North, regardless of from where it is coming or at whom it is directed.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that a clear message goes out of solidarity and support for John, his family, and by extension, the democratic and electoral process.</p></speech>

I encourage all Members to reach out to their various communities, including refugees, direct provision centres, and asylum seekers.  This programme aims to engage, protect, empower and create a more inclusive community, and ensure that our communities can benefit from people who come here seeking our assistance, support and sanctuary.  Such people will ultimately enhance, enrich, empower and create a better Ireland, community and people.  As time goes on, our young people will, hopefully, benefit from the wisdom and experiences of the new Irish who come here and who are welcomed by the vast majority of people.</p> <p>We will have a debate about RT&Eacute; later, which is welcome as it has a significant role to play in public service broadcasting in this country.  There are many strands to RT&Eacute; such as Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, TG4, and Lyric FM.  It was great to meet staff from Lyric FM, who made the station great in Limerick, in the audiovisual room earlier.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are aware that this debate is taking place.  There has to be a recalibration of the mindset within RT&Eacute; about the importance of the arts and culture to this country.  There are thousands of citizens, unwittingly or for whatever reason, who have not got a television licence.  People nowadays move houses many times and end up finding themselves without a television licence.  There should be some sort of an incentive for people to actually get into the system such as a discount for people taking out a television licence for the first time.  This would involve many thousands of people and would generate a significant amount of money for RT&Eacute;.  It would bring people into the television licence realm until such time as we see proper and decent reform of funding of public service broadcasting.</p></speech>

This is a significant point in the context of the important debates we must continue to have about migration.  This particular initiative goes back to 2015 when the Government established the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  It is important we get local communities engaging with refugees, welcoming them into communities in practical ways such as receiving them when they first come to the country and assisting them with all that is necessary in connection with settling down and thriving in Ireland.  I commend the work of that programme and urge communities to get involved.</p> <p>The closure of the Cuisle holiday centre in Donamon, County Roscommon, has been a decision of the Irish Wheelchair Association which has invoked a passionate and critical response from service users and their families.  My colleague, Senator Hopkins, has raised this issue eloquently, as have others.  The consensus among many observers, including the Taoiseach, is that this decision is regrettable.  Indeed, the Taoiseach conceded the decision will have a negative impact on the economy in the region, as well as everything else, because 48 jobs will be lost at the centre.</p> <p>I welcome and commend the Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, Deputy Harty, for inviting the Irish Wheelchair Association to a meeting to give a comprehensive account of its actions in this matter.  I hope to participate in that meeting.  There appears to have been no genuine or meaningful engagement with service users prior to the shock announcement of the centre&rsquo;s closure.  Many of those who protested outside the gates of Leinster House last week felt utterly betrayed by the Irish Wheelchair Association.  They also felt shut out of the decision-making process by an organisation which supposedly has been representing their concerns.</p> <p>Only last July, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, assured the other House that the provision of respite services, to enhance cost efficiency and continuous quality improvement, including those at Cuisle, would continue to be provided and that all this would be done in consultation with all the families of people with disabilities.  Here we are, however, four months later and the service at Cuisle is being dismantled against fierce local and national opposition.  The Irish Wheelchair Association claims its rationale is consistent with the policy trajectory in the HSE document, Time to Move on from Congregated Settings, A Strategy for Community Inclusion.  Who are the real beneficiaries, however?  What has happened under the heading of consolidating a healthcare service is affecting inappropriately what is in fact a holiday facility for people.  It seems to have been done in a top-down way without consultation.  We need to continue to keep the pressure on about this issue.  We should certainly take an interest in what will happen at the health committee.</p></speech>

I talk to colleagues on all sides of this House, who are in total agreement that our councillors should be paid properly for the work they do on our behalf.  They are at the coalface of our democracy.  I know the Leader is totally approachable with regard to this matter but I would impress upon him the need for the Moorhead report to be published as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>I endorse what Senator Craughwell said about helicopter and emergency services provided by the Defence Forces and the unfortunate difficulties in which they find themselves.  I know Senator McFadden agrees that there needs to be an urgent review of the pay and conditions of the Defence Forces.  The reality is that morale is at an all-time low.  While I acknowledge that the Government is attempting to do something to rectify the situation, unfortunately, it is not enough.  While I support Senator Craughwell's call for the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to come to the House, the situation is urgent enough to require the attendance of the Taoiseach, who is the Minister for Defence.  I am aware that unlike a lot of previous taoisigh, he has attended this House on two occasions, which I welcome.  The last time the Taoiseach was here was April 2019 but it is important that he comes to the House before the end of the year to address both the difficulties within our Defence Forces and the difficulties relating to topics like health, social welfare, employment and councillors' pay and conditions, issues about which a number of other Senators have concerns.  Let us hear at first hand what he has to say about all these matters.  I ask Senator Craughwell to allow the Leader some time to seek the attendance of the Taoiseach in this House to address those issues, primarily the Defence Forces.  He is the Minister for Defence and has ultimate responsibility for that portfolio and I would like to see him in attendance in this House before the end of the year.  </p></speech>

I do not have the full information regarding the tragic events that took place in Lucan last night but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a full investigation.  I assure Senator Ardagh that the Government is committed to resourcing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle any form of criminality and crime.  I remind her that this is why &euro;1.76 billion was allocated to the Garda Vote, with an increase to &euro;1.82 billion in 2020.  This is why the Government increased capital investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the tune of &euro;92 million and why we reopened the Garda college in Templemore and are hiring more garda&iacute;.

I remind Senator Craughwell that this service was not in place before Fine Gael came into government in 2011.

The Minister of State will be available to come to the House to deal with this matter.  If that is not suitable to the Senator, I am prepared to sit down with the Senator afterwards to work out a day that is suitable to him, if Thursday does not suit.  We can have a debate on the Defence Forces issue, which Senator Wilson spoke about as well.</p> <p>Senator Gavan raised the important issue of community employment scheme supervisors.  It is a very contentious issue that has been ongoing for over a decade and is the subject of a Labour Court recommendation.  It is important to point out again that the employees are those of private organisations or companies, albeit in the community and voluntary sector that receives State fund.  Furthermore, the Minister for Finance has a number of occasions answered parliamentary questions in the Lower House on the matter and on the cost of between &euro;188 million to &euro;347 million.  There no agreement on this payment.  I will be happy for the Minister come to the House again to debate the matter.  There might be a more expeditious approach for Senator Gavan.  I appreciate where the Senator is coming from.  Community employment schemes and supervisors play a huge role in our community and voluntary sector and all our communities benefit from their input, involvement and engagement.  I will be happy to have a debate on the retirement age as well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=19"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Higgins referred to a number of issues.

We see so many churchmen, including Bishop Colton in Cork, who are leaders when it comes to inclusivity and equality and welcoming diversity.  For the church to take that view is disappointing.</p> <p>Senators O'Sullivan and McDowell raised the issue of standards in politics.  We all have an obligation and a duty when it comes to how we carry ourselves and understanding the import of our remarks.  Speaking as somebody who enjoys the cut and thrust of politics, it is important that we understand this.  The remarks of Senator O'Sullivan are pertinent in that regard.  Equally, as politicians, we have an obligation to understand we have very broad duties when it comes to how we engage with the people and the media, irrespective of whether we give false briefings to the media or false impressions on certain matters.  As Senator O'Sullivan said, politics is a noble profession.  All of us in this Chamber serve with one intent - to do good to make our society and the country better.  At least, I hope that is what we are all trying to achieve.  The Senator makes an important remark, that people who engage should understand the ramifications of what they do.  I agree with him in his point that trawling through what has been said by all Members of both Houses, those in parties and none, does not serve the body politic well.  I hope to come back to this issue at a later time.</p> <p>Senators McDowell and Black referred to the position taken by the United States as announced by Secretary of State Pompeo and the T&aacute;naiste's remarks.  The T&aacute;naiste has made it clear that we stand with the European Union on the matter and that there has been no change in the Irish position.  We all stand with the European Union in its opposition to what Secretary of State Pompeo and President Trump are doing.</p></speech>

A Commencement matter might be a more expeditious way of getting a response.</p><p>Senator Humphreys raised the matter of local government.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, are not available today but I would be happy to ask them to come to the House next Tuesday for a debate on local government.  </p><p>Senators Horkan, Boyhan and Wilson raised the issue of the Moorhead report.  There is an obligation on Government to publish that report.  All of us accept the importance of local government and the enormous contribution that our elected local government members play in the functioning of local government, the growth in their workload and the increased pressure on all members of local government.  There will be no shying away from that on this side of the House.  I have asked the Minister to set aside a date in his diary for a debate.  I have not yet had a response in regard to the publication of the Moorhead report.  It is an important debate that we need to have.</p><p>Senator Boyhan raised the specific issue of members of Cork County Council who now are members of Cork City Council.  The matter he raised is an important one but it is not one that I believe should be raised on the floor of this Chamber.  I am aware of the situation, as Senator Boyhan will know.  I hope the Senator will agree with me that there is an obligation on Cork County Council to respond to the members not named by the Senator but referred to in terms of the number of people involved.  There is an impasse between the Department and Cork County Council.  It is unacceptable that elected members are caught up in this impasse and are being torn between two particular arms of local government, be that the Department or County Hall.  I call on the Minister to direct Cork County Council to engage.  The impasse is unacceptable.  Many of the members in question have given decades of service to their constituents and local government and they have enhanced local government in the city and county of Cork.  </p><p>Senator Lawlor made reference to the issue of the Irish language in the junior certificate curriculum.  The trial sample paper published was agreed by a variety of bodies.  We have seen a more organic view being taken of Irish in terms of its usage in the oral part of the examination and class-based assessment.  Earlier, we were joking about Peig Sayers.  We have moved a long way from the days of Peig to a more grounded version of Irish being taught, where the emphasis is on comhr&aacute; - conversation - and the spoken language.  It is important that we get this right.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House for a debate on the matter.</p></speech>

We all agree on the need for justice for the Finucane family in regard to the death of Pat.  The Senator also spoke about the electoral contest in the North of our country.  Similar to the remarks expressed by Senator O'Sullivan around the body politic, those who engage in electioneering, regardless of their colour or hue, should remember that what we say and do and how we carry on during election campaigns matters.</p></speech>
