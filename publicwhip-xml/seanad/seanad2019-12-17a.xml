I did expect the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to attend but I know she is busy and there is a Cabinet meeting.  One of the reasons I want to single her out is that I want to acknowledge her.  I know that she is not here but I want to put on the public record her outstanding service and her Department.  I can honestly tell Members that of all of my time in my three years here there is no Minister who has followed up diligently on every piece of correspondence or representation that I have made and I have personally received a response from her.  Not only have I had a response but it has been personally signed off by her.  Her attention to detail is extraordinary, which is worth putting on the record of the House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> In many ways that goes back to the team she leads.  I do not know if she is a hard taskmaster, but she is a good one.  From my knowledge, from feedback from the Minister, her staff and her officials and from the many representations that I make on behalf of city and county councillors across this country, I have found her to be excellent.  I wanted to say that to her today but she is not here, so perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, might convey that to her.  I genuinely believe that we should acknowledge people who excel in their work in public service, and she does.</p><p>I thank the Department, in particular for the level of public engagement.  I am mindful of the social welfare Christmas and new year payments as well as publications.  It is constant and it is important to acknowledge the quality of the work and the information that goes out.  This was in our paper today.  I want to thank the Minister in the Minister of State's Department for the increase in the number of carers who will have the opportunity to train from 1 January 2020.  It is a few additional hours.  It is not a lot but it is going in the right direction.  I understand that there are always demands on public finances, public funds and public support.</p><p>I raise the issue of carers in crisis - the carers in our community.  They are mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and loved ones who support close family members with a disability in the homeplace or in the community or elderly parents and friends.  The Minister of State has spoken time and again in this House about the importance of keeping people in their homes and in their communities, where practical and possible.  What better place, what nicer place and what more comfortable place to be supported when one is ill, has a disability or in need of support than in one's community.  I hope that focus is not lost.  I accept that funding is always a difficulty, but the priority has to be on how we can put and increase resources in homes and in our communities to support vulnerable people.</p><p>The real purpose of raising this today was to thank the Minister, Deputy Doherty, on doing a difficult job well but, more importantly, to ask her to keep the focus on what she intends to do to increase support.  I do not necessarily expect the Minister of State to read the reply into the record but I would be very happy if he passed on this message.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-12-17a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019121700002#C00300"><p>I would like to thank Senator Boyhan for raising the matter.  Family carers play a crucial role in the provision of care at home to elderly, disabled, and ill loved ones.  The Government is committed to support carers in their caring role, and alleviate the financial burden of caring through a range of healthcare and income supports.  The National Carers' Strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to the challenges faced by family carers, and sets out the strategic direction for future policies, services, and supports provided by Government Departments and agencies for carers.  The strategy is designed around a core vision which recognises and respects carers as key care partners who are supported to maintain their own health and well-being, care with confidence, and empowered to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.</p> <p>The Government has increased expenditure on carers allowance, carers benefit, carers support grant, and all ancillary care allowances by 20% since 2016.  These payments offer an important source of income support for those caring for a family member due to old age or disability.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection expects that spending on these payments in 2019 will amount to more than &euro;1.2 billion.</p> <p>In budget 2020 an increase in homecare credit was announced, raising the credit from &euro;100 to &euro;1,600.  In addition, the number of hours that carers can work or study outside the home is being increased from 15 hours to 18.5 hours per week with effect from January 2020.  More than 1,200 carers are expected to benefit from this change at a cost of &euro;11.6 million.</p> <p>Identifying carers and their needs as early as possible is of critical importance if they are to be supported in their caring role.  The Department of Health has secured funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund for a pilot of the carers needs assessment tool, which will be progressed next year.  The tool will be a key step in helping to identify carers at all stages and will also play a role in identifying the supports required.  Funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund has also been secured for information and training support for family carers, which assists carers to provide the best care possible to the care recipient, reduce the risk of injury to the carer and care recipient, and help family carers cope with the emotional and psychological aspects of their role.  Funding has also been made available to provide for the dissemination of resource information for family carers, the development of support networks, and support groups to assist with the transition back into social and economic life at the end of the caring role and measures that assist in promoting carer self-identification.</p> <p>Supports for the cared-for person are also vital in many ways.  The needs of the carer are interlinked with the cared-for person.  Budget 2020 allocated additional funding for disability services, including supports for school leavers, autism services, emergency residency protocols and respite.  The total disability service budget will exceed &euro;2 billion in 2020.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Department of Health has committed to an additional investment of &euro;52 million in budget 2020 for older persons to bring the total funding for home supports to &euro;487 million, providing 777,000 more home support hours than the 2019 target.</p><p>The increased investment in the benefits and supports for family carers I have outlined reflect the Government's serious commitment to looking after people who spend their time caring for others and maintaining the level of supports available.</p><p>I assure the Senator that I will do justice to his sincere and genuine comments by conveying them back to the Minister.  I know she will appreciate them.  I agree with the Senator; any positive examples of good practice should always be acknowledged, highlighted and recognised as such as a reminder to everybody else.</p></speech>

This Commencement matter follows on from an issue I raised last week in the health committee with the Minister for Health and the HSE.  It came to my notice that 15 beds in St. John's Hospital in Limerick were not in use for the past three months, which is unacceptable.  I will qualify that by saying I fully understand the considerable difficulties faced by staff, including consultants, other medical staff and administrative staff, throughout the hospital but more particularly in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, in managing a situation whereby we are playing catch-up with reconfiguration.  The 24-hour emergency departments, EDs, at Ennis Hospital, Nenagh Hospital and St. John's Hospital were closed, and 138 co-location beds were supposed to be built on the grounds of UHL before the reconfiguration went through.  It should not have gone through.  We are playing catch-up.  What we now need is the 60-bed block under construction on the site of UHL.  A 96-bed block will go into the planning phase early in the new year.  This will provide more than 150 beds.  That will take time.  The 60 beds will be in place by next September, but we must all work together.  No one, management or anyone else, told me these 15 beds were idle and not in use.  Two long-standing consultants retired in St. John's Hospital over the past year.  If we are operating in the dark and we do not know what is happening within the hospital group, it is impossible for someone like me, a public representative in Limerick, to assist fully at national level.  If I were aware that 15 beds, for whatever lack of resources, could not be opened, I would have been at the desks of the Minister and the Minister of State and would have beaten down the door to get the funding in place.  I will put Limerick ahead of everything else but I did not know about this.</p> <p>I am glad funding is being provided under the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to open the beds in St. John's.  I want them open quickly.  Furthermore, I want a comprehensive bed management plan put in place to ensure the beds are put to maximum use in UHL, St. John's, Ennis, Nenagh and Croom.  It is important that everyone works together on this.  This is not in any way a criticism on my part of anything to do with the medical profession - the consultants, the nurses or anyone else.  I want to help but I do not know what the position in the hospitals is.  There are 15 beds not in use.  Why was this the case?  How can I assist?  I want to know now whether a comprehensive bed management plan is in place to provide the resources.  If the university hospital group needs resources, the Department should ask for them and tell us it has done so.  Funding for the second MRI scanner was provided when asked for, but when I asked for i tat the health committee, there were 15 beds at the same time not in use in St. John's.  I did not know that at the time.  If I had, I would have looked for funding there as well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The situation with the 15 beds does not concern me if they are not open but the Minister of State should tell me what is required to be done in terms of resources.  I will go to the appropriate Minister and the Government to fight for those resources for Limerick.  There has been a major capacity crisis in Limerick for a number of years.</p><p>I would like to see an audit of the nursing home beds in Limerick and its regions to ensure they are put to most efficient use.  If funding is required, it should be provided.  Funding will come through the NTPF for an additional ten nursing beds.  That has been approved.  The minor injury clinics in Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's Hospitals must have longer opening hours and we need to see the second MRI scanner for Limerick hospital in operation straight away.  We all need to work together to ensure we deal with the crisis facing patients in Limerick.  That includes Ministers, management in the hospital group, consultants, nurses and administrators.  I will take whatever criticism put at our door but I am there to help.  If I do not know beds are unoccupied, how in the name of God can I help?</p><p>Have detailed discussions taken place to ensure there is a comprehensive bed management strategy in place and we can all work together, including medical, ministerial, administrative and management staff?  We must ensure we can get through this crisis and get the 150 extra beds that should have been put in place.</p></speech>

The number of patients attending EDs continues to increase year on year.  For the first 11 months of 2019, the number of patients attending hospital EDs increased by 2.5%, and the number of admissions increased by 0.7% when compared with the same period last year.</p> <p>According to HSE TrolleyGAR data, there was a 14.5% increase in the number of patients waiting on trolleys in UHL emergency department this year up to the end of November 2019 when compared to the same period last year.  It is acknowledged that this is exceptionally high and the HSE is actively working with the University of Limerick Hospitals Group to ease congestion in the hospital, with a focus on facilitating transfers to level 2 hospitals, assistance from rehabilitation units and community health organisation services, as well as prioritisation of diagnostics to aid inpatient discharges.</p> <p>The HSE winter plan was launched on Thursday, 14 November, in preparation for the anticipated increase in demand over the winter period.  The Government allocated an additional &euro;26 million to fund the implementation of the winter plan.  Each winter action team has set out a range of initiatives it will undertake within its area to implement the plan.  The integrated winter plan for University Hospital Limerick will be delivered by winter action team, WAT, 3.  The initiatives for WAT 3 include additional home support hours to facilitate early hospital to community transfers; additional aids and appliances to facilitate early hospital discharges and ED avoidance; mobile doctor service units to manage increase demand for home visits and facilitate ED avoidance; a low-level domiciliary rehab team in Limerick city to facilitate early discharge and ED avoidance; added triage nursing support in Shannondoc to support ED avoidance; an added registrar in UHL to assist in addressing workflow and improve patient experience times; and added healthcare assistants support in the hospital to provide staffing at ward level to support additional surge patients.</p> <p>The NNTPF has agreed at my request to support the marginal costs of funding additional beds for three months to the end of March 2020.  This initiative will support the commitment by the HSE and my Department to alleviate winter pressures in our hospital system.  Hospitals have been invited to make submissions to the fund to utilise this funding.  To date, the NTPF has approved in principle and subject to appropriate governance and oversight 172 additional beds.  These beds will be funded from the fund's budget at a cost of approximately &euro;4.6 million.  This includes an additional 15 beds in St. John's Hospital and ten additional nursing home beds to facilitate egress and alleviate overcrowding in UHL emergency department.</p> <p>The NTPF is currently assessing further proposals that are still being received.  In this regard, given the challenges facing the EDs with the exceptionally high use of trolleys for patients, I urge all hospital groups and individual hospitals that have not done so to engage with the NTPF to identify proposals to provide additional bed capacity for the winter period.  Furthermore, a capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at UHL, with funding of &euro;10 million allocated in 2019.  The HSE has advised that the enabling works are complete, the main contractor has commenced work and it is anticipated that the construction will be completed in mid 2020.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This important project will go some way towards addressing the acknowledged lack of bed capacity in the region.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that 15 beds are coming into use in St. John's Hospital.  They need to be up and running as quickly as possible, along with the additional nursing home beds.  If management and consultants in Limerick and the mid-west region feel there are areas where there is a need for additional funding and resources, they should let us know.  We are here to assist and work collectively as a group.  I am aware of the difficulties of working in the hospital group for consultants, the medical team and nurses in Limerick and the mid-west.  They work throughout the hospital group in UHL, Ennis, Nenagh, St. John's Hospital, Croom and the maternity hospital.</p> <p>We all must work together to ensure we do not have a situation where there are 62 people on trolleys in UHL, as happened yesterday.  It was the highest number in the country.  There were 54 on trolleys in Cork.  There is a continuing crisis because of the lack of bed capacity.  The focus must be on addressing the short-term needs over the next number of months so everything is done to alleviate pressure in the ED.  I admire the work the medical and nursing teams do with consultants in the University Limerick hospital group.  The key issue is that people are made aware on time of whatever resources are required because my role as a public representative for Limerick is to go to the Government to ensure the resources are put in place.</p></speech>

That must be acknowledged and it must be referenced in any conversation about healthcare and its future.  We must recognise the good work that is being done in the clinical education and research centre, CERC, building and the many innovations.  Most of them are led by clinicians.  Many of these are superb initiatives.  We were shown presentations on them.  They are essentially about building capacity but by having better innovation and efficiencies driving through the system, as well as lessening people's reliance on hospital beds by being more creative in how we deal with them.  That is an important part of this debate.  I acknowledge the good work being done on that front by the UL hospital group.  I was particularly impressed and it would be remiss of me not to point to that.</p> <p>While we struggle to build the 60-bed modular unit, it is not all about funding.  Sometimes staffing can be the difficulty in terms of trying to get the appropriately skilled staff.  UHL has advised the NTPF that it expects to open the ten beds in the nursing home this Wednesday.  The opening of the beds will be staggered for clinical safety reasons but they should all be fully operational by the end of the year, which is effectively two weeks away.  It is usual practice to stagger the opening.  One would not just open ten new beds on the day.  Regarding the 15 beds in St. John's Hospital, UHL will revert later in the week with further information, as these beds require a consultant.  That appears to be the difficulty.  It is not funding alone, but the availability of a consultant.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister, Deputy Ring, for taking time from his schedule to be here.  Rossmore Forest Park is a national park located on the outskirts of Monaghan town.  It is a huge, fantastic facility.  It stretches across more than 320 ha of forest.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It has been used primarily for recreation purposes as there are many beautiful trails and walks through it.  There is also a lake there.  Recently a new play park and a giant trail were developed, which have proven very attractive to locals and visitors alike.  This park has serious potential to become not just an attraction in County Monaghan but a regional attraction but it needs to be developed further.  With that in mind, Cycling Ireland and Emyvale Cycling Club have approached Monaghan County Council with a view to providing cycling infrastructure within the confines of Rossmore Forest Park.  The project they have in mind is the creation of a 2.5 km family cycle route which is completely off-road.  Cycling on the open road is not a very attractive option for beginners or children.  The proposal is for a completely off-road track that would be very safe.  </p><p>As the Minister knows, cycling has become very popular in this country.  Many more people are cycling now, which is great to see, particularly given the health benefits of physical exercise.  The problem in Monaghan is that we do not have proper facilities for cyclists to learn how to cycle safely.  Therefore, an application has been forwarded by Monaghan County Council to the Minister's Department for funding under the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme.  This project in Monaghan town is very much needed and I hope the Minister will look upon the application in a favourable light.  Monaghan has many fine attractions apart from the forest park to which I have referred.  We also have the Castle Leslie estate in Glaslough, Lough Muckno in Castleblayney and the Patrick Kavanagh Centre in Inniskeen.  Most people would agree that Monaghan, like other parts of the country, needs to see an economic benefit from tourism which it has not enjoyed to date.  We have many fine attractions and we need to build on them.  This project involving Cycling Ireland and Emyvale Cycling Club represents a first step in the development of a cycling attraction within Rossmore Forest Park.  Cycling Ireland has ambitions to develop further cycling attractions within the park.  I urge the Minister to provide funding for the first step in the development of a facility that would be both a local and regional attraction, something that is very much needed in County Monaghan.</p></speech>

I can confirm that my Department has received an application for funding from Monaghan County Council to support a 2.5 km off-road family cycling route at Rossmore Forest Park under this year's outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme.  I understand that the proposed project is part of a larger series of works set out in the Rossmore Forest Park master plan, which was developed by Monaghan County Council in partnership with Coillte.  This is an ambitious plan with a number of different elements designed to realise the significant potential of the park while managing it in a sustainable way.  It is expected that the plan will be implemented by Monaghan County Council on a phased basis.  The council has already been successful in securing funding from my Department under the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme.  Rossmore Forest Park received funding of over &euro;420,000 under the scheme in 2018.  This funding has not yet been drawn down, although it is expected that works will be completed early next year.  This is in addition to funding of &euro;115,000 provided to the park in 2016.  The type of work being funded includes the upgrading of paths and signage and new footbridges, as well as improved access and recreation points.  I understand that funding was also provided through the PEACE programme for the development of an adventure play park.</p> <p>The commencement of the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme in 2016 marked the first time in recent years that a dedicated funding stream was available for bodies involved in the provision of this type of infrastructure.  Demand for funding remains high and there is enormous potential to further develop the outdoor recreation sector.  I intend to continue to support projects of this type through measures such as the rural regeneration development fund, LEADER and the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Ring:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This year, my Department sought applications under the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme for three measures ranging from small-sized projects costing less than &euro;20,000 to large projects requiring investment of up to &euro;500,000.  My Department has received 284 applications under the three measures this year, representing a total request for funding of approximately &euro;24 million.  My officials must assess each application carefully on its own merits to ensure that good value for public moneys is received from any funding committed under the scheme.  Last month, I announced funding of &euro;1.8 million for 109 projects under measure 1 of the 2019 scheme.  This includes five projects in County Monaghan.  The assessment of the applications received under the larger measures is still ongoing.  These include the new application received in respect of Rossmore Forest Park.  I hope to make announcements in this regard in the near future.</p></speech>

This is an opportunity for the Government to put Monaghan on the map as a tourist attraction.  I sincerely hope that when the Minister goes to write that cheque, as he intends to do in the new year, he will have Monaghan County Council in mind.  I hope that he will see his way to providing much-needed funding for this facility.</p></speech>

The outdoor recreation scheme is a fantastic scheme, which works well.  I know the particular part of the county about which the Senator is talking.  I am under a lot of political pressure from the Minister based in the constituency, as the Senator will understand.  She puts a lot of pressure on me because she believes there is no other county than Monaghan.  I like the outdoor recreation scheme and I want it to continue but I want to send a message to every single county council, including Monaghan County Council.  I appreciate the Senator's very respectful approach today.  The local authorities have had this money since last year and should have it spent.  I have written to every local authority and I am starting to withdraw funding from them.  They will be getting letters.  Any authority that has not spent money it received in 2017 will have it withdrawn.  There is no point in putting &euro;110 million into the rural regeneration scheme, &euro;25 million into the LEADER scheme, &euro;68 million into the town and village scheme to carry out 830 projects, &euro;43 million into the outdoor recreation scheme, and &euro;32 million into the CL&Aacute;R programme if the authorities are not going to spend the money.  I know the funding was not there for a number of years but it has been provided continuously in recent years.  I want to send a message to Monaghan County Council and every other local authority.  I will be looking at projects on which money has not been spent.  I cannot allocate funding to councils that have not spent the money they have received.</p></speech>

As he knows, we have great plans for afforestation, planting more trees, as part of our battle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Without a doubt, forestry plays a very important part in carbon sequestration but all the evidence points to the fact that our system for licensing or planning forestry is not fit for purpose.  The matter I bring before the Minister of State today arises out of complaints from people involved in the industry, particularly the Forestry Company in Cork.  These companies are given licences to plant and to fell mature forests but there is a major problem.  As the Minister of State knows, the planning process does not involve a planning application to the local authority.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The planning process is not just a planning application to the local authority.  It involves an initial application to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for a licence.  The forestry appeals committee hears objections or appeals against decisions made.  However, it would seem according to those involved in the industry that very few, if any, licences are being issued from the Department and that there are major blockages in the forestry appeals committee system, which means that they cannot do any business.  That might point to an issue with resources but, more worrying, the substantive issue that the decisions made by the forestry appeals committee decisions appear to be <i>ad hoc</i>.  It does not appear to operate a system of precedent, case law or something akin to that whereby people objecting and those defending their case can be properly guided as to how the committee interprets the legislation.  That is one aspect.<br/><br/>The other aspect is that these forests have a major impact on communities.  Communities are complaining that they are not being consulted properly.  There is a recommendation in the forestry guidelines that they should be consulted but that is not happening in many cases.  Under the current system, if one wants to builds a road going into a forest, one has to get planning permission and go through the rigours of the local authority.  However, if one wants to plant a vast forest that might have the same impact as building a warehouse in the middle of the countryside, one does not need planning permission.  <br/><br/>There must be a more integrated approach in county development plans to ensure there can be a proper and robust teasing out of the balancing of land use and desirable forestry because we need forestry in the right place and with the right mix to avoid monoculture.  Equally, we have to have consideration for communities and ensure that these forests are not overbearing and that they are a fair imposition on communities.  One only has to look to the likes of Leitrim where there is vast afforestation and people are up in arms about it.  We need to get the balance right but this cries of a system, in terms of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the forestry appeals committee, that is not fit for purpose.  It needs to be reviewed in respect of the county development plan and the local authorities, but that is not happening.  People are aggrieved.  They believe they are not being listened to and that there is not a proper process in place to allow their concerns to be aired.  There are also the people involved in the industry.  This does not seem to suit anybody and the result is that it will not suit our objective to plant more forests.  We have to go back to the drawing board and get this right.  I hope we can begin that process here today.  I acknowledge Senator Paddy Burke, who tabled this Commencement matter but who cannot be here owing to-----</p></speech>

I can see it is an issue the Senator is very interested in as well.  I thank her for raising it.</p> <p>I apologise to the Senators for the absence of the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, both of whom are in Brussels.  As Senator Mulherin will be aware, the Minister is dealing with fisheries at an important meeting that is pertinent to her county.  The Ministers are keenly aware of the current delays being incurred by applicants and have asked me to give some background to the issues to both Senators.</p> <p>All forestry licences issued by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are subject to public notification and consultation and third party appeal.  As the planning body for forestry applications, it has an obligation to ensure that all licences are issued in accordance with relevant environmental legislation.  The relevant legislation is continuously subject to change as a result of case law interpretation and so the Department's procedures must change in tandem.</p> <p>Furthermore, decisions are subject to appeal to the independent forestry appeals committee.  Some of the submitted appeals have been won by appellants through challenging the Department's procedures.  These cases have required the Department to change procedures involved in assessing forestry licence applications.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Pat Breen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1766"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1766&amp;amp;pid=PatBreen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The appeals are connected to the appropriate assessment, AA, procedure.  Article 6.3 of the habitats directive requires that where a plan or project is likely to have a significant effect on a Natura site, either individually or in combination with other plans or projects, it must undergo an appropriate assessment of its implications for that Natura site.  The forestry inspectorate has been implementing an AA procedure established in 2013.  However, as the FAC has identified issues with the procedure, and as recent European case law is interpreted within Irish courts, changes to the procedure have been made.  The Department has taken several steps to help deal with these changes including engaging the services of external environmental consultants to assist with the necessary revision of the AA and the delivery of training for forestry inspectors.  It is also currently recruiting additional ecologists to join the forestry inspectorate.</p><p>A major triage operation is also ongoing to categorise the large number of files currently on hand for consideration by the in-house ecology team.  The purpose of this process is to categorise files for further action and to advance each to AA determination stage using external ecological consultants.  Forestry licences continue to be issued, albeit at a slower rate than would be expected.  However, it has been a good year overall for felling licences and to the end of November the Department has issued just over 4,000 tree felling licences which is still higher than any previous year and is 10% higher than the total for all of last year.</p><p>Forest roads payments are up by 35% in 2019 with 87.4 km built to date as opposed to 64.6 km in the same period in 2018.  The FAC is an independent body but I understand that it is now starting to hear appeals on cases on the Department's new procedures.  Three additional administrative staff have been assigned to the agriculture appeals office to give extra secretarial and administrative support to the FAC.  The Department will keep the resources of the FAC under review in the event that additional resources are needed.</p><p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, are fully aware that this situation is causing difficulties, especially for landowners and forestry contractors.  I wish to assure the House that departmental officials are actively working towards alleviating the current temporary disruption.  I believe the robust and workable system now being put in place will result in an improved licensing system of benefit to all stakeholders.</p></speech>

They are concerned that the protocols and rules being designed for the new AA would be fit for purpose and compatible with appropriate and efficient regulation of the sector.  There is the objective that it is done in an environmentally appropriate way but also that it complies with regulations.  I am sad to see that once again we have issues around environmental obligations placed on the State arising out of the habitats directive.  It has been the undoing of many of the planning permits granted for a road or a bridge and now there are problems in respect of forestry.</p> <p>I would like to maintain my position.  I do not feel that the system there at the moment for communities, adjoining landowners and the industry is fit and proper for purpose.  The approach needs to be better integrated with the planning system operated by the local authorities because this is all to do with land use and getting the balance right.  Even though there are some references to the planning authorities in the forestry regulations it is a box ticking exercise.  It is not robust enough to put in place the ambitious plans we have for forestry and to do that fairly. </p></speech>

Additional measures have been put in place, with additional staff and resources to deal with the issuing of licences, felling of trees and forest road construction.  Forestry road payments are up 35% on last with 87.4 km built to date as opposed to 64.6 km in the same period in 2018.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Pat Breen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1766"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1766&amp;amp;pid=PatBreen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There have been improvements in this area.  I note the Senator's concern for those who have experienced delays, particularly the contractors and farmers.  Forestry is a popular type of farming in many areas, especially in the west, as I am sure the Senator knows.  I assure her that the Department and its officials are actively working towards alleviating the current temporary disruption.  It is important that the Department monitors this in the coming months to see whether we are getting the results needed, particularly in improving the licensing system.  This is for the benefit of all stakeholders.  We know how important that income is for farmers and so we must get that work done as quickly as possible, especially given the current environmental challenges in the industry, which the Senator noted. </p></speech>

I wish to raise the issue of insurance, the Government's inaction on it and any proposals it might have to ensure people are paying the correct amount for insurance and that insurance companies are not price gouging and price fixing, which is a concern we all share given the stark increase in the cost of insurance over the past decade.</p> <p>At this time of the year, homelessness is all the more prevalent for people who do not have a home in which to celebrate Christmas and who have no likelihood of getting one.  This bizarre reality has happened under a Government that at one time was the largest property owner in the country.  It sold thousands of homes to vulture funds and on behalf of banks when its own citizens needed them.  Could the Deputy Leader explain why that was the case?  </p> <p>This month is the 99th anniversary of the partition of Ireland receiving royal assent.  Does the Deputy Leader agree that we should have a debate about that issue in the new year given that the election results in Scotland and the debate that is happening there will have an impact on Norther Ireland and in light of the election results in Northern Ireland where, for the first time ever, unionist MPs were returned as a minority from Northern Ireland to Westminster?  </p> <p>The other issue, which was on the Order Paper for some time, is that the report compiled by the all-party Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement entitled, Brexit and the Future of Ireland: Uniting Ireland &amp;amp; Its People in Peace &amp;amp; Prosperity, which is the first report commissioned by this House and in which I was involved as rapporteur, has not been debated by this House.  The 17 recommendations have not been implemented by the Government, which has said quite clearly that it is not making any preparations to try to achieve the main aim of the State.  Brexit has transformed the landscape in Northern Ireland and the debate has moved on.  The place where the debate is not happening is inside this House.  It is not happening in the D&aacute;il.  The Taoiseach has said that a border poll is not a risk but is too important and sensitive to be dealt with in the national risk assessment.  What is the Government's policy on trying to achieve the main aim of the State?  At the McGill Summer School, the Taoiseach spoke about how Brexit has transformed views among some people across the community divide regarding the constitutional issue.  Two Attorneys General have said that the achievement of a unified Ireland is a constitutional imperative.  There is an obligation on the State and all agents, including Members and the other House, to strive to achieve it.  They cannot choose not to achieve it yet this Government is choosing to do exactly that, which is a breach of its constitutional obligation.  I ask the Deputy Leader that if nothing else, we be allowed to debate the issue.</p></speech>

The committee has completed its work and issued its final report.  I expect it will be stood down in a matter of days.  It expires on 31 December.  I wish the committee members well and thank them for their work.  It was important work that brought a certain focus and international attention to some members of the committee, which was not a bad thing.

The Minister reflected on that and our conversation, and on matters that were discussed this morning at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I understand he has now extended for a further two weeks that public consultation until some time near the end of January.  I welcome that.  I am glad that I played some part in that.  I acknowledge the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for agreeing to do that.  I thank him for that.</p><p>I will be here to vote tomorrow but I will not be here to speak on the Order of Business.  As we come to the end of the year, I take this opportunity to thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Cathaoirleach, the Clerk of the Seanad, Mr. Martin Groves, and Bridget and all the staff of the Seanad for the work that they do.  I also thank Ms Orla Murray and the Leader.  It is not always an easy place to be chairing, administering and leading the House and it is important.

I did not know Cormac.  My colleague, Senator Warfield, will talk further about him on the Order of Business, but his tragic death at the age of 19 over the weekend is something that shocked us all.  I just want to pass on my sincere condolences to both the Labour Party and to his family.  It is a terrible tragedy to happen.</p> <p>I congratulate all of the successful candidates in the elections in Britain and in the North and wish them well in the challenges ahead, and acknowledge all of the candidates who did not get elected and hope that they are all okay as well - even Mr. Nigel Dodds.  I congratulate in particular my party's team.  We have come back with seven MPs again.  I welcome Mr. John Finucane MP to his position in North Belfast.  It was a considerable achievement.  It is a testament to the man that John Finucane is and the MP that I know he will be.  I suppose what the elections in the North tell us is that, above anything, and all kinds of analysis is done on it, we must be in charge of our own destiny and the responsibility we have across all parties and none to make sure that we do that.  Even with the reports of Mr. Dominic Cummings stating that he could not care less if the North of Ireland fell into the sea, it is clear to everybody across the board now that we must be in control of our own destiny.  To that end, I would ask again that the Government here would set up the architecture for that in terms of the discussions that need to be had.  They need to be had within a framework that ensures mutual respect and everything else that is required, namely, a safe space for people to be able to discuss our future in a mature way, learning from the past but not being controlled by it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I commend today's important report on Brexit by Senator Richmond and the committee, including Senator O'Reilly.

He was the chair of Labour Youth, but that was not just what Cormac was - he was more than Labour Youth.  He was a great scout leader, a fantastic musician and huge advocate for the Irish language.  Recently, he was out campaigning for Gaelscoileanna in Dublin Bay South.  By his own account, he was a great footballer.  I was not too sure, as he would have a wry smile.</p> <p>Too often, we undervalue the contribution that young people make to political life and democracy.  Cormac was certainly a fantastic member of Labour Youth and the Labour Party.  He packed so much into such a short life.  He will be truly missed by the Labour Party.  Even at this early stage, he had been marked out by many people in the party as a future leader of it, and possibly the first Labour Party Taoiseach.  He was of that quality.  I do not say that lightly.  One need only have met this young man to see his leadership qualities.  He could mix with people of all ages and groups.  That has been reflected in recent days in what members of all political parties, in particular young members, have had to say about him.  He had great respect across all parties.  On Sunday night, when there was a short remembrance ceremony in his primary school, members of political parties and none came together in an outpouring of grief in solidarity with his parents.  His parents really appreciated those expressions of sympathy, especially from what he would have called his competitors in the political sphere.  He certainly enjoyed his politics.  He made a mark in Irish society and would have made a far greater one, had he been blessed with a few more years.</p> <p>I thank the Senator and all political parties for their expression of sympathy to the family and party.

It is difficult when a person is taken away so early in life.  All young people, no matter what age they are, have achieved something.  I listened to Senator Humphreys, who has highlighted someone who had significant potential.  It is sad to see a young life being taken so tragically.</p> <p>Yesterday's report from the Central Bank highlighted the cost of insurance that we are all paying for through our premiums.  The headline was the insurance companies' profits but it was stark to read into the report and see the legal costs associated with insurance claims.  On average, a payout under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, is &euro;22,631 with a legal cost of &euro;753.  When a claim goes through litigation in the courts, the average payout is &euro;45,390.

The Chief Justice announced its seven members.  In fairness to Fianna F&aacute;il in the D&aacute;il, it implemented a timeframe of six months after the committee was established for a report to be produced.  The problem is that the clock has not started ticking yet because the Chief Justice has not instigated the first proper meeting of the committee.</p></speech>

It is such a tragic end to a wonderful future.  I read about him and our President's beautiful tribute to him.  I lost my best friend, Gerry Minor, at 19 years of age and I can relate to the feelings of his friends and family.  It brings back the memory of my friend.  His mother said to me at the time that Gerry has a very cold bed tonight.  That is a lovely, sad thing but it is true.</p> <p>I do not think the House will agree with this but I will suggest it anyway and it is a matter for the House to decide.  I would like to send congratulations to Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, on a wonderful election result for him and the Conservative Party, with a majority of 80.  I will be clear that I never envisaged another referendum in Britain about its membership of the EU.  Now there is a clear decision and the agreement has been made with the support of our Taoiseach, who was most helpful in this regard.  It is a very good deal as far as Ireland is concerned.  It is as good as we could get.  It means that a united Ireland will be achieved sooner than later because there will be no Border in Ireland, between North and South, and Ireland will be detached from the UK because it will be one country trading together.  That is progress.  It was noted that &pound;46 or &pound;47 billion sterling is being transferred from the UK to pay the EU for commitments the UK made.  I will not get agreement on this but I would like to send my congratulations to Boris Johnson in that regard.  I also congratulate Colum Eastwood and Claire Hanna, the partners of Fianna F&aacute;il in Northern Ireland.  We are very proud of that.</p></speech>

It is such a tragedy.  I offer our sympathy to his colleagues in the Labour Party.  He is a great loss to Ireland and more particularly to his family.  We need idealistic young people like him.</p> <p>I congratulate John Finucane on his election in Northern Ireland.  I was a guest of his on a committee visit recently in his capacity as lord mayor when we were in the North with a group from the Oireachtas.  I was very impressed by the way he received us, his welcome and his remarks, and I wish him well.  I also congratulate both Colum Eastwood and Claire Hanna.  The SDLP has suffered a lot in the Northern Ireland context but it has been a very consistent voice.  It is good they have recovered.</p> <p>In case I do not get to speak tomorrow, I want to join in the felicitous remarks to all the staff and Members of the House.</p> <p>I ask the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, to the House in the new year to discuss the climate change agenda with special reference to rural Ireland.  I am thinking of two very important issues that are clear in places such as Cavan and Monaghan, where I come from, and throughout rural Ireland.  The first is the question of rural transport.  If we are to move away from diesel cars and carbon emitting vehicles, we need a better rural transport infrastructure and better connectivity between small towns.  In consultation with the Minister, Bus &Eacute;ireann needs to deal with that.  We need a better rural transport system.  While Irish Rural Link is doing well, we need to supplement it and work on the area of rural transport.</p> <p>If we are moving away from fossil fuels, people throughout the country, and specifically in rural Ireland, need practical support through grant aid to bring their houses up to the condition whereby they can cope with the new energy regime.  That is important in regard to old houses in particular.  We need a fuller grant scheme to deal with that and I ask the Deputy Leader to address that.</p> <p>I hope we can have that debate on rural Ireland and climate change, and branching into the agricultural sector as well.  All of that needs a thorough discussion in the House in the new year because we cannot have a climate change agenda that puts rural Ireland in a bad position.</p></speech>

I have been talking to a few councillor colleagues.  I believe there would be a benefit if the Minister would consider putting together a forum, at least on an annual or six-monthly basis, between the Department and interested councillors so they can inform the Department of the needs within their own areas and keep abreast of what it has planned for their areas.  In towns such as Balbriggan, Swords, Rush, Lusk and Skerries in Fingal, there is a significant need for more schools whereas, in other areas, the issues could be of a different nature.  Just like we have a HSE forum for councillors that meets on a regular basis, I believe there would be value for councillors to have access to such a forum with the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p>It would to help inform the Department of the needs in the area and inform its policy decisions, and allow us to predict with greater certainty what is happening, in particular given recent demographic changes.  As in the past, houses are built, families move in, children are born and they attend school five years later, and people can see what is happening.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, with our current housing situation and the movement of people, we have many families arriving already complete into areas such as Skerries, Balbriggan, Rush, Lusk, Swords, Malahide and Portmarnock.  They already have children of secondary school-going age, which makes being able to predict the demand a little more difficult for the Department, and I accept that.  The bottom line, however, is that we now have a crisis in north Dublin in that we have families unable to say where their children will go to secondary school next year.  One instance in Skerries involves fourth-generation Skerries people on both sides of the family going back through parents, grandparents and great-grandparents.  This is utterly unacceptable and must be addressed.  The Minister was very good to come to visit the school and meet the people affected.  However, there is very much a case for the Minister, first, to meet parents' representatives from the area and, second, to come before the House to discuss with us how we might put such a forum together in order to avail of the on-the-ground knowledge many councillors have and could contribute.</p></speech>

I wish to discuss children today.  I would like the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills before the House to tell us what he is doing to support schools around the country in accessing grants to feed their pupils.  I read in the newspaper last week that almost 11,000 vulnerable children miss out on their meals each day because eligible schools, DEIS and non-DEIS, are not accessing the State-funded school meals scheme.  I am aware that the Committee of Public Accounts has already called on the Minister to write to the school boards in question to query why they are not accessing funding from the school meals programme, which aims to provide regular nutritious food to children.  It seems 71 invited schools have failed to join the programme, which leaves the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection with an &euro;8 million unspent portion of its budget.  This is incredible.  I would call the Minister in myself but I seem to have difficulty getting the relevant Minister to address my Commencement matters.  We sometimes seem to have that issue here.  Recently it has been a massive issue for me, but that is for another day.  Barnardos has cited the shocking statistic that one in nine children goes to bed hungry because of a life lived in poverty.  There is a way to get these children some food.  We need to figure out where the breakdown is.  Some 33 DEIS schools and 38 non-DEIS schools qualified for the scheme.  I would like the Minister to explain to us the reason for this and why these schools are not drawing down the funding.  Lots of schools in Carlow are crying out for this funding.  Is there a lack of communication?  What is the answer?  The matter is urgent, and I ask for a serious answer to it from the Minister.</p></speech>

It is a huge loss at such a young age.</p> <p>I wish to raise the report just published by the National Office of Clinical Audit.  While there are a lot of negative comments on the health service in this country, it is interesting that the report shows that the number of people dying from heart attacks, stroke and pneumonia in Irish hospitals has reduced drastically over the past ten years.  There has been a 35% reduction in heart attacks, in respect of which the number of people admitted has fallen from 74 to 48.  Stroke is down by 38%.  Pneumonia is down by 28%, which is a huge achievement by the healthcare sector and all those who work in it.  A lot of the commentary we see is very much on the negative side, as if there is a total disaster in healthcare, whereas this report is clear evidence that the 135,000 people who work in the HSE, whether backroom or front-line staff, are doing their best to provide the best-quality healthcare that can be provided.  This is clear evidence of major improvements in these areas.</p> <p>While I am dealing with this issue, it is also important to acknowledge that while all of us will be off over the Christmas period, all the nurses, doctors and care assistants will provide the same level of care throughout our hospital and healthcare sector over those few days.  It is important we acknowledge their work and the contribution they make on a day-to-day basis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The ambulance service will also be fully operational in the Christmas period.

I did not know Cormac personally but I spent much of Sunday night reading about his life, his musicianship, his involvement with Scouting Ireland and his political leadership.  His loss is clearly devastating for his family and friends but it is also a loss for the left in Ireland.  I have had the privilege of serving as the national chair of Sinn F&eacute;in Youth, &Oacute;gra Shinn F&eacute;in, and it has shared its condolences.  The thoughts and prayers of everyone in Sinn F&eacute;in are with his family, friends and comrades.  Above all else, from what I read on Sunday evening it seems he was a gorgeous human being.

He was such a young man, at 19, to have made such an impression across so many different levels of society.  It is a huge loss to the Labour Party and politics.  It is amazing to think of the difference for good this young man could have made to our country or further afield if he had got a grip in politics or life.</p> <p>The United Kingdom election took place and I send my congratulations to Mr. Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party.  It was an election that finally put to bed exactly where we are going with Brexit, although we will see what happens in the next few weeks.  The Labour Party in the United Kingdom must think seriously about where it is going.  One would think that in opposition the Labour Party would have done extremely well.  We are in a very interesting position and it is quite clear Scotland and England are going their separate ways.  That will have major repercussions for the island of Ireland.</p> <p>I congratulate Mr. Colum Eastwood and Ms Claire Hanna from the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP.  I am delighted to see an SDLP nationalist voice in Westminster.  I know many people from Young Fine Gael and Fine Gael who canvassed in both those constituencies for those two wonderful candidates.  I send my congratulations to Mr. John Finucane, whom I met when he was mayor of Belfast.  I wish him well.  It was a stunning victory in north Belfast as that seat has been held by unionists for 128 years.  This was not a good election for Sinn F&eacute;in or the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP.  The real winner of the election in Northern Ireland was the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland.  It is not 50:50 any more but rather 40:40:20.  This is a most amazing breakthrough for the Alliance Party, which is the middle ground.  This will have major repercussions.</p> <p>It is the wrong time to have a border poll despite everybody talking about it.  Nationalists are correctly talking about an uncomfortable conversation that must be had.  Nationalists in the Republic of Ireland will also have to partake in uncomfortable conversations about the relationship we will have with the United Kingdom.  I mentioned in this House many times our association with the Commonwealth of Nations.  We must have those uncomfortable conversations if we are to have an Ireland that will accommodate 1 million unionists who want to be part of that agreed Ireland.  It has to be not just an agreed Ireland but there must be more links between Ireland, the United Kingdom and the European Union.  I look forward to the challenging and interesting times we will experience in the coming years.</p></speech>

School principals continue to voice their frustration at the time and effort required to find a substitute teacher for either a long-term or short-term absence.  I was contacted by a school principal who has been in the job for many years.  Throughout that service the school principal has fought consistently to ensure that a qualified teacher would stand before every classroom in schools throughout the country.  That is the way it should be.  Every child should be assured that there is a qualified teacher standing in front of the class.  Now, however, the situation has become so bad that school principals are glad to see anybody with a semblance of qualification in teaching be a substitute teacher for a short-term or long-term absence.  Principals tell us how much they dread getting a telephone call in the morning from a teacher who will be absent because of illness or for some other reason.  That starts a process, which can take hours, of getting on the telephone to ring or text people or send WhatsApp messages in an effort to find somebody to cover for that period of absence.</p> <p>The Minister for Education and Skills needs to get a grip on the situation.  I ask the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister to the House early in the new year to advise us on what plan of action he has to tackle the lack of teachers in the country.  It is deeply frustrating for the nation that when we educate our young people to be teachers, nurses or doctors we then watch them go to the airports to leave the country with those qualifications.  It is an issue the country must resolve.</p></speech>

I also extend my sympathy to the Labour Party.  It is a very difficult when it is somebody so young and particularly in those circumstances.</p> <p>I wish to raise two matters.  The first is about insurance.  I note the Central Bank's report yesterday which showed that the insurance companies were making a 9% profit on motor insurance.  Representatives of the insurance companies appeared before the finance committee on two occasions, in June and October, and during those hearings I did some primary research that examined companies' turnovers across the insurance sector.  The expected margins they needed were 5% or 6% but when I did the calculations I found that five of the six companies were earning profits of almost 10%, on average.  They were making super profits.  I am glad the Central Bank, which is able to do detailed statistical and empirical analysis, has come up with 9%.  My calculations were done on the day and I was amazed at the level of profits they are earning.  While we want reform of the insurance sector in terms of reform of the book of quantum and other measures, the insurance companies have a part to play too.  They cannot fleece customers.  That is why I would like to see motor insurance premiums coming down.  Furthermore, the companies need to provide cover across a range of sectors.</p> <p>The second issue is the current difficulties for Limerick Football Club.  It is a proud soccer club in Limerick city and has just emerged from an examinership.  I hope ways can be examined by the city, the local authority and Government levels to see if a structure can be put in place to ensure the future of senior soccer in Limerick.  That might take many forms.  Many clubs have a community based structure that goes back into the heart of a city.  We should explore every opportunity.  It is critical that senior soccer in Limerick FC continue in Limerick city.  It is part and parcel of what we are and it is something on which there must be careful consideration.</p></speech>

Cormac was the chairperson of Labour Youth and I know that the Labour Party family will miss him greatly.  I offer my condolences on his death.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise is the recent British election.  I congratulate all of the MPs who were elected, particularly in the North.  There are some new faces now, which I very much welcome.  However, this week the focus of attention must turn to Stormont.  One message coming from last week's election, particularly in the North of Ireland, is that the political paralysis caused by the lack of institutions in the North cannot continue.  The voters gave a clear message in that regard, with votes for Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP down on the previous election.  There is a real need to get the institutions back up and running in the North before the deadline of 13 January 2020.  On the ground, schools do not have budgets to meet basic requirements such as special needs assistants and hospital waiting lists are increasing.  We think we have problems with the latter down here but the figures in the North are spiralling out of control.  People are waiting for years.  There are real issues about which people are concerned in places like Magherafelt and Maghera that must be addressed.  The only way they can be addressed is through democratic and accountable decision-making at Stormont, rather than having civil servants running day-to-day operations in the Six Counties, with no decisions being taken, effectively.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been arguing over the Irish language issue and while I agree with its position, the fact that Stormont is not up and running means that Foras na Gaeilge is not even operational.  Basic requirements can only be resolved by getting the institutions back up and running.  In that context, I commend the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney on his work.  It is essential that both the Irish and British Governments put as much pressure as possible on the parties in the North to get the institutions back up and running, for once and for all.</p></speech>

I wish to join others who expressed sympathy on the death of Cormac &Oacute; Braon&aacute;in.  At 19 he was young, active, vibrant and full of promise and his death is a real tragedy for his family, particularly at this time of the year.  Our thoughts are primarily with his family but his death is also a huge loss to the Labour Party.  I extend the condolences of everyone in Seanad &Eacute;ireann to Cormac's family and to the Labour Party.</p> <p>Senator Mark Daly raised the issue of insurance, as did several other Senators.  The report to which he referred made stark reading but certain measures have been put in place and a lot of work has been done in this area.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell took a forensic look at this issue and as he said, insurance company profits are completely over the top.  While there are issues around legal costs and awards, insurers' profits really are something else and something must be done about that.  I have dealt with insurance companies a lot in the legal world and I know that they are completely and utterly profit driven so in that context, we must introduce measures that will reduce insurance costs overall.  The fact that we have now passed the Judicial Council Bill is a help and I note Senator Lawlor's comments in that regard.  I know that it met at the beginning of December.  I chaired a committee in this House a few years ago which met in private session initially to get its ducks in a row but once the first proper meeting happens, the time does then run.  I would imagine that will happen from the beginning of January but I will relay the Senator's question to the Minister because it is an appropriate one.</p> <p>Senator Mark Daly also raised the 99th anniversary of the royal assent.  It is obvious that he would raise this issue in the House now and a debate on same would be timely, once Brexit has been sorted.  I do not want to sound like Boris but timing is important.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Conway-Walsh spoke about a framework within which to have the discussion and I agree with that.  Timing, however, is everything in life.  It is important to have the framework and the discussion but the timing needs to be right on that front.  It would be irresponsible to push that agenda too much at this particular point in time.  The size of the report alone suggests that it is something which should be discussed in this House.  The implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is something which is close to everyone's heart.  I suggest we have a debate on that.</p><p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the report of the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  I give all credit to Senator Richmond and the other Senators on that committee for the amount of work they got through.  It has been a very useful and helpful piece of work.  Senator Conway-Walsh suggested that we hold a constructive debate on the findings of the report.  That is a very good suggestion.</p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh also spoke about the elections in the North and in the UK.  As I said, I agree with her point about the framework but timing is everything.  I have already mentioned the report on Brexit.  That would be a good discussion to have.  It would be wise for this House to be to the forefront on this issue given that the report was compiled by a Seanad committee.  </p><p>Senator Humphrey raised the issue of Cormac &Oacute; Braon&aacute;in, which I have addressed.  Senator Lawlor made a point about legal costs, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, litigation and the judicial council committee.  He has done a lot of work in this area.  I have already addressed his question.  The question of when a result in this regard is likely should be put to the Minister.  Regardless of all the talk of committees and judicial councils, we really just need to see results with regard to the level of awards.  I agree with the Senator in that regard.</p><p>Senator Leyden spoke about the elections and congratulated Boris and others.  Senator Reilly congratulated many of the Members of Parliament who have been elected and requested a debate on the climate change agenda with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in the new year, which would be timely.  This would be a useful debate, especially with regard to rural Ireland.  A general debate on climate change in the new year would be timely.  I canvassed in Senator Reilly's constituency and the issue of school places was often raised.  There is a growing population in the area.  The HSE-type liaison group for education he suggested would be a good idea.</p><p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of DEIS schools and others that have been awarded moneys for school lunch programmes that they have not used up.  I find that very difficult to understand.  I would be grateful if we could have a debate on that in the new year.  If certain schools are not using it, it should be allocated to other schools.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of the health service, on which he does a lot of work, and the very satisfactory results in many areas of the health service.  We get a wash of negative commentary with regard to the health service but all of us know people who cannot speak positively enough about the health service once they actually access it and receive care from nurses, doctors and all concerned.

Senator Feighan raised the issue of the elections and made a point about the timing of the border poll.  Senator Gallagher raised the issue of the supply of qualified teachers.

The issue of Limerick FC is very important for young people and older people in Limerick alike.  It seems that all need to come together to ensure a satisfactory outcome.

These EU instruments provide for this information exchange between member states.  Having regard to the free movement across borders, there is very significant benefit to have a system allowing the reliable exchange of criminal records information between member states.  </p> <p>Every effort must be made to ensure an effective European response to criminal activities, in particular serious cross-border crime and terrorism.  The European Agenda on Security highlights the need to maximise EU measures on information exchange and operational co-operation.  The rapid and efficient exchange between competent member state central authorities of information extracted from criminal records is important if we are to avoid individuals escaping justice.</p> <p>The need resulted in the agreement at EU level of these two EU instruments to establish ECRIS.  The system allows for the transfer of criminal record information between member states for use in criminal investigations and proceedings, and for other relevant proceedings and matters where the sharing of information is necessary.  It also creates a specific obligation on each member state to inform those other member states when their citizens are convicted of criminal offences.</p> <p>Currently, the National Vetting Bureau, which exchanges information, carries out four main tasks within this framework.  They are, first, the submission of requests to central authorities in other member states for extracts from their national criminal record in respect of nationals of the member state concerned.  Second, the bureau responds to requests from the central authorities in other member states for extracts from Ireland's criminal records database in respect of Irish nationals.  Third, the bureau receives, stores and updates where necessary Ireland's criminal records database with appropriate information received from central authorities in other member states in respect of Irish nationals convicted in those other member states.  Fourth, our central authority transmits information, and any necessary updates, in respect of criminal convictions imposed in Ireland on all nationals of other EU member states to the central authority of the member state of the convicted person.</p> <p>Ireland's Data Protection Act 2018 has given effect to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and transposed the law enforcement directive.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The material impact of this new data protection regime on our careful transposition of the ECRIS framework decision and Council decision has been considerable.  This Bill has been subject to extensive and detailed consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the European Commission over the past 12 to 18 months.</p><p>Turning to the specifics of the Bill, section 1 is a standard provision defining words and phrases used in the Act.  Section 2 provides for the designation of a central authority, as required by the framework decision.  The Garda Commissioner is the designated central authority.  Section 3 provides for the recording, when available, of the nationality or nationalities of EU nationals who are convicted of an offence.  Section 4 provides that the Irish central authority, when available, must transmit criminal record information to the relevant central authority in the member state of a person's nationality.  Section 5 provides for the storage of information.  Section 6 provides for the circumstances in which the Irish central authority may, and in some cases, must request information on convictions from other central authorities.  Section 7 provides for the responses to requests from other central authorities and related categories of information that can be transmitted in respect of a person who is a national of the State.  Section 8 provides for the responses to requests from other central authorities and the related categories of information that can be transmitted to other central authorities in respect of a person who is not a national of the State.  Section 9 deals with the deadlines to respond to requests for information.  Section 10 provides for the electronic transfer of information.  Section 11 provides for safeguards on how and when personal data is received, transmitted and can be used.  Section 12 provides that when the Irish central authority receives a request for information on an Irish national from a country other than an EU member state, the Irish central authority can only provide information subject to limitations outlined in section 7.  Section 13 provides that the Bill does not affect any obligation or power to provide or request information under any other law.  Sections 14 and 15 are standard.  Schedule 1 includes the full text of the relevant framework decision.  Schedule 2 lists the information that can be provided on request.  Schedule 3 lists other purposes in addition to that of criminal proceedings for which information can be exchanged.  Schedule 4 includes the full text of the implementing Council decision.  </p><p>Members may be aware that Ireland is required to inform the Commission of the measures we have taken to facilitate transposition.  I am confident that I will have the support of the House in this regard.  The Bill is not only a priority due to the position the Commission has now taken but because its future development is part of a package of measures to enhance law enforcement and judicial co-operation across the EU.  Accordingly, I am pleased to present and commend this Bill to the House.  I very much hope we can progress matters this afternoon towards enactment.  </p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this very important legislation.  However, it is baffling that it took ten years to bring it to the House following the European Commission decision.  It took a formal letter last November before the Government acted.  Could the Minister explain to the House the reason for the delay?  It is quite clear that up-to-date criminal records of citizens of member states are urgently required.  I have a concern about the situation post-Brexit because only EU member states can access this database.  When the UK is no longer a member, it will send requests to the Irish Government.  What mechanisms are in place to deal with that?</p></speech>

Why has it taken seven years for this issue to reach the D&aacute;il and Seanad to be legislated for?  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been operating the exchange of information on criminals with other police forces since 2012.  Obviously, this activity was being carried out with the best of intentions but it did not have a legal basis.  This is highly irregular.  Why did this legal gap continue for so long?  There are a number of questions, which the Minister can deal with at the end.  A review should be carried out to provide answers regarding this legal loophole.  We need answers to the obvious questions arising from the delay.  It is not just the Seanad and the D&aacute;il that need answers.  The European Commission issued this State with a formal notice to resolve this anomaly or explain to it why we are in this legal limbo.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We should not be in this space.</p><p>All EU member states are part of the criminal information exchange programme and now that Britain is leaving the EU, questions arise about the protection of the information that the British police has received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the past seven years.  At present, this information is protected by EU data protection legislation but once Britain leaves the EU, this information is not protected.  What arrangements are being put in place to ensure this information is protected?</p><p>I would also like to know whether criminal records travel with them from state to state as they pass through the EU.  There may be examples where crimes in one state are not crimes in another.  What of non-EU nationals?  Do their criminal records follow them when they become citizens of another EU state?  The Netherlands has put in place a provision to ensure that data are passed between member states in the event of change of nationality of an offender.  When people change nationality when they arrive here or in another EU state, how will this be dealt with?</p><p>The Bill sets out the need for the competent storing of documentation to ensure it is available for sharing if required.  The storing of data can be an onerous task and we saw that when documents relevant to the tribunal of inquiry were lost.  Is it proposed to have separate registers for storing convictions or will all information be stored in a central database?  Will the bureau in Tipperary that deals with vetting continue to store that information or will it be duplicated?</p><p>It is important that the public has confidence in the system designed to protect data and that it is clearly capable of being protected and that robust accountability measures are in place should the system break down.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the central authority for the exchange of records and yet it is facing staff shortages.  Will the Garda have adequate staff to perform this task?</p><p>Twenty working days is the timescale for the delivery of information requested by respective police services.  Is this a realistic timescale?  I am informed by people who regularly seek access to information from various agencies of the State, including the criminal justice system, that such a request is more likely to be delivered in 20 months.  The concern is that 20 days is an unrealistic timeframe.</p><p>The issue of spent records is one about which we need to be careful.  The issue of spent convictions needs to be dealt with and clearly thought through in respect of this legislation.</p><p>The general thrust of what has been done here is admirable and needs to be brought forward as quickly as possible.  All EU states, including this one, need to be conscious that there is a serious issue regarding the protection of people's data with regard to exchange of information so that it is not open to hackers and cannot be accessed by people outside the tight confines of the criminal justice system here or in other EU states.</p><p>I await the Minister's response to those concerns but, as I stated, my party will be supporting the passage of this legislation.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the support of the two Opposition parties, as indicated by Senators Clifford-Lee and Mac Lochlainn, for this important legislation.</p> <p>I am on the joint parliamentary scrutiny group on Europol.  It is an extremely important developing role because crime is borderless and the best way of giving a society some chance of dealing with the scourge of crime that transcends all borders is by working together and having a seamless sharing of information.  We see it in the Acting Chairman, Senator Wilson's part of the country with the developing protocols with the PSNI.  That type of structure and protocols needs to be extended worldwide.</p> <p>I would agree that it is a pity that this legislation is only becoming before us now.  That said, better late than not at all.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will help in the resolution of crime, not just in this country but in our neighbours as well.  Brexit is an important consideration.  The British authorities have made it clear that when it comes to security and sharing of information, they are at one.  At the latest meeting in Brussels of the joint parliamentary scrutiny group of Europol, the Commissioner for home affairs, Julian King, a former British ambassador to Ireland, spoke at length about how his country is committed, post Brexit, to putting whatever suite of measures is necessary in place to deal with the scourge of crime, especially the new developing online crime.  I believe that will happen and it is very welcome.  It is good that this Bill is passing all Stages today.  It will hopefully leave the Seanad with a unanimous seal of approval.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-12-17a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1402" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019121700002#FF00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  On behalf of the Labour Senators, I support this important Bill, which will put into effect the EU-required framework decision on the organisation, content and exchange of information and Council Decision 2009/316/JHA.  If one considers the parliamentary history of this Bill, it should have been before us much sooner.  The Minister and others have raised the issue of delay.  The Commission issued Ireland with a reasoned opinion in July on account of the delay in notifying measures for the transposal into our national law of this framework decision.  The Minister said the transposition was delayed due to domestic legislation which was a greater priority at the time, but that can always be said.</p> <p>I looked at the legislative history of this Bill and given that we have all welcomed it, with, I believe, no opposition or voices against it here or in the D&aacute;il, since it is an important Bill that will enable the exchange of information on criminal records between EU member states, it is extraordinary that it is coming to us to be taken through all Stages in the Seanad on our second last sitting day this session.  It received Government approval on 31 July; the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality decided that there would be no need for pre-legislative scrutiny because it was largely technical and it did not have any difficulty with its provisions; and it was on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 25 September, at which point general support was expressed for it.  It seems odd to me that it is only now, on 17 December, coming to us to pass all Stages in the Seanad.  Unfortunately there has been a pattern over many years, though not particularly under the Minister's watch, of Department of Justice and Equality legislation being rushed through in the final sitting week of December and July.  It is a pity to see that happen here too.</p> <p>Senator Ruane has tabled amendments that she will raise.  The issue of spent convictions and their relationship with this legislation was raised in the D&aacute;il.  I am glad that her amendments will give us an opportunity to debate that issue again.</p> <p>Finally, as others said, Brexit has clear implications for the substance of this Bill.  We all have concerns about how the British Government's stated intention to leave by 31 January will impact on exchange of records, especially with regard to the UK's connection to ECRIS.  We all have that concern and I do not imagine that, at this stage, anyone in the Government can answer the question on that.  It is a matter for the British Government.  It needs to be said and it underlines the importance of legislation such as this and of EU instruments because they are designed to facilitate a more streamlined criminal justice process on a transnational basis across member states.  I support this Bill but, like others, I raise the question as to why it has taken so long to come to this House, why there was such a delay in bringing it into the parliamentary process in the first place and, once it came into the D&aacute;il in September, why it took so long to come to us in the Seanad and it needs to be taken on all Stages on the second last sitting day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-12-17a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019121700002#GG00100"><p>I acknowledge the support of Senators.  A number of questions have been raised.  As I previously stated, the importance and value of ECRIS cannot be overstated.  Our objective is the same as that of other member states and I am pleased there is all-party agreement on the content of the Bill and among Independent Senators as well.</p> <p>A number of questions were raised by Senators Mac Lochlainn and Bacik.  ECRIS has been operational since 2012.  It is operated by the Garda on an administrative basis but that does not in any way affect its legality or otherwise.  We are anxious to ensure by the passing of the legislation that it will be underpinned by statutory force, which will set out the requirements of the framework decision.  Once the system became active, it was important that our central authority, once connected to the system, was in a position to execute the exchange of information with the central authorities in other member states, and that is what happened.</p> <p>I acknowledge there was an issue regarding delay.  However, in the Department of Justice and Equality, perhaps more than any other Department, if one takes the criminal law reform side of the house along with the civil law reform side of the house, we have been particularly busy in recent times.  As to one of the reasons this legislation is only coming to the House today, I cite, O cite the fact I have done in excess of 100 hours in this House on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.  With that legislation happily enacted by the Seanad, it will now result in a greater flow of legislation from my desk and from my Department.</p> <p>Senators Mac Lochlainn, Conway and Bacik mentioned the issue of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and, of course, it is true this will present certain challenges in the area of EU directives, in particular those that have been enshrined in legislation in the UK.  These are issues for the future relationship and it would be not appropriate for me at this stage to speculate.  However, I am happy to keep the House abreast of developments as regards the future relationship in the area of security and criminal law, having regard to its importance.  In the meantime, I am very much aware of the value and importance of co-operation and a strong and positive relationship with the UK authorities in sharing, exchanging and comparing notes on this ECRIS-type information, among other types, through a range of criminal justice directives.  It is important that mutually beneficial relationship continues, irrespective of the format of relationships, and that will be seen over the next year.</p> <p>On the matter of storage of data, which was raised by Senator Mac Lochlainn, the central storage will be the central database at the National Vetting Bureau in Tipperary.  On the issue of the use of the system by the Garda on an administrative basis, as I said, that is fully legal and has been accepted by our EU colleagues.  That said, however, it is important that we proceed to statutorily recognise the directive, and that is what I hope we will do in the coming period in the Seanad. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-12-17a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019121700002#HH00600"><p>I am just acknowledging the shaming that happened last week in the Chamber.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill to the House.  It is relatively straightforward, enacting in Irish law a 2009 Council decision relating to the exchange of criminal record information between EU member states through the European criminal records information system, more commonly referred to as ECRIS.  It provides for the exchange and format of such information and is an important part of record sharing between countries in this important area.  The primary policy underpinning the Bill is that there needs to be a certain form of equivalence in the methods by which information on foreign recognition of convictions are transmitted between members states, in line with general European principles of equal treatment for European citizens in different member states insofar as is possible.  It is very much in this spirit that I table my two amendments.</p> <p>As the Minister will be aware, I have conducted considerable work in the Seanad on spent convictions and on legislating for the circumstances under which a criminal record must and should be disclosed, having regard to the interests of the public and the privacy rights of the individual in this regard when deciding the balance.  I am grateful to the Minister and his Government for their support for this legislation as it has progressed through the House.  As the Minister will also be aware, we essentially have two different schemes for spent convictions in Irish law: a general regime under the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016, which can apply to District Court and Circuit Court convictions, and a specific regime for Garda vetting under section 14A of the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012, which applies to District Court convictions.  The general rule is that after seven years, and without reoffending, a single conviction can come off one's record.  A problem arises, however, where an Irish national receives a conviction in another member state and that information is transmitted to the Garda through ECRIS.  As no account is made for foreign convictions in our domestic law, one can receive a conviction in another EU country that if one were to be convicted of here would qualify to become spent.  As a result of this gap in our laws, however, that conviction will never qualify to become spent, no matter how minor the crime.  In a Bill that at its very heart provides for the principle of European communication, equivalence and equality of treatment between how convictions are recorded in member states, this is a major gap in the Bill and must be addressed.</p> <p>As an example of this in action, I was recently contacted by a constituent, following the passage through Committee Stage of my Private Members' Bill in this area, who had had this exact issue.  While on Erasmus as a young undergraduate student in the Netherlands and at a difficult time in his personal life, he engaged in extremely minor shoplifting to the value of &euro;5.  Despite immediately repaying the value and being released from custody on the same day, the student received a &euro;100 fine and a misdemeanour-style conviction, the lowest form of penalty under the Dutch penal code.  This conviction is clearly equivalent to a District Court conviction and if received in Ireland would clearly be eligible to become spent after a period of non-offending under our laws.  When it was transmitted to the Irish authorities, however, my constituent was informed there will never be an opportunity for this extraordinarily minor conviction to become spent as there is no recognition of this when the information is being transmitted.  There is therefore clearly a problem here.  My constituent then contacted the Dutch policing authority about having the record expunged on the Dutch end.  However, because the Netherlands takes a different legislative approach to record expungement, which is embedded in privacy rights and involves certificates of good behaviour, etc., an approach more common in countries that do not use common law, he was told that because there was not an equivalent in the legislative framework used here in Ireland, the Irish authorities could never view his conviction as spent, and that even if same was transmitted to the Irish authorities, they would still refuse to treat it as such.</p> <p>This is my motivation for tabling amendment No. 1, which creates a recognition of foreign convictions and allows for such convictions as received by my constituent to be spent.  It is simply not fair or proportionate for him to be disadvantaged for his entire adult life, particularly as he enters the labour market, for an extraordinarily minor infraction that if it were to happen in Ireland would be eligible to become spent.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If this Bill intends to deal comprehensively with European equivalency and equality of treatment in the area, this major flaw in the legislation could be fixed with my amendment.

I am unable to accept the amendment because it is not open to our national central authority to convert the criminal record information that comes here into our own national interpretation.  I consulted with the Attorney General on this and the advice was that it would be imprudent to accept the amendment.  However, Members will recall we had a debate on Senator Ruane's Private Members' Bill on the matter of spent convictions.  With both these amendments I will see how we could incorporate some of the matters raised by Senator Ruane into her own Private Members' Bill as it progresses through the House to see if we can accord the point she makes in respect of spent convictions.  I am unable to accept the amendment in its current form.</p></speech>

It relates to the treatment of convictions that have become spent under Irish law and the obligation to transmit such spent convictions to other European Union member states in accordance with this Act.  If our laws deem a conviction to be spent, I would be of the strong view that information relating to such a conviction should not be transmitted under this Act.  We have told the individual concerned that after a set period of not offending, this convection would no longer be relevant and it would no longer be a factor.  It stands to reason, therefore, that this would extend to information sent to other jurisdictions, especially as our laws only apply to minor convictions received in the District Court and the Circuit Court.</p><p>There is no explicit mention in this Bill of any such arrangements or for how convictions received by those under 18 would be treated.  This amendment would give statutory effect to those concerns.  I recognise there may be sensitive matters that could require a more detailed disclosure of information and that these are set out in Schedule 3 to the Bill.  I have, therefore, set out that in respect of these matters, it would be section 14A of the National Vetting Bureau Act that would apply to these convictions as these are the equivalent measures used for more sensitive issues here in Ireland.</p><p>I know this matter was raised with the Minister in the D&aacute;il, and whether the legislation would apply to spent convictions and whether they would be transmitted was raised by Deputies Catherine Connolly and Martin Kenny on Committee Stage at the Select Committee on Justice and Equality.  The Minister's view at the time was that the Bill would not apply to spent convictions and that he would take it up with the central authority to make sure.  However, as no amendments were tabled to the Bill on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, there is a need for this provision to be made explicit in the Bill.  I urge the Minister to take on the amendment, which I see as a key part of the reform of spent convictions.</p></speech>

The legal position is that we are obliged to disclose information relating to spent convictions with our European Union counterparts through the National Vetting Bureau Acts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Similarly, central authorities in other member states share their spent convictions information, where it may exist, with our central authority.  This ties in with the earlier point I made, which is that a member state's concept of what is recorded in its criminal records must be respected.  The law at European and national level does not allow me the latitude to manipulate, as it were, the treatment of such information when shared in an international context.</p><p>I will not accept the amendment, but it is an issue that we might be able to revisit in our discussion on Senator Ruane's Bill.  I would be happy to have my officials discuss this point with the Senator in the context of the ongoing discussions on that Bill.  In the meantime, I ask the Senator to withdraw her amendment for the purposes of enacting this legislation today.</p></speech>

Even though the points are similar, how we address them might be a little different.  If we consider something to be spent here, it should be removed completely from every system that exists here.  The Garda vetting bureau or the central authority should not be able to see it or be able to relay to another country that it exists.  We are into a conversation on whether something is spent at all if an institution or a state can still access it.  I am willing to withdraw the amendment, but we must examine the nuances.  What we are going to consider spent in another country is one thing, but if we consider the conviction is spent here we must be able to ensure, for the individuals who receive a conviction that is spent, that it is well and truly spent, regardless of how another country deals with spent convictions.  I look forward to teasing that out with the Minister and his officials over the coming months.</p></speech>

It is my understanding that Senator McDowell in particular is agreeable to this clarification.  I am sure that Senators will agree that those with genuine claims concerning, for example, misconduct or the maladministration of an estate, should not be discouraged from instituting or commencing legal proceedings because of a fear they may be charged with the entire costs of such proceedings if unsuccessful.  The compromise put forward today should meet the concerns of the Senators who drafted the legislation and I ask the House to accept the amendment as currently drafted.</p></speech>

I have now resubmitted them.  The first amendment relates to the increase in the hours for which carers may study or work outside the home without an increase in the earnings disregard from 15 to 18.5.  I am not happy with the report.  Perhaps I have missed something but I went through it over the weekend and it did not really answer the question as to why the number of hours has been increased while the associated financial disregard has not.  I do not think one can be done without the other, as I said.  It has been stagnant for 11 years without an increase.  Unless the Minister can give me clarification, it seems the allowance is not commensurate with the increased hours.  Maybe I did miss something in the report but I studied it very hard and could not find anything.  The Minister said that the report had already been produced so I withdrew the amendment in good faith.  I chased the Minister's office for a little while.  I am not being punitive towards the Minister's staff but I did not find the information requested in this report.  Perhaps the Minister can provide the rationale for increasing these hours without a corresponding income disregard in her reply.</p> <p>I also withdrew amendment No. 2 pending a report but have again resubmitted it.  The number one priority for carers is reform of the means test for carer's allowance.  Alarm bells should sound when we see only one in five carers receiving carer's allowance.  The eligibility criteria are far too strict and actively prevent carers from accessing social welfare supports.  They are put off.  I said that previously.  The eligibility criteria are very strict.  Again, I am not satisfied with the report mentioned on Committee Stage.  I continue to request a review of the means test in consultation with stakeholders.  I spoke to Family Carers Ireland and it is unaware of such a review having taken place despite it being the main body representing carers throughout the country.  Will the Minister outline when the stakeholders were consulted and whether Family Carers Ireland was consulted?  If not, I will push for votes on both amendments.</p></speech>

This increase to 18.5 hours will accommodate increased participation by carers in the workforce or in training and will, it is to be hoped, strengthen their connection with the workforce and serve to ease them back into the workforce once their caring duties are over.  As a result of that increase from 15 to 18.5 hours, we expect that some 1,200 additional family carers will now qualify for the payment.  It is estimated that this will cost just under &euro;12 million.  Any carer currently working fewer than 18.5 hours a week can now avail of additional hours.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, in deliberating on the measures for budget 2020, we did include an examination of the disregard for carer's allowance.  In its pre-budget submission, Family Carers Ireland looked for an increase in the disregard for carer's allowance of &euro;117.50 for a single person and &euro;235 for a couple per week.  My Department costed this proposal using the ESRI's SWITCH model and, allowing for income tax and working family payment offsets, the net cost was estimated to be some &euro;55 million.</p><p>Changes to schemes were considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence-based perspective.  The Senator is aware we only had &euro;130 million to spend this year in total, so we needed to make sure any money we spent hit the spots that needed it the most.  When we looked at the people who were in receipt of carer's allowance, some 92% of current recipients have no means, so increasing the disregard would not have made any difference to them.  The overwhelming majority of carers who can benefit from the change from 15 to 18.5 hours can do so with no impediment.  The existing income disregard and means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance is the most generous of any disregard within the social welfare system.</p><p>I sometimes find that when we have this conversation about the value of care, we talk about this as if it was a payment as opposed to an income support.  We have to be grounded in the fact the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection supports people who have no other income.  It does not make a payment for a service; we support people who have no other income.  The weekly earnings disregard is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  At 18.5 hours work per week, this is equivalent to an income of &euro;36 per hour worked in a two-person household and &euro;18 per hour in a single-person household.  This indicates there is significant scope for carers to increase their working hours without impacting their payments in any way.  In fact, only 0.1% of current carer's allowance recipients have means of between &euro;250 and &euro;300 per week, so it is unlikely they will have any of their payments reduced as a result of increasing their hours, either in work or in training, from 15 to 18.5 hours.  Carers who would benefit from an income disregard are those in higher income households.  Given the need to target the available resources fairly and equitably to those people who are most in need, allowing an increase in the number of hours was the best use of the limited resources available.</p><p>With regard to the second amendment, the Senator may not be aware, although I hoped it was in the report I gave her, but we held a comprehensive policy review of carer's allowance.  It was conducted by the Department over the previous 12 months and laid before the Houses on 28 August 2019, so it is a matter of record and it is with the Oireachtas joint committee.  In addition, on 15 August, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also published a spending review of carer supports.  Among its key findings was that of the &euro;1.4 billion spent on carer support programmes in 2018, carer's allowance amounted to 77% of that overall expenditure.  Given how little time has elapsed since those two reports on 15 August and 28 August last, there is genuinely little benefit in doing another exact same report, given it is the same period we would be looking back on as for the two reports that were laid before the Houses.</p><p>I assure Senators that I, as a member of the Government, and the whole of the Government are very aware of the key role that carers play, which is why I am so keen for us to have a conversation about the value of care, arising from the Citizens' Assembly that will start in January.  Most of the times we have this conversation, either in this House or the D&aacute;il, we talk about the value of care as if we were paying for care when, in fact, what the State does at present is support with an income support those who have no other income, and that does not include all of the people who are giving care.  We need to have a national conversation about the value of care.</p></speech>

This amendment asks for a report.  I acknowledge that in August, when we were all on the holiday break, a report did come out.  However, this amendment is concerned with the impact of the increase to 18.5 hours and it seeks a report.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not asking for an increase of the income disregard but for a report on the impact of it.  The Minister&rsquo;s report was laid before the Houses in August, which was holiday time.  I have sought specifically in the amendment to include Family Carers Ireland as a key stakeholder.  They were unaware that the review was taking place.  I will press the amendment. </p></speech>

What I said in the report I gave the Senator and again in my most recent contribution is that 92% of the people who currently receive carer's allowance have no means and, therefore, increasing the disregard will have no effect on them whatsoever.  Only 0.1%, the tiniest percentage of people receiving carer's allowance, have means of between &euro;250 and &euro;300 a week.  Increasing the means threshold would affect only that 0.1%.  That is the report we did in preparation for the budget and that is exactly what I gave the Senator.  If she presses the amendment, that is exactly what I will provide to her.  I am in the Seanad's hands.</p></speech>
