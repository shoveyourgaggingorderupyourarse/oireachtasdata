I cannot believe that I am once again here talking about paying student nurses and midwives.  I ask the Minister of State to take my pleading back to the Minister for Health to sort out the pandemic payment for student nurses and midwives.  It is unbelievable that this is still going on.  A year ago, I introduced a piece of legislation that would allow student nurses and midwives to be paid.  The Government, cynically, did not oppose the Bill.  In fact, it let it proceed to Second Stage and be sent off into the ether rather than face a bad headline of once again simply refusing to acknowledge it or to commit to paying student nurses and midwives.  Whatever about the argument that student nurses and midwives are not working and, accordingly, whether they should therefore be paid, that is a little bit beyond the scope of what I am here to speak about today.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State why student nurses and midwives have still not been paid the promised pandemic payment.  I have spoken to a number of student nurses and midwives around the country, and they want the Government to put its money where its mouth is and instead of clapping for them, to pay them the promised pandemic payment.  Students were deployed to fight this virus and while the Government did pay them the rate during the first wave, they ended up working during the much more aggressive second and third waves free of charge.  Student nurses and midwives took on the same workload as nurses while still balancing learning the skills required as part of their college training placement.</p> <p>I will not lie.  After two years of this pandemic, with all that we asked of student nurses and midwives and all that they did on the Covid-19 front line, I was almost apoplectic when I learned that the reason their payment, for which they have been fighting tooth and nail, was not yet paid was because a memorandum had not yet been written.  It is a very hard pill for student nurses and midwives to swallow that they are not getting a payment they had been promised from September, one I was told had been approved by the Cabinet before Christmas, but although it is now February, nearly March, because a memorandum has not been written.  That is beyond unseemly.  It is extremely frustrating for student nurses and midwives.</p> <p>It is unbelievable that we have left struggling student nurses and midwives, and have not paid them this meagre contribution given that they held the hands of dying patients at the height of the pandemic when their family could not be there for them.  They cared for elderly patients on wards and played a crucial role in keeping the lights on and the doors open while Covid consumed the health service, all while they were students and supposed to be learning and on placement, upskilling and training to get the technical skills that are so desperately needed on their part.  The pandemic payment is not a whopper.  I believe it is &euro;100 a week, which is not insignificant.  It is incredible that it has not yet been paid.</p> <p>I would contest that student nurses and midwives are currently working for free, but the Government has the power to change that.  The Minister of State will probably tell me that the reason they have not been paid is because a memorandum has not gone out and that someone else has not done the work.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ultimately the Minister for Health is in charge of ensuring that student nurses and midwives are being paid.  That memo went to Cabinet and my understanding is that it was agreed by Cabinet.  As I said, it is unbelievable that we are in this situation.  It is February, nearly March, and student nurses and midwives are going to be coming to the end of their academic year very soon and they still have not been paid.  Why has this happened and, most important, when is it going to be rectified?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-22a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022200002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue.  It is not the first time she has taken to her feet to raise this.  A key Government priority is to protect the education of all students,  including student nurses and midwives.  Clinical placements account for 50% of the overall education programme requirements for student nurses and midwives and supporting students to undertake clinical placement remains a key priority for the Government.  In early 2021 the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, directed a longer term review of matters relating to student nurses and midwives to be undertaken.  He appointed Mr. Se&aacute;n McHugh to carry out this important work.  In November 2021 following consideration of the recommendations within the McHugh report, Government approved the Minister's interim proposals to provide significant additional supports, worth &euro;12 million, to student nurses and midwives while attending their clinical placements.</p> <p>For supernumerary students these proposals extended the pandemic placement grant, PPG, of &euro;100 per week to all eligible nursing and midwifery students on placement for this academic year backdated to September 2021.  In addition, the McHugh report sets out recommendations to enhance the current travel and subsistence scheme for students in attending their supernumerary clinical placements.  The Minister will consider these further so that a permanent enhanced scheme can be developed that will provide a targeted and more equitable approach to supporting students in undertaking supernumerary clinical placements, to be in place from September 2022.</p> <p>In the meantime the Minister has doubled the weekly cap on vouched accommodation allowance to &euro;100 per week of placement for supernumerary students needing overnight accommodation away from their normal place of residence in order to attend some of their clinical placements, which is also backdated to September 2021.</p> <p>In regard to internship students on rostered placement, work is ongoing to progress other recommendations within the McHugh report, including increasing the salary of intern students to 80% of the staff nurse salary.  In the meantime we are providing student nurses and midwives on paid internship placement with additional support of &euro;50 per week of placement, amounting to &euro;1,800 in total.  This is for the duration of their internship and is with effect from January 2022, the same date as paid internships for the current academic year began.  </p> <p>To go to the nub of the Senator's question, on 22 January 2022 the Department issued sanction to the HSE regarding these additional supports and requested that payment be prioritised.  Yesterday the Department was informed by the HSE that it is finalising a memo to be issued to services to provide for payment.  As part of this process the draft communication has been shared with representative groups.  After the memo is finalised and issued, the HSE has confirmed payment will follow the normal lead in time for routine payment cycles which I believe is fortnightly.  The Department has once again emphasised to the HSE the importance of expediting these payments.</p> <p>In conclusion the Department has also commenced its work on the recommendations from the McHugh report that are applicable to the next academic year, and in this regard the Minister intends to bring a detailed proposal to Government in due course.</p></speech>

We understood the memo had very recently gone out.  The review is extremely welcome and I urge the Minister to enact these recommendations with haste.  It is all well and good that this is going to be sorted out soon.  I note there is no set date yet.  It is still somewhat in the hopefully not-too-distant future, which will bring student nurses and midwives some comfort but it will not help them backdate anything.  Backdated payments are all well and good if you can afford to have a backdated payment.  However, landlords are not going to take backdated rent, Vodafone will not take a backdated bill, and Tesco is not going to take a backdated payment for groceries.  I am sure the Minister of State understands how deeply frustrating this is for students nurses and midwives.  They go in every single day and do their absolute best and they are exhausted.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are wrecked.  The pandemic payment is a small payment and it immensely frustrating for those student nurses and midwives.  My phone is literally hopping in front of me with people asking when they are getting this, on which date and what is happening.  We cannot have stuff backdated all the time.  I hope that this can be sorted very quickly.</p></speech>

Yesterday the Department was informed by the HSE that it is finalising a memo to be issued to services to provide for payment.  The Department has, once again, emphasised to the HSE the importance of expediting these payments.  The Senator is quite right.  It is exactly as she said.  They are student nurses and they have been guaranteed this payment.  It needs to happen very quickly.</p> <p>In conclusion, I just want to make some additional remarks.  I want to inform the House that the overwhelming majority of student nurses and midwives have availed of the Covid vaccination, which has been a significant contributing factor to ensuring that clinical placements have continued with minimal disruption.  I want to commend all student nurses and midwives in this regard. </p> <p>Second, to ensure that appropriate oversight of support is in place for students, the clinical placement oversight group has remained in place and reports to the chief nursing officer in the Department.  </p> <p>I will again raise the Senator's issue.  We are nearly there but nearly is not good enough.  They need their back money and I do appreciate that.</p></speech>

I am raising this matter about the adult metabolic services at the Mater hospital in Dublin.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the importance of the work that this unit does.</p> <p>However, it is, unfortunately, significantly under-resourced.  There are much-needed resources required for this unit to operate at a reasonable capacity.  At the moment, it is not operating to its capacity at all.  It certainly is not reaching its potential and, sadly, it is not reaching the potential that it could achieve for the patients who are suffering.  I am thinking particularly of the patients who are diagnosed with phenylketonuria, PKU.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of how debilitating PKU can be.</p> <p>From birth, many children who are diagnosed with PKU find that their eating habits have to be completely altered.  They are isolated from their peers even when they go away on school tours, trips away and so on.  They have to have a special diet because of their condition.  This continues into adulthood.  A friend of mine has it and it is a daily struggle in terms of just putting together a diet that one would feel satisfied with and one would feel they are fulfilling the best they can in life.  That is a huge strain on people.  It is a huge strain on people&rsquo;s mental and physical health.</p> <p>We have, as a society, a responsibility to do all that we can to support these people who are a small minority of our population.  Yet, Ireland has double the European average of people who suffer from PKU.  Many medicines are being trialled but, unfortunately, they are not being trialled on adults because the resources are not there and the expertise is not in place at the Mater to do so.  I am thinking, particularly, of a drug called Kuvan.  Perhaps the Minister of State is aware of this drug.  It is a new drug and it is believed it can revolutionise the lives of people who have PKU.  However, it is no good to people in Ireland who are suffering from PKU because the drug is not being trialled at the Mater hospital.</p> <p>Kuvan is just one drug.  I believe there is much research internationally being done on PKU.  There are many drugs at pretrial and trial stage in other countries.  However, we are a long way down the line from ever being able to trial those drugs in this country.  </p> <p>PKU sufferers are citizens of this country as well.  They pay their taxes the same as the rest of us.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are citizens and they have the same right to access to proper, decent healthcare and the potential to have access to new medicines that can and would transform their lives.  We have spent a great deal of money on health over the past number of years for the good reason that we were in a pandemic.  The spend on health in this country has increased year-on-year dating back over the past ten years.  The health budget is &euro;24 billion.  When &euro;24 billion is being spent on health, all citizens should have a reasonable expectation that they are going to benefit from it.  This unit in the Mater hospital needs investment.  It needs to be tooled up and resourced so that people who are suffering from PKU will have the same access as their European counterparts to ground-breaking medicines that will change their lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-22a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022200002#E00200"><p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address the House on this important matter, which I am taking on behalf of Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.</p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital is the designated site for the National Centre for Inherited Metabolic Disorders for adults.  This centre provides assessment and treatment to adults with inherited metabolic disorders.  It is also responsible for the diagnosis and management of these patients.  Inherited metabolic disorders include a diverse group of rare conditions that can result in significant morbidity and mortality.  Presentation may occur at any age.  With advances in healthcare delivery and new therapeutic interventions an increasing number of affected children whose lifespan previously would have been severely curtailed are now reaching adulthood.</p> <p>The adult metabolic service in the Mater hospital provides multidisciplinary care for patients with metabolic disorders.  These disorders include phenylketonuria, PKU, which the Senator has spoken about, galactosemia and lysosomal disease.  This important service helps patients to manage their conditions with optimal diets that match their metabolic needs.  The HSE has informed me that current staffing in this important service at the Mater hospital is 12.5 whole-time equivalents.  This team includes consultants, non-consultant hospital doctors, nursing staff, dieticians, a medical social worker, a psychologist and administration staff.  Currently, approximately 900 adult patients attend the metabolic service at the Mater hospital.  It is anticipated that will increase by at least 100 additional patients per annum over the next five years.  These additional patients will include transition patients from the paediatric services located in Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at Temple Street.  In addition to the above, the centre tests patients' responses to therapies for PKU treatment.</p> <p>Since August 2019, newborns diagnosed with PKU have been tested in CHI at Temple Street and treated, when responsive, with Kuvan.  There are also a number of patients with known dietary requirements who have been trialled on this medication.  Once a child is placed on Kuvan, this treatment is expected to be lifelong.  To date, access to Kuvan has not been available for PKU adults attending the centre at the Mater hospital, other than for three patients who received ongoing approval following an earlier phase 3 clinical trial extension. </p> <p>I have some good news for the Senator.  I have been informed that the HSE and the Mater hospital have now agreed appropriate funding levels for 15.6 whole-time equivalent staff and the Mater hospital is commencing this recruitment process.  With this resource in place, the centre at the Mater hospital will begin to expand the service to meet current and future requirements.  This resource will also support provision of Kuvan trialling and monitoring for appropriate patients with PKU.  I am assured that the HSE and the Ireland East Hospital Group remain committed to the progressive development of metabolic services at the Mater hospital and to improving this service for patients of the Ireland east region.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-22a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022200002#E00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive update.  It is very positive news.  I sincerely hope that the recruitment of the additional three or four whole-time equivalents happens and that it does not fall into the HSE ambitious plans for recruitment that does not happen.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is specialised and critical and I imagine it will have to be an international recruitment process.  The reason people want adults to avail of Kuvan, in particular, relates to the fact they have seen its success with children and the difference it makes.  The adults the Minister of State mentioned who are continuing to use it in their lives following the trial have benefited from it.</p><p>Given there are clear benefits and the results speak for themselves, it is essential that this happens.  I sincerely hope the recruitment will happen in 2022, with Kuvan rolled out this year also.  The Minister of State might stress to the HSE, perhaps even in writing to the chief executive, the need to put this on the priority recruitment radar, even above and beyond other recruitment, in order that it will be made a top priority of the HSE.</p></speech>

As he will have heard in my earlier response, it is anticipated the number of patients presenting will increase by at least 100 per annum over the next five years, so we have to build capacity.  There are currently 12.5 whole-time equivalents in the adult metabolic service at the Mater hospital and that figure will increase to 15.6, or an additional three posts.  That is welcome and recruitment should be commenced as a matter of priority.</p> <p>The recruitment of the additional staff agreed between the hospital and the HSE will enable the service to expand to meet future requirements, including the provision of Kuvan trialling and monitoring for appropriate patients with PKU.  As I said earlier, children who are put on the drug remain on it, but it is not as accessible for some adults.  I will certainly convey the Senator's concerns to the Minister for Health and I thank him for raising the issue.</p></speech>

I seek an update on the progress of the roll-out of the programme on women's health announced in budget 2022.  Budget 2022 included a number of announcements relating to women's health, one of which involved the provision of free contraceptives for 18 to 25-year-olds.  It is my understanding this is due to happen from August.  A survey carried out by Plan International Ireland has found that many females have decided they are going to avail of the offer.  Will it begin in August?  Will someone who is almost 26 years old be cut off when they turn 26 or can they continue for a year or two?</p> <p>A total of &euro;10 million of the funding will be used to address period poverty.  One survey has found that many females aged between 12 and 19 have found the cost of sanitary products to be very difficult.  Some public buildings have started to provide free sanitary products, as have some local authorities.  Similarly, in Scotland and New Zealand, free period products are offered to all those who need them.  Who will be in charge of the programme in Ireland and will we be able to match what is being done in Scotland and New Zealand, for example?  What will be the nature of the roll-out in schools, universities and colleges?</p> <p>There was also an announcement relating to the funding of four menopause clinics, a really important area.  The first one has opened, in Dublin.  Will the other three be spread out among the regions or will they all be Dublin based?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For example, will there be one in Munster and another in Connacht?

That this Oireachtas has finally placed such an emphasis on women's health is a positive outcome.  It is great to hear the different voices in both Houses all supporting one another.</p> <p>My Department is committed to improving women's health.  Since the establishment of the women's health task force in 2019, we have engaged with women all over Ireland.  We have listened to what they want from their health service and we have taken a number of positive steps to improve women's experiences of healthcare and health outcomes.  We are building supports for tackling period poverty.  The Government has supported the Free Provision of Period Products Bill 2021, taking into account the recommendations of the period poverty in Ireland discussion paper.  A cross-governmental period poverty implementation group is co-ordinating the development of interventions recommended in the programme for Government, the discussion paper and the Bill.  More than &euro;700,000 has been allocated to my Department in 2022 for initial period poverty measures.  I hope to have more detail on the Senator's question about schools and universities soon.  I would be happy to return to the House and update it on the matter.  We are currently working on HSE-led initiatives for members of the Traveller and Roma communities in the south east as well as projects in collaboration with local authorities, for which the majority have already submitted expressions of interest.  We are reaching out to the voluntary sector, including food banks, to support as many people as possible.</p> <p>Following up on the programme for Government commitment, we are preparing to introduce free contraception for women, starting with 17-to-25-year-olds.  Funding of &euro;9 million has been allocated for 2022.  The scheme will provide the cost of prescription contraception, two GP consultations per year and fitting, removal and check-ups for long-acting reversible contraceptives; and additional training and certification for medical professionals to fit and remove long-acting reversible contraceptives.  Contraceptive options will include contraceptive injections, implants, coils, the patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill, including emergency contraception.  As such, it will not be limited to oral contraceptives only.  Expanding the scheme to further age cohorts can be considered once we have had a chance to monitor and evaluate the 17-to-25-year-old scheme and ensure that it is working smoothly.</p> <p>We anticipate significant progress with the roll-out of a number of specialist menopause clinics this year.  In 2021, a specialist menopause clinic was established under the governance of the National Maternity Hospital, the first publicly funded clinic of its kind.  Budget 2022 provided the necessary funding to enable the roll-out of an additional three specialist menopause clinics.  As to the Senator's question on whether they will all be Dublin based, she will be delighted to learn that they will not be.  There will be one in Galway, one in Cork and one in Limerick.  The three new menopause clinics being established in 2022 will be part of the maternity networks in the South/South West, University Limerick and Saolta hospital groups.  This provides a good catchment area around the country.  As I understand it, the operationalisation of the new clinics will be dependent on resourcing the necessary staff.  In this regard, the HSE's national women and infants health programme has advised that the engagement with the relevant hospital groups is progressing as planned.</p> <p>Across each of the issues raised under this Commencement matter - period poverty, contraception and menopause - we are committed to progressing the agenda and advancing women's health experiences and outcomes.</p></speech>

It is great to know that the programme is on course to deliver within the timeframe.</p> <p>Regarding my first question, I am still unsure as to whether the free contraception programme will start in August.  I assume from the Minister of State's answer that it will.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The fact that it is to be reviewed for an older cohort once it is up and running is very welcome.</p><p>I am delighted that University Maternity Hospital Limerick has also been included in the clinics.

It is an area that has been forgotten for a long time so it is very welcome news.</p><p>The Minister of State also spoke about the inclusion of food banks.  There are people in poverty who go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and such places.  It is important that there is engagement with those places regarding the provision of products.</p></speech>

I agree with her; that is why the food banks were mentioned.  Like she said, the likes of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are important.</p> <p>My understanding is that free contraception will commence in August as planned.</p> <p>I will touch on one point that was not raised but that comes under my remit, which is perinatal mental health supports.  We currently have six main hubs across the country.  All 13 spoke sites now have mental health midwives in place under the model of care for specialist perinatal mental health services for women before, during and after their pregnancy.  Sometimes people can have mental health difficulties and to have those 19 perinatal mental health midwives in place throughout whole country is really positive.</p> <p>We have been have been actively progressing a commitment for &euro;31 million in additional funding for women's health in budget 2022.  In the coming weeks, we will launch the women's health action plan for 2022-23 setting out the actions that will realise the investment.</p> <p>I thank the Senator and other women Members of both Houses for raising their voices on women's health.  It is very timely and great to see.  It is great to have the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, support all our calls and have our voices heard.</p></speech>

The programme for Government and climate action plan set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector from 7 megatons of carbon dioxide in 2018 to between 3.5 megatons and 4.5 megatons in 2030.  A comprehensive retrofit programme will be a key measure to support the achievement of this target.</p> <p>We will need to retrofit the equivalent of 500,000 homes to a building energy rating of B2 and undertake the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes to replace older, less efficient heating systems by the end of 2030.  This represents approximately 30% of the housing stock and is among the most ambitious retrofitting programmes in the world.</p> <p>The national retrofit plan was published last November as part of the climate action plan 2021 and sets out how the Government will deliver these targets.  The plan is designed to address barriers to retrofit across four key pillars.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->First is driving demand and activity, second is financing and funding, third is supply chain skills and standards and fourth is governance.</p><p>Recognising that the achievement of our climate action plan targets will require a step change in the pace and scale of delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s residential retrofit programme, the Government has approved a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades to create warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills.  The key measures include: first, a new national home energy upgrade scheme, providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 building energy rating, BER, standard.  That is up from 30% to 35% of grants that were available.  There are a significantly increased number of free energy upgrades for those who are at risk of energy poverty.  That is up to &euro;400 per month, from an average of &euro;177 per month in 2021.  There is a special enhanced grant rate, which is equivalent to 80% of the typical cost for attic and cavity wall insulation for all households.  That is to urgently reduce energy use as part of the Government's response to current exceptionally high energy prices.</p><p>The new initiatives will be funded by the unprecedented national development plan financial allocation for residential retrofit.  That is &euro;8 billion available up to 2030.  More than 60% of this funding, &euro;5 billion, will be sourced from carbon tax revenue.  A total of &euro;267 million has been allocated for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's residential and community schemes and the solar photovoltaic scheme in 2022.  This is the highest ever allocation for the schemes.  The investment this year would support almost 27,000 home energy upgrades, including over 8,600 homes, to a building energy rating of B2.  This is a near doubling of the number of homes delivered to B2 in 2021.  In addition, &euro;85 million funding has been provided by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, for the local authority energy efficiency retrofit programme.  This means that of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million, 58%, or &euro;203 million, will be spent on dedicated energy poverty schemes and local authority retrofits.</p><p>Regarding wood pellet burners, a marginal abatement cost curve was developed as part of the climate action plan.  That was to provide a solid, analytical foundation on the most cost-effective pathway to reduce emissions in line with Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation targets.  In using Ireland&rsquo;s 2018 greenhouse gas emissions projections to 2035, associated projections of economic activity and assessments across 300 business cases for technology, the analysis identifies the technologies, including fuel switches and the associated levels of adoption that are required to meet our 2030 targets in the most economical way.  Our national target of 400,000 heat pumps was derived from this analysis, and Government funding and incentives are aligned with this policy objective, as opposed to other heating systems, such as wood pellet burners, which do not have national targets.</p></speech>

The rising cost of electricity is probably the biggest concern, especially with some of the retrofit innovation.  Heat pumps are probably our largest concern.  They are so tied to the ESB.  This is particularly the case when we cannot feed power back onto the grid.  We are doing so in a very minimal way at present.  That is really an issue.  The sooner that link with ESB is tidied up to be able to feed power back in through the grid, it will be a massive help.  The cost of power when it comes to heat pumps is probably the greatest concern I have in relation to this matter.  I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer.  He has been very helpful.</p></speech>

He is right to ask about the refit tariff.  This is the money that is paid to people for selling their electricity back to the grid.  That process is in train as fast as it can be done.  It will be ready within a small number of months.</p> <p>Regarding the deep retrofits, our analysis says that approximately 50% of homes need their attic insulation redone and  that they would get a great return on investment by doing that.  Attic and cavity wall insulation are the two most cost-effective measures.  For somebody who spends &euro;500 on getting their cavity walls and their attic insulated, the Government will pay &euro;2,500 on top of that &euro;500.  That means that they will make back about &euro;300 a year.  It means that their return on investment of &euro;500 down will be made within less than two years.  It is a very good way to save money on electricity bills.  It is worth more per year than the &euro;200 that we are putting in people's accounts on one-off basis.  They will get &euro;300 every year thereafter.  We are very keen that as many people as possible take that up.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a very affordable scheme for people who are not on welfare but are on low pay.</p></speech>

It is a great pleasure to have them in the Chamber for today's business.</p> <p>Stoyu z ukrayinoyu: stand with Ukraine.  I was on the phone this morning to my esteemed friend and colleague, Yevheniya Kravchuk, who is a Ukrainian parliamentarian, speaking about the current situation in Ukraine.  It is imperative that we condemn the actions of the Russian President, we stand with Ukraine and we demand sanctions.</p> <p>On a lighter note, I thank the Cathaoirleach for his very warm welcome to Athy Sing and Sign Club.  They are an incredible group of young people, led by the inspirational Maggie Owens, who has a super choir that signs everything they sing.  They came to Leinster House this morning and signed the national anthem for the Cathaoirleach.  It is wonderful when we see innovative people and communities like this throughout country and we need to celebrate them.  It just happens this group is from Kildare, but they are very appreciative of the Irish Sign Language Act that was brought through the House.</p> <p>I will also raise the issue of affiliation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, for the Defence Forces.  I understand the reason my Commencement matter on the issue was ruled out of order, but I will very briefly raise it now.  In essence, we know public pay policy is set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the public services committee of ICTU, but PDFORRA and other Defence Forces personnel cannot influence this because they are not members of ICTU.  It is simply wrong that while members of the Defence Forces are currently beneficiaries of the public sector pay determination process, they are, in fact, precluded from participating in any meaningful way because their representative bodies are not permitted to affiliate with ICTU.  It is vital they are offered the support of ICTU prior to the commencement of any pay review and this should happen within the next four weeks.</p> <p>Yesterday, I met Caoimhe O'Connor from Newbridge, who is graduating from the special needs assistant, SNA, course in University College Dublin on Thursday.  She reminded me of the meeting I attended of the north Leinster branch of F&oacute;rsa union representatives, who were very clear in their demands for respect for the SNA campaign.  It is very important that SNAs, especially those who have done this particular course, receive the appropriate accreditation and that they have a more professional qualification at Quality and Qualifications Ireland level 6, which would increase the standing of SNAs in the school system and secure proper recognition for their work.  I am happy to say I will have a meeting with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, on this and other educational issues tomorrow, but this has to be a priority.</p></speech>

I also join with colleagues in welcoming Lord Mayor Kelleher and his son to the Chamber.  It is a very prestigious position to be Lord Mayor of Cork, our second city.  I wish him well during his trip to Dublin and for the course of this very important year.</p> <p>The Cabinet is today approving the disbandment of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and the removal of most remaining public health measures, including the wearing of masks.  It is appropriate this House sends a very clear "Thank you" to NPHET, Dr. Tony Holohan and Dr. Ronan Glynn for the outstanding work they did during this pandemic.  From the very start and the very first press conference, right through to now, their communication skills have been outstanding.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They were conservative in their approach but that approach saved many thousands of lives.  It is also appropriate to thank the people who support them.  We think of Paul Reid and Damien McCallion and the team at the HSE.</p><p>They did not get everything right but nobody gets everything right.  In the fullness of time, lessons will be learned for future pandemics from what we achieved and did not achieve during this pandemic.  The critical point is that everybody proceeded with the best of intentions and the ultimate goal of protecting public health and saving the lives of our citizens.  They did a damn good job.  On behalf of this House, I propose that the Leader send a letter to Dr. Glynn, Dr. Holohan and the HSE and its management team.</p><p>I pay particular tribute to public health mid-west in my area.  One looks at Dr. Favier and people like her and the manner in which they went on local and national radio.  They were very clear, distinct and articulate in selling the necessity to abide by the public health measures.  At a local level, I acknowledge the great work done by public health mid-west, not just during the pandemic but prior to it.  I know that work will continue post pandemic.</p><p>It has come to my attention that the blind and visually-impaired students who are doing the leaving certificate this year will not have access to digital examination papers.  Modern technology - iPads, computers and sign readers - has done such wonders for visually-impaired young people in terms of being able to communicate, do their business and study for their examinations.  I remember when I, as a visually-impaired person, did my leaving certificate 30 years ago.  Despite what is available now and the opportunity technology provides, the Department of Education is still so antiquated that it does not provide examination papers in digital form.  I would like the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Health.  Perhaps the House will have a discussion on it.</p></speech>

It is a testament to the Seanad that we are not afraid to recognise and bring into the House people from any community anywhere in the world who are being subjected to horrendous treatment.  I also welcome the Lord Mayor of Cork.  It is always a pleasure to see him in the House.</p> <p>I know the Leader has an interest in issues relating to aviation.  She must be aware of the change in the law that took effect on 1 January as a result of a European directive on security clearance for people working at airports.  The Garda vetting system is breaking down.  Employers do not know who to contact.  They do not know how to expedite for clearance people who are brought in to work.  We presume, although we do not know, that the clearance procedure involves investigating the backgrounds of family members, as well as the individual concerned.  There is some suggestion that people coming from overseas can be Garda vetted much faster than indigenous Irish people.  We need to look into this fairly urgently.</p> <p>There is much talk about Ireland's seat on the United Nations Security Council and how we won it.  According to an article in one of today's newspapers, we won it with 945 pairs of socks and with umbrellas, badges and notebooks.  Some &euro;125,000 of our hard-earned taxes were used to bring on side the diplomats who would be voting.  It is repugnant to everything the United Nations stands for that these annual competitions should take place for a seat that rotates every 20 years in any event.  There is something terribly wrong, in a world that is full of inequality and hungry, about us throwing out socks, umbrellas and fancy notebooks in order to win a seat on the United Nations Security Council.  It is horrendous.</p> <p>I will move swiftly along to Ukraine and what is happening there today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

If Mr. Putin is that afraid of the possibilities of problems in eastern Ukraine, what he needs to do is to bring it to the United Nations Security Council and let it pick a peacekeeping nation that will look after the needs of the people in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>I have been engaging with the Ukrainian ambassador and her staff over the past few days.  My heart goes out to them today.  They are miles from home and at the end of the day, they have no idea what will happen over the next 24 or 48 hours.  We saw that in the incursions into Georgia, there was absolutely no support.  We cannot allow that to happen in Ukraine.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Green Party-Comhaontas Glas, I convey my deepest sympathies to the family, friends and the DUP on the sudden loss of Christopher Stalford, who represented the people of South Belfast since 2016 and had been the Assembly's Principal Deputy Speaker since 2020.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p> <p>Like previous speakers, the Green Party is appalled by the developments in Ukraine, and the aggression.  The Russians are not only recognising but are occupying the two eastern provinces in Ukraine.  It is in flagrant breach of international law and the Minsk agreements and is a wholesale assault on the sovereign integrity and the territory of Ukraine.  It is a matter to which this House perhaps should devote a separate debate.  Last week, we celebrated 100 years and one thing that was said is that we can play an advisory role to the Government.  We can think differently.</p> <p>Maybe in a debate, Ireland, which has a good solid reputation, could in a most difficult situation pave some small way forward.  At such a debate, I would why Ireland is not one of the following eight EU member states which have signed a declaration on the EU membership perspective for Ukraine, namely, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, the Slovak Republic, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia and Bulgaria.  I believe the Czech Republic and Romania are due to give that support.  It is a complex and challenging matter applying to be a member of the EU.  I would like an explanation.  There may be a reason for it.  There are other countries conspicuous by their absence from that support.  We talk the talk but when Ukraine wanted to come into the EU, which is such a difficult task, Ireland with its credibility was not leading the way.</p> <p>Also, we have learned from the peace process here.  Despite a long-term occupation on the island, it did not stop peace.  It did not stop the silencing of the guns.  Have we something to offer our fellow European neighbours here as we face the worst outbreak potentially of bloodshed and war since the Second World War?  Could we nudge some great peacemakers, like them or not, such as former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, Gerry Adams, Lord David Trimble, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Ms Monica McWilliams, and Liz O'Donnell?  If they were asked, they would bring our credibility and experiences.  It is a precious peace, albeit not a perfect peace, on the island of Ireland but maybe we can bring something to at least trigger bilateral talks, which, according to what I am reading, do not seem to even be happening at present.  There is no sign of bilateral talks.  I note both parties might be reluctant to enter bilateral talks but as a catalyst, even if it is behind the scenes, Ireland, as a credible country, has something to offer on its own peace journey.</p></speech>

I welcome the lord mayor to the Chamber.</p> <p>I echo the sentiments of Senator Martin in relation to the very sudden and very sad death of Christopher Stalford, MLA.  I have known Christopher for a long time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We were on Belfast City Council together.  We travelled on a number of international delegations to the United States, in his role as chair of the development committee and my role as ardmh&eacute;ara in Belfast.  I knew Christopher before that, perhaps not in the same personal sense but certainly in a political sense, as he would often turn up at events wearing Union Jack socks and a pinstripe suit.  One thing you could never take away from Christopher was his commitment to his unionist and, he would say, conservative views and the very articulate and passionate way that he advocated them.  He and I had many disagreements on political issues relating to Ireland but also more broadly.  I have to say, however, that I always found him a great character and a great wit.  After a robust debate, I could join him for a cup of coffee or, dare I say it, even the odd pint, to have a really respectful conversation.</p><p>One thing that struck me in later years with Christopher was the real love and commitment he had for his wife Laura and their four children.  They are first and foremost in all of our thoughts.  Christopher's death is a big loss to them, his broader family, his DUP family and his constituents in south Belfast.  On my behalf and on behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in group and, I am sure, colleagues across the House, I extend deepest sympathies to Laura and Christopher's children.</p><p>I might return to this matter given the limited time I have available to me but the Leader will have seen coverage of our neighbour, the National Gallery, whose staff and a number of artists have taken issue with the award of a particular contract.  I sense your eyes on me, a Chathaoirligh, so I will not go into the specifics around contractual and procurement issues.  Nevertheless, the best artists are those who hold a mirror up to society and challenge some of its worst elements.  Direct provision remains a real issue and a problem and concern for many people across society.  I hope to return to the issue, but in light of what has been said in the public domain in recent weeks about the National Gallery, it is timely for the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, to come to the House to discuss the programme for Government commitment to end direct provision and to give an update on that.</p></speech>

I also extend deepest sympathies, on behalf of the Labour Party Senators, to the Stalford family on the loss of Christopher.  It is a shocking time for the DUP and the wider unionist family but there was shock right across the island of Ireland in recent days when people learned of his passing.</p> <p>The Continent of Europe has entered a very dark period with the events in Ukraine in recent days.  I express my solidarity with all the people of Ukraine.  While the news of the package of sanctions is very welcome and the detail is eagerly awaited, we need to hear a very strong message from the Government about supporting the sanctions.  Ireland is a net exporter to Russia, but we rely hugely on fossil fuel imports from Russia.  We must be seen to be very strong in backing the sanctions against Russia at this point following its acts of aggression against its neighbour, Ukraine.</p> <p>The main issue I wish to raise today relates to the announcement yesterday of the postponement of the citizens' assembly on drug use until 2023.  This flies directly in the face of the Taoiseach's commitment on the floor of the D&aacute;il just two weeks ago.  It runs contrary also to what he said in the Fergus McCabe lecture last year.  We must have an open, honest and detailed conversation about drug addiction and drug use in this country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People's lives, their communities and their families depend on that conversation.  As my colleague, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, who spent many years campaigning on these issues, said, lives are going to be lost.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of lives lost to drug overdoses when compared to every other EU member state.  In 2017 alone <b>377</b>people lost their lives due to a drug overdose.  Many were concentrated in some of the most deprived and disadvantaged parts of this country.  It is, however, important to say this is an issue affecting all of Ireland.  It is not just confined to Dublin, Cork or Limerick or the main urban centres.<br/><br/>There is much anger and frustration at the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.  We had tried to work constructively with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, on the drugs issue since he took up his position but we now need to hear from people more senior than him, namely, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, what they are going to do about drugs policy in this country.  If there is going to be a citizens' assembly on drugs in 2023 - we are told it is going to happen then but it may not - it will be 2024 before the Government can even begin to consider the recommendations.  Are we really going to have a Government make sensitive and difficult decisions a year or months out from a general election?  There is a very serious question mark over all that but the key issue is that we need to hear from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health what their plans are with regard to drugs policy in this country because lives depend on it.</p></speech>

Too often I come into this House and speak about the people we are leaving behind.  On 28 February we are leaving behind our most vulnerable people.  We are leaving behind people in our society with long-term health issues and who will now be living in fear, without the protection of mask wearing.  It is something we need to look at.  We are forgetting about people who have COPD.  I have COPD and I am anxious about people sitting beside me not wearing a mask.  I was on the bus yesterday coming from Donegal and I put my bags beside me because I was not comfortable.  There are many people in the world, especially in Ireland, who are not comfortable, including wheelchair users, people who have cystic fibrosis or other major underlying health issues already.  Unfortunately, this Government has failed to listen to those people and to our elderly people.  It is extremely sad.</p> <p>Last week I met with people from the Respect for SNAs campaign.  The scheme for qualification has not been changed since 1979.  That was more than 43 years ago and we have not looked at changing the scheme.  The Department wants to look at the contracts of SNAs before it looks at the qualifications of SNAs.  I am a qualified SNA and I have a FETAC level 5 qualification.  We might say it is only an SNA.  That is a load of crap.  I am sorry, a Chathaoirligh, but an SNA is more than just an SNA.  We go into classrooms and we are caregivers and educators.  That needs to be respected and recognised and, most important, it needs to be valued.  If we are all serious about giving every child equality of opportunity to be successful within our education system, we need to be serious in supporting that success by supporting our SNAs.</p> <p>The review group is looking at having an expert group to look at the qualifications of an SNA.  I support the setting up of that group as soon as possible.</p></speech>

He was working hard on behalf of the people his community.  I hope Members would join with me in extending sympathy to his wife Rita, their son Conor and, indeed, his family, friends and Wexford County Council, generally, on that loss. </p><p>I, too, want to raise the question of what is happening in Ukraine.  We have previously talked in this House about an increasingly authoritarian Russia and the approach that it has taken.  Russia has now violated the sovereignty of an independent state.  This is a defining moment now for Europe.  Colleagues have spoken as well about how the sanctions we need to see at European level need to be strong.  I believe that every Russian oligarch and their family should be stripped of any EU visa in order to send the message very clearly home to Vladimir Putin.  Certainly, there have been calls that UEFA should withdraw the Champions League final from St. Petersburg.  We should in no way allow the Russians to host such an event.  </p><p>A message needs to go out very strongly from these Houses, that we stand very much in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  Also, I believe that there are a number of political parties and representatives from this island who have been ambivalent in their attitudes towards Russian aggression and we need to call those out.  It has to be very clear that we will no longer tolerate this.  We have seen two of our MEPs, Mick Wallace, MEP, and Clare Daly, MEP, who, quite frankly, are nothing more than Putin&rsquo;s sock puppets parroting the line of the Kremlin.  Those political representatives who have supported Russia over this time need to be called out.  I would hope that our Government would continue to do so.</p></speech>

It is an incredibly sad time for his family - his wife Laura and their four children, the DUP family and the entire political family in the North.  Our thoughts and sympathies are with them today and this week.</p> <p>I want to reflect on the announcement yesterday about the connected hubs in relation to the launch of a mobile app where people can locate a local hub that they can work from.  There is a network of more than 200 hubs that they can choose to work from, a campaign to generate awareness of that and &euro;5 million to enhance the services.  This is about making remote working a more realistic proposition into the long term and providing the community infrastructure to support it.  Some &euro;100 million has been put into making that happen in communities.  We are addressing the barriers along the way.  This is change in motion.  One of the things the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys rightly pointed out yesterday was the need for this to be affordable for people.  She is looking at ways to do that.  Anchor tenancies are a way to do that as well, in terms of bringing in an employee to work on a long-term basis and multiple employees and employers setting up those arrangements.</p> <p>It is not just the Department that can help, it is also Revenue.  We have a remote working tax relief, but that tax relief seems to be only for employers, which can pay their employees &euro;3.20 per day tax-free to work from home.  That should immediately be available for people to work in hubs.  The community gets more from people who will be working as well as spending in the community.  We should be looking at reduced VAT rate for people who are paying it for themselves.  We need to invest in hubs in general to make them affordable and accessible.</p></speech>

Ranks of uniformed and armoured military figures, stripped of their badges and identification tags, converged on protestors, an officer on horseback trampled over a disabled woman, approximately 200 arrests were made and over 60 vehicles were seized by the state.  This sounds like something we would hear about in regard to Russia or actions which we would condemn in Hungary or Poland but instead this is happening in the supposedly liberal democracy of Canada and no condemnation has been forthcoming.  </p><p>To legally permit the level of force, Prime Minister Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act 1988, the first time this Act has been evoked since it replaced the War Measures Act 1914.  Not being satisfied with merely dispersing protestors, the state froze the finances associated with certain individuals and companies believed to be involved in the protests.  These are people who committed no crime and have not been convicted lawfully in court but who the Government decided to punish because they might have been connected with a protest that was inconvenient to the government.  It was an unprecedented act by the state against its citizens, which should be roundly condemned. </p><p>I call on the Leader to write to the Canadian ambassador, H.E. Ms Nancy Smyth, condemning the excessive force used by the government on the overreach that is happening there to its citizens.  Authoritarianism is a threat to democracy no matter whose foot the boot is on.</p></speech>

They are going to be very important to all parts of the country, particularly rural Ireland.  There are approximately 200 hubs in place, with a plan to increase that number to over 400 within the next two years.  That is really good news.</p> <p>The other good news is the announcement today by the Government of &euro;7 million in support for the pig industry.  There are 8,500 people employed in that industry.  Not that long ago, pig farmers were doing very well but now they have hit on hard times.  I welcome that the Minister and the Government have stepped in again.  There are 1.6 million pigs, 300 pig farmers and 8,500 people employed in this industry.  I hope the funding announced by Government will be of assistance to all of those people.  </p> <p>I want now to return to an issue that is discussed here year in, year out, that is, flooding along the River Shannon.  I have been speaking to people who live in the Callows area.  I am told that at this stage thousands of acres are flooded, some of the side roads are blocked such that people have to make round trips or cannot get out and that water levels have risen by almost five inches in the past 48 hours.  We are heading into a crisis there.  I hope that the weather is going to improve somewhat.  It has been horrible over the past number of days, particularly in the west and the midlands.  In that regard, I ask that the Leader would ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, who has responsibility for this area to come to the House to update Members on progress made.  This Government and previous Governments have been very committed to flood relief.  A significant amount of money is there but we need an update in regard to where we are going.  I am aware that improvements are being made but this is a really bad time for farmers along the River Shannon.</p></speech>

It would be a fitting end to a pandemic that on behalf of the nation, we would afford Dr. Holohan an opportunity to address the Seanad on the handling and management of the pandemic.  As a nation, we owe NPHET a debt of gratitude.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We may not have agreed with everything it said, prescribed or did, but, collectively, we stood up to Covid-19.  The actions of NPHET, its management and its honesty saved thousands of lives.  The state owes the members of NPHET a significant debt of gratitude.  I thank them all most sincerely for the work they did, the sacrifices they made, the decisions they took and, most importantly, the professionalism they showed in their handling and management of the pandemic.</p><p>I join with other Senators in asking for a debate on working from home.  The issue of work hubs is a new dimension and they are important and welcome.  Working from home has brought a new dimension to thousands of people's lives that is to be commended, but it is not for everybody and we cannot lose sight of that fact.  There is an obligation on employers, unions, employees and workers, families, children and all stakeholders in society to have a debate on what working from home should look like, what it will mean and what will be the obligations and responsibilities of employers and other important stakeholders, an issue I will return to another day.</p></speech>

It did not mention the price of being a member of a trade union but, thanks to the Labour Court, we now know that price in light of the fact that two very brave young women lost their jobs as a direct result of joining a trade union and of trade union activism.  The 32-page judgment is well worth reading.  It outlines how the case against these two workers was completely fabricated, how cameras in their changing rooms provided footage that was sent directly to management and the appalling victimisation of people just seeking the right to join and be represented by a trade union.</p> <p>It was a good day for workers' rights when the two women got justice got in the court, but the elephant in the room, of course, is that the Ivy restaurant was just implementing accepted policy.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland and the Irish Hotels Federation are absolutely clear that they do not recognise trade unions nor engage in collective bargaining, which is why there is no joint labour committee for hotels that could put a floor of decency back into the sector.  I again reference Dr. Deirdre Curran and the powerful report she compiled just prior to Covid in which she detailed a series of levels of abuse throughout the sector.  They relate not just to breaches of employment rights but also to verbal, psychological and physical abuse of workers.</p> <p>Let us face it: the hospitality sector enjoys considerable lobbying in this Chamber and in the D&aacute;il.  When will this House call on the sector, very simply, to recognise the right to collective bargaining, engage in a joint labour committee process and ensure standards of decency are put back into the sector?  There cannot be more victims like those two brave young women, who just wanted to join a trade union and be represented.  All of us need to stand up.  I ask for an urgent debate on the matter.</p></speech>

Our colleague raised the issue of the unrest in Canada and requested he write to the Canadian ambassador.  Before he does that, we should have a full debate in the House and let all sides of that issue be discussed.  My reading of what is going on in Canada is that it is really an extension of Trumpism, whereby a certain group of far-right protestors, using Covid-19 to further a separate agenda, have intimidated journalists and residents of Ottawa.  I have looked on in amazement.  Everyone in the House is entitled to his or her opinion, but I have every faith the Cathaoirleach will not write such a letter on behalf of one particular side.  If a motion is tabled in this House, where we will all have an opportunity to express our opinions, that is fine, and if it is passed, I will accept the will of the House.  Nevertheless, I would like to have a say, if possible, before such a position is reached.</p> <p>The main issue I raise is one I have been aware of for some time but it was brought into stark focus for me this morning, when I received communication from a resident of Clare.  It relates to the delays in certain medical treatments, particularly hormone replacement therapy, HRT.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have had direct contact with someone who spent seven years just trying to get a diagnosis in the first instance.  After going through all the cost and trauma associated with that, she eventually reached the point where it was accepted that the menopause was the core of the issue.  Now, though, there is an issue with getting the prescribed medicine.  Approximately 32,000 women have faced difficulties in sourcing their HRT medication.  It has been put to me by the woman who contacted me as well as by many others that changing from one medicine to another does not work and has profound impacts on their mental health, given the physical and emotional consequences of same.</p><p>We need to understand why the delays are happening.  Perhaps we need to bring the Minister to the House.  It has been put to me that such delays are not evident in other countries, particularly European ones.  Perhaps the Leader could invite the Minister or a Minister of State from the Department of Health to speak to the House about when the supply chain issue might be resolved for those women who are going through a difficult time as a result of these delays.</p></speech>

We want to hit 40% in the EU by 2030.  That is very ambitious.  Two elements stand out to me where Ireland is concerned.  First, the EU wants to increase the number of cross-border energy connections.  Second, it wants to accelerate the approval process for renewable energy projects like wind farms.  This will be beneficial to Ireland.  The European legislative process has just started and Ireland should use it to look for further funding from the EU to supercharge our wind farm efforts, including offshore.  There is a funding pot for this.  It is called the Trans-European Network for Energy, TEN-E.  Under it, approximately &euro;5 billion can be availed of by EU member states.  It recently updated its criteria.  One criterion is offshore wind.  Recently, the EU placed Ireland in the North Sea offshore grid, NSOG, priority corridor.  Given that the EU is looking at Ireland as a potential wind champion and other member states like Germany and France do not have the same capacity to produce offshore wind energy as we do, this is a good opportunity for Ireland to apply for funding from the EU to supercharge our wind farm plans and concepts.  This might not only allow us to hit our own wind energy targets by 2030, but also to sell excess wind energy to member states that need it.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has been good in coming to this House multiple times to discuss the range of climate action initiatives that are being worked on.  I am calling for a debate on Ireland's wind strategy at some stage, in particular as it relates to offshore wind energy.  That would be helpful for all Senators.</p></speech>

He has been to the fore as regards the Irish Sign Language, ISL.  Athy Sing and Sign has always put it first.  It is a great group led by Ms Maggie Owens along with Ms Linda Dobbyn, Ms Mary Byrne, Ms Breda Moore Flynn and Ms Majella Harris.  Of course, who could forget Mr. Aiden McHugh?  The group promotes ISL at every opportunity and it was great to meet it today.  The Cathaoirleach and the group discussed a number of interesting proposals on progressing ISL <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other sign languages around the world.  I look forward to assisting him in that as it is worked through.  Today's visit was good and appreciated, and I wish to put on the record how proud we in the town of Athy are to have such a group among us.  I congratulate it on the great work it is doing in our community.</p><p>I wish to raise the issue of the lack of GPs.  This is a particular problem in the commuting counties.  I am sure the Leader will have encountered it as well.  I have had representations from Louth, Laois, Carlow, Wicklow and my own county of Kildare.  We have provided housing in certain places and people have come to live and join the communities there, but they cannot find GPs.  It is a major problem in south Kildare in particular.  I have written to the Minister and the HSE.  In its latest reply to me, the HSE stated that it had no role or authority in assigning a GP to a private patient.  Where do we go from here?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These people have young children and are raising young families, and they are driving to Dublin to where their previous GP practices were to avail of services for their sick children.  One can just imagine putting a sick child into a car or whatever in order to get them to a GP in Dublin an hour or an hour and a half away.  It is just not acceptable.</p><p>As I have asked before, we need to have an urgent conversation in that regard and bring the Minister for Health into the Chamber.  With the retirements, etc., of GPs into the future, it is a huge problem for commuting counties and for rural Ireland.  We need a debate on it urgently.</p></speech>

It was asked to do so out of its housing allocation as a matter of urgency but the council's response was that it needed more time.  I understand anyone's plea for more time but when we face a crisis, time is often something of which we have little.</p> <p>Recently, I met with Offaly Domestic Violence Support Services and it is obvious that victims do not have any more time.  They cannot wait; this cannot wait.  People in these areas need help now and I urge Offaly County Council to act now.</p> <p>Last week, Tusla published its review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It highlighted major gaps in services across the country but particularly in the midlands.  Some 62% of people living in County Offaly, 37% of those living in County Laois and a truly shocking 93% of those living in County Longford live more than a 30-minute drive from emergency accommodation.  We need to fix this.  Lack of services for victims is not only a moral failing; it is a failing of our international obligations and we need an immediate solution.</p> <p>Following the publication of the Tusla review, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, listed counties Laois, Westmeath and Longford for prioritisation for the urgent provision of family units.  Laois Domestic Abuse Service has been campaigning for many years for a refuge and Portlaoise has been prioritised for eight family places.  Laois County Council is collaborating to identify a suitable site, hopefully as soon as possible.  We need to see the same level of prioritisation for County Offaly.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy McEntee, will outline timelines and structures for the delivery of safe accommodation and refuge places as part of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I understand this strategy will be published in April and I look forward to reviewing it with a midlands lens.</p></speech>

Research from the UK has found that bus drivers have higher levels of Covid-19 deaths than other occupations.  We also have research that found that 41% of people polled said they were less likely to use public transport after the pandemic.</p><p>I am really concerned that removal of masks as a requirement on public transport will, in fact, damage the safety of those working and those who have to travel by public transport and, indeed, as we have seen, discourage others from using public transport when that needs to be a priority in terms of our wider safety and in respect of climate.  I really urge the Government to rethink its policy public transport.</p><p>What I will speak about today, however, is something even wider and more important in terms of the pandemic.  It is premature to talk about it being over because we know people are dying all around the world.  Last week, the 6th European Union-African Union Summit: A Joint Vision for 2030 took place.  As we anticipated, the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver was a huge issue of trust and damaged trust.  The South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, tweeted that:</p> <blockquote> 	An agreement on the #TRIPSWaiver would strengthen and consolidate our relations with Europe.  If we are not able to reach a solution, this will mean we were not able to find each other on a matter of life and death. </blockquote> <p>This House passed a motion before Christmas on the TRIPS waiver.  We sent a very strong signal that we recognised the urgency of a TRIPS waiver on life and death.  We wrote to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which responded by saying it did have lead responsibility and that the proposal is primarily one of health policy rather than a general trade or intellectual property issue.</p><p>Yet the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, was at that EU summit and he did not speak about it as a life or death issue or as a health issue.  He said at this EU-African summit that we want to avoid the pandemic being used to &quot;undermine innovation or undermine intellectual property.&quot;  I am really concerned that the T&aacute;naiste on one hand tells us it is a health issue, and he acknowledges that, and then speaks on all our behalf in a way that is out of spirit with the statement from this House and with what the Minister for Health said.  He is representing us at a key forum of Europe's conversation with African nations and telling them that he regards intellectual property as a bigger priority than health or life and death.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Again, I hope we can move forward on this.

The Certain Institutional Burials (Authorised Interventions) Bill was published today.  It is a really important Bill.  It is critical that we get this through our Houses, passed, put into legislation, enacted and put into place as quickly as possible.  If I was born, and if those boys over there were born in a different time, I would be in a mother and baby home.  I am an unmarried mother.  When I look at those wee faces, I think of the burials in Tuam.  It is very emotional, even to have them here today.  We need to have this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, on the work that he, his Department and his officials did.  They took on many of the recommendations that were in the pre-legislative scrutiny report.  They have included coronial and scientific expertise in the new Bill, which was not there before.  That is a big move from what it was.  We really needed this and was part of what the children&rsquo;s committee recommended.</p> <p>I really welcome this.

As Local Enterprise Week is coming up, and will take place from 7 March onwards, it is good to get the message out to businesses that there are supporting services out there and that they should apply for them.</p> <p>The other issue I want to raise is my concerns regarding University Hospital Limerick.  I am like a wound-up record at this stage.  I know that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, visited the hospital recently.  There are talks of HIQA carrying out an independent investigation.  Yet, University Hospital Limerick is topping the charts in terms of trolley numbers.  It has been doing so consistently for a long time and certainly, something has to happen.  I acknowledge the Minister met staff and senior management but I believe we need to have a fresh pair of eyes looking at University Hospital Limerick to alleviate the plight of both the staff who are working there and of the patients.  It is about safety as well and that patients feel safe when they visit University Hospital Limerick.  Trolley numbers are definitely very high and have been consistently so for a while.  Something has to happen about it.  I believe it requires somebody independent to review it.  </p></speech>

Some are from Tipperary town, including one to do up a recreational amenity.</p><p>There is a really good application from Ballyporeen for the upgrade of an old school house into a enterprise hub with broadband and a community centre.

Two years ago the name for tourism was "staycation".  It worked very well for the country.  Such a debate should be a priority because so many areas in the sector are under severe pressure.  The hospitality sector is under pressure in terms of staff and in many cases it is looking for permits.  That is something that crosses over to other Departments.  There is a shortage of chefs and a whole range of staff in catering.  Then there is the matter of sterling which is getting stronger.  That could help our tourism sector.  We should be encouraging people from the UK to holiday here.</p> <p>In high-profile tourism areas, we should have very good Wi-Fi so that people visiting can use it for business as well as for pleasure.  This is the time of the year to have such a debate.  The hospitality sector needs a lift.  It is experiencing massive increases in the cost of energy and other things.  There are great challenges and if the House could be of any assistance in highlighting these matters, that would be very welcome.</p></speech>

Some of us had a chance to meet him today and to acknowledge what he said.  It is important to speak to people like him and to hear what they have to say.</p> <p>The European directive for transparent and predictable working conditions, which is due to be transposed in this jurisdiction by 1 August, according to article 21 of the directive.  It is a very important piece of employment legislation that will particularly protect people in insecure or low-paid employment.  It will have important provisions on maximum probation periods and the minimum wage.   Another important provision is that an employer will not be able to advertise a job without setting out clearly a salary scale.  That is something that not only addresses certainty for the applicant but it will also go a long way towards addressing the gender pay gap.  There will be clarity on what pay will be available to people and it give people an opportunity to submit a job application with their eyes open.</p> <p>I do not know what steps have been taken to transpose this legislation.  I do not have that information.  I hope this House will have an opportunity to speak about it because the details of how that is done will be tremendously important.  The way that it is worded and takes effect in Irish legislation will dictate whether it is a strong measure for the employees who need it or not.  I hope we will have a debate on that and have a clear opportunity to look at the legislative provisions that transpose the directive.</p></speech>

I met him at an event in Queen's University on the future of unionism and he was most gracious afterwards when we had a cup of tea and a chat.  He put across his point of view in a very forthright manner but in a way that brought the best out in every part of our conversation.  We extend to his family our regret on his sad loss.

When I heard the news at the weekend, I genuinely realised how fragile life is.  A 39 year old gentleman with an incredibly promising political future ahead of him has died.  We all have no doubt he would have been leadership material in probably the not too distant future.  It is an awful tragedy.  On my behalf, and on behalf of all the Members, I extend condolences to Laura and his four children, to all his constituents, to party colleagues and to all his colleagues in the North.</p> <p>Senator Ward asked how the current EU employment legislation will be transposed.  From my experience of being a Minister with responsibility with employment, unfortunately I have to tell him that it will probably take years to happen.  It took us a long time to get the last miscellaneous provisions Bill passed in 2018 but I will make inquiries with the Minister today and find out.</p> <p>Senator Burke asked for a debate on tourism, which I have scheduled in the diary, but I will see if I can bring it forward now that the days are getting longer and we all have had a spring in our step in the past few days.</p> <p>Senator Ahearn asked when the announcement on the town and village renewal scheme will be made.  I do not know but I will make inquiries today and come back to him on it.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne raised, and not for the first time as she has done so nearly on a weekly basis, as have others, the inefficiencies in University Hospital Limerick that are nearly unique to Limerick.  I am surprised by what she said and that is why I texted her.  I was under the impression that the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il a number of weeks ago had agreed to an independent review and now the Senator has been told the Minister on a visit to the hospital this week has said they are only considering it.  That is not good enough.  I will certainly make known the Senator&rsquo;s views to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Leader of the Green Party today.  We have a commitment to make sure we improve those services.  Hundreds of thousands of euro have been given to University Hospital Limerick in recent years but there has been no comparable improvement in services for the people of that region.  It is not good enough.</p> <p>It is lovely to see people back in the Chamber and around the Houses and normal life returning.  I wish Senator McGreehan and her three little boys well.  It is lovely to see them with their squeaky clean little faces and lovely hairdos and great to see them here.  The Senator raised a really important issue.  I heard the Minister, Deputy Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, interviewed on radio this morning on my drive to the Houses.  He is one of the most thoughtful Ministers we have had in a long time.  I am not being disrespectful to anybody in saying we all have to be a Minister on our first day in office without having been one prior to that.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has taken this issue to heart and has put Trojan effort into making sure this Bill takes into account all of the issues that have been raised with him during the past 18 months.  I have no doubt when it is published this week some people will say it is missing this or that, but he had done an enormous body of work to bring forward the institutional burials Bill.  I reassure the Senator that I spoke to the Minister&rsquo;s private secretary yesterday and there is no doubt we will have this Bill passed by both Houses hopefully by the end of May or the beginning of June.  That should be a priority for all of us.  There are 796 little bodies buried that need to find a connection with their family members.  It is incumbent upon all of us to make sure that happens as smoothly as it possibly can.</p> <p>Senator Higgins talked about the Trade-Relates Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver and the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s perception of what we discussed here before Christmas.  I will certainly convey the Senator&rsquo;s message to the T&aacute;naiste and come back to her on it.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Hackett, talked about Tulsa's recent review of accommodation services presented to Ministers last week and the need for timelines, which I think we will get in a few weeks when the Minister, Deputy McEntee, has finished her three-week public consultation review. </p> <p>Senator Wall talked about the urgent debate that is required for GPs and I will organise that as quickly as I can.</p> <p>Senator McGahon talked about having a debate on renewable energy targets that have now been set at 40%. </p> <p>To answer the question raised by Senator Dooley, I certainly will try to arrange a debate on the topic of the request Senator Keogan raised this morning because it would be very apt to hear wider views on it.  As to why there are delays with the supply chain, having listened to delays of diagnoses of whether women were depressed or menopausal, which they have had to put up with for donkey's years, is beyond belief.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is beyond belief.  I will see what I can find out and come back to the Senator.</p><p>I thank Senator Gavan for raising the issue he did because I was trying to figure out how I would bring it up nobody else did so I am glad he brought it up.  I had the privilege of meeting Julia and Lenka.  Deputy Joan Collins brought them to me a number of years ago.  They are two remarkable women, but they were incredibly vulnerable when I met them because of how badly they were being treated by their employer, the Ivy, the salubrious restaurant down the road.  They were treated despicably by that organisation, and it gave me great pleasure to see the judgment that was handed down.  The only thing that gave me a little bit of sadness was that they did not get four times the amount of money that was awarded to them.  They had been treated despicably.  We should name and shame every organisation that mistreats the people who go in and provide a service on its behalf on a daily basis and who give the best impression of that organisation.  In the back rooms of such companies' premises, these staff are treated so poorly.</p><p>I have been in contact with the two ladies since.  I want to let them know they are the reason we have the new legislation on tips.  They are the reason we started that ball rolling a couple of weeks ago and we had the T&aacute;naiste here a couple of weeks ago.  They are the reason that will make me fight to make sure the service charge is included in the legislation and I have done a bit of research in recent weeks which I did not do when I was in the Department.  The original agreement between the unions and the industry at the time, 48 years ago when service charges were introduced, there was no legislation covering it because it was an agreement between unions and the industry that the service charge would be introduced to make sure the people who were giving you the service got looked after and got paid well.  That was because the wages were always considered too low to earn a living.  There is no reason why any employer should take that to pay for knives, forks, their own bottom line, broken plates or whatever they are having themselves.  It is for the people who serve us and that is where it should be going.  I will work hard with Senator Gavan and others to make sure it goes that way and stays that way.</p><p>Senator Buttimer and others talked about NPHET in view of the fact that it was disbanded suddenly this morning.  Colleagues have raised acceptance and delight at the fact that this time next week we will not have masks and the visible signs of Covid.  Others, such as Senators Flynn and Higgins, have talked about the fact that there still is an air of cautiousness among some people.  As a society, we need to make sure that we recognise both.  There are people who will be gleeful next week and there are people who will still be scared and vulnerable.  We need to make sure we look after those who are scared and vulnerable but also try to genuinely get down to whatever the new normal will be as quickly as we possibly can.</p><p>Senators Murphy and Currie talked about the work hub.  Senator Currie spoke about the connected hubs and the extra 200 we are getting over the coming years, which will be great.  Senator Murphy also sought a debate on the flooding of the River Shannon, which I will organise as quickly as I can.</p><p>Senator Keogan brought up the protests in Canada and I will try to organise that debate on a Thursday afternoon in the coming weeks because it would be interesting to do that.  The Senator is right and she mentioned last week that there was little coverage of its so maybe it is a good time to bring it up.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne talked about the Uyghur World Congress visit this morning.  I note with interest the lovely email we got and I thank the Senator for his reply, which was well drafted.  There is no reason not to shine a light when human rights violations are being made and to sing about them insofar as they should not be done in the quiet or in close corners.</p><p>Senator Flynn asked for a debate on direct provision, which we will organise.</p><p>Senators Sherlock, Martin and Craughwell, among others, talked about Ukraine and the sanctions I hope will be announced at some point in the afternoon.  Each of them are right that the sanctions need to be as loud and reactive to the intolerable actions of the Russians last night as possible.  They should not be tolerated by any part of a functional, normal and democratic society.</p><p>Senator Craughwell showed his dismay at the cost of the 945 pairs of socks.  That sounds silly but you do not get to have a seat on the UN Security Council without lobbying all the people who make a decision.  However, he has a point and he made it well.</p><p>Senator Conway talked about sending a letter to NPHET and looked for a debate on disability and digital papers for students of this year&rsquo;s leaving certificate.</p><p>Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin started the debate by condemning the Russian attacks and she again talked about the lack of ICTU affiliation for our Defence Forces and their powerlessness in talks on their pay.  The Senator also referred to the Respect for SNAs campaign and Caoimhe O&rsquo;Connor in her area, who will graduate as an SNA next week but who will not get the respect she deserves.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As I said here before, the Respect for SNAs campaign deserves all our support in any way, shape or form we can offer it.</p></speech>

Streaming services are now a key feature of everyday life.  They are on our phones, laptops and televisions.  However, regulation of these editorially controlled services has not kept pace with the regulation of broadcasting services.  This Bill will change that and ensure that streaming services are subject to up-to-date rules.</p><p>While the fact the Internet is a key part of our lives has become increasingly apparent, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought sharp focus to this reality.  From working from home to schooling from home, the Internet has enabled us to weather this pandemic in ways that have surprised us all.  While the Internet has had a broadly positive impact, there are risks, however, especially to children.  Some of these risks are online extensions of existing problems, such as bullying.  Others represent new challenges in our digital age, such as image-based abuse.  While we have updated our criminal law for the online age, there has not yet been a way to hold online services to account.  These are key matters this Bill will begin to tackle for the first time.  As such, the Bill's scope is ambitious and includes updates to the regulation of broadcasting services, including radio, television and streaming services.  It also provides for the creation of a new regulatory framework for online safety to tackle the availability of the most serious forms of harmful online content.  This will be done by providing for risk-based regulation of services that facilitate access to user-generated content.  In doing this, the Bill also provides for the implementation of the revised audiovisual media services directive into Irish law.</p><p>The foundations for achieving this ambition are those elements of the Bill that provide for the creation of a new regulatory body, coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, the media commission, which will implement and enforce these new and updated rules.  In order to do so, an coimisi&uacute;n will have a robust and modern suite of regulatory functions and powers and, in line with EU law and best practice, will be wholly independent in its exercise of those functions and powers.  Regulatory independence is key to effective regulation, especially for content regulation, where fundamental rights are so important.  In some parts of Europe, this independence is being eroded.  It is vital that Ireland leads on this issue.</p><p>The powers of an coimisi&uacute;n include the power to fund its operations by levying the services it regulates; to create legally binding regulatory codes; to gather information and appoint authorised officers to conduct investigations; and to seek the imposition of sanctions for failures of compliance, including financial sanctions of up to &euro;20 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is higher.  In the most serious cases, an coimisi&uacute;n may seek criminal prosecution of senior executives of non-compliant services and seek court orders to block access to a service in Ireland.  In respect of broadcasters, an coimisi&uacute;n will retain the power to revoke broadcasting contracts for serious breaches.</p><p>An coimisi&uacute;n will also take over the current functions of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  The staff of the BAI, approximately 40 people, will transfer to an coimisi&uacute;n.  I envisage that an coimisi&uacute;n will need to scale quickly up to a staffing level of at least 160 and in the longer term may require staffing of up to 300.  The Government has approved the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n on an administrative basis, including recruitment of key personnel, prior to the enactment of this Bill.  Work on this is ongoing between my officials, the Public Appointments Service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>While the functions of an coimisi&uacute;n primarily relate to the regulation of services, it will also have wider roles relating to the protection of children, research, education, media literacy, and journalistic and creative supports.  In carrying out these roles, an coimisi&uacute;n will support and promote an open, trusted and pluralistic media and online environment.  There is a widespread problem with the availability of harmful and criminal content on widely used online services.  It is clear that self-regulation in online safety is not working and that oversight and accountability is required.  As regards online safety, the Bill requires an coimisi&uacute;n to regulate video-sharing platform services in line with the directive.  In addition, the Bill provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to designate further online services for regulation from a pool of relevant online services.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In this context, an online service is relevant if it facilitates access to user-generated content.  This covers a very wide range of services, including social media services, many gaming services and online messaging and storage services.  In order to designate an online service, an coimisi&uacute;n is required to conduct a risk assessment of the service, including regarding the prevalence of harmful online content available through the service and the nature and scale of the service.  This approach will enable an coimisi&uacute;n to direct its energies to the areas where they are most needed.</p><p>Once an online service is designated, an coimisi&uacute;n can require it to comply with binding online safety codes.  These codes can require online services to adapt their systems and processes in three key areas which are rules for content moderation and complaints handling; rules regarding the design of the service and how and why it displays certain content to users; and rules about advertising.</p><p>With regard to video-sharing platform services, an coimisi&uacute;n is required to apply the provisions of the directive to those services through these codes. The main aim of the online safety codes is to tackle and progressively reduce the availability of harmful online content on designated online services.  In this regard, the Bill clearly defines harmful online content.  Online content is harmful where it either relates to one of 40 criminal offences listed in the Bill, or is cyberbullying, the promotion or encouragement of eating disorders, self-harm or suicide, or makes available knowledge of methods of self-harm or suicide.</p><p>The schedule of criminal offences includes the offences under Coco's Law, or the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, with regard to image-based abuse, abusive communications and harassment.  For harmful online content which is not criminal in nature, a risk test must be met for it to be considered harmful.  This includes whether the online content gives rise to any risk to a person's life or a reasonably-foreseeable risk to a person's mental or physical health.  The Bill also provides for a mechanism for future categories of harmful online content, both criminal and non-criminal, to be added to this list, subject to Oireachtas oversight.</p><p>The Bill also requires an coimisi&uacute;n to create a super-complaints scheme, under which nominated bodies such as expert NGOs can formally notify an coimisi&uacute;n of a range of online safety issues.  In addition, the Bill empowers an coimisi&uacute;n to audit the handling of complaints by designated online services.</p><p>In summary, the online safety elements of this Bill will ensure that an individual person will be exposed to far less harmful online content and that online services will be required by law to respond to and robustly deal with complaints when they are made.  In this regard, an coimisi&uacute;n will have significant powers of compliance and sanction to hold these services to account.</p><p>As the Members will be aware, I have established an expert group to examine providing for an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill.  The role of the expert group is to examine whether it is practicable to do this and, if so, how it may be done.  The group has 90 days from the date of its first meeting, which was on 31 January 2022, to examine this matter and to report back to me with its recommendations.  Following this, I will then consider tabling an amendment as the Bill passes through the Oireachtas.  If an individual complaints mechanism can be provided for, I would like to ensure that it is.  In this regard, any proposals that I bring forward must be workable and legally robust.</p><p>In terms of the regulation of broadcasting and streaming services, this will for the most part be done through media codes and rules.  Media codes are mostly about the content of programming, including rules for programme standards and advertising.  Media rules, on the other hand, are mostly about the presentation and structure of the service, including rules regarding the time given to advertising, accessibility requirements for persons with disabilities and quotas for European works.  In order to ensure the uninterrupted regulation of broadcasters, provision is made for the existing broadcasting codes and rules to be carried over and become media codes and rules.</p><p>The Bill also provides for the mandatory registration of streaming services to ensure that, in line with the directive, all streaming services established in Ireland are subject to appropriate regulation.  Broadcasters will remain regulated on a contractual basis.  The Bill also provides for the transposition of an optional provision in the directive to empower an coimisi&uacute;n to levy broadcasters and streaming services, including those established elsewhere in the EU, in respect of any revenues that they may make in Ireland in order to fund the production of European works, including Irish-produced works.</p></speech>
