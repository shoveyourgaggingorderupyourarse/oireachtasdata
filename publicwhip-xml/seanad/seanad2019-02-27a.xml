It concerns a school that has over 350 pupils and 75% of the accommodation of which consists of prefabs.  I was in it in the last two weeks and in quite a number of the rooms there were clear marks on the ceilings where water was coming in.  The process of applying through the Department of Education and Skills for a new school building dates back over 14 years.  Full planning permission was obtained for the existing site.  As Carraig Na bhFear is within ten miles of Cork city, the view is that it is going to grow substantially in the next ten to 15 years.  Therefore, the need for forward planning needs to be kept in mind in developing a new school.</p> <p>The board of management and those in charge of working out the details of building a new school came to the conclusion that if they went ahead with the project for which they had received planning, in the not too distant future the school would not be of sufficient size to deal with the growing population and that it would not be possible to expand it further because the site would be surrounded on all sides.  On one side it is bordered by the public road, while on all others it is bounded by housing.  Therefore, they decided the school should move to a new site.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was therefore decided to move to a new site which was acquired with the assistance of the purchase of some land from a community development group, some land from the GAA and some land from a private source.  As a result, there is a far better site on which it will be possible to accommodate good facilities adjoining the school.  The problem is that the proposal has been submitted to the Department which must give consent for an application for planning permission on the site.  It is in that context that I am asking the question this morning.  The board of management is very concerned about the current state of the school where more than 70% of the accommodation is provided in prefabs.  There are 350 students at the school and more than 50 staff members, which includes provision for children who need that extra support.  It is important that we try to move on with the project at an early date.</p></speech>

It provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position in relation to the major building project for Scoil an Athar Tadhg national school.  The project is included in the six-year construction programme for 2016 to 2021 which was announced in November 2015.  The brief for the project is to provide a new two-storey, 16-classroom school with a five-classroom autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, unit.  The board of management of the school is the client for the project and is fully responsible for directing the design team on progress through the design stages of architectural planning.  The board has made a number of changes to the brief over the past ten years and this has resulted in significant delays in advancing the project and bringing it to site.</p> <p>In October 2009, a proposed exchange of the greenfield site for the current school site which had been advanced by the board of management was deemed to be no longer a viable proposition.  The reappointment of the design team was then required following a changed brief to accommodate the new school on the existing school site.  A replacement civil and structural engineer and replacement quantity surveyor also had to be appointed in June 2011 following the withdrawal of the original consultants from the design team.  In March 2016, the board of management requested a further brief change, which included an increase in floor area, at an additional cost of over &euro;2 million.  This brief change was approved by my Department in August 2016.</p> <p>Based on the 2016 brief, the project reached the end of stage 2b in early 2017 and would then have been ready for progression to tender stage.  However, in June 2017, the board of management wrote to the Department requesting a meeting to discuss the possibility of a new greenfield site which the board of management was proposing as an alternative site for this building project.  Following a meeting between the school's representatives and the Department in January 2018, the Department agreed to facilitate the school and its design team to submit a report on the viability of moving to the new alternative site.  The report submitted to my Department in June 2018 included details of a pre-planning meeting with Cork County Council which took place on 30 May 2018.  Following a review of the report, the Department authorised the school and its design team to submit a revised stage 2a, developed sketch scheme, submission based on the proposals for the new site.  The stage 2a submission has recently been received in my Department and a stage 2a stakeholders' meeting is taking place today.  At the meeting, the design team will make a presentation of the proposals to the Department.  As soon as the stage 2a submission can be approved, my Department will be in a position to authorise the board of management to proceed with the new planning application which is now required due to the board's proposal to move the project to an alternative site.  I hope that clarifies matters for the Senator.  I believe the meeting is taking place as we speak.  Hopefully, we will be able to move forward over the next couple of weeks to bring the project to a conclusion.</p></speech>

I appreciate the detailed reply very much and accept that the Department has worked well to try to progress the matter.  It is important to acknowledge that there will be a saving with the new project in the following sense.  If the school was to be built on the existing site, quite a number of prefabs would have to be moved to a new site while the building work was in progress.  In going to a new site, this will not now have to happen.  While I acknowledge today's meeting, my concern is about the timeline for proceeding to planning, which will take three to four months.  I ask the Minister of State for some clarification in that regard.  Will consent for the board of management to apply for planning be forthcoming from the Department within the next two weeks?  That is the clarification the interested parties seek.</p></speech>

In any event, it is pretty new.  The design team will make a presentation to the Department.  I acknowledge that the Senator submitted a Commencement matter on 5 February 2019, which was not selected.  The Department tells me that after the meeting today the submission will be assessed and I believe the Department will be in a position to authorise the board of management to proceed with the new planning application in a short time.  I acknowledge the length of time this has taken to date and the board of management's consideration of a new application and change of site.  The Department has been very efficient in moving project stages forward at all times and is determined to get the project up and running as soon as possible.  Following today's meeting, I think we will see progress within a number of weeks.  I will go back to the Department immediately and ensure the Senator is informed of what happens at today's meeting and how matters are developing.</p></speech>

I seek an extension of the current regulation around stamp 2 and stamp 4.  I know someone who came to Ireland as a student in 2003 on the stamp 2 programme.  The person went to college to follow courses in hotel management and business studies and has studied various other courses since.  The person has been working on stamp 2 for the last number of years and applied for a visa to remain in the State.  A programme for people like this was introduced in 2018 but it was from 2005 onwards and, having come to the State in 2003, the person did not qualify.  The person's skills are not on the critical skills visa permit list and so the person is not eligible under that scheme either.  While the relevant stamp 2 permission was extended in March 2018 for 18 months, the person has been in Ireland for 15 years and contributed to society, including through taxes.  The person to whom I refer is very involved in voluntary organisations and has contributed to the community.  Notwithstanding the charitable deeds performed, the person is being told that once the 18 months are up, there will be a requirement to leave Ireland.  I ask for a review of the case or an extension of the programme for stamp 2 holders back to 2003.  A few people are affected and they have played their part in Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have accepted their taxes for more than 15 years.  They paid to come here to be educated here.  They have worked their way through it, yet we are telling them that in six months they will have to leave Ireland.  It is very worrying for them because they have established themselves here as a member of society and played a fine role in their commitment, not only to the people they work with but also to the community.  A review or an extension of the programme back as far as 2003 would be greatly welcomed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, who is appearing before a committee this morning, sends his apologies.  I welcome the opportunity to address the position regarding the recent special scheme for non-EEA national students.</p> <p>In October 2018, a new scheme to allow certain non-EEA nationals to apply for permission to remain in the State was launched, as the Senator has outlined.  The scheme was open to non-EEA nationals resident in the State who held a valid student permission between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010, and who had not, in the intervening period, acquired an alternative immigration permission, to apply for permission to remain in the State.</p> <p>The scheme addressed a significant cohort of people who had been in the State for a number of years and who form part of the undocumented persons in the State, having moved from a position of having permission to be in the State some years ago to having fallen out of permission.  The scheme provides that permission will be granted for an initial probationary period of two years.  This permission allows successful applicants to remain in the State including the right to reside and work in the State and will be subject to renewal after two years.</p> <p>The Senator may not be aware that this is not the first such immigration scheme introduced by the Minister in respect of students.  The Irish National Immigration Service, INIS, previously introduced a student scheme in 2012, available to persons who had been continuously resident in the State before 2005.  It was called the 2004 student probationary extension scheme.  Thus this group were specifically considered and dealt with under that scheme.  INIS introduced that student scheme to assist in the transition to a new immigration policy regime for full-time students which commenced in January 2011.</p> <p>As a final measure in assisting the transition to the new regime, the 2012 student probationary extension scheme was made available to non-EEA students who first registered their residence in Ireland as students on or before 31 December 2004 and who had commenced their studies in Ireland by that date.  These arrangements allowed eligible students to reside in Ireland for a further period of two years on specified conditions.  Some 2,700 individuals qualified under this scheme and were granted permission.  In addition, at the conclusion of the two-year probationary period those students were eligible to apply for a more permanent status on condition that certain obligations were fulfilled.</p> <p>Accordingly, students who came to Ireland prior to 2005, have already had a scheme and pathway made available to them.  Consequently, it would not be appropriate for the Minister to duplicate the most recent scheme of 2018 for a group already given the opportunity to regularise their status in 2012.</p> <p>I might add that other options are available to persons who seek to regularise their situation in the State, particularly in cases where the person fell out of permission through no fault of his or her own.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1384" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#C00300"><p>I was not aware of the prior scheme.  Obviously the person about whom I am speaking was probably not aware of it at the time and missed the application date.  There are other options and I will certainly explore those.  Is there any way for this case to be reviewed or considered?  This person has contributed financially by paying tax and in the community.  This is a very fine and upstanding person who has contributed much.  Is there any way for their case to be reviewed if they did not apply in time when the scheme was opened in 2011?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#C00400"><p>There are a number of ways in which people can regularise their status.  I will arrange for those methods to be transmitted to the Senator so that she can ascertain if there is a way for this person to receive status.</p> <p>I repeat that students who came to Ireland prior to 2005 have already had access to a scheme to regularise their immigration status.  That has been done.  I understand that somebody might not have known about it and missed out.  The most recent scheme for non-EEA students was devised to address a cohort of long-term residents who arrived in the State between January 2005 and December 2010 and who, after initially holding a valid student permission, fell out of residence permission.  We are doing this on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>These timed-out students who arrived in the State as students prior to 2005 were previously provided with an opportunity to regularise themselves under the 2004 student probation extension which commenced in August 2012.  This scheme allowed those non-EEA nationals, who registered their student permission or commenced studies in the State on or before 31 December 2004 and who had maintained their residence permission as a student since initial registration in the State, to make an application to INIS for a further residence permission.  Those who met the qualifying criteria were granted a two-year residence permission.  Their status continues to be that of a student.  However, during this two-year period they were allowed full access to the labour market.  At the conclusion of the two-year probationary period, students were informed they would be eligible to apply for a more permanent status on condition that certain obligations to be fulfilled.</p> <p>It would not be appropriate for the Minister to duplicate the most recent scheme for a group already given the opportunity to regularise their status in 2012.  I will arrange for the details to be sent to the Senator.  Following that, if she wants to communicate with the Minister's office, there may be ways of doing things.  Not knowing the situation in this case, I cannot comment further.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This relates to the need for the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to make a statement on whether the public services card should be an acceptable form of identification in opening a bank account.  I have received representations from people living in rural areas as well as vulnerable elderly people seeking alternatives when opening a bank account owing to the closure of rural post offices with which the Minister of State will be very familiar given that he represents a rural community.</p> <p>Particularly when rural post offices close, people are being asked to have alternative arrangements to have their pensions or whatever to be transferred through a bank.  A particular elderly lady from Galway contacted me.  She has no passport and will not have a need for one.  She does not think it is right that she should have to spend &euro;75 getting one as a form of identification to open a bank account, in effect to arrange for her pension to be transferred into a bank account where there are no facilities, no ATMs, nothing.</p> <p>The Minister of State will be very aware of this from his constituency.  The public services card, PSC, is a card issued by the Government which verifies a person's identity.  I know it is not necessarily a national ID card.  There was much debate at the time on that issue.  Many people were opposed to it and some people were in favour of it.  It is an issue of the status of the card and whether it can be used as an official identification rather than people being required to go and apply for a driving licence which an elderly person would not have.  In this case the woman does not drive.  She does not have a passport, does not see a need for the passport and feels there should be a verifiable alternative.</p> <p>A considerable amount of money was spent on developing the public services card.  Can this be used as an official ID for this purpose?  I would like to hear the Minister of State's view.  It is a real issue of particular concern for people in rural communities and vulnerable elderly people.  As a result of the shutdown of the post offices this issue has really come into focus.</p></speech>

Currently, the PSC can only be used by public bodies specified in this legislation when conducting a public transaction with the person concerned.</p> <p>One of the provisions set out in section 5 of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 would, if enacted, enable citizens to volunteer their PSC where they wish to use it as a form of proof of identity and-or age.  However, it is important to note that a non-specified body could not request or demand the production of a PSC.  It simply gives individuals the option to use their PSC if they wished, as proof of identity and-or age, in transactions with non-specified bodies.  It is clear from customer feedback that PSC holders should be allowed to volunteer the card to non-specified bodies if it suits them to do so, for the purposes of ID verification.  Customers often report that private companies insist on a State-issued photographic ID such as a passport or driver's licence which they might not have and which attracts a cost.  In contrast, the PSC is free of charge.</p> <p>This proposal provides, therefore, for the card be accepted as a form of identity verification by a private sector organisation or non-specified body, but only at the sole discretion of the cardholder.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 proposes a number of amendments to the Social Welfare Acts, the Pensions Act 1990 and the Civil Registration Act 2004 in addition to provisions relating to the use of public services cards.  The proposed amendments to the Pensions Act contain a number of key measures relating to defined benefit pension schemes.  It is intended that these measures will act to support existing provisions in the Act by providing for further protection for scheme members' benefits and enhancing employers' responsibility for their schemes.  These provisions, in particular, are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  In order to achieve a resilient solution, it has, therefore, been necessary to consult in detail with other Departments and obtain numerous legal opinions.  When these matters have been resolved and the amendments are approved by Government, an early date for Committee Stage will be requested.</p></speech>

I accept the Government is considering amendments and that the matter is complex.  In essence, the Minister of State is telling me that it is a voluntary arrangement with the cardholder.  However, there is no comfort there for these rural people.  They have no IDs and are being forced as an unintended consequence to apply for a passport.  This means an 80 or a 90 year old lady must pay &euro;75 for a passport as a form of ID.  We do not have a national ID card system in Ireland and, as such, there is no alternative.  I must write to this lady today to tell her there is no comfort and that she will have to spend &euro;75.  It is a disgrace.</p> <p>This matter should be looked at.  As a Deputy from a rural constituency, the Minister of State should take the matter on and champion it personally as it is a very important issue.  We have no form of ID for thousands of people who are being told to go through the process of applying for a passport to prove their identities.  I ask the Minister of State to consider pursuing the matter on foot of the genuine concern here.  These are not the people who are kicking up and roaring and screaming every day of the week.  They are elderly people in rural communities who have suffered the consequences of the closure of post offices.</p></speech>

They are eminently sensible and I will certainly advance the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, on whose behalf I am taking this matter.  What I read to the House suggests a provision has been made, provided the person consents to it being used as an ID card.  Certainly, I will get more clarity on that from the Minister and see how we can progress the matter.  The Senator has made a valid and reasonable request.</p></speech>

I seek an update on the development of a primary care centre in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon.  As a person from Ballaghaderreen and as a healthcare professional, I cannot emphasise enough the need to develop this primary care centre in our town to deliver enhanced health services locally.  We all know this is important from the development of primary care centres across the country where people have, rightly, been able to access quality healthcare close to where they live.  The current health centre in Ballaghaderreen is not fit for purpose and the development of a modern, professional space is required to deliver services in our area.  Local people should be able to access a wide range of services, including GP services, public health nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, counselling, clinical nutrition advice and mental health services under one roof in a modern, purpose-built setting.</p> <p>I have been working on this issue for some time and believe strongly in the need for the development.  Last October, the HSE was in the final stages of agreeing a schedule of accommodation and a floor plan for the centre.  I hope the Minister of State can provide an update in this regard and that we have progressed further than the position in October.  Health services locally are under huge pressure and it is important to deliver the primary care centre.  However, a building is just that.  We must also see increased capacity to support people who need to access our health services locally.</p></speech>

The HSE has responsibility for the provision, maintenance and operation of primary care centres and other primary care facilities.  I am happy to inform the Senator that I have received a positive update from the HSE on the proposed primary care centre for Ballaghaderreen.  The centre will be delivered under the operational lease mechanism whereby the HSE leases the accommodation from the developer selected to build the centre to the HSE's specifications.  Preparatory work is progressing to agree the lease to be entered between the HSE and the selected developer.  The HSE advises that the schedule of accommodation to which the Senator referred has been agreed for the proposed centre, which will be located on the Roscommon Road at the site of the current doctor's surgery.  I understand agreement on a floor plan is at the final stages and that planning permission will be applied for once it is agreed.  It is hoped that this will be secured by the end of June this year.  As I am sure the Senator will appreciate, it is not possible to provide an estimated operational date until planning permission is secured.</p> <p>The expansion of community and primary care is at the heart of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I share the commitment of the Minister for Health to ensuring people get the care they need as close to home as possible and have access to a greater range of health and social care services within their communities.  In this respect, Senator Hopkins will welcome the investment in primary care in County Roscommon.  When the Ballaghaderreen centre comes on stream, it will be in addition to the five primary care centres already operational in the county at Boyle, Monksland, Castlerea, Roscommon and Strokestown.  Our investment in Roscommon reflects the Government's determination to develop the primary care sector.  There are now 126 primary care centres in operation across the country, 18 of which became operational in 2018.  In addition, there are approximately 80 other locations where primary care infrastructure is either being developed or is at advanced or early planning stages.  Of these, 12 centres are expected to become operational in 2019.  We must and will continue to invest in the development of primary care centres in both urban and rural areas nationally to enhance and expand the capacity in the sector to deliver high quality, integrated care to people in their own communities.</p></speech>

While it is positive that work is progressing, I emphasise that every effort must be made to ensure there are no delays in the delivery of the centre.  In fact, I cannot overemphasise the importance of the centre to the region nor can I overemphasise the need for capacity provision, which means increased staffing allocations.  By way of an update on the location for those who are interested in the development of the primary care centre in Ballaghaderreen, I understand that it will be located on the Convent Road outside the town and not on the Roscommon Road at the current doctor's surgery.  That is important.  As the Minister of State said, the project needs to go through the planning and other stages.  As such, every effort must be made by the HSE and the Department to facilitate its delivery as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The House has had many debates on the unfolding situation, but it would be good to have a specific debate on the future of Dublin Port.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, needs to outline the plans for the port post Brexit, be it at the end of March or a short time thereafter.  Dublin Port is the State's single busiest outpost in terms of customs checks and Border inspections and whenever the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union happens, it will become much busier.  Its CEO has called it the pinch point post Brexit.  As the Minister has also used that language, it is already known that there will be issues at the port.  The CEO has stated technology is in place and that extra booths have been built.  They will represent the first Border checks since the early 1990s.  The work that will be done at the port will be intensive and time consuming.  Therefore, we must ensure its infrastructure and the surrounding road network, including the Dublin Port tunnel, will be able to facilitate that work in order that we will not see lengthy delays in goods leaving the port for deliver in the rest of the country.  The M1 and the Dublin Port tunnel are elements of the infrastructure people from north County Dublin use on a daily basis.  North County Dublin is the fastest growing part of the country and increasingly providing housing for people living in Dublin city, yet it has inadequate transport infrastructure, with train services operating beyond capacity, a bus service that was designed many years ago and which is not fit for purpose and many people being forced into their cars, onto the M1 and into the Dublin Port tunnel.  The situation is bad at the best of times, but the impending disaster of Brexit, regardless of whether it will happen at the end of March, the end of June or some other date, will have knock-on effects on the people living in north County Dublin and the northern half of the country who rely on the M1 and the Dublin Port tunnel to access the city.</p></speech>

I live along the green line.  When the service started, it was a comfortable way to come into town, but it has now reached the stage where, from approximately 7.30 a.m. until 10.30 a.m. and from 3 p.m. until 7 p.m. or 8 p.m., it is like getting into a sardine can.  Trams are so overcrowded, it is not funny.  Someone cannot scratch his or her nose for fear of assaulting someone in the process.  We might, therefore, include the Luas in any discussion on transport.</p> <p>Last week the Leader and I met the Iranian ambassador.  I compliment the Leader on addressing the issue of human rights in Iran, rightly so.  He left the ambassador in no doubt as to his views.  There is no getting away from the fact that the situation in Iran and other countries has to change, but that is no reason for Ireland to cut off its nose to spite its face.  There are 80 million people in Iran who provide a massive market for beef, lamb, chicken and turkey.  There are also massive opportunities in petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, ICT, exchange programmes for academics and co-operative academic work between the two countries.  I cannot for the life of me understand why when almost every European country has an embassy in Iran and those who impose sanctions on Iran are trading with it on a daily basis, despite there being an open market in which to compete, we will not open an embassy there.  We will not even put one official on the ground just to have a presence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

The situation was the same in Galway and Kilkenny.  Farmers have beasts that are ready for sale but we cannot get a market for them.  The market is flat throughout the country.  I will let my colleagues who are more involved in agriculture than me address that issue.  However, could the Leader invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House for a debate on Iran and the opportunities there?  Perhaps we might get a clear explanation, not the usual old waffle about the fullness of time and the right juncture, of the reason no embassy is open there.  We have a good relationship with that country.  The Leader, the Cathaoirleach and I were in Iran and we were treated with the utmost respect and, by and large, we found the people to be happy-go-lucky and, like the rest of us, trying to scratch out a living.  We might have that debate as it is something we should address urgently.  There is an opportunity there.  It is knocking on our door but we are not opening the door.</p></speech>

For the first time there is judicial recognition that no proper investigation under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights was carried out into his murder 30 years ago.  The family have struggled for years to get this far and have shown dignity and grace in the face of sheer refusal and duplicity from British Governments.  It is time the murder of Pat Finucane is properly and publicly investigated in a public inquiry.  Nothing less will suffice.</p> <p>On another matter, figures I received last week show that in Mayo 130 adults and 55 children are on the waiting list for inpatient ear, nose and throat, ENT, treatment and there are 2,028 adults and 823 children on the outpatient list awaiting treatment.  That is more than 3,000 people in Mayo alone.  The reason I investigated the figures is that I received a call from the parent of a child with autism who needed an appointment.  She was told it would be two and a half years before the child would get an appointment.  I thought that had to be wrong but on seeing the waiting list I realise it is true.  It is absolutely scandalous in this day and age, when we talk about rainy day funds and how well the economy is doing, to have 3,000 people in one county alone waiting for ENT treatment.  Delays in treatment can lead to permanent and irreversible damage to patients.  Many patients in need of ENT treatment suffer from a range of other physical and intellectual disabilities as well.  That magnifies the problem.  As I mentioned last week, 60 more children were failed by the audiology testing services.  In many of these cases earlier diagnosis and swift treatment could potentially have reduced any harm caused by this systemic failure.</p> <p>The lack of urgency to clear the waiting list for 2019 shows that little has changed in terms of Government priorities.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, said he plans to publish the joint Department of Health, HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, scheduled care access plan for 2019 shortly.  I urge him to make that a priority and to ensure that adequate funding and resources are provided to reduce and eventually clear these waiting lists.  It is inhumane to have children suffering in this way only to be told that they must wait two and a half years for treatment.  It must be dealt with.  I ask that the Minister be invited to the House to discuss that plan and what he is planning to do to reduce the lists.  It is impossible to explain to a child that because one does not have the money the child cannot get the treatment he or she needs.</p></speech>

I am very pleased that after a long campaign on my part, initially raising it in this House and the Leader bringing the matter to the Minister, today members of the National Transport Authority, NTA, appearing before the transport committee, are suggesting that we supplement taxis and hackneys in the country to work the country's less profitable shifts.  I have been calling for that consistently so I am extremely pleased.  It will have major implications for Cavan, Monaghan and all rural areas where there are dispersed populations.</p> <p>I have a different request now for the Leader.  I ask him to invite the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, to the House to discuss the climate change agenda.  Central to that is the need for the next Common Agricultural Policy to incentivise and support farmers to green their activities and continue environmentally friendly activities, to expand the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and so forth.  That must be in the next Common Agricultural Policy and we should discuss it with the Minister, Deputy Bruton.</p> <p>However, the main issue I wish to raise with the Leader and with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, when he comes to the House is electric cars.  First, we need an infrastructure for them.  We must have more and better charging points.  I have a new proposition in that regard, which is that we should incentivise young drivers with an extra amount of money or a grant, and it would not be expensive on a national level, to make their first car an electric or hybrid car.  The reason is that if a young person's first car is an electric car he or she will develop a green environmental consciousness and a pride in the electric car.  That will expand to other facets of the person's life.  The person will seek to have solar panels on his or her house and to do other things in the climate change area.  I am specifically proposing, first, that we give a special incentive of extra money to young drivers to drive an electric car as their first car, second, that the Minister be invited to the House to discuss that and, third, that when we put a major focus on the infrastructure for electric cars and grant aiding young people to have them we also support the next Common Agricultural Policy having a very green dimension and decent money for farmers to do what they love, preserving the environment.</p></speech>

It was a privilege for me to meet Pat Hume and her family, and many other people.  Between 200 and 300 people watched the film in Westminster last night, which shows the respect that people have for his efforts.</p> <p>On 12 March we are holding an event called Champ, which has generated peace, harmony and affection among politicians from Northern Ireland in Westminster.  The event is called Champ because this is a dish made with potatoes and scallions that everyone from Northern Ireland is familiar with.  We have expanded the group to include politicians from Leinster House.  The event will take place on 12 March in Westminster.  Many politicians from all sides have been invited and they are very welcome to attend.  A significant vote will take place on the same day as Prime Minister May will try to get her Brexit deal through; it will be an interesting day.  With what is happening in Westminster, Europe and, indeed, here, I hope that we can have some deal in the coming weeks and months. </p></speech>

In the last 48 hours we have witnessed a Prime Minister, after a deal had been rejected, offer the opportunity to separate the votes to leaving without a deal or the opportunity to vote on whether to extend Article 50.  We have also witnessed Jeremy Corbyn do a U-turn and move to a position to support a second referendum.</p> <p>This is a time for cool heads and steady leadership.  We need to give space for Westminster to follow protocols and due process to define what will actually happen.  It is not a time for inflammatory language or antagonising words.  We all need to move away from the rhetoric of a bad deal being better than no deal or of no deal being better than a bad deal because all of this language is unhelpful.  We need to recognise once and for all in Britain, Ireland and Europe that there is no such thing as a good Brexit. </p></speech>

Do not underestimate the integrity of either the politicians or the electorate.  The best people to decide the future of the UK and its relationship with Ireland, the EU and the rest of the world are ultimately the electorate.  Give them all of the facts, and I mean all of the facts, give them all of the information and let them decide.  Democracy dictates that one is entitled to change one's mind and it is not undemocratic to do so.  British citizens, like Irish citizens, are perfectly entitled to change their mind based on information that they now have.</p> <p>In a climate where we are all reminded of the importance of respect we must respect the referendum, which we have done; we must respect the need to get this right, which we are doing; and, we must respect the 16 million people who did not elect to leave.  It was Franklin D. Roosevelt who said: "Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us.  The ultimate rules of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government officials, but the voters of this country."  In 2016, this decision was presented to an electorate.  If the British Government is so divided and is failing to get a majority or a consensus then it must raise the question of whether this is the right thing to do.  Brexit began being about opportunity and sovereignty and has ended up being about damage limitation and division.  Leader, I urge that this Government gives the UK Government time and space, and accepts that a few extra weeks now would be time well spent.</p></speech>

In fact, the lead item was from Libya, which involved tremendous work done by an Irish journalist called Sally Hayden.  She has been crucial in exposing the horrific torture and human rights abuses going on in Libya.  I recommend that people watch the film, which can be downloaded from "Channel 4 News".</p> <p>The film actually showed Eritreans being tortured, having hot molten plastic put on their backs, and having concrete blocks placed on their backs while they lay in chains on the floor screaming in pain.  The reason this is happening is because the pirates who have taken these guys, girls, women and children extort large sums of money from the families in Eritrea.  The horrible truth is that our Government is complicit in this happening because, through the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, rather than rescue migrants and bring them to safe havens, now the PESCO forces, including our Naval Service, hand them over to the Libyan coastguard, which is the equivalent of handing these people over to pirates.  The Libyan authorities, in turn, sell them as human commodities to people traffickers and at that point the torture, degradation, rape and mutilation is an everyday occurrence.  This has all been filmed and it was all shown on "Channel 4 News" on Monday night.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent in opposing the membership of PESCO by our naval forces.  It gives me no pleasure to say that this situation shows how right we were.  The most shameless disregard for human rights across the world is happening in the Mediterranean and, unfortunately, our Naval Service is part of it.  We pay large sums of money to Libya to take care of the problems so that we do not have to see these people or worry about them and, in turn, they are sold, tortured, mutilated and killed.</p> <p>I ask for a debate on the matter, Cathaoirleach, as a matter of urgency.  It is time for people to stop their silence.  Surely we should all be able to speak out against what is happening in Libya and against the role of our Naval Service in allowing it to happen.     </p></speech>

Thanks be to God, it now looks like we will have a deal or, as he hinted at, an extension.  Please God, the moderate voices across both parties in Westminster will be to the fore and sense will prevail.  I agree fully with what he has said.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Feighan about the Champ event.  It is a very good effort and has borne fruit over the past year or more by maintaining very good friendly relations between politicians at Westminster and here in Ireland.  While it may not be possible for us all to get to the event on 12 March, we all wish them well and, hopefully, apart from Senator Feighan that some few others will attend.</p> <p>This morning I am very concerned about the increasing number of deer in Kerry, particularly in the Killarney area.  Traditionally, the deer have been largely confined to the Killarney National Park.  However, there is much evidence in recent times that the deer have encroached on and roam well beyond the parkland.  While I accept that fences are not the answer, in a few specific instances, mainly between the park and the Castle Ross lands and Killarney Golf &amp;amp; Fishing Club, some limited fencing would help.  This may be also the case on another stretch of road between Ballydowney and Gortroe.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Coghlan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1881"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Our coroner has been concerned about the increasing number of accidents, unfortunately, causing death in a few instances.  I am not too sure if the Garda is fully satisfied about that, but in any event, the deer are crossing that road to farm land on the northern side, and that is an important route on the Ring of Kerry.  We need to hear more about an updated management plan from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It might be appropriate for us to hear from the Minister on this matter generally.</p></speech>

It is important too that we would have an early debate on defence matters, especially on the pay and conditions of those who serve in the Defence Forces.  That is important also in the context of the outcome of the vote that might arise from our consideration of Senator Norris's proposal.</p> <p>I rise today to express my concern about what is going on in my home town of Drogheda at the moment.  The town is in a state of fear.  As Members of the House will know, an attempt was made on a man&rsquo;s life yesterday in a horrific gun attack outside a toy store in a retail park on the north side of Drogheda.  The Garda is very clear that it was connected to an ongoing violent criminal feud in the town.  Drogheda simply does not have enough members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing the streets or available to senior Garda management.  Cities of an equivalent scale and towns that are much smaller, such as Dundalk and Sligo, for example, have units and shifts for 12 to 14 garda&iacute; while in Drogheda many of the units only have five or six garda&iacute;.  Yesterday, only one marked Garda car was available to police an area with a population of 50,000, which is absolutely disgraceful.  Last week, an overtime ban was introduced for the Drogheda area.  In addition, in recent days I understand that the armed response unit was withdrawn from the area so there was no access to a full-time armed response unit in the middle of a violent criminal feud that is striking fear into the people of my home town.  That is not good enough.  It is disgraceful and absolutely scandalous.</p> <p>The Minister for Justice and Equality, in a PR stunt, visited Drogheda Garda station in December.  He is on record as saying that Drogheda will get what Drogheda wants and what Drogheda needs.  What Drogheda got was 18 additional probationer garda&iacute;, straight out of Templemore but we have only retained three to supplement a stretched Garda force in the town that is not sufficient even to undertake normal policing duties let alone police a violent criminal feud.  People&rsquo;s lives are at stake and it is only a matter of time before somebody is killed.  My fear is that the first person to be killed will be an innocent bystander not connected to any criminal activity whatsoever in Drogheda.  We need to have an urgent debate in this House and hear the Minister for Justice and Equality make a commitment to the people of Drogheda that the police force in our town will be properly resourced, not just to police the violent criminal feud but to do normal policing work, as we are entitled to expect.</p></speech>

If I can, a Chathaoirligh, I will conclude on this point.  This is an urgent matter.  I understand that the Taoiseach is scheduled to visit Drogheda on Friday.  My message to him is that he should not come to Drogheda if he does not have additional Garda resources to provide to the senior Garda management in the town.  Otherwise, it can only be dismissed as a mere PR stunt, the same type of PR stunt that was undertaken by the Minister for Justice and Equality last December.</p></speech>

It is a great day for the Finucane family.  I concur with what Mrs. Finucane said, so I presume the outcome is totally satisfactory to her.  I raised this issue many times in the Council of Europe.  I thought there was collaboration between the United Kingdom and paramilitary forces, which amounted to state execution.  There was also the assistance of an MP.  The comments made in the House of Commons under full immunity were absolutely disgraceful.  That must be exposed.  It is a great day for the Finucane family.</p><p>I remind the Leader of my request for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come into the House to discuss the beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP, scheme.  According to an article in the <i>Farming Independent</i>of Tuesday, 26 February, by the reporter, Declan O'Brien, just a quarter of suckler farmers have applied for the scheme.  An extension of the application period has been sought by organisations until at least Friday, 1 March.  That is not satisfactory and I do not believe it will attract any more applicants but the Irish Cattle &amp;amp; Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, and the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, have sought that.  A total of 17,000 suckler farmers with 400,000 cows have applied, which is 26% of the 65,000 suckler farmers that are eligible.  They know exactly what I said, namely, that it is a very unsatisfactory scheme.  I reiterate the point that the scheme is badly thought out and should be fully reviewed.  The chairman of the ICSA suckler group, John Halley, said the idea that &euro;40 per cow would make any difference was an illusion.  We now have typical suckler beef U grade carcases of 450 kg being cut by 10 cent per kilo or &euro;45 per head.  The scheme is completely counterproductive.  Health and safety issues also arise, as it is a very dangerous endeavour to move a cow into a weighing scales and it will really not prove anything.  At the very least, this matter should be reviewed now in light of the slow and low take-up, which shows that the Leader of the House does not have all the answers at any time, although he might pretend he has.  He knew all about it yesterday but he certainly did not know that so few had applied, even though his party is in government.  He is a bit of an illusion too.</p></speech>

I have just come from the AV room which was packed this morning for the launch of a Government document on housing options for our ageing population.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Damien English, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, who has responsibility for older people, set out the excellent Government policy on housing options for our aging population.  The real devil in the detail is that we must see performance, deadlines and targets for how it will happen.  It is all very aspirational.  I accept that every plan must have aspirations but it must also have mechanisms for monitoring its implementation.  The reality is that we know many elderly people are living in houses that are perhaps a bit too big for them.  They would like to trade down but they do not have the option because of the lack of supply of smaller residential units within their community where they wish to live and where they are involved in the community and have their library and doctor, and where they go to mass or wherever else.  People want to stay within their communities.  We all know that from our involvement in local government and in relation to housing.  This is a really good policy document and I urge everyone to pick it up today.  It has only just been launched in the past half hour.  It is really good and interesting.  If there is a slot sometime in the future I ask the Leader to set aside some time for the Ministers to come in and outline their vision on the policy and, more important, their timelines for the introduction of the various measures within it.</p></speech>

Both the Leader and the Cathaoirleach are very much aware of the issue.  I am concerned about where we are going and how we are policing aquaculture licences, the regulations and legal rights allowing people to get involved in the process.  The industry will be a driver of the economy but we must ensure that the proper locations are identified for it.  We must bring people with us.  There must be consultation and informed debate about what it will mean for the marine area and marine users.  It is important that the Minister would come to the House at some stage to outline his view regarding those issues.  There is a proposal in Kinsale at the moment for an extensive mussel farm.</p></speech>

We need the Minister to come to the House to clarify these issues so that we can have an informed debate on where we are going to locate these farms.  We all know that they are going to be part of the industry going forward but how we determine their location and engage with the public on same is very important.</p></speech>

New figures show that not only are we failing to combat HIV effectively but are actually going in the opposite direction to our European counterparts.  Many of our European counterparts have the same health resources but have implemented and prioritised proactive health policies in this area.  Many have invested in PrEP and PEP distribution and accessible testing but we have not done so.  It should also be noted that it costs the State more than &euro;400,000 to treat a person with HIV over his or her lifetime.  This is money that could and should be spent on improving our health response to HIV.</p> <p>An effective measure that could be implemented and would cost absolutely nothing is a renewed and inclusive sex education curriculum.  At present, HIV prevention is regularly excluded from lessons in the context of men who have sex with men.  We are not equipping our young people with the measures to fully navigate their sex lives in a safe and positive manner.  Indeed, 24% of respondents in a HIV Ireland survey thought that HIV could be passed on through kissing or by sitting on a toilet seat which shows that misconceptions are increasing among young people.  Something needs to give or to change in this regard.  </p> <p>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills published its report on sex education which will inform the review by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, of relationships and sexuality education provision.  I support the recommendations in that report which are very ambitious and I commend Senators Gavan and Ruane who played a very active role on that committee.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to discuss the report and provide an update on NCCA review.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.75" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1418" speakername="Diarmuid Wilson" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#L00500"><p>This morning on my way here from Cavan I drove through very severe fog for most of my journey.  I was astonished at the number of cars that had no lights on, not to mention fog lights, in what were very treacherous driving conditions.  I call on the Road Safety Authority, RSA, which has conducted very successful road safety campaigns on speed, tiredness and drink driving, to also devise a campaign on driving in very hazardous conditions such as fog, ice and snow.  The RSA campaigns have proved to be very successful.  I was astonished at the number of people who were driving without even their normal lights on this morning.</p> <p>I wish to raise a related issue in terms of traffic and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Since the foundation of the force in 1922, bar a few glitches, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has served the community of the Twenty-six Counties on this island with distinction.  However, I have noticed recently that the word "Garda" is being dropped from a number of areas.  We have the Policing Authority, reports on the future of policing and, most recently, I noticed that newer Garda cars do not carry the "Garda Traffic Corps" mark, which is a well respected brand throughout the length and breadth of the Twenty-six Counties, but have "Traffic Policing" on them.  I am concerned that there is an attempt to denude the brand of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am highlighting this because it would be a pity to do so.  Since 1922 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has guarded the peace and safety of our citizens.  It could become known as the police but I do not want to see that happening.  I hope that this is not as a result of the new Garda Commissioner coming from a police state.</p></speech>

Senator Clifford-Lee raised the very important issue of Dublin Port and the contribution of the chief executive, Mr. Eamon Reilly, to the debate on Brexit.  We should reflect on his contribution and his belief that there will not be any additional congestion, notwithstanding that there will be a pinch point.  As the Senator rightly said, Dublin Port is a pivotal access point for goods entering and leaving our country.</p> <p>In the context of Dublin and transport, it is important to recognise that the Government is committed to extensive capital investment in public transport.  The BusConnects programme will bring about a significant reduction in journey times of between 40% and 50% which will greatly improve the customer experience.  It is important that we have that debate and I am happy to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the House to discuss the transport issues raised by Senator Craughwell.  The Senator also raised the very important issue of trade in the context of Iran.  A parliamentary delegation made a very successful trip to Iran last year.  We must stress to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade the importance of opening dialogue around the possibility of reopening our embassy in Tehran.  We should not be dictated to by another super power in that regard.  Significant trade opportunities can be opened up, notwithstanding the issues around banking and the persecution of Christians and those of LGBT persuasion.  These are issues that also need to be addressed as part of a dialogue.  Discussion is healthy and I commend the Cathaoirleach for having discussions last week with the Iranian ambassador in Dublin.  It is through dialogue and exchange visits between our parliamentarians that we can open up new channels of communication which will ultimately lead to the reopening of our embassy in Tehran, which I support.</p> <p>Senators Conway-Walsh, Feighan, Wilson and Coughlan spoke about Northern Ireland and about Brexit.  I also welcome the ruling of the British Supreme Court today on the Finucane case.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that we read what the Supreme Court said, namely, that an "effective investigation" into Pat Finucane's death had not been carried out.  In the Lower House this morning, the T&aacute;naiste reaffirmed the Government's position that there should be a public inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane.  The former Prime Minister, David Cameron, gave a commitment but that was reneged upon for whatever reason.  It should now be honoured.  We all recognise that, as part of reconciliation on our island, there are people on all sides of the political divide seeking answers and justice for their hurts.  Today is no exception.  This House should send a strong message that a public inquiry should be initiated by the British Government.</p><p>Senators Marshall, Feighan, Coghlan and Wilson referred to Brexit.  I concur with the wise contribution of Senator Marshall.  If the British Government needs more time, let us give it that time.  If it cannot get a majority in the Parliament, let us have a second vote.  We were all warmly receptive to yesterday's comments by Michel Barnier when he said that he was doing all he could to reach a resolution but that the backstop was not renegotiable.  That is the fundamental point.  There will be another vote today in the UK and further votes later, but it is critical that the UK as a parliament and a people recognise that we are here to continue our relationship and work with it.  There is no good Brexit, full stop.  We commend the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, on their work.</p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of waiting times in Mayo.  I do not have an answer for her, as I am not familiar with the issue.  Senator Leyden will be glad to hear that.</p></speech>

I suggest that Senator Conway-Walsh submit a Commencement matter on this issue.  We have requested that the Minister for Health attend the House.  I await his finding of a free spot in his diary.</p> <p>As much as I would love to accept Senator Norris's amendment to the Order of Business, I will not do so.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, has made himself available today.  I thank the House in advance of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill being taken today at whatever time that may be.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, had a double entry in his diary, so I thank the House for providing for a debate of only two hours today, instead of the three hours that were scheduled.  As I see no reason to change that, I will not accept the amendment to the Order of Business.</p> <p>Senator O'Reilly made an interesting proposal regarding electric cars.  The National Transport Authority will be before the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport today.  The Senator's suggestion on incentivising young people through a grant or allowance to purchase electric cars as their first vehicles is an interesting one and needs to be considered.  There is great foresight in the proposal.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House.  We all must try to improve our attitudes to climate change.  An example of that is Senator O'Reilly's proposal, and I commend him on his suggestion.</p> <p>I would be happy to accept Senator Gallagher's amendment to the Order of Business.</p> <p>I join Senator Feighan in commending and paying tribute to John Hume, who has left a significant legacy on our island and in the world in which we live.  Thanks to the work and life of John Hume, our world is a better place today.</p> <p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of PESCO.  It is important to recognise that it does not affect our national sovereignty and has no pressing impact on our neutrality.</p></speech>

I do not see this as being tied in any way to how we can all condemn the blatant disregard for human rights in Libya.  We can work to continue promoting and enhancing the lives of Eritrean people and we can ensure that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade works on behalf of the Government to raise these issues.  I would be happy to have him come to the House.</p> <p>Senator Coghlan raised the issue of deer marauding through Killarney.  It is an important issue.  He referred to the Ring of Kerry, the N72 and other routes where this issue is having an impact on drivers.  His point needs to be addressed.  Some 120 deer have been culled but fencing has been ruled out.</p> <p>Senator Nash raised the important issue of the ongoing violent criminal feud in Drogheda.  As he will appreciate, I do not know the Garda numbers for Drogheda, but the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has increased the moneys available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for new cars, new equipment, recruitment, and pay and conditions.  I am not familiar with the overtime issue that the Senator raised.  As he pointed out, the Taoiseach will be visiting Drogheda on Friday.  It would be wrong to ask him not to go.  It is important that he go to hear at first hand the issues affecting Drogheda.  I am sure that the chief superintendent in charge of the district-----</p></speech>

As the Senator rightly stated yesterday, there is a pilot scheme for suckler farmers worth &euro;20 million specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production.  Besides the &euro;20 million for the beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP, there is the &euro;300 million under the beef data and genomics programme, &euro;23 million for the areas of natural constraint scheme and further schemes that will invest significant amounts of money.  The Senator can throw his eyes to heaven all he wants, but at least this Government is investing.  He should acknowledge that.  Of course, he will not do so, which is his wont.</p></speech>

Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell also raised the matter on the Order of Business yesterday.  The points made by Senator Boyhan should be addressed in this House and it is my intention to have the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government come to it because it is critical that we have a discussion on the issue of choice and the future model of delivery of housing for older people.  The Senator spoke about the report.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, has commented that it is a question of "right sizing", rather than downsizing.  Having that debate is necessary and healthy and we will have it.</p> <p>Senator Lombard raised the issue of aqua licences.  I will be happy to have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine come to the House to discuss it in due course. </p> <p>In a very telling contribution Senator Warfield referred to the rise in the number of cases of HIV and the need for a new model to tackling it.  It is alarming that there were 531 new cases last year.  It is happening at a time when, notwithstanding the Senator's remarks, people are more aware and have greater access to information than ever before.  It is frightening, therefore, that the number of cases of HIV is going up, rather than down.  I agree that there is a need for a new collaborative approach to be taken.  I will be happy, therefore, to invite the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss the issue which is one that needs to be addressed urgently.  The increase in the number of cases is significantly against the trend elsewhere in Europe.  There is, however, a lot of good work being done in many parts of the country, but for some reason, it seems to be falling on deaf ears.  Whether it is an attitudinal issue or a complete failure to understand, I am not quite sure, but there is a need to have a further conversation, leading to change in the model of delivery. </p> <p>Senator Wilson made a very interesting point about the lack of care taken by motorists in difficult weather conditions and how common sense should dictate that they switch on their lights.  I concur completely with him on the movement to change the name of "An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na" and the word "Garda", on vehicles in particular.  I was not aware of it, but I support him 100%.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is what the force is called and it should always be that way.  I am not in any way in favour of a change of name to policing or police force.  I will be happy to have the matter taken up with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  </p> <p>While I will accept Senator Gallagher's amendment to the Order of Business, I will not accept Senator Norris's.</p></speech>

It includes assaults on medical staff.  In the ten years between 2008 and 2018 there were 7,500 reported assaults on nurses.  There were 1,267 assaults on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the four years between 2012 and 2016.  The legislation also seeks to extends the provisions to fire service personnel and paramedics.  It is time we made a statement that emergency workers need to be protected.

I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Members of the Seanad for this opportunity to update the House on the implementation of the forestry programme.  We had a very constructive discussion about forestry during my visit to the House last April.  I recall that many positive contributions were made on the subject.  As I mentioned at the time, the current forestry programme, which is the overarching framework within which forestry schemes are made available, runs to the year 2020.  The mid-term review of the programme published this time last year resulted in the enhancement of a number of measures in the programme.  These enhancements included an increase in certain grants and premiums and an increase in the minimum mandatory requirement for broadleaves per site from 10% to 15%.  I propose to outline a number of other initiatives which have been rolled out over the last year.</p> <p>Last year I established a forestry programme implementation group, which represents the forestry sector, State organisations, and environmental non-governmental organisations, to monitor progress on the implementation of the various measures and schemes under the programme, to identify issues relating to the delivery of targets, and to discuss how these issues could be resolved.  This group also provides a forum for direct engagement between all of the various stakeholders, which is useful in gaining an insight into their respective concerns and priorities.  </p> <p>While the area of newly-planted forest for which payments issued in 2018 was lower than expected at 4,025 ha, 2018 was a particularly challenging year in terms of extreme weather conditions, with dramatic snowfalls this time last year and an extended period of drought over the summer.  I remain hopeful that planting rates will recover this year.  My Department will be supporting promotional initiatives which will encourage landowners to consider forestry as a viable use of land.  There are many land-use options available to landowners and I believe that forestry is a strong contender, especially in view of the generous incentives currently available under the afforestation scheme.  </p> <p>In this regard, the attendance at the recent Teagasc advisory clinics was encouraging.  Teagasc hosted the largest every nationwide series of forestry advisory clinics earlier this year, promoting the establishment and management of forestry as a sustainable and rewarding use of land on Irish farms.  I understand new planting inquiries made up more than half of all consultations, with farmers and landowners seeking information on the many planting options offered under the forestry programme and the range of attractive establishment grants and annual premium categories available.  The farm forestry approach, in which planting trees does not replace agriculture but works alongside it as part of the farming mix, deserves consideration.  Last year I got the opportunity to visit a forest in County Kilkenny which had won the Teagasc farm forestry award 2018.  It really demonstrated whole-farm planning, with the integration of a dry stock enterprise, forestry and GLAS measures.  </p> <p>I remind Members of the House that the forestry scheme is voluntary, with each individual free to decide if he or she wishes to plant forestry and avail of the grants and premiums available.  There are no county or regional targets for forestry planting in Ireland.  The forestry grants and premiums are available to landowners throughout the country.  I do not propose to depart from such equality of access.  It should also be noted that afforestation patterns are also subject to a range of variables, with soil quality and economic evaluation of various land-use options being significant factors.  </p> <p>As Members will be aware, I have commissioned an independent study on the forestry sector in County Leitrim.  The terms of reference for this study have been agreed and published.  I believe that they are sufficiently broad to address the views of all stakeholders.  An evidence-based approach will be used to reach objective conclusions.  Members will be pleased to note that public consultations will be a strong feature of the study, which will cover the entire county and which will assess the attitudes of people to a wide range of forestry impacts.  This assessment will be based on local consultations with farmers, non-farmers, representative groups, and other interested parties.  I look forward to the outcome of the study as its findings can inform us all, including local communities, policymakers, and other interested parties, of the impacts of the expansion of the forestry sector and any issues arising.</p> <p>Turning to the new incentives rolled out under the programme, I am pleased that we were in a position to support current forest owners through the introduction of a knowledge transfer scheme.  The scheme for 2018, which I launched last August, attracted a lot of interest and resulted in the formation of 33 groups totalling 605 participants.  I look forward to launching a similar scheme for 2019 in the near future.</p> <p>Last month I launched three new support measures under the forestry programme to support biodiversity in Irish forests.  Members will note that one of the new schemes is to support continuous cover forestry, which allows for the production of commercial timber while retaining forest cover at all times.  The other two measures were new deer tree shelter and deer and hare fencing schemes, which aim to support landowners who wish to plant broadleaves in areas in which there is a risk of deer damage.  There are also changes to the woodland improvement scheme to introduce grant aid to carry out a second thinning intervention for broadleaf forests.</p> <p>We are all aware of the many benefits from forestry, including employment, exports, biodiversity and recreational facilities.  It is also important to recognise the role forests play in climate change mitigation.  Forests not only sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but also store carbon in the wood products they produce and can replace materials made from fossil fuels.  The Irish national forest estate removed an average of 3.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year from the atmosphere over the period 2007 to 2016.  With respect to our international climate change commitments, grant-aided afforestation will also make a significant contribution to our climate targets and could contribute to a reduction of up to 22 million tonnes of CO2 over the ten-year period from 2021 to 2030.  </p> <p>In addition, the Government recently agreed to the preparation of a new all-of-Government plan to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change.  The new plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery.  A number of inter-departmental groups are currently examining areas of mitigation potential across a wide range of areas which include forestry.  This plan will be presented to Government next month and will require a step up in ambition across many areas of our economy.</p> <p>The Government proactively assists and supports the development of Irish forestry through the national forestry programme, with some &euro;103 million allocated for this purpose in 2019.  My Department, Teagasc and other forestry stakeholders continue to inform and encourage landowners to plant forestry to maintain and increase the level of benefits from Irish forestry.  I have also established a forestry promotions working group to act as a forum within which ideas can be put forward on how to develop and promote the forestry sector in Ireland.  My Department has also announced a call for proposals on forestry promotion which is due to close at the end of this week.  I hope that this call for proposals will attract some creative and innovative ideas that will increase public awareness of the multifunctional benefits of forestry, promote a higher level of tree planting, and encourage existing forest owners to maximise the benefits of their resource.</p> <p>The most recent national forestry inventory, the results of which I launched last July, found that forests account for 11% of the total land area of Ireland, with forest cover estimated to be at its highest level In over 350 years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Andrew Doyle:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are currently benefitting from the investment in forestry, one of the results of which is a vibrant, export-led timber processing industry which employs over 12,000 people, both directly and indirectly.  These jobs are almost all in the rural economy and often in locations where alternative employment opportunities are not plentiful.</p><p>It would be remiss of me, in discussing forestry here, not to mention Brexit as it represents a significant challenge for the forestry sector.  The forestry sector, like all other sectors here, is keenly aware of the potential impact on its business, especially given that over three quarters of the output of the Irish timber processing sector is exported to the UK.  A key priority for our timber processors is to ensure they can provide their goods to their customers in the UK on a timely basis.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, and I have met representatives of Forest Industries Ireland on this issue and my Department is also liaising with them.  I thank the House for giving me this opportunity to update Members on forestry-related matters and I look forward to listening to their contributions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#Q00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive report on the forestry programme to date.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to developing the forestry sector in Ireland, which plays a very important role in environmental, economic and social policy.  The growing, harvesting and processing of forests make a massive contribution to the economy.  In Ireland, this is estimated to be in the region of &euro;2.2 billion, with approximately 12,000 jobs dependent on the sector.  Meanwhile, timber production is in the region of 3 million cu. m every year, with around 20% of that amount produced by private landowners of forests.</p> <p>Forests cover some 11% of Ireland's land area, approximately 770,000 ha, but this is against an EU average of 38%, which shows the substantial progress that could be made in this country.  The Food Wise 2025 strategy has set a target of 18% afforestation by 2050.  It was under a Fianna F&aacute;il Government that ambitious planting targets of 10,000 ha per annum were set out in the National Development Plan 2007-2013, with more than 8,000 ha planted in 2010 alone.  However, regrettably, under successive Fine Gael-led Governments, annual planting targets have been downgraded to between 6,000 ha and 8,000 ha, which is significantly behind the Food Wise 2025 annual afforestation target of 15,000 ha per annum.  The majority of what is being planted is replanted mature and cut-down forest that previously existed and is not new, virgin forestry.  Ambitious planting targets for forestry must be achieved, with a premium put on native broadleaf planting.  As the Minister mentioned, this is a major issue.  Significant amounts of what is planted are non-national conifers but we need to put the emphasis on our native national broadleaf trees.</p> <p>Proportional planting policy on a national and regional basis is key to wider afforestation policy and I am glad the Minister mentioned that.  There is a lot of unrest in the north-west of the country, where the two Fine Gael speakers come from.  I am sure they will mention this point.  There is a feeling among farmers in those areas that we have gone back to the Cromwellian edict, "To Hell or to Connacht" in the area of afforestation and we need to address this.  We need to open the island as a whole to afforestation and we should not demean certain areas by imposing plantations.</p> <p>Data from the Department show that, in the past two years, the Government missed the afforestation targets set out in the national afforestation programme for 2014 to 2020.  In 2018 just 56%, equivalent to 4,000 ha, of forestry was planted out of a target of 7,205 ha.  Shockingly, last year the planting targets for the afforestation of native woodlands and fibre combined were missed by 98% and 100%, respectively.  Overall planting targets were missed by 22% in 2017.</p> <p>Forestry has a key role to play in reducing Irish carbon emissions.  Afforestation is a vital tool for reducing our carbon footprint and the 300,000 ha of new forest planted since 1990 has absorbed a massive 18% of Irish agriculture's annual greenhouse gas emissions.  Ireland's forests removed 4.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in 2015 alone.  The inclusion of land use, land use change and forestry within the scope of the new EU 2030 climate change framework is a welcome development and represents a sensible approach.  This broadens the tools available for Ireland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration.  Land use, land use change and afforestation will enable Ireland to access the removal of 26.8 million tonnes of CO2 over the 2021-2030 period.</p> <p>The Minister mentioned the groups he has set up and announced many ambitious targets but the time has come for implementation.  Given the massive role afforestation can play in tackling greenhouse gas emissions, we need to start achieving our targets.  It is vital that we look more closely at farm forestry to ensure greater regional balance in forestry and so that we can promote forestry in conjunction with traditional farming methods in the regions.  We also need to look at some of our past policies.  Although people generally replant a forest when it is harvested, the obligation to commit to do so 20 years in advance of the harvest is off-putting and is keeping a lot of people out of planting forestry.  They do not want to sign a contract that almost constitutes a commitment on behalf of the next generation in 20 years' time.  If we could remove this obligation from contracts, we would get more people to sign up to forestry.</p> <p>I would also like the Minister and Coillte to look at the management of existing forests from the point of view of wildlife and biodiversity.  Yesterday, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine had a very good debate on the eradication of TB.  Deer straying from forests, not least in the Minister of State's own county, are being blamed for the spreading of TB and we need to look at how we manage this issue.  The Minister of State mentioned fencing and we need to introduce stricter conditions for the control of wildlife, particularly deer, in areas where TB affects the suckler and dairy sectors.</p></speech>

Last week I was in the wonderful house in Avondale.  When summing up, the Minister of State might touch on the plans for that.  In the context of forestry, we have to think of the bigger picture and that includes biodiversity and the potential for more jobs.  We have to look at the training sector as it pertains to horticulture and forestry.  We have spoken about broadleaf trees but we need to look at our nursery stock production for them.</p><p>There is the potential for jobs in this sector and training programmes are a part of that.  I acknowledge what Teagasc is doing and anyone who reads the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>regularly will have noticed the series of forestry seminars it has been running over the past few months, and the workshops it has held across the country to which huge numbers have turned up.</p><p>A lot of people are looking at setting aside a certain amount of land.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Clearly we do not want good, productive agricultural land used for forestry.  That would not be the way to go but there are marginal lands that are very suitable for forestry.  There is enormous potential for job creation here.  We must consider, in particular, the area of soft tourism.  There are some amazing forest parks in this country, including Avondale forest park in County Wicklow where there is a master plan to do bigger and greater things at that location and rightly so.  It is a beautiful place which was also the location of one of the State's first forestry schools.  </p><p>There is a significant amount of potential in forestry.  I wish to acknowledge the work of Teagasc in particular.  Many young people who fall out of mainstream education would benefit from involvement in the forestry sector.  We must develop more options such as apprenticeships in forestry and related horticultural areas.  </p><p>When I mentioned to a few colleagues from Leitrim that I would be involved in this debate today they immediately referenced the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association as well as talking about lovely Leitrim.  We all know that farmers cannot get money from banks to buy land.  It is possible, however, to get loans from the European Investment Bank at 1% for investment in forestry.  A young farmer wanting to expand will not be able to get a loan from a bank at 1%.  We all know that and the arguments associated with it.  The Minister of State knows, as someone who is involved in agriculture, that some of the lands in Leitrim are marginal.  However, he also knows that weanlings and other livestock can be reared and can thrive on marginal lands at certain times of the year, as happens in County Leitrim.  It is a question of looking and tailor-making what is happening.  The monoculture of spruce is detrimental, particularly up there.  A balance must be struck but if one is surrounded on three sides by massive forestry, what does that say?  Leitrim is dying.  Parts of Leitrim are dying but people are not listening.  There is the potential to develop a balanced forestry sector there but it must be done in conjunction with the existing communities.  I met a family who approached an auctioneer with a view to buying 50 ha or 60 ha in Leitrim last year.  They were refused because they could not get enough funding.  They went to owners of the land who were their neighbours.  The owners said that they would love to sell the land to them but that a private investor wanted to buy it.  The family could not compete against the investor who is buying up large tracts of land up there.  It is sad and while it involved neighbours, it is all about money at the end of the day.  We have already spoken about the need for broadleaf plantations.  I know that people from Leitrim are tuning into this debate today and they want me to point out that there are disaster zones in that county.  There are communities dying in Leitrim because of the policy that has been pursued in relation to forestry.  That needs to be addressed.</p><p>I have touched on the issue of training and encouraging more forestry.  As previous speakers have said, we need new forestry plantations.  Of course we must replenish and replace but we must also set ambitious targets for new plantations.  We can have a very comprehensive forestry plan which goes hand in hand with productive agriculture.  However, we need to look at training and attracting people with the necessary skills to the sector.  Having seen forests in Europe, particularly in Germany, I believe there is enormous potential for soft tourism around national forests.  I know that this is outside of the Minister of State's remit but it is something that must be explored further.  The capacity in this area is considerable, as is evident from forests in the Dublin mountains.  South Dublin and Dun-Laoghaire Rathdown County Councils are working on cycling tracks, tourism trails and so on, which provide benefits to both locals and tourists.  I urge the Department to further explore the enormous potential in this area.  I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive report he provided to the House today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#R00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this very important topic.  As previous speakers said, the forestry programme is throwing up a number of issues in rural Ireland.  Before I get into discussing that, I would like to pay tribute to a former Deputy from my own county, Mr. Joe Blowick, who served as a Minister for Lands.  Prior to his election, there was no forestry programme in this country.  It was his idea to establish such a programme and he has left a great legacy upon which we can build but it is important that we get it right.</p> <p>In Mayo there is a lot of forestry, with 10% of our agricultural land planted.  That puts the county 3% above the EU 2020 targets for the planting of forestry.  Approximately 24,000 ha are in private ownership and the remaining 34,500 ha of forestry are owned by Coillte and the NPWS.  Planting in Mayo is significant and it is estimated that between 300 and 340 ha are being planted in the county every year.  The amount of land under forestry continues to increase, although most of the planting at the moment is being done by private landowners and not by Coillte.  It is private landowners who are taking up the baton in terms of planting.  Premia in Mayo are worth &euro;3.65 million to participating landowners.  By 2035, it is expected that timber production in Mayo will have trebled.  These are all positive aspects of the forestry programme being pursued by the Government but a number of issues remain to be addressed.  These are related to issues raised by previous speakers.</p> <p>We see our forestry as an asset but it must be driving employment too.  At the moment, notwithstanding the fact timber production will treble by 2035, most of the timber produced in Mayo is shipped out of the county to timber mills in the south, most notably in Waterford.  Therefore, we are not adding value to the primary product in Mayo itself.  The same is true in Leitrim, Roscommon and other counties of the west and north.  Coillte owns and controls large tracts of land and must be challenged to deliver jobs locally.  I am not just talking about in the growth of the forests but also in the timber mills and the production of wood chip.  The latter has enormous potential in the context of district heating systems and renewable energy solutions, which is also one of the Government's objectives.  There is capacity in this area but it is not being developed.  The concerns arising in Leitrim would be lessened if locals could get jobs rather than just felling timber.  </p> <p>A balance must be struck in terms of land use.  Senator Paul Daly made a very dramatic point about people being forced into forestry and said "To hell or to Connacht".  That is not the true story, however.  The true story is that more people are opting for forestry because of the problems in suckler farming and the depressed prices in that sector.  We are encouraging farmers to increase beef and dairy production under Food Wise 2025 and the increased interest in forestry is more of a symptom of that than anything else.  That said, I can relate to the social implications of being surrounded by forest, particularly when that forest comprises Sitka spruce and very little else.  It is not particularly attractive and is quite depressing for communities.  Communities have been articulating this quite well of late and have been stressing the need for balance.  We obviously want to pursue our planting programme and more could be done to encourage farmers to plant on at least part of their lands, regardless of the type of farming in which they are engaged.  In that way, we will get a better mix.  </p> <p>The Minister of State said in his speech that the Department is going to encourage more variety in planting, particularly of native trees, which I welcome.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These are the sorts of issues the forestry promotion working group must consider.  For the sake of biodiversity, it is important we get the right mix and that we not just looking at big industrial forests which, contrary to our intentions, are not as attractive for tourism as a properly mixed and put together forest.</p><p>Another issue is rural tourism.  I welcome the development in Ballycroy, County Mayo, where Coillte has handed over 4,000 acres to the National Parks and Wildlife Service to allow a wild area to develop for the purpose of tourism.  I welcome these very important and necessary initiatives from the likes of Coillte.  We could benefit more from Coillte and the Government articulating their commitments to tourism in terms of forests that are used for amenity and leisure purposes by locals.  Recently, there was much concern about Belleek Forest Park in Ballina, County Mayo, where Coillte felled a particular part of the forest.  Many people were concerned that Coillte could do what it liked.  The fact that Coillte did not go further was down to its benevolence as opposed to protecting a piece of the forest.  I would say that Coillte acted properly in this case but boundaries need to be more clearly defined when it comes to the protection of forests, especially where local groups have invested a lot in these forests and enjoy them as amenities.</p><p>People have described how important forests are for the carbon sink.  I already mentioned that there is a need to plant more trees and to have a greater mix of tree varieties.  We must also encourage farmers to plant trees but there are a couple of obstacles, as was said.  When a landowner plants trees, he or she must wait for them to mature, then fell the trees and replant, which is a major deterrent.  The idea that one no longer has a say about what happens to one's land that is used for  forestry is, for many people, not a choice.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that, and that is aside from the fact that after year 15, people will not get an income.  People's land is tied indefinitely to forestry and while they never choose to leave forestry, it is a negative aspect of the forestry programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1400" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#S00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</p> <p>The planting of large areas of land with trees, driven by grant aid and annual payments to landowners, has to be examined for its overall impact on communities and long-term impact on the land and the environment.  The reason for very generous Government assistance for forestry is to encourage it as a means of reaching our commitments on climate change, as trees are viewed as the only way to absorb and store carbon.  For a farmer struggling to make a living on wet and poor land in the west, it is an attractive option, as indeed it is for investment and pension funds.  Land can be bought cheaply and planting it brings the security of State funding and the 15 years of guaranteed payments.  As a Government policy, grant-aided monoculture afforestation is successful in getting more land under trees.  The permanent change of land use is one of the clear consequences of this policy.  However, communities living in areas where forestry is replacing farming as a model of land use suffer negative impacts as there is very little labour involved in growing Sitka spruce.  In reality, it closes down the countryside.</p> <p>Economic and social activity around traditional farming has significant spin-off in the local area, with services being provided to the farm and products and materials traded with the farm.  Normal farming activity creates opportunity, which in turn creates more activity.  On the other hand, the farm planted with Sitka spruce never needs new gates, fencing or anyone to cut fodder, bale it and gather it or plough land for reseeding.  There are no animals to feed or care for, and no need for a vet to look at an animal.  There is no need for anyone to upkeep habitat or hedges, fix machinery or maintain sheds.  Above all, a farm on which Sitka spruce is grown needs no farmer to go to the mart to meet other farmers or to call on neighbours when in need, because there are no needs.  The planted farm becomes deserted, wild and uninteresting.  The EU has stated that the main principle for forestry is that they serve environmental, social and economic purposes.  As I just outlined, Irish forestry policy does not address these three criteria.  The rural community that once survived on the micro-economy, which the activities of farming delivered in an area, suffers decline and also becomes deserted.  The economic activity created by the planting, maintaining, thinning and processing of conifers is very low as much of the industry is highly automated.   There is about one full-time job per 1,000 ha of forestry.</p> <p>Another problem created by our afforestation policy is the transfer of land ownership from local farmers to international corporate interests, which engage forestry management companies to thin and maintain the forests.  In many cases, when farmers plant the land themselves, they collect the annual grants for 15 years and, when the first thinning is carried out, they are offered a buyout by the forestry management companies on behalf of big corporate funds.  Such an offer is hard to resist for ageing farmers as the next payment from the trees is 15 to 20 years away.  This move to corporate ownership of forestry land is happening apace and is supported by Government grants for carbon sequestration reasons.  We, in Sinn Fein, call for a policy that introduces a 50 km radius limit for establishment grant and forestry premium payments.  This means that the recipient's main residential residence must be within 50 km of the forestry site.  For companies, this should apply to their main headquarters to ensure that the economic benefits are retained in the local area.</p> <p>On 15 February, the Minister announced the terms of reference for a Leitrim forestry study, which will be carried out by UCD.  The study will cover the social and economic impacts of forestry, the impact on farm incomes and the state of regulation on Leitrim at present.  The terms of reference have already been criticised - first, because local groups, such as Save Leitrim and the local branch of the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, were not consulted, and second, because issues such as planning, soil carbon analysis, land prices, tax, local infrastructure and fire risk have been left out.  Groups say that the terms of reference have clearly been designed to avoid critiquing the Government's wider forestry policy.  I ask the Minister of State to please address these concerns in his reply today.  Many groups are anxious to know where the Department stands in response to these criticisms.</p> <p>At present planning permission for afforestation in Ireland is not required for plantations that are under 50 ha in size, which makes up the bulk of plantations.  This situation has led to private entities purchasing peat bogland, which otherwise should contribute to carbon sequestration in order to plant large, commercial plantations.  My Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, has proposed legislation to ensure that planning permission is required for any plantation over 5 ha.  I ask the Minister of State to outline today whether he supports the legislation.</p></speech>

Before I respond directly to the matter in hand, I wish to bring people's attention to the issue of trees being felled in public and private areas over the past two weeks.  I have received a flood of emails and tweets from just about every county, as has the Green Party, about the extent of tree felling around the country.  There is a sadness and lack of understanding as to why trees are being felled and on such a scale.  I have received reports from County Waterford, Dungarvan, Fethard, Faheen, Golden Road, Cashel, Bray, County Mayo, Westport, County Kerry, Killorglin, Hugginstown, Gorey, Carrigaline, Limerick, County Meath, County Roscommon and Fingal in Dublin.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That has come to hand and I wish to draw the Minister's attention to it.  I have tabled a Commencement matter for tomorrow for the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, because of the anger among the public about the trees and the fact that there appears to be a lack of social and ecological value attached to them.  People are waking up and recognising the importance of trees and tree coverage in terms of ecological services and biodiversity.  When we see reports that diversity is threatened the necessity for trees is more important than ever.</p><p>The idea that tree policy can be set by a single complainant to a local authority or that the benefits trees provide can be erased because of the inconvenience to councils of a single complainant is just not good enough.  We can do better.  We require a national biodiversity policy with a strong statutory basis that would mandate landowners, local authorities and bodies such as the ESB and larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to have a better approach to managing trees in public areas.  I hope the Minister will take this into account overall.</p><p>In response to the Minister of State's contribution on the implementation of the forestry programme, like many of my colleagues I wish to address the Save Leitrim campaign.  It is not long since the group protested at Leinster House and held a press conference about its concerns.  The Minister of State is well aware of the points made by the campaign and the complaints about the approach of the State forestry agencies across the country.  He will also be aware of the campaign's disappointment at not being able to discuss the terms of reference of the study of forestry policy in the county.  The group has been campaigning for a moratorium on new planting in the area and for a well-designed study that would examine the cross-cutting issues around forestry and forest cover in Leitrim.  Members of the campaign are dissatisfied with the terms of reference.  They are narrow in scope and will limit the UCD investigative team to looking at only some of the areas affected by current policy.  Fire risk, soil carbon analysis, local infrastructure impacts, land prices, tax and other issues are omitted, as are the health and mental health impacts of such major use of non-native coniferous forest planting on communities.  The group is so disappointed in the process that it is also concerned about the outcome of the report given the lack of consultation with people and communities such as theirs.</p><p>The Green Party has always been passionate about forestry and tree cover in Ireland.  Ireland has the second lowest level of forest cover in Europe and the lowest in the EU, but it is increasing.  That is welcome.  We want forestry to be an integral part of Ireland's response to climate change and the challenges to our biodiversity, to enhance biodiversity at a time when there is such massive global decline and to provide stable and good employment in rural areas.  We want a policy that Ireland can be proud of, one that provides material for energy and green construction and for a high-value export product, crafted by a skilled and engaged emerging sector.  That is far from what we have today.  It could be better.  Ireland has approximately 11% forestry coverage.  Sweden, in contrast, has the highest level at approximately 69%.  Our approach to forestry is to confine it to profit-orientated State-run and privately-run plantations, separate from the communities around them.  We should develop and enhance the social knowledge in communities about the importance of tree cover.</p><p>We must have a positive vision for the future.  Our vision is one of healthy forestry plantations across the countryside, of selected uphill areas being allowed to return to the tree cover they previously had before excessive grazing took over in some areas and of trees used in public areas and allowed to mature there and be left alone to provide shelter and benefit to life.  Most importantly, we seek a national land use strategy.  That is the single best way to deliver a strong vision for Ireland.  I hope it is something the Government will engage with more, particularly in view of the pending report from the climate action committee.  There are plenty of models in other countries that we could look to in terms of how we could do things better in Ireland.  The Minister of State's intention is more or less what we seek, an increase in forestry and the opportunities that forestry can provide to citizens.</p></speech>

We are all very aware of the benefits of forestry, but the issue is very much about achieving a balance between environmental needs and meeting the needs of communities.  As the Minister of State correctly pointed out, it is an important mechanism through which we must tackle the issues surrounding climate change.  There is also the fact that 12,000 people are employed in the forestry sector.</p> <p>I live in north Roscommon and, as in Leitrim, people there are dealing with issues in respect of marginal land, farmers trying to manage within very tight margins and the issues with the increase in plantation in the region.  We are all aware of the report the Minister of State has commissioned in an effort to address the communities' concerns.  As Senator Grace O'Sullivan said, a number of people from Leitrim travelled to Leinster House recently.  They are concerned about the increase in forestry and the increase in the amount of land being bought by people from outside the locality for the specific purpose of planting to avail of subsidies.  There is great concern about that across the north-west region of north Roscommon and Leitrim.</p> <p>It is positive that the report will allow for consultation with farmers, non-farmers, representative groups and other interested parties.  The Save Leitrim group has concerns about the terms of reference but the fact that there will be consultation is positive.  The outcome of that report will be important for how we achieve a balance not just in Leitrim but throughout the country.  Teagasc also has an important role to play with regard to the interest and its advisory clinics.  The Minister of State referred to increasing the minimum mandatory requirement for broadleafs per site.  Again, that is positive.  Obviously, there must be a focus on more species and habitat diversity, and the broadleafs are very much a part of that.</p> <p>Finally, the concerns of the people in the north west are real.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maura Hopkins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2478"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2478&amp;amp;pid=MauraHopkins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will end where I started, whereby we are all very much in favour of the need to increase forestry in meeting our environmental targets.  We also need to find that balance across our communities.  As Senator Mulherin rightly pointed out, farming is going through a particularly difficult period at present, especially in the west.  While there may be different land options, unfortunately things are really difficult in the beef and suckler sector.  Farmers are struggling across very tight margins.  We need to support them as best we can to ensure that the suckler sector can continue.  That is difficult at present.  I am aware that is not part of today's discussion but in many ways it does form part of it, because people are considering forestry instead of these sectors right across the north west.  It is important that we achieve a balance nationally and not in just one particular area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#U00200"><p>I thank the Senators for their various contributions.  At the outset, there are 12,000 people employed in the forestry sector and it is worth over &euro;2.2 billion, with exports of more than&euro;350 million.  By 2035 the All Ireland Roundwood Production Forecast estimates that 50% of that will come from the private sector.  There are 21,000 private landowners, mainly farmers who own plantations and are growing timber on their farms.  I said at the outset that I want to see forestry as a whole-of-farm planning option and that it is integrated into such a plan.  I am a perfect example of it myself.  It is 27 years since I planted my first 8 ha and three years ago, I added another 10 ha on marginal land, which has not interfered at all with the output of the farm.  All it has done is that it has tried to add some income support to it.</p> <p>I will deal with a number of issues but will deal first with Senator Boyhan's point about Avondale.  Coillte has plans and has secured planning permission for an investment totalling &euro;8 billion in the first phase.  It envisions two things, as it is seen in many ways as the cradle of modern democracy and the cradle of forestry.  There will be a whole Victorian interactive "At home with the Parnells" experience in the house and surrounding grounds.  The other part is about opening up the park and having a treetop walkway from which one can travel back down a lift, and then one can then walk around Lovers Leap, as it is called, as well as other areas.  It will be a whole woodland experience there.  It was Samuel Hayes who initially brought in species from all over the world and experimented with them in the 18th century when he owned the property.</p> <p>As I noted earlier, forestry contributes in a significant way to climate change.  To address Senator Mulherin's point, there are efforts to explore the idea of having combined district heating and power options.  There are only so many major processing mills.  There is one in County Galway and another in County Leitrim but there is not one in counties Mayo or Roscommon.  There is one in the North, namely, the Balcas mill in Enniskillen.  There certainly is scope for the development of regional district heating systems.  In Finland, I have seen a pulp mill that ten years ago remained closed for nine months but which is now exporting material to China for the purpose of textiles, which is part of its bio-economy.  China is replacing much of its fossil-based products with products from the bioeconomy, and from trees in particular.</p> <p>I should point out that last year in 2018, following on from the mid-term review, albeit from a low platform, 27% of all new plantings were broad leaves.  Farm forestry will be considered as part of the overall Pillar 2 CAP negotiations.  The development of the new CAP programme will see a minimum of 30% of Pillar 2 funding being spent on climate and environmental-related measures.  Some 40% of CAP's overall budget is expected to contribute to climate action, while at the same time providing what I believe is an economic benefit through the primary product of timber itself and its by-products to the local farms. </p> <p>I would be the first to say that planting practices in the past were erroneous.  The idea of a monoculture, close to the road, houses and rivers was an error, just like advertising for smoking.  Let us be honest about that.  I note a forest application and appeals system has been in place since the mid-term review and planting practice today insists upon 15% broadleaf, 15% by diversity, as well as setback distances from roads, rivers and houses.  A lot of the plantations that are monoculture today will have, when clear-felled and replanted, a landscape that will look significantly different.  It is also important to point out that even in monoculture plantations, once the roadway network is put in and it is first thinned, it is never a closed canopy again.  It is reckoned that between years seven and 17 in a relatively healthy good-yielding conifer plantation is the time that the thicket closes, which is before the first thinning.  Once that opens up, it is fair to say that it never becomes a closed canopy again.</p> <p>The replanting obligation was mentioned on several occasions here and it certainly is an issue.  I would ask that it be borne in mind that all revenue from the sale of timber is tax-free.  This is called an afforestation programme, which is meant to increase the national forest estate.  It is difficult to know if we would even be given clearance to do so, but if we were to say that we do not have a replanting obligation - even if it is the case that most people would not opt for it -  one has to consider the implications of the tax benefit that has been given through the establishment grant and premium payments that have been made tax-free, and indeed from the sale of the product.  One also needs to factor in, which is never mentioned, the carbon emissions that one will create by digging out and getting rid of root systems and returning that land to other use.  There may something that can be done with it by way of an option if we get our targets raised, but I would not like to speculate on that at the moment.</p> <p>On the Leitrim study, this is a broad range issue which we attempt to make as broad and as simple as possible.  There is significant consultation.  Anyone and everyone who has a point to make, be it about fire or planning permission or any related issue, including the groups that were mentioned, is free to do so.  When we published this, we also published a website and contact details to which people can make their submissions.  I would encourage everybody to do so.  They will be taken on board and will be considered.  As I said at the end of the presentation, this will inform us all, together with local policymakers and local communities, as to forestry policy as we move forward.</p> <p>I come from a county that up to last year traditionally had the highest level of plantation.  We are now just marginally behind Leitrim.  We have a bigger county so we have more trees.  We have more people working in the industry but a lower percentage of the workforce due to having a bigger population.  We have approximately 1.5% of our working population involved in the timber industry, which is nearly 1,000 people.  Leitrim is estimated to have up to 5% of their people employed in the timber industry.  One of the biggest employers in the county is a board mill plant with the supporting industries that go with that.</p> <p>Somebody's mentioned Coillte and biodiversity.  At the biodiversity conference last week, the chief operations officer for Coillte made the point that it has 70,000 ha, representing 10% of its overall estate, that are designated as a biodiverse area.  Some 10,000 ha of this area are designated as pristine.  It has a wild hazel wood project in Sligo - I do not think there is anybody present from Sligo - and it intends to enhance it and spend quite a lot of money in turning it into a nature park and biodiverse Mecca, which can be a model for other parts of its property.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Andrew Doyle:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Bord na M&oacute;na ecologist outlined its plans to re-wet some of the peatlands to bring them back to the original habitats.  If they are re-wet the carbon can be trapped but if they are left exposed the carbon emits.  Bord na M&oacute;na will consider other options, including wind energy, tree planting, biomass production and conservation, all merging into a total policy use for the land it is responsible for.  It works hand in glove with Coillte on that.  </p><p>When talking about conifers people talk about spruce, and not other conifers, such as Douglas fir and Scots pine which is a native conifer.  Most people regard it as a broad leafed tree but it is actually a conifer.  It is a slower growing one and is hardier - for example, it will resist frost in May whereas Sitka spruce will not.  All these products have an enhanced value in timber use and production but Sitka spruce is the most versatile and, although it is nearly a bad term, it has the most commercial potential.  If we are planting GPC 3, grant and premium rate 3, which is Sitka spruce, with 15% broad leaves, and up to 15% in terms of biodiversity areas, for every 100 ha we plant in Sitka spruce, we get 15 ha in broad leaves which is half our target.  Native woodlands went up threefold last year.  We have a woodland environment scheme which will allow corporate social responsibility from major investors to add to the attraction for landowners of planting native woodlands.</p><p>Among the other things we are trying to do to make landowners who have plantations that are more than 15 or 20 years post-premium is to make them aware of the value of the resource they have.  I touched on it in my opening address.  We have "Talking Timber", a timber marketing event, and a forest open day on wood mobilisation.  These are information days, mainly driven by Teagasc but with the Department, the knowledge transfer groups and the producer groups to make people aware of the value of the resource.  I hope that after the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which will coincide with the next forestry programme, that we will be able to blend into the CAP an acknowledgement and a reward for people who plant trees because this is part of one of the environmental measures.  It is not the only one but it is certainly part of it.  I see no harm in the biodiverse area within a plantation allowing somebody to have, in that area which will not have any trees, a bee habitat and get paid for it.  I do not see why that should not happen.  It could blend in perfectly.  That is an example of something I think could happen.</p><p>We have a NeighbourWood scheme which sometimes we do not sell too well but it is really good.  There is one in Balla in County Mayo, one at Vartry Lakes and one in Dunmore East.  The Department will support a community-led initiative to create a NeighbourWood scheme which is a walkway, recreation and information interactive setting.  The grants are quite generous.  There have been at least two information days.  The one in Dunmore East generated a lot of interest and a significant number of applications from community groups around the country.  It is estimated that that industry is worth more than &euro;300 million not just forestry but recreation, in particular walking.  It is an area that has great potential.</p><p>I agree there should be a land use policy.  When I wrote the Fine Gael manifesto for agriculture in 2011, I said we needed to develop a total land use plan which includes food production, energy production, environmental and carbon mitigation and recreation and put all of that into a policy.  I guarantee that we can achieve our forestry targets and protect communities that feel under threat.  We can make it part of an overall land use plan that deals with all those key issues.  Landowners need to see this as part of their own farm operations as opposed to being an alternative.  That is the key to this.  If everybody did a little and planted 5 ha, 6 ha or 10 ha, we could hit our targets and improve the economies of all those small holdings and be rewarded with the environmental climate change benefit which could be achieved from that type of initiative.</p></speech>

I will leave it to my colleague Senator Norris to confirm this, but I believe we had all agreed that the words "the Commission shall" in subsection (2) removed any element of doubt.</p> <p>On the Minister prescribing a time period, we did not want to leave the process open-ended.  Having sat on interview boards for public appointments, the Minister will be aware of the difficulties in bringing a board together, getting agreement on the advertisement to be placed and deciding the marking scheme to be applied and the questions to be asked.  As appointments are made to the Supreme Court, it may be necessary for the court to call on expertise in criminal law, corporate law and so on.  All of these matters give rise to the possibility of an appeal.  If one tries to scope the advertisement in a particular direction, one is automatically excluding other people.  This will cause serious problems.  Our main concern is that we not leave the process open-ended, whereby a post will be left unfilled for an extraordinary length of time.</p></speech>

When it comes to the restaurant, it is a grey area.</p> <p>Regarding my difficulties with the word "may" where it appears a second time in the amendment, it would be better if it was turned into "shall", but I accept that the matter is covered by subsection (2) which governs the entire process.  I am satisfied in that regard and there is no difficulty.</p> <p>I am distressed to hear phrases such as "marking scheme".  That sounds as if judges will be held up like schoolchildren for some little test by outside consultants.  That is not their function.  I do not at all like the idea of marking judges.  The purpose of the amendment is clear and obvious, namely, to allow the Government some control over how quickly the judicial appointments commission may make a recommendation in respect of any particular or apprehended vacancy.  It is an absolutely essential check and balance over the commission to ensure the Government will not completely outsource and lose control over its constitutional function to recommend to the President judicial nominees.  This is an important point about the idea of outsourcing to consultants something that is part of the essential Government's prerogative.  Article 35 of the Constitution states clearly and explicitly that it is the right of the Government to recommend to the President an appointment to the Judiciary.  This provision cannot be undermined or changed without a vote of the people.  It is included in the Constitution for a good reason.</p> <p>The Supreme Court is equivalent to the American Supreme Court, the composition of which is a matter of considerable political importance to the American people, as the composition of the Supreme Court is to the Irish people.  If the Government believes the Supreme Court is showing tendencies to be a little too liberal or illiberal, it is its right to nominate a judge whose appointment is intended to ensure the balance will be correctly maintained according to its viewpoint.  Citizens elect politicians to represent their interests, with their first task being to elect a Taoiseach who appoints the Government.</p></speech>

He can interrupt me as much as he likes.  I do not give a damn.  The longer this goes on the better as far as I am concerned, but I am being economic in what I am saying.  I will repeat what I said for the Minister's education.  The purpose of this amendment is clear and obvious, namely, to give the Government some control in this regard.  It is an absolutely essential check and balance over the commission to ensure that the Government does not completely outsource and lose control over its constitutional function to recommend judicial nominees to the President.  What could be clearer and more directly relevant to this amendment?  The Minister was talking nonsense when he said it was irrelevant.  It is a constitutional duty of every Government and every Minister to make major decisions that have lasting impacts on citizens' lives.  Shirking those decisions, or outsourcing them, to unelected lay persons appointed by civil servants represents a gross dereliction of that duty.  </p><p>By the way, I very rarely read from a briefing.  It is not up to the Minister to point out that I was reading and that was because I had gone to the trouble of getting a brief on this matter.  It is highly technical.  Deputy McDowell is delayed in the High Court and cannot be there.  I am speaking to his amendment and I need a brief to deal adequately with these matters.  I make no apology whatever about it.  I raised a question about Members reading in the Seanad because it used to be something that was forbidden, prohibited or discouraged but I was told that is the case and they could read whatever the hell the like.</p></speech>

The point I have been trying to make, and I hope I make it clear, is that there is no simple way to fill a public appointment because, ultimately, it is reviewable by the courts, and I have been involved in public appointments during my life.  When the commission prepares its advertisement it must cover all eventualities.  My colleague, Deputy McDowell, made the point yesterday that the questions that are asked of applicants must be the same.  We cannot have different questions asked of different candidates.  They must be the same.  There must be a way to evaluate the questions in order that it can be ensured they are equally treated across all applicants.</p> <p>I fully accept what Senator Norris said.  We are talking about the most senior judicial appointments in the country but we cannot allow subjectivity to come into the appointment process.  We are talking about a process where we are trying to put in place a system to appoint members of the Judiciary.  There is no room for subjectivity in such a system.  It must be fully transparent and reviewable in the event of a dispute, and such a review must be seen to have been fair.</p> <p>There are countless cases in public appointments down through the years where people who were disappointed in a competition went for a review and in the review a marking scheme was an absolute must.  The point we are making is that we need the commission to know on the day the Minister asks it to fill a vacancy that it has X many days in which to do that.  It is up to it to find an interview board, prepare the advertisement, compile the questions it will ask of the applicants, have a marking scheme for those questions and remove any element of subjectivity because subjectivity gives rise to doubt.  That is what we are trying to ensure.  That is the nub of what I hope will be in this new section 45.</p> <p>Let there be no doubt about it.  I do not care how senior a position we are appointing, be it from the Chief Justice down, every applicant is entitled to know that he or she was treated in a fair and consistent manner.  Applicants are entitled to know what marks were available for each question, how many of those marks they got and why they lost marks.  They are entitled to all of that.  They are also entitled to have themselves compared against the ultimate winners.  I do not know how we will do that because we are talking about putting three people forward.</p> <p>Senator Norris adverted to the fact of their being external consultants.  There is an issue where external consultants may be used in the short-listing process.  That is something that would have to be built into the time to which we are adverting.  If the Minister accepts this amendment, and I hope he will, in setting a time limit for the commission to report, it will have to take into account all the matters I outlined, including the possibility of an appeals process because natural justice requires that there would be an appeals process of some sort or other.  I will leave it at that and await the Minister's response.</p></speech>

First, I have certainly reflected, and I know the Acting Chairman has asked the Minister to reflect on his comments about the nature of the House.  Having sat here and listened to those comments and reflected on them, I believe they are extraordinary.  The tenor of them is to reflect on the leadership of the House, which is in the hands of Fine Gael as a Government party and not in the hands of Senator Norris or anyone else other than the person designated and the party position designated for leadership.  It was an unfortunate comment.  The Chair was right to ask the Minister to reflect on it and I believe the comments should be withdrawn because they reflect upon the Leader of the Seanad, not upon any of us who have been participating in this debate.</p></speech>

It is very welcome that we do that and is a practice we have had for some time but there is still a Leader of the Seanad and that is a post and a role that is held currently by Fine Gael.  It is unfortunate if comments reflect badly on that person because the Leader does seek to lead by negotiation and by giving every other leader of the groups notice.  That is welcome and is an exemplary style of leadership.  It is unfortunate that the Minister would make a comment that suggests the leadership of the House is somehow lacking or inadequate.  I call upon the Minister again to withdraw his remark.</p> <p>I have not spoken much in recent times on the Committee Stage of this Bill because my amendments have been dealt with.  We have debated those and I have indicated to the Minister that I would withdraw quite a number of them in order to resubmit them on Report Stage, notably those on the gender balance issue around sections 44 and 45.  However, I wish to speak briefly on Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments on the amendments we are debating currently, Nos. 91(d), (e) and (f), and the fact Senator Norris, as he has said, was reading from a briefing with which he had been provided.  That is an absolutely acceptable practice.  If I am not personally able to be present when my amendments are before the House I would provide a written briefing to whatever colleague I had asked to introduce them on my behalf.  That is what Senator Norris was doing, as he has said, and there is nothing wrong with that.</p></speech>

It seems an obvious amendment to deal with separation of powers and the Executive's constitutional function.  This is really where we are at.  There are serious questions about constitutionality going through this entire debate and Senators McDowell, Craughwell and I have, I think, laid a trail as a result of which I believe and hope the President will refer this Bill to the Supreme Court.  It is not the Oireachtas that appoints judges, it is the Government.  That is a function which has been vested in the Executive by the Constitution and that will remain the case until and unless there is a referendum that changes that.</p> <p>In a constitutional situation, where there is no question whatever but that it is the Government that appoints, the dangers of creating kangaroo courts where the Oireachtas acts as an effective overseer of judicial action, or exercises quasi-judicial functions, is a very topical and relevant issue following today's Supreme Court ruling.  This has to be taken into account.  There has been a very important action in the Supreme Court taken by Ms Angela Kerins and there is a decision today from the Supreme Court which is directly relevant to this amendment.  The Supreme Court found the D&aacute;il's Committee of Public Accounts, of which the Minister who is promoting this Bill, Deputy Ross, was a member, acted significantly outside its terms in reference in its dealings with the former chief executive of the Rehab group, Angela Kerins.  The Supreme Court found it has the power to declare the actions of the Committee of Public Accounts unlawful.  That is the nub of where we are at.</p> <p>As a result of this decision of the Supreme Court today, the kind of interventions contemplated could be deemed to be unlawful and it is significant and interesting to note that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was one of the members of the Committee of Public Accounts, the actions of which have been called into question by the Supreme Court.  It shows a track record of him going outside the remit of the committee.  This case is a perfect example of the dangers inherent in the Oireachtas jumbling its constitutional functions and powers and the proposed amendment seeks to ensure there is no repeat of these mistakes when it comes to judicial appointments.  In other words, the judgment of the Supreme Court shows that the Oireachtas was in fact jumbling its powers and the Supreme Court has seen fit to rebuke the Committee of Public Accounts and hold that its actions are unlawful.  That means it imperative that we ensure this does not happen again in respect of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.</p> <p>It is inevitable that if a constraint is imposed on the Executive that it must inform the Oireachtas whether it has or has not accepted the commission's recommendation for a judicial nominee but, instead of its own motion, recommends another candidate for the Judiciary, the judicial nominee would be sullied and unfortunately name abused, probably in the D&aacute;il Chamber which is often like a dog fight in action and where there is no restraint in shredding people's reputations.  That is another danger.  I urge the Minister to take on board this amendment, which was very seriously put down by Senator McDowell.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#JJ00100"><p>We discussed the issue of confidentiality and the importance of not damaging a person's good name or reputation.  We discussed recently the impact of the commission failing on its first attempt to find suitable candidates to recommend to Government for judicial appointment.  I made the point at that time that if the commission had to go through a second round, speculation in the media, on social media, in politics and in the Law Library would become more and more prevalent the longer it took to find suitable people.  We are trying to ensure that no pressure can be brought to bear on a Government or Minister to provide any insight into the commission's deliberations.  We do not want names to be mentioned.  For example, if a senior counsel is appointed to a senior judicial position for which a judge on the panel for appointment did not make it to the shortlist, what damage would that do to the judge's reputation and his or her position on the Bench?  Similarly, what damage would it do to the reputation and practice of a senior counsel who was not rated for a judicial position?</p> <p>Assuming the President is prepared to enact the legislation without referring it to the courts, I have no doubt that, as soon as more than one panel is required to fill a single vacancy, horrendous pressure will be applied to Ministers and the Government to answer questions on why it took two or three rounds to find a suitable judge.  Speculation will be rife across the social system.  The purpose of the amendment is to try to protect a Minister and Government from having to disclose anything about anyone.  It is a tall ask because all those who are eligible may apply for a judicial position.  There is a facility to bring in outside consultants to rank the candidates.  Confidentiality is vital when consultants draw up a scheme to rank the candidates for the consideration of the commission.  The commission will then choose three names from that list.  Everybody will want to know who applied, how they fared and why some were rejected.  We are trying to protect reputations and the Government.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Norris, referred to a case which seems, on the face of it, to have backfired on the Oireachtas.  This is dangerous because the separation of powers is one of the most important tenets that we survive on.  When the courts are adjudicating on what went on in an Oireachtas committee, it sets a bad precedent.  It is not for me to criticise the Supreme Court and I am not for one moment doing that - it is doing its job - but if we leave ourselves open to that type of scrutiny, we risk damaging the Oireachtas to the point where nothing can be said or done.  We cannot allow that to happen.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

Section 49 contains elements of the amendment shared across the House.  I will seek to have removed from the Bill section 49(2) and (3), which relate to the publication of reasoned written explanations of any decision not to nominate a person recommended by the commission, along the lines of what Senators have been saying here, with which I do not disagree.  The amendment we are discussing goes further than the later amendment No. 97, which we will have an opportunity to discuss.  I do not want to cut across or contradict section 49 and for that reason I am not accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

It is very interesting that one of the points the Minister makes is that he will seek to amend the Bill by withdrawing section 49(2) which states:</p><blockquote>In the event that a person appointed to judicial office has not been recommended by the Commission under this Act, the Minister shall within 30 days of that appointment cause to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas a statement containing a reasoned written explanation of the decision of the Government not to nominate a candidate recommended by the Commission.</blockquote> <p>This is a most extraordinary provision.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1392" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#JJ00800"><p>Absolutely.  The same principle emerges with regard to amendment No. 91e which states:</p><blockquote>Nothing in this Act shall require the Government or the Minister to make any statement or explanation to the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to its advice to the President in respect of any person for appointment to any judicial office, whether or not the person was a person recommended by the Commission for appointment under this Act.</blockquote> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about circumstances where the person was recommended.  Far more significant is the circumstance where the person is not recommended.  While I believe the Minister is in large part in agreement with us on this issue, I ask him to contemplate a particular situation as it would be more economical if it was accepted at this point.  This is, once again, a case of live horse and one will get grass, with the Minister saying he will introduce an amendment.  We have, therefore, a hypothetical amendment overshadowing discussions of a specific and particular amendment.  I am not sure that is good practice.  Let us consider a situation where a High Court judge makes an application to be appointed to the Supreme Court, the Government decides not to appoint him and then gives the reasons for not appointing him.  Obviously, these must involve some defect of character, legal training or expertise or related to previous bad judgments in court cases and so on.  How on earth would that judge go back to his role in the High Court because he would be discredited and his reputation completely damaged?  How could he operate properly as a judge of the High Court in those circumstances?  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment at this point.</p></speech>

I am a bit conflicted in not pursuing it, given the way the debate has gone in this House.  If I call a vote, the chances are that I will lose it.  We are talking about people's reputations, and we have all seen how this country works.  Indeed, in the Minister's Government we have seen fine people hounded out of office by a media frenzy, either cooked up within this Oireachtas or fed to the media.  I had to apologise to the Minister's predecessor for getting caught up in that because I think a decent woman was run out of office.  I can just imagine the furore within the shark-infested waters in and around this House and the demand to know who applied and how they fared.  We love to take people's reputations down in this country.  It is a feature of our society that we like to take people down.  With this Bill we are expecting people to apply for judicial appointments in the future.  If we get one bad outcome, it is going to destroy the entire process of people applying for judicial posts.</p><p>Will the Minister give me some sort of guarantees, and I know we are not at section 49, as to where we will be before I consider whether I will divide the House on this?  I am very mindful that the Minister has been more than facilitating in any area that I have debated with him until now and I am mindful not to frustrate him any further but I would like to have some sort of guarantees.</p></speech>

I would like to make another comment on this.  I refer directly to the Government's explanatory memorandum dealing with section 45.  It reads, "Section 45 requires the relevant committee, in respect of each name that it recommends for appointment to judicial office, and also in respect of each name of an eligible applicant that it cannot recommend, to provide the Minister with particulars of the person&rsquo;s education, professional qualifications, experience and character, and where applicable, the results of interviews or tests conducted by the relevant committee."  This is quite extraordinary.  Details of the judge's education would go back to primary school and secondary school.  Where does it go?  Who are these people appointed to examine this and to establish the educational background of a possible judge?  As to "professional qualifications", if somebody is in the High Court already, presumably he or she has professional qualifications.  It is redundant for a group of consultants to reflect on the question of their qualifications.  As to "experience and character", will the Minister explain to the House what is meant by the word "character"?  This opens the way to character assassination.  It would be a most extraordinary situation to have a group of consultants giving a long disposition on the character of a proposed judge, whatever about the results of interviews or tests conducted by the relevant committee.  What kind of tests is it going to conducted?  Will it be the Rorschach test?  Will the Minister comment on this business, particularly on the business of character?  Are we assuming that there are justices in existence at the moment of bad or dubious character about whom there are question marks?  I just do not know.  It seems extraordinary to me.</p></speech>

Section 45 requires the commission - as it states, "The Commission shall" - to provide the Minister in writing with a statement setting out the reasons a person is suitable for appointment to the judicial office concerned each time it recommends the name of a person to the Minister.  That is the section unadorned with any amendment because the amendments have now been rejected.  I am genuinely puzzled about what format the statement shall be in and what detail is it envisaged the commission shall provide to the Minister in respect of suitability for appointment.  It is an unusual one.  I speak as someone who has sat on interview panels, as many colleagues will have, and generally feedback is provided to people who are not recommended for appointment in the course of job interviews for posts as to the reasons they are unsuitable for appointment.  What sort of reasons would be given as to why a person would be suitable for appointment, what would be the level of detail and how personal would a letter of recommendation be?  It is a genuine question.  I will not labour the point but has the Minister a view on this?  Is it something that will be spelled out in greater detail in guidelines or regulations to be attached to the legislation, if and when passed, or is this all that the commission will be given in terms of guidance as to reasons?</p></speech>

I would not see it going beyond that.</p></speech>

Senator Norris also made a point in this respect.  It is helpful to hear the Minister say that but where is it set out that this is all the commission needs to do?  It seems the commission could take a very different view of the sort of the detail that would required in setting out the reasons a person would be suitable for appointment, rather than that simple statement of name, years of experience and so on.  It seems a much more detailed set of reasons might be provided by a particular commission.  There is an issue about consistency of reasons across different recommendations and across different persons.  One would not want to see the commission setting out a lengthy list of reasons one person is suitable for appointment and simply the bare bones of the name, years of experience and so on in respect of another person because one could then immediately have a hierarchy in terms of levels of suitability for appointment to judicial office.  I do not know if it is enough that the Minister simply gives us this clarification, helpful though it is.  We would need to know where is the basis for that clarification.</p></speech>

It states: "Section 45 requires the relevant committee, in respect of each name that it recommends for appointment to judicial office, and also in respect of each name of an eligible applicant that it cannot recommend, to provide the Minister with particulars of the person&rsquo;s education, professional qualifications, experience and character, and where applicable, the results of interviews or tests conducted by the relevant committee."  That is very significantly greater and much wider in scope that what the Minister suggested.  I am not for one minute suggesting that the Minister is misinforming or misleading the House but there does seem to be a contradiction there.  A large number of items are set out there, including education - the Minister did not mention the person's education - professional qualifications, experience and character, and where applicable, the results of interviews or tests conducted by the relevant committee.  I would ask the Minister to explain the business of character in this respect.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the opportunity to engage with the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann on matters related to the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces and look forward to listening to their contributions.</p> <p>The security of the State and its citizens is a whole-of-government concern.  A broad range of Departments and agencies are assigned security responsibilities.  Providing for the military defence of the State&rsquo;s territory is fundamental a security requirement, for which responsibility is vested specifically in the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  The defence contribution to security also encompasses defence inputs to domestic security, particularly in support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which has primary responsibility for protecting the internal security of the State; defence inputs to the State&rsquo;s response to large-scale emergencies; and defence inputs to international peace and security.  In addition, defence resources are used for other non-security tasks which maximise the utility of defence assets for the benefit of the State.  All of these requirements highlight the key role the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and Civil Defence play within the State&rsquo;s security and support framework.</p> <p>Security is the bedrock on which a society&rsquo;s cultural, social and economic achievements are built.  Defence underpins Ireland&rsquo;s security, as well as the promotion of the State&rsquo;s strategic interests in the international environment.  I know that I will have the support of all Members of this House when I say Irish people, rightly, take great pride in the Defence Forces and the contribution they make to domestic security, international peace and security and also to the broad range of supports provided for other Departments and State agencies on an ongoing basis.  I have witnessed at first hand the important work the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service undertake, both at home and overseas.</p> <p>It is also important to recognise the excellent work of Civil Defence, as part of the local government response, in supporting communities in times of adversity.  The commitment of members of Civil Defence and the Reserve Defence Force is testament to the continued spirit of voluntary service that enriches Irish society in so many ways.</p> <p>As Members will be aware, the White Paper of Defence provides the strategic and comprehensive defence policy framework for the period up to 2025.  Since its approval by the Government in 2015, the White Paper has driven the identification of key priorities and, with A Programme for a Partnership Government agreed to in 2016, informed many of the strategic goals, objectives and actions contained in the shared strategy statement of my Department and the Defence Forces.  I am pleased with the progress made to date by my Department and the Defence Forces in the implementation of the White Paper.  Their work in that regard has laid solid foundations for many of the developmental aspects of the White Paper which charts a course for the continued development of capabilities across the defence organisation, while recognising that people are the key element of success.  The Government is committed to ensuring the defence organisation is one in which people, both civil and military, are proud to serve.</p> <p>While the White Paper provides the strategic and comprehensive defence policy framework for the ten year period up to 2025, the framework is nevertheless designed to be flexible and responsive, which I believe is important, given the dynamic nature of the current security environment.  The framework is also designed to enable the defence organisation which comprises the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces to be adaptive to changing circumstances and use its resources as efficiently as possible.  It is within that context that the White Paper has set out the Government&rsquo;s intention to establish a process of fixed cycle defence reviews which are common internationally and give assurance that policy remains up to date and relevant to changing future circumstances.  The White Paper specifically provides that the reviews are to have a three yearly cycle, with every second review being more comprehensive in nature.  As such, they are to be styled as a strategic defence review.  The White Paper specified that the first in the new cycle of reviews would be a White Paper update, which my Department commenced in July last year.  I am pleased to advise Members that work is now well advanced on the White Paper update, with two key strands close to completion.  One relates to the work of an interdepartmental and inter-agency group established to carry out a fully updated assessment of the security environment, while the second is a review of progress in the implementation of the White Paper.</p> <p>Another important element of this process will be my meeting next Tuesday with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, at which we will discuss the White Paper implementation project which is being undertaken by a joint civil-military project team and focused on developing a formalised structure for fixed cycle defence reviews.  In accordance with the White Paper, the periodic reviews are to become a permanent feature of the approach to defence policy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paul Kehoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It highlights the connectivity between defence provision and the proper functioning of civil society which is not always well understood or immediately obvious.  Defence provision, as a foundation element of national security, remains critical and fundamental to the success and operation of most other public policies.</p><p>The defence sector is made up of two Votes, namely, Vote 35, Army Pensions, and Vote 36, Defence.  The combined Estimates for both Votes for 2019 provides for gross expenditure of some &euro;1.007 billion, an increase of &euro;60 million or 6.4% over 2018.  The 2019 provision comprises &euro;758 million for Vote 36, an increase of over &euro;50 million, and &euro;249 million for Vote 35, an increase of &euro;10 million.  The 2019 pay allocation of &euro;529 million for Vote 36 provides for the pay and allowances of more than 10,400 public service employees, including 9,500 Permanent Defence Forces, PDF, personnel, 550 civilian employees and 355 civil servants and makes provision for increases due under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  The non-pay allocation comprises both current and capital elements.  The current expenditure allocation of &euro;123 million for 2019 provides mainly for expenditure on ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.  In accordance with the National Development PIan 2018-2027, the capital allocation for Vote 36 has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million.  This represents an increase of 38% on the 2018 allocation.  The NDP provides for a total of &euro;541 million over the period from 2018 to 2022.  This substantial increase in funding will allow the defence sector to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, as identified and prioritised in the White Paper on Defence.  The Vote 35 allocation for 2019 of &euro;249 million, which is non-discretionary and demand-led, includes an additional &euro;10 million on the 2018 allocation.  This allocation will provide funding for some 12,400 Army pensioners and their dependants.  The allocation of more than &euro;1 billion for the defence sector for 2019 emphasises the importance attached by the Government to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the resources necessary to deliver on all roles assigned by Government, both at home and overseas, and demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the capabilities necessary to deliver on all their assigned roles.</p><p>As members will be well aware, Ireland has a long and proud tradition of participation in United Nations mandated peace support operations.  The deployment of the Defence Forces on such missions continues to provide an active and very tangible demonstration of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to supporting the maintenance of international peace and security.  Ireland currently has 673 Defence Forces personnel deployed in nine different missions throughout the world and also to a range of international organisations and national representations.  Ireland&rsquo;s main commitments overseas are to the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and the UN Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights.  The UNIFIL mission is Ireland&rsquo;s largest overseas mission, with 458 personnel deployed.  Irish troops served as part of a joint Irish-Finnish battalion in UNIFIL until November 2018 when, due to other national commitments, Finland withdrew from the battalion.  As an interim measure, an additional contingent of approximately 106 Defence Forces personnel has been deployed to the UNIFIL mission to cover the back-filling of the Finnish contingent for a 12 month period.  This additional commitment will continue throughout 2019 as Ireland has assumed full duties and responsibilities of IRISHBATT up to November 2019.  Poland has advised that it would be willing to partner Ireland in UNIFIL from November 2019.  It is proposed that Hungarian personnel would also deploy as part of the Polish contingent.  Discussions on the details of this arrangement are currently being advanced.  UNDOF in Syria is the second largest mission, with 136 personnel.  The main Irish contingent, comprising a force reserve company of 130 personnel, successfully completed its relocation to Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the area of separation in September 2018.</p><p>As members may be aware, the D&aacute;il recently approved Ireland&rsquo;s ratifying of the EU status of forces agreement, SOFA, and Ireland&rsquo;s signing and ratifying of the NATO Partnership for Peace, PfP, SOFA.  This was a significant and positive decision and was one that I very much welcomed.  SOFAs provide for immunities and privileges extended to members of the Defence Forces when serving on overseas missions.  It is important that the brave men and women of our Defence Forces serving overseas are as protected as all other military personnel operating on the same mission or on the same exercise.  SOFAs also relate to the immunities and privileges extended to members of the Defence Forces when engaged in exercises in EU or NATO and PfP member states, or on standby for the EU battle groups.  With this in mind, I want our personnel to benefit fully from the training available through exercising with peacekeeping partners and troop contributing states where such opportunities are available.  Ratification of the status of forces agreements assists in the delivery of such benefits for our Defence Forces.</p><p>In terms of personnel numbers, the White Paper on Defence confirmed the strength of the PDF at 9,500, comprising 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service personnel.  The strength of the PDF across all services and ranks at the end of 2018 was 8,957 personnel.  The Government remains committed to ongoing recruitment to increase this strength to the establishment level of 9,500.  In 2018, this resulted in 611 new entrants being inducted, in addition to 15 PDF members being awarded a cadetship.  The 2019 recruitment campaign commenced with the recent Naval Service general service recruitment competition which closed on 21 January last.  A further 800 new entrants will be targeted in 2019, comprising of general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers.  Retention of specialised personnel such as pilots and air traffic controllers in the Air Corps is a significant challenge in the light of the demands arising for such skills in a growing economy.  Air Corps personnel are an attractive employment source for airlines and other air service providers given their experience and training.  Every effort is being made to address the current shortages in personnel faced by the Air Corps.  Actions to return to a full level of air traffic control, ATC, services by the Air Corps are under way which will facilitate a gradual extension of operational hours for ATC services in Baldonnel over the year as newly qualified personnel develop their experience.</p><p>Public service pay and pensions are a very significant component of Government expenditure.  Similar to other areas within the public service, the pay of PDF personnel was reduced during the financial crisis.  The reduction in pay was on a graduated basis with increased rates of deductions for those on higher earnings.  This action was one of many measures taken to stabilise the financial situation which faced the country following the economic collapse.  Improvements in the economy have provided the opportunity to unwind, in a fair and sustainable manner, the reductions in pay imposed on public servants, including Defence Forces personnel, under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, FEMPI.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paul Kehoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements.  The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement.  Increases due to date under the agreement have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel.  Further increases in pay are scheduled for later in 2019 and 2020.  By the end of the current public service pay agreement the pay scales of all public servants earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, including members of the Defence Forces, will be restored to pre-FEMPI levels.  The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.</p><p>The Public Service Pay Commission is currently examining recruitment and retention issues in the defence sector.  This is on foot of an initial submission from the Department of Defence.  The commission's work is ongoing.  The Government will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations that arise from the work of the commission.  The commission has recently written to the management parties seeking a meeting which I understand is scheduled to take place next Tuesday, 5 March.  This follows the joint submission by military management and my Department.</p><p>Aside from the important issue of pay, the civil and military authorities continue to address a broad range of human resources, HR, related issues such as the working time directive, the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, complaints procedures, including bullying and harassment, the independent monitoring group and other issues such as colour blindness, eyesight standards for the Naval Service Reserve and height requirements.  In terms of the working time directive, as I previously informed the D&aacute;il, a Government decision dated 18 November 2016 approved the drafting of the heads of a Bill to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  This will remove the exclusion contained in section 3 of the Act.  There is ongoing contact between my Department and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection with regard to legislative change.</p><p>The Reserve Defence Force consists of the First Line Reserve, the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve.  Personnel in the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve are represented by the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, with which the Department of Defence is due to meet in the coming weeks.  The Government recognises the important role that the three elements of the RDF play in contributing to Ireland's defence capability.  The White Paper on defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the RDF, and it is currently on a developmental path arising from the recommendations of the White Paper.  Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions, two White Paper projects have been identified which are important precursors to the establishment of a specialist reserve.  A gap analysis of skill sets in the Permanent Defence Force will identify potential roles for Reserve members who possess specialist skills.  Options to develop the First Line Reserve are also currently being examined.</p><p>With regard to Brexit, as part of a whole-of-Government approach my Department continues to engage in forward planning with the other Departments involved in addressing all issues relevant to the UK decision to exit from the European Union.  I am satisfied that the necessary arrangements are in place in the defence organisation to address the potential challenges arising from Brexit.  Both the Department and the Defence Forces are currently engaged in prudent planning in response to the UK vote of June 2016.  Structures have been put in place in my Department to address the potential challenges arising from Brexit.  The Government's stated goal remains - to ensure that the current island border arrangements are maintained to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>Before I conclude, I should mention that my Department also has responsibilities in respect of emergency planning and Civil Defence.  The office of emergency planning, OEP, of which I am chairman, is a joint civil-military office within the Department and supports the incumbent Minister in the role of chairman of the Government task force on emergency planning.  The task force oversees the emergency planning preparations in Departments and the public authorities under their aegis.  The OEP supports sustained public awareness and reassurance regarding a whole-of-Government approach to emergency planning and responses to national level emergencies and crises.  The OEP liaises both nationally and at international level on risk and best practices in emergency planning.</p><p>Civil Defence is a statutory volunteer based organisation with units located in each local authority area.  The organisation is managed and developed at national level through the Civil Defence branch of my Department.  It provides second line support to the principal response agencies, which are An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, and the local authorities, and other State bodies for a broad range of operations and events.  There are some 4,500 trained and active volunteers in the Civil Defence who provide essential supports in time of need.  The Department of Defence has recently commenced a wide ranging review of the roles of the Civil Defence, which is important given that the Civil Defence was established as far back in 1951.  A wide range of stakeholders are being consulted on the future direction of the Civil Defence, including the principal response agencies and the Civil Defence officers in the local authorities.  As part of the consultation process the Department organised eight regional volunteer consultation meetings which took place in October and November 2018.  I am pleased to report that over 400 volunteers attended these meetings, which allowed volunteers to air their views on the future development of the Civil Defence and to contribute to a roadmap for the development of the Civil Defence over the next ten to 15 years.  I was delighted to have the opportunity to attend some of these meetings and to meet some of the volunteers.</p><p>Finally, with regard to the decade of centenaries and the desire to ensure a successful commemorative programme, both the staff of my Department and members of the Defence Forces continue to work closely with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of the Taoiseach on planning for appropriate Defence Forces input to the various centenary events that will occur between now and 2023.</p><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the Seanad this evening and I look forward to hearing Members' thoughts and views on defence matters.  I have tried to touch on a number of current issues that have been raised in the House and I will be delighted to address these and any further issues of interest later.  I tried to cover as much as possible in my statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1394" speakername="Ned O'Sullivan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#RR00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am substituting for our party's defence spokesperson, Senator Wilson, who is otherwise engaged in his capacity as party Whip.  He has been kind enough to provide me with a brief and he asked me to raise some issues on his behalf, which I am happy to do.  Before that, however, I wish to say that I have immense respect for our Defence Forces - land, sea and air - as does the entire population.  We are proud of them and they do us proud in everything they do.  They are loyal to the State and to their commander-in-chief, if that is the proper term, Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann.  The current President, Michael D. Higgins, has always acknowledged and appreciated their service and has always given them a proper profile at his functions.</p> <p>I must state a conflict of interest insofar as in a number of my elections to the Seanad I was nominated by the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations, of which the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, are constituent bodies.  I was very proud to receive that nomination and through engaging with those bodies I believe I have an enhanced insight into the operations of our Defence Forces, which has made me admire them even more.  In my youth I was a member of Forsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il, FCA, which sadly is no longer with us and has been replaced by the Reserve Defence Force.  It was a very formative and useful experience when I was growing up.  Many young people were taught life skills, discipline and patriotism through being members of the FCA.  At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, we heard from a delegation from the Reserve Defence Force.  I ask the Minister of State to attend closely to what it has presented to him as its representatives make some very valid points.</p> <p>To return to Senator Wilson's concerns, he has stated that since 1992 the Defence Forces have undergone eight re-organisations or reviews.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is an average of one every three years.  It has resulted in turmoil, relocation, uncertainty and confusion for the members of the Defence Forces.  Such tensions and family displacements are not conducive to ensuring optimum operational viability, certainty or good morale.  The Defence Forces have been an easy target for cost-cutting.  Their unreserved loyalty and professionalism have perhaps been taken advantage of.  Policy has become a matter of fitting them into a particular budget envelope.  </p><p>Senator Wilson raised very strongly the point that the lowest paid public servants in the country were the members of the Defence Forces.  They alone, of all public service organisations, do not have the option to strike.  This should be valued.  To a certain extent, one must ask whether they are being punished for their responsible non-action.  If somebody has a weapon he or she is not using, it is incumbent on us to appreciate this and try to find other ways to bring the Defence Forces forward.  We all know that a large number of members of the Defence Forces are dependent on supplementary social welfare income to feed themselves and their families.  That is seriously wrong and shows very serious disrespect for the armed forces.  In October two Naval Service vessels were unable to set sail owing to crew shortages, while reservists were brought in to plug gaps on another ship.  The Chief of Staff said he would make a direct plea to the Public Service Pay Commission.  It is clear that he is losing trust in the Department and the Minister of State in the management of this crisis.  At the PDFORRA conference in October it was highlighted how large numbers of soldiers, sailors and Air Corps staff were buying themselves out of the Defence Forces because they were unhappy with their pay and conditions.  PDFORRA has stated that since the start of 2018 more than 170 personnel have paid money to leave the service.  More than 1,200 have done so in the past six years, with some paying up to &euro;40,000.  The association has also stated personnel are not being properly paid for working additional hours, which may mean that some are being paid less than the national minimum wage.  According to a retired regimental sergeant major, Noel O&rsquo;Callaghan, a leading member of a close knit group which is steering the campaign, almost 1,800 Defence Force members are in receipt of family income supplement, a matter to which I have referred. </p><p>New information provided for Fianna F&aacute;il shows that at the end of November 2018 there were more than 9,000 personnel serving in the Defence Forces.  This compared with a figure of 9,219 in late 2017.  The fall comes despite more than 600 recruits having been taken on during the period.  The current agreed level for the Defence Forces is 9,500.  At this stage it would be progress to reach that level.  It has been estimated that 25% of senior Air Corps pilot posts remain unfilled owing to the absence of suitably qualified and experienced candidates.  On a cost-benefit analysis alone, given that the cost of training a pilot is around &euro;1.5 million, such a policy would have the combined effect of ultimately saving money and enhancing operational capacity.  It takes six years to train a bomb disposal officer, with two years of specialist training being added to his or her four-year science or engineering university degree course.  Specialist Naval Service deck officers require years of intensive training to be able to man the bridge of a naval ship.  To achieve this wide spectrum of specialist and unique competencies, the State invests vast resources of time and money.  The failure to focus on retaining these specialist skills across the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service not only undermines capability, it is also a very serious waste of scarce resources </p><p>Another matter very close to Senator Wilson's heart is that of D&uacute;n U&iacute; Neill barracks in his county of Cavan.  When it was closed, nobody thought there was any real risk of violence returning to the Border region, but, unfortunately, we have seen indications that we are not at all secure in that respect.  As the Brexit fracas continues to weave and meander its strange way through Westminster, there is a vacuum in the North because of the failure of the two main parties to engage successfully to restore government in the North.  Where there is a vacuum in politics, there is always an avenue for people of violence, of which we have seen a little recently in Derry and other places.  Whereas I am not one to predict doom and gloom or anything like it, we have to be conscious of this issue.  The public are conscious that we are not terribly far away from something that could precipitate another 30 years of the useless, wasteful tragedy of sectarian violence with which we grew up.  The Army needs to be ready, supported and funded.  If that is not done, we will be taking some very serious risks. </p><p>My final comments are on Jadotville, an issue which has been raised several times by my colleague Senator Craughwell.  I will not delay the Minister of State, but the people concerned have been campaigning for a long time and the public know that they are right.  Insofar as he is able to do so, I ask the Minister of State to comply with their reasonable requests.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#SS00200"><p>The Minister of State is welcome.  I congratulate him, the Defence Forces and his Department on the launch of the symposium on the brigade activity reports on the military service pensions collection on Saturday at Cathal Brugha Barracks.  It was a tremendous success.  The members of the public who were present were extremely impressed by the work done by the military archives.  It is a great feather in the Minister of State's cap.  Once again, the military showed that it was capable of stepping up to the plate in performing anything asked of it.</p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned the White Paper, with the issue of retention and recruitment.  Unless I have misread it, there is nothing in the White Paper about retention.  There is something in it about recruitment, there is but absolutely nothing in it about retention.  As my colleague Senator Ned O'Sullivan has pointed out, the finest of men and women whom it has cost the state tens of thousands of euros to train are walking out the door hand over fist.  In fact, some are so anxious to get out that they are spending up to &euro;40,000 to do so.  That is the first problem with the White Paper.  I hope the Minister of State is going to tell us that the review of it in July will include a major section on retention policy.  </p> <p>Another issue about which I have some concerns is the distribution of the Defence Forces.  There is a battalion in County Donegal and another in Dundalk, but we really do not have a whole lot more until we move south of a line running from Dublin to Galway.  There are troops in Dublin but in insufficient numbers to deal with the requirements of its various military centres.  This means that troops from County Donegal, Dundalk and Athlone are travelling to Dublin to carry out standard barrack duties.  Troops from Galway are travelling to Portlaoise to guard Portlaoise Prison.  Clearly, there is a mismatch between the requirements of the State and the locations of soldiers.</p> <p>Has the Minister of State or his Department war-gamed the possibility of having to secure the Border, as was done in 2010 during the foot and mouth disease crisis?  If we have to have a border, we will need to have troops available.  At this stage, nobody can say there will not be a border.  People laughed at me in 2016 when I said it might happen.  It is now looking very likely that it will, unless some miracle takes place.</p> <p>Language is everything and I really object to the use of the term "neutrality".  Ireland is not neutral and never has been.  It is a militarily non-aligned state.  If we were to be neutral, we would have to spend the  money Finland and various other countries spend to guarantee neutrality.</p> <p>I turn to the Air Corps and the recommissioning of officers.  I would like to ask the Minister of State about this flawed project.  It has failed and no new pilots will be commissioned this year.  Two former officers will be recommissioned in the coming weeks, but it will not stem the exodus.  It is shocking to think that as many as ten pilots will leave the Air Corps this year and with a recommended pilot crew strength of 107, the Air Corps is now in serious deficit.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> We also know that there is a serious shortage of aircraft mechanics and that the strength of air traffic controllers is only at 50%.  I know that the Minister of State's office has been contacted by at least one qualified air traffic controller seeking direct entry and to my knowledge he has not received a reply.  He is currently working as an air traffic controller in the Middle East.  I will leave it at that with him.</p><p>I have been on my feet in this Chamber warning that what was going on for the past two years would lead to the depletion we have.  We cannot replace experienced people with recruits.  I know the Minister of State has tried on the recruitment side, but unless we change the terms and conditions, it simply will not happen.  </p><p>The shortage of pilots in the commercial sector is encouraging Air Corps pilots to leave.  Most of them can double the salary they get in the Defence Forces when they work for private airlines and they get greatly improved terms and conditions of employment.  The key to retention therefore is to offer comparable and competitive salary, and terms and conditions.  Some will argue that people do not join the Defence Forces for the money, but that argument cannot be used if they are living in very poor circumstances</p><p>Recommissioning is causing consternation among those in the Air Corps.  Some pilots who have been loyal to the State are somewhere close to the ranks of those who are re-entering.  I understand one is a lieutenant colonel and one is a captain.  The pilots in the Air Corps need to know that their promotional opportunities will not be impeded by these people coming back.  I understand they are to come back on a short-term contract for three years.  I would want an assurance that that contract will roll over every three years and that they will not be allowed to compete against colleagues who have remained in the Defence Forces.  They will come in and stay in as short-term commissions.  I wonder what happens to the lump sum they were paid when they left if they qualified for a pension.  Do they have to refund that in order to return?  A Deputy who loses his or her seat and subsequently becomes a Senator must return any moneys he or she got.  </p><p>RACO, the commissioned officers' association, has had consultation with the Minister of State.  I hope it was meaningful consultation and that he took its concerns on board, particularly with regard to competition for promotion.</p><p>In August 2018 the Department of Defence committed to establish a sub-committee of the conciliation council to progress the issue of the working time directive.  Officials promised terms of reference by the end of September 2018.  Now five months on, those terms of reference have not been forthcoming, despite monthly requests by the representative associations.  What is causing this delay?  When will the terms of reference be issued?  I am aware that the military management working group&rsquo;s report was submitted to the general staff and Department two weeks ago.  Does the Minister of State have any update on this?  Has this report being shared with the representative associations?  What steps is the Minister of State taking to ensure there are no further cases against the State on the implementation of the working time directive?  The Minister of State will be aware that on 12 March, three cases will come before the courts.  Once a case goes to the courts, it goes to the State Claims Agency.  However, can we do something to stop claims coming forward now to get the working time directive operating?  There are plenty of examples throughout Europe where the working time directive has been implemented and works well.</p><p>The Minister of State spoke about Vote 36 covering the pay and conditions of 9,500 Defence Forces personnel.  I believe the actual number in the Defence Forces now is approximately 9,200 and operationally it is around 8,500.  What happens to the surplus money that is not paid out?  Can we not use that money to improve the lot of soldiers who are in place?</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned Brexit and this brings me back to the issue of the Border.  If the Brits crash out of the European Union on 29 March and we are forced to have a border in place, I ask the Minister of State to reassure me that we have places to accommodate those members of the Defence Forces who will be sent to the Border regions.  We have lost the barracks in Monaghan and Cavan.  Have we war-gamed?  Have we earmarked the accommodation that may be necessary should our soldiers have to travel there?  </p><p>The Minister of State today spoke about three Defence Forces: the Permanent Defence Force; the Reserve Defence Force and the Civil Defence.  I have worn all the uniforms and served in all of them.  When I was a lad every Tuesday night on every corner there were four or five Reserve Defence Force lads waiting to go for training.  Every Sunday morning there were trucks all over Galway city to bring them to the range, bring them on exercise or whatever.  That has gone.  I understand there are less than 2,000 active available Reserve Defence Force personnel.  Clearly a major job of work needs to be done to re-establish the Reserve Defence Force in the way it was.

Today I will do something over again that I have done scores of times previously.  I was hoping the Minister of State would rescue my sanity by providing us with a different outcome.</p> <p>Since becoming a Member of the Oireachtas almost five years ago, I have referred to the Defence Forces on 324 occasions.  On a number of these occasions, I have thanked them for the great work they have done in times of difficulty, such as the support they gave us while we were helping victims of flooding or snow.  On other occasions I commended them on their fantastic peacekeeping work overseas.</p> <p>However, on the vast majority of those occasions it was to raise some aspect of the pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces.  Whether it was parliamentary questions, D&aacute;il debates, committee debates, Seanad debates, Order of Business, Commencement Matters, statements such as today, or even letters to the Minister of State or his Department, I seem to be asking the same basic questions.  I have been asking for movement on the pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces.  The wages of many ranks are poor and the hours of work are often much longer than those specified in the working time directive.  I have been calling for an increase in the military service allowance, which is payable to all Defence Forces personnel, but which would not have a knock-on effect on the remainder of the public service.</p> <p>I have been raising issues about recruitment, retention and recommissioning.  Every time I raise these issues, I get the same result: an answer written, with respect, by civil servants and designed to concede nothing.  They reheat the same speech over and over again, referring to the White Paper, which, I remind the Minister of State, is now more than four years old.  They make vague promises that there may be some reward over the rainbow of the Public Service Pay Commission.  Like the rainbow, the end of the pay commission seems to get ever further away.</p> <p>There have been promises that a sub-committee of the conciliation council would examine working hours but many months later, the Department has still not produced the terms of reference.  We have got a vague statement about the pride and esteem in which we hold these brave men and women.  However, esteem will not pay anybody's electricity bill and it is not possible to do the weekly shopping with a pocketful of pride.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->With a family background in military service and having grown up looking over the parade ground at Custume Barracks, I have a particular gr&aacute; for those who serve our country and its flag in the Army, Naval Service, Air Corps, Reserve Defence Force or Civil Defence.  They provide a diverse range of specialist capabilities across all service branches to support citizens and the State in security and crisis situations.  Their professionalism and dedication in the face of demanding challenges is unique to military service and should be acknowledged by the Government.  I take no pleasure in complaining to the Minister of State here today.  My comments are not intended to be personal.  However, the Department has given up on these fine men and women and it is the reason many of them are now leaving the Defence Forces.  We must ensure that military service is an attractive career option for young men and women.  Currently, enlisted recruits are among the lowest paid public employees and the fact that many must rely on family income supplement and other State supports speaks for itself.  Unlike other public servants, they cannot and will not strike and we should not use that fact to treat them less favourably than other public servants.</p><p>As we move towards the centenary of the establishment of the National Army in 1922, we must put in place the structures and funding to ensure &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann is motivated and resourced to commence its second century ready to meet the needs of a changing Ireland.  Throughout the history of the State, we have seen many occasions on which the Defence Forces have refused to give up.  I refuse to give up on them.  I will keep going.  I will keep doing the same thing over and over and I will continue to raise these issues until we get a different result.  If only to give himself some peace from my pestering, I ask the Minister of State to please offer the House some different outcome.  Can he tell us anything positive that has changed since the last time we had statements in the House?  If he could, it would help his sanity and mine.  More importantly, it would finally demonstrate that we support the Army founded by our party's predecessors.  It would be the first step towards providing our personnel with the recognition and absolute respect they deserve.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is very welcome to the House for these statements.  I note and appreciate his indication that he has come to the House with a listening ear.  Like Senator McFadden and other Members who have spoken, however, I feel a sense of <i>deja v&uacute;</i>around the contributions thus far.  Like other speakers, therefore, I hope we get to hear some concrete and credible proposals that will begin the process of making an impact and tangible difference to the lives of members of the Defence Forces and their families.  I have two matters to raise.  The first is the erosion of our neutrality.  I disagree with what my colleague, Senator Craughwell, said in this regard.  The second is the issue of working conditions and pay of members of the Defence Forces.</p><p>Many people are deeply concerned that there has been a consistent drip-feed of measures which are incompatible with neutrality.  A few months ago, Fine Gael MEPs produced a document which argued that our neutral position should be compromised to facilitate greater European integration.  Several EU leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker and Angela Merkel, have made it clear that they would like to see the establishment of an EU army.  I am also concerned that there is evidence that the European Defence Agency is commandeering funding streams such as those for small and medium businesses and social funding streams at EU level for defence projects.  A number of these have been successful.  The State has recently signed up to participation in PESCO projects which many believe are the foundation for greater EU defence integration and, ultimately, an EU army.  Fine Gael MEPs recently voted in the European Parliament in favour of a report calling for each member state to spend 2% of current GDP on defence.  Currently, the State spends 0.3% of GDP on defence.  The Minister of State must clarify whether he supports this position and intends to raise defence spending in line with other member states.  While Sinn F&eacute;in supports increased investment in our Defence Forces, in particular to address issues such as pay, we have huge concerns at proposed increases to align us with the European militarisation agenda.  This is particularly so in the face of the need for more houses and an improvement in our health services.  Sinn F&eacute;in has produced a Bill that seeks to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution through a referendum.  We believe that most people wish to preserve our neutral status and that any change to that status is a matter for the people, not the Government.</p><p>With respect to working conditions for Defence Forces personnel, there have been substantial cuts in pay and allowances.  There is a serious issue with retention and recruitment.  This has been recognised by the Public Service Pay Commission which is currently examining the issue.  Its report was due last year but has been delayed.  Numbers have fallen in the Defence Forces from 9,173 at the end of 2017 to 8,975 at the end of 2018.  The optimum number is 9,500.  Experienced and trained staff are leaving in their droves for the private sector where they can obtain better pay and conditions.  The Defence Forces have little or no collective bargaining rights, are prohibited from joining or affiliating with trade unions and cannot strike.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed legislation to provide collective bargaining rights for the Defence Forces and garda&iacute;.  The European Committee of Social Rights upheld a case taken by PDFORRA, which represents the ordinary rank and file membership of the Defence Forces, to establish greater collective bargaining rights of Defence Forces' members, although it also stated that the prohibition against strike action was appropriate.  Currently, members of the Defence Forces are exempt from the provisions of the working time directive and are required to work extensive hours at very short notice.  While many members accept this is a feature of the job to some extent, the issue has been exacerbated by the fact that highly expert personnel have left and those remaining have seen their workloads increase.  There are a number of cases being taken in relation to this matter.  While the Government has said an internal working group is examining the matter, it refuses to give further details as there are cases ongoing.  To me, that sounds like a cop-out.  The Government committed to bringing forward legislation on this in 2016 but we have seen no progress.  Instead, members of the Defence Forces have been forced to take cases to the High Court, which is a disgraceful necessity.</p><p>I note the remarks of the Minister of State on Brexit - all two and a half sentences of them.  His last sentence unnerves me in that it says the Government's stated goal remains to ensure current all-island border arrangements are maintained to the greatest extent possible.  That is not what the Government is saying.  The Government is saying there will be no hard border on the island and that, come hell or high water, there will be no infrastructure, mechanics or manifestation in any way of a hard border.  I heard that reaffirmed as recently as this morning at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, who was before the committee to discuss Garda numbers and the Garda presence along the Border.  The Minister of State might, therefore, reassure the people listening and watching carefully in that regard.  I listened to Senator Craughwell refer to war games along the Border and preparations for this stuff.  The Border is made up of people's back yards and farming fields.  It consists of stone bridges and country lanes.  I sure as hell hope we are not preparing in that fashion.  I am not saying this to be combative or to undermine any steps the Minister of State must take, but we have one stated and clear position from the Government on the return of any border and something that is a little bit more opaque and different in the statement he made this afternoon.  He might take the opportunity to reassure me in that regard.</p><p>I have mentioned to the Minister of State before the approach from his Department to recruitment north of that invisible border.  I attend a number of major events, including festivals and maritime events, at which significant organisations seek to recruit members.  These include university freshers' fairs at which I have not seen a presence on the part of the Defence Forces despite the considerable interest in the service in the community in the North.  Many young men and women approach me on foot of my role in the Seanad to see if there are avenues along which they might proceed and to secure letters of support.  I appreciate that this comes at the Minister of State from leftfield a little bit.  As such, I will follow up with him in writing on that.</p></speech>

I share the pride of many in that service as well as the concern others have spoken of in great detail about the conditions under which Defence Forces' personnel must work.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is imperative that those who serve the country in this way are properly remunerated and supported and that there is an opportunity to let their collective voice be expressed.  I know there are prohibitions on what they can do in that regard but it is important that they be heard.  The working time directive will provide another chance to ensure we move towards serving in this way being a genuine and a liveable option.  Some parts of the expenditure the Minister of State outlined will address pay and pension issues.  Nobody would argue with that except to say we need more resources in those areas. </p><p>The Minister of State also mentioned capital expenditure.  It would be good to have a sense of what that involves.  Are there plans for a multi-role vehicle, which is a big ticket item.  I know it was discussed.  It is a real concern because it is not normally compatible with our previous peacekeeping work.  Perhaps the Minister of State could indicate whether that is on the agenda.</p></speech>

That points to the general need for assurance because we have seen the Minister of State's party calling for 2% of the budget to be spent on defence at European level.  That is also present as a goal in the Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, moving to a very high level of defence expenditure.  That is a real concern for many.  There have been indications of European social and structural funds being routed into military expenditure.  Perhaps the Minister of State could address that.  Can he assure us that Ireland's aid and overseas development funding is not being used in any way for military activity or infrastructure?  That is important because people take great pride in our aid and development funding.  </p><p>While on one level reviews are a positive thing, when I look at the regular White Paper reviews I am concerned that they will be used to increase military spending every time one rolls around.  Can the Minister of State assure us that Ireland's neutrality will be firmly represented in these reviews and the rolling set of White Papers?  I absolutely disagree with others who have spoken.  Ireland is a neutral nation.  Its neutrality is well documented and has been spoken about at the highest level, including at the UN Security Council.  Ireland has both sought and gained recognition, opportunities, derogations based on its neutral status and there are infinite statements over many years about our status.  I believe there have been compromises in certain ways by the use of Shannon Airport and by signing up to PESCO but neutrality is something deeply important to the Irish people.  We know that surveys show that 80% of the Irish public support it.  Given the apparent confusion on the part of some Members of the House I would like the Minister of State to assure us that all his Department's documents will reflect that neutrality.  We can expect it to be very visible, not only in the reservations attached to the status of forces agreements, SOFA, which the Minister of State mentioned.  He might elaborate on those reservations and how they mention neutrality but also on the White Papers on a rolling basis.  Neutrality needs to be cemented.  Can the Minister of State assure us that the Government will be strongly asserting our position as a neutral nation over the course of the next year?  We know that if the United Kingdom were to withdraw there are many in Europe who would like to see a European army.  Many senior Commissioners have openly stated this.  Will Ireland make it very clear to our European friends and allies, who we value so much, that we believe our contribution to Europe is made as a neutral nation?  Ireland was able, for example, to send Eamon Gilmore, as someone from a neutral nation, to Colombia to help secure peace there.  This is the service Ireland's neutrality has done for Europe and the world.</p><p>Another border of concern is the one manned by the European Border and Coastguard Agency, Frontex.  Jean-Claude Juncker has said that he plans to have 10,000 additional border guards on the borders of Europe.  Will Irish military and security personnel be involved in that?  Will Ireland be funding that?  What is the Minister of State's perspective on that?  The militarisation of Europe's borders has deeply undermined our collective human rights reputation.</p><p>In 2017 we debated Operation Sophia.  The Minister of State said then that transferring to Operation Sophia will result in the redeployment of Irish Naval Service vessels from primarily humanitarian search and rescue to primarily security and interception.  Many people spoke about the pride we all felt when we saw Irish ships saving lives.  I pointed out at the time that vote meant we were moving away from saving lives.  Sadly, that has proved true.  There is no longer meaningful search and rescue happening in the Mediterranean.  Instead, we are supporting the Libyan coastguard and outrageous situations in Libya as highlighted by M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, Amnesty International and Irish journalists who have travelled there.  More than 721 deaths at sea were registered in June and July 2018.  Those lives might have been saved previously by Irish ships and humanitarian work.  This is a really serious concern.  How does the Minister of State view the future of Operation Sophia?  How does he stand over Ireland's failure in this humanitarian work?  How can we justify funding inhumane conditions?</p><p>Have any operations taken place outside the UN Security Council resolutions in respect of Operation Sophia?  There has been a pull away from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty.  Can the Minister of State comment on Ireland's role in disarmament and how he plans to address the recent concerns of countries pulling away from our international disarmament infrastructure?  Could he also comment on India and Pakistan in that regard? </p></speech>

For years we have been signing up to various international arrangements, many quite positive for the Irish Defence Forces in respect of experience and our general commitment to securing peace around the world.  Notwithstanding that, however, and despite the reassurances given by successive Ministers for Defence, there is no doubt that our neutrality is being compromised, piece by piece.  Some might say a new reality faces us globally and our Defence Forces and policy may need to adapt.  I think most of us in this House can agree that our neutrality is something that should be defended and respected.  We are famed for our neutrality.</p> <p>In my own work, even as a Minister of State in an entirely different context, when I was abroad, other governments often mentioned that it was respected, valued and cherished and Ireland's bona fides was always accepted because of our neutrality and the way we manage our defence situation and our history of neutrality.  We should continue to value it and never undermine it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We all talk about how we value the Defence Forces personnel, their families and the commitment they make to our country.  However, I agree with Senator McFadden that all too often we just pay lipservice.  The value we say we place in the Defence Forces is not always reflected in the way we remunerate their work, their commitment to our country and the sacrifices they make.  This is no ordinary job.  We know that.  It is galling and plain wrong to see about 80% of Defence Forces personnel earning less than the average public sector wage.  It is extraordinary and a really sad commentary on the situation.  Too many rely on the working family payment to supplement meagre incomes.  Defence Forces personnel make enough sacrifices without having to rely on the working family payment.  No full-time working individual should have to rely on it to make ends meet.  There is no dignity in that.  We really need to focus on the work of the Public Sector Pay Commission and the work that is being done by RACO and PDFORRA.  I compliment the campaigning work of the families and partners of Defence Forces personnel to draw attention to the pay injustices that are inherent in the system.</p><p>This problem did not just emerge today or yesterday.  It has been ongoing, as we all know.  Successive Governments have to take responsibility for it.  Nobody here is entirely blameless.  Everybody has responsibility in this regard.  I have been reading media reports from last week on the EU training mission, EUTM, camp in Mali, an operation in which 20 Irish personnel are involved.  The camp came under attack from suspected al-Qaeda operatives.  There could have been a lot of fatalities, including of Irish personnel but, thankfully, there were not.  It illustrates the sacrifices that are made by Defence Forces personnel abroad to protect our values, to protect democracy and spread peace and security.</p><p>Far too many active and retired Defence Forces personnel struggle day in, day out.  Often, retired members are coming from an institutionalised background, where they are used to strict military discipline, and find it difficult to adapt to life on civvy street, as it might be described.  There are very high levels of relationship breakdown, addiction issues and psychiatric problems among members of the Defence Forces and former serving members.  I pay tribute to the work of the Organisation of National Ex-service Personnel, ONE, in supporting our veterans.  I am sure the Minister of State will join me in that.  We often forget about our veterans, who have made very serious sacrifices to represent and defend the interests of our democracy.  ONE spearheaded a very important and effective campaign to raise public awareness of the issue of homelessness for our former Defence Forces members.  Despite its good work in providing very significant levels of accommodation in Dublin and elsewhere, far too many former members of the Defence Forces find themselves homeless and in difficulty.  During ONE's campaign, former Defence Forces personnel raised awareness of homelessness by wrapping themselves in a tricolour sleeping bag.  That was a very effective way of illustrating the problem and it goes to show why we need to resource ONE to work with the difficult cases it encounters every day and the difficult situations in which veterans find themselves.  They deserve our respect and genuine support, financial and otherwise, not just our lipservice or tokenistic support. </p><p>I was surprised to learn that there is no full-time psychiatrist employed by the Defence Forces.  Perhaps the Minister of State would elaborate on this.  I understand that moves may be afoot to try to retain the services of a locum psychiatrist.  We have a Defence Forces complement of almost 10,000.  Given some of the experiences they face on the front line, the job they do and the difficult scenarios they face in defending our country and representing Ireland on UN missions, our veterans often experience post-traumatic stress disorder.  It is really important we focus on the need to engage the services of experienced psychiatric personnel to work with serving members of the Defence Forces to work through any issues they may have.  If those issues are not dealt with in the workplace and people are not supported in those scenarios, we store up problems for the future.</p></speech>

I know a number of people who have served overseas in all divisions of the Defence Forces.  I am familiar with the work they do.  We have all mentioned recruitment and the Minister of State referred to it on a number of occasions.  I do not think recruitment is the issue.  Many people are willing to join the Air Corps, Naval Service or Army.  The real problem is retention.  The Minister of State made reference to the Public Service Pay Commission.  It needs to report very quickly because part of the problem associated with retention is pensions, particularly for those who have recently joined the military.  There is a fixed time at which they have to go.  They have to retire by the age of 58 or 60, a restriction not applied to anyone else.  However, they do not receive their State pension until the age of 66 at present, and that age will be 68 or 69 by the time many of these people are retiring.  There used to be a supplementary pension that would cover the time between being forced to retire by the State and receiving the State pension.  I ask the Minister of State to speak to the pay commission so that this can be resolved. It is an issue that is upsetting the military at the moment and making it difficult for the Defence Forces to retain personnel, particularly in the 30 to 40 age group, because those people are looking towards where they will be in 20 or 25 years.  That is when I started my own private pension.  They will have to consider whether to do that then.  Can the Minister of State give them some reassurance that there will be something for them when they are forced out of the military and until they receive the full State pension?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#WW00800"><p>The Minister of State made a very comprehensive speech, which will be analysed by the representative bodies, such as PDFORRA and RACO.  A good case can be made for the reinstatement of a full Cabinet position.  I know the Minister of State attends Cabinet but there is a case to be made for a reorganisation of the Ministry to give defence a real, full say at Cabinet level.  That is no disrespect to the Minister of State.  He is doing his utmost to persuade Government to support the Army in every way possible.  I have a vested interest because my nominating bodies are PDFORRA and RACO.  The general secretary of PDFORRA is Gerard Guinan and the general secretary of RACO is Commandant Conor King, the deputy general secretary is Lieutenant Colonel Derek Priestly and the former general secretary is Lieutenant Colonel Earn&aacute;n Naughton.  All of them provide a great service.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They do an excellent job in representing the rank and file and the officers of the Army, which is vital.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, has a close relationship with the organisations and is accessible to them.  I have never heard otherwise, and that is very important.  His speech will be analysed by the representative bodies and if there are any queries in that regard, I am sure they will refer back to Members of the Seanad and to the nominees who received the endorsement of both organisations and were elected on the Labour Panel.  They would feel we owe them a debt of gratitude for their support and that it is our turn to support them in any way possible.</p><p>In that regard, an issue has arisen in the last few days.  The Minister of State is probably aware of the emails that have been sent to Members of the Oireachtas regarding the Jadotville situation.  I understood there was a recognition of Jadotville and the question of a medal when the Minister of State was in Athlone.  The representations have been particularly strong on this.  I have received hundreds of emails.  An email from Malahide community school states that the school has close links with some of the Jadotville personnel, including Commandant Patrick Quinlan, the officer who commanded A Company and who was deserving of the military medal for gallantry, Captain Liam Donnelly, who was recommended for the distinguished service medal, and Corporal John McManus, who was recommended for the distinguished service medal.  The email continues that in recent years the school has become aware of the battle of Jadotville and the issues regarding recognition of the extraordinary achievements of the men of A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion, in the Congo in 1961.</p><p>I cannot understand why they have not been given the recognition they deserve.  They were courageous but they were written out of history.  I hope the Minister of State will give a response to this.  The function the Minister of State held in Custume Barracks in Athlone was an important and significant event for the survivors of Jadotville.  What other action can he take to recognise their work?  They saved their men on that occasion.  Otherwise, it would have been a blood sacrifice and that would not have been justified in the circumstances.  For some reason there is a feeling, since the time of Conor Cruise O'Brien and others, that their work and sacrifices have not been recognised.  They were outnumbered and outmanoeuvred.</p><p>I am sorry I do not have more time to speak.  Senator Ned O'Sullivan has outlined our position, but I was anxious to put that point to the Minister of State.  Our spokesperson in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Jack Chambers, is responding positively to the representations that have been made and he has raised the matter with the Minister of State in the D&aacute;il.  We will continue to lobby in this regard.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for the work he is doing.  All of us are immensely proud of the Defence Forces.  As Senator Nash said, it is not an ordinary job.  What the Government has done in respect of the opening of recruitment and the allocation of extra capital expenditure for the Defence Forces is welcome.  I commend all who serve in the Defence Forces, be it in the Army, the Naval Service, the Reserve Defence Force or the Civil Defence.</p> <p>There is a responsibility on us in a recovering economy to ensure that the focus is on pay restoration.  The Minister of State referred to that in his statement and he is doing that in his work.  It is important.  The reason I speak in this debate is not only to express my commendation of the Defence Forces but also to point out that I have met service members, their families and ex-service members who have expressed their concerns about the pay and conditions.  It would be remiss not to acknowledge that issue.  That said, however, we have the Public Service Pay Commission and the Minister of State has established a different forum to examine pay and conditions.  Equally, the White Paper on Defence is very much about ensuring that resourcing is high for that.</p> <p>There is another matter regarding the Defence Forces that should be mentioned and acknowledged.  I commend Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, Chief of Staff, and Sergeant Richard Muldarry on the way in which they walked in Dublin Pride Parade.  It raised the profile of the Defence Forces and showed them to be diverse and inclusive.</p> <p>My comments are about advocating and imploring for an improvement in the pay and conditions and ensuring that in a recovering economy we allocate resources not only for expenditure on pay but also for capital expenditure in terms of buildings and equipment.  I commend our men and women who serve abroad.  I am aware that the Minister of State signed off today on an extension of the mission in Mali.  We can take justifiable pride in our Defence Forces, but I was anxious to make my few other remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#XX00800"><p>I will do my best to respond to all the issues raised.  It is unfortunate that some of the Senators who made a contribution could not take the time to hear my reply after they had made some accusations, which I have no problem defending.  However, that is the way it is.</p> <p>One of the issues raised is the pay and conditions of the Defence Forces.  I have noted on several occasions that pay and conditions have been a challenge.  I have acknowledged that in the D&aacute;il and Seanad in the past and on a number of occasions at public events.  It is only right and proper to highlight the pay of members of the Defence Forces.  I will outline the average gross earnings in 2018 and go through the ranks starting with enlisted personnel.  The gross average earnings in 2018 were as follows: &euro;37,529 for a three star private; &euro;41,076 for a corporal; &euro;44,622 for a sergeant; &euro;49,605 for a company quartermaster sergeant, CQMS; &euro;50,224 for a company sergeant; &euro;53,616 for a battalion quartermaster sergeant, BQMS; and &euro;54,878 for a sergeant major.  For the officer class they were: &euro;37,108 for a second lieutenant; &euro;42,291 for a lieutenant; &euro;53,138 for a captain; &euro;66,496 for a commandant; &euro;79,162 for a lieutenant colonel; and &euro;88,480 for a colonel.  A three star private, if he or she passes out and concludes three star training, will come out with a gross annual salary of &euro;27,913.  Three weeks ago there was a new cadet class.  A school leaver, a second lieutenant, will come out with &euro;35,614 and a person with a third level qualification, a lieutenant, will come out with &euro;40,566.  They are not the lowest paid public servants, but I recognise that there are challenges.</p> <p>I have stressed another issue here but Members are not willing to listen to me.  There are fewer than 90 people on the family income supplement, which is now the working family payment.  That is less than 1% of the total organisation.  That includes members of the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence.  People understand that the working family payment is in place for a reason.  It depends on a person's circumstances.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about retention.  Page 78 of the White Paper refers to retention.  It states that the recruitment, training, development and retention of suitable military personnel are essential factors in developing the military capabilities required to discharge the roles assigned by the Government.  I assure the Senator that retention is mentioned in the White Paper.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paul Kehoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Craughwell spoke about pilots and I presume that he was referring to RACO.  Let me state that RACO was consulted on the matter.  The views of the association were noted and taken into consideration when preparing the terms and conditions.  The fact that the representative association does not agree with all of the terms and conditions does not equate with a lack of consultation.  The terms and conditions were drafted by civil and military management, and consideration of the impact of serving members was part of that process and a balanced proposal was finalised.  RACO has been consulted in the past on the terms and conditions for individual applications.  RACO was also consulted on the proposals for the standardisation of the arrangements.  I am also informed that departmental officials discussed the draft terms and conditions with RACO and the matters raised were considered in the development of the document.<br/><br/>RACO has informed me of its concerns as recently as last week.  However, I do not accept that the terms and conditions represent a fundamental change for serving members or their promotional opportunities.  Recommissioned officers will be offered a short service commission for a period of three years and in that period they cannot compete for promotion.  Let me state that the association knows that and was informed of that situation.  In that period the officers will not be allowed to compete for promotion nor will they block promotional opportunities for any other officer or pilot within the Air Corps.  It is totally disingenuous to say that this blocks the promotion of other members.<br/><br/><b>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</b>What if they extend it beyond that?</p></speech>

The arrangements provide an appropriate balance between the recognition of those who currently serve in the Air Corps and operational requirements while, at the same time, being fair to those who want to return to service.   I have the full support of the military management from the General Officer Commanding, GOC, of the Air Corps and right up to the Chief of Staff on this re-entry policy.  It was due to their idea that we came up with this and it is a fantastic idea.  We are 33 pilots short at the moment so if there are pilots who are former members of the Air Corps and are willing to come back then I welcome them back into the organisation.</p> <p>Border security is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As Senators will know, the security of the island of Ireland is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is as an aid to the civil power that we respond to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>We are carrying out all of our work with the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency.  Recently an accusation was put to me that the agency was unhappy with our patrol days.  In 2018, almost 100% of the requests that the agency made to us were granted.  Of course, there are times when we are unable to comply for various reasons.</p> <p>Senator McFadden spoke about the pay commission.  This is a fully independent pay commission and I am allowing it to do its work.  There was a full joint submission made to the pay commission by civil and military management.  I understand that the pay commission is interviewing members of the Defence Forces at the moment.  It will continue to do that job of work over the coming period.  As I stated in my opening address, there will be an opportunity for civil and military management to address the pay commission, which I asked for.  Management will be given the opportunity and I gave that data in my opening few words.</p> <p>It is very disingenuous to say that loads of people are in receipt of family income supplement.  That is not the case, which I stated in this House the other day and I repeat it here again.  I have stated that I will work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the pay commission to make sure that we finalise this matter as quickly as possible.  Whatever job of work that they require and need, I would rather that we gave them the space and opportunity to do that work.</p> <p>I have addressed the issue mentioned by the Sinn F&eacute;in Senator with my comments.  Specifically, Senator Higgins spoke about a multi-role vessel.  That is in White Paper and in the programme for Government.  Work is continuing and we will continue to work on the matter. </p></speech>

It is one issue that I continue to highlight and outline at every given opportunity, specifically at all of the European Council meetings that I attend where I always outline Ireland's policy on neutrality.  People might not call it neutrality; Senator Craughwell referred to "non-aligned".  It is very important that each and every country has different positions and policies.  I have highlighted and will continue to highlight our policy on neutrality.</p> <p>On the White Paper update, that will not alter the fundamentals of existing defence policy, including our policy on neutrality.</p> <p>Operation Sophia has played a decisive role in improving the overall maritime security in the central Mediterranean.  I believe every member of the House here would agree with that.  EU member states have agreed to extend the mandate of Operation Sophia for a further three months and to carry out a review.  Discussions are taking place right now, at EU level, on the review of the mandate.  Once that is concluded we will consider Ireland's participation in Operation Sophia into 2019.  The matter will be considered in due course. </p></speech>

There has been a lot of political and media attention recently regarding the vacancy for an inhouse psychiatrist in the Defence Forces.  It must be stressed that there is no delay in referring Defence Forces personnel requiring immediate psychiatric care or assessment.  Such cases are referred to the HSE's accident and emergency departments where, if hospitalisation is required, it is provided immediately.  For outpatient cases the waiting time for a HSE appointment is approximately three  months.  In order to provide Defence Forces primary carers with the broadest range of options possible in dealing with the spectrum of cases that present to them, they have also been authorised to refer cases to local external private psychiatrists for outpatient treatment where this is deemed appropriate.</p> <p>We did seek a psychiatrist but, unfortunately, we were unable to get one because there is a huge demand for psychiatrists.  Nobody applied so we had to look at the remuneration and we sent a proposal to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I know that the process has almost concluded and I hope we will have a psychiatrist in place in the very near future.  I assure Senators that members of the Defence Forces receive the attention that they require.</p> <p>Senator Lawlor mentioned the supplementary pension.  That is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I suggest he raises the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  The issue has nothing to do with the Public Service Pay Commission.</p> <p>The Jadotville medals is another issue that was raised.  On 13 June 2017,  the Government committed, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as An Bonn Jadotville, or the Jadotville Medal, to each member of A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion, and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the siege of Jadotville.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paul Kehoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This specially commissioned medal was procured to give full and due recognition in honour of the courageous actions of these personnel during the siege.

Senator Nash referred to the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE, campaign.  I increased ONE's funding by 108% in the recent budget.  It does fantastic work.

I also welcome the publication today of the first set of data on gambling in Ireland.  I look forward to examining the scale of the field work, the sample size and the findings.</p><p>As an initial response, I believe that the focus on lottery tickets and scratch cards obscures the millions of euro being spent on other forms of gambling, particularly in unregulated online environments.  I also welcome the news that the Government will publish the final report of the interdepartmental working group on gambling shortly.  As I have the opportunity to address the Minister of State directly now, I ask him to define what &quot;shortly&quot; means, if we can expect to have the report before the Easter break and if we can have a specific date, please.</p><p>I will be forgiven for showing a certain level of impatience with the rate of progress on this issue, which the Minister of State will agree has been protracted.  The first time I spoke in the House about gambling was on the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015, to which I introduced a number of amendments calling for warnings similar to those on cigarette packets to be displayed on online and static betting operations.  It was an eye-opener for me that day to get such strong support from all sides of the House.  In the end, though, the Whip was enforced and the Act was passed without my amendments.</p><p>In the course of preparing those amendments, I came into contact with families and individuals whose lives were plagued by the often silent and sometimes invisible scourge of problem gambling.  The following year, I held a well attended briefing on the need for a gambling control Bill to regulate the sector, a Bill for which there was widespread support.</p><p>To say that the pace of change has been slow is an understatement.  In fact, 2,000 days have passed since the Act was first drafted.  For every one of those 2,000 days, someone's life has been adversely affected by problem gambling.  It has been a staggering 1,000 days and six parliamentary terms since this Government committed to introducing a gambling control Bill, yet nothing has moved.</p><p>The current legislation is antiquated.  It is difficult to believe that Ireland's gambling and gaming legislation predates the electrification of the country.  Gaming in Ireland is governed by the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and betting is primarily regulated by the Betting Act 1931.  Given the vast advances of the past 20 years in how people gamble, these regulations were described by a 2007 report by the casino committee as a &quot;relic of social history ... utterly unsuited to effectively regulate gaming in a modern, wealthy European state&quot;.  This antiquated legislation has had adverse effects on the lives of problem gamblers and their families.  By neglecting to put in place an appropriate regulatory framework, successive Governments - this has not happened on the Minister of State's watch alone - have actively contributed to the scale of problem gambling.  It has been irresponsible and, with advances in technology and with online sport betting companies ramping up their advertising to unprecedented levels, the rise in problem gambling will be exponential.</p><p>I note with interest from the data set released today the correlation between problem gambling among young males and unregulated access to online and telephone gambling.  This is a sinister and worrying statistic.  I welcome the statistics issued today.  We are not short of evidence from other sources either.  According to conservative estimates, there are at least 45,000 people living in Ireland with a &quot;severe pathological gambling addiction&quot;.  Based on international evidence, there are a further 110,000 Irish citizens who suffer from a milder form of problem gambling.  What people might not know is that Ireland also has the highest online gambling losses <i>per capita</i>globally and the third highest overall gambling losses <i>per capita</i>.  Somebody is making a lot of money from Irish citizens in an unregulated and highly lucrative environment.  Even the average punter for whom gambling is not a problem is at a disadvantage compared to his or her European and global counterparts.</p><p>This is fast becoming a case of Nero fiddling while Rome burns, given that the legislative response to this crisis has been one of delays and piecemeal legislation.  I commend my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues on introducing the Gambling Control Bill 2018 and regret that its progression through the Oireachtas has been blocked by the Government, given that it requires a money message.  I note that the Minister for Justice and Equality will introduce a gaming and lotteries (amendment) Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

I am unclear as to why updating stakes and prizes, the amounts which can be waged and won in gaming, is a priority for the Department when the gambling control Bill would bring in the necessary reforms.  To me this constitutes a waste of precious departmental time and taxpayers' money.  It does not give me confidence that the gambling control Bill will be progressed as a matter of urgency.  I made reference earlier to the interdepartmental working group report.  Will the Minister of State ensure, as per international best practice, that there is sufficient time for public and stakeholder consultation in the drafting of the revised general scheme of the gambling control Bill?  Can he confirm that the gambling control Bill will allow for the establishment of an independent regulator for the gambling industry?  I accept the Minister of State's bona fides in attempting to tackle unregulated gambling.  However I still have a grave concern that in trying to produce the perfect legislation we have already run the risk of letting perfection become the enemy of good regulation.  I said at the outset that I truly believe the Minister of State has a deep concern about gambling and the regulation thereof.  I trust we will hear something this evening that will substantiate that belief, or at least help me to believe it. </p></speech>

I have been extensively briefed by a former Minister and Deputy, Mr. Dick Roche, who has taken a particular interest in this issue.  I would like to concentrate particularly on gaming and the operators of casinos and slot machines.  I refer to the situation in Dublin.  On O'Connell Street there is an absolutely enormous casino.  Around the corner there is another enormous casino on Parnell Street.  It is really pretty ghastly.  In the old days there were bookies and that was it.  Now there are these enormous gambling establishments, some of which actually give money back to compulsive gamblers to encourage them to continue.  It is shocking.  There is an absolute absence of morality.</p> <p>With regard to gaming machines and so on, the key legislation governing gaming operations in Ireland, the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, is being flagrantly broken in every single part of the country.  Operators are being allowed to openly break the law.  Tens of millions of euros in licence fees, moneys which could fund much-needed addiction services, are not being collected.  There is every reason to question whether proper value added tax, VAT, is being collected.  Questionable licensing decisions have been made in the District Courts.  Garda activity in applying the law has virtually come to a standstill and the Revenue Commissioners, which have been active of late, have questions to answer about why the excise services waited so long to become active. </p> <p>The Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 sets out the conditions in which it is legal to operate a gaming machine in a gaming establishment.  The licensing of amusement facilities, which are often run side by side with gaming, is set out in the Finance Act 1992.  While the 1956 Act is regarded by many as outdated, the fact remains that it is the law and the disturbing reality is that it is being flagrantly and openly broken.  Illegal gaming establishments are being allowed to operate with impunity while millions of euros in revenue are denied to the Exchequer.  There is also the major question of how VAT is treated. </p> <p>Industry sources suggest that there are between 30,000 and 40,000 gaming machines in operation across the country.  Every gaming machine requires an annual gaming machine licence.  In 2018, a total of 12,112 gaming machine licences were issued.  Some 4,326 annual licences, costing &euro;505 each, and remarkably 7,787 three-month licences, costing &euro;145 each, were issued.  In other words, there are far more gaming machines in operation than licences.  To get a gaming licence an operator must apply to the District Court for a certificate for a gaming licence.  The court may issue a certificate only where the relevant authority has adopted Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  This is an essential and crucial Part.  Only when Part III has been adopted can certificates be legally issued.  When a certificate is issued, the operator must apply to the revenue for the licence.  Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 is operational only in small areas of the country.  For example, Part III does not apply in Dublin city or county except for parts of Skerries and Balbriggan.  Any gaming machine operating where Part III has not been adopted is operating illegally.  How can thousands of gaming machines for which there cannot possibly be licences by virtue of their location remain in operation?  There are thousands of machines operating in Dublin, where it is not possible to get a gaming licence.  </p> <p>Major questions must also be asked about the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Why have there been few, if any, prosecutions in recent years?  What has An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na been doing?  Why is the level of Garda activity in the area declining?  In 2012, there were 96 cases of what the Garda describes as recorded crime incidents.  The Garda is very coy about providing any information about prosecutions.  The number of recorded crime incidents was 61 in 2010, 47 in 2013, 14 in 2014 and 13 in 2017.  There is a constant decline in the number of recorded incidents.</p> <p>As mentioned, the Revenue Commissioners issue the licences for gaming machines and premises.  The Revenue Commissioners have been active in recent times, seizing gaming machines in a number of high-profile raids.  There are still questions to answer, however.  Why has it taken so long to take action?  Many of the premises raided in Dublin have been openly operating since 1988 when Dublin Corporation, as it then was, banned gaming machines from the city.  That is about 30 years.  Why have only a small proportion of the gaming machines operating in each of the venues raided been seized?  Other than seizing machines, what further action will be taken?  Will prosecutions follow?  There is no evidence of that, despite repeated questions from Deputy Mick Wallace in the D&aacute;il.  Will back levies and taxes be collected?  What form of licence, if any, did Revenue issue for the machines that did not have gaming machine licences?  Is Revenue effectively giving cover to gaming operators by issuing amusement machine licences for what are actually gaming machines?  What licence fees did Revenue collect?  An annual gaming machine licence costs &euro;505 per machine.  An amusement machine licence costs &euro;125.  How was VAT charged on the machines for which operators did not have gaming machine licences? </p> <p>There is disturbing evidence that in at least one instance, a District Court issued a licence for a premises in County Dublin where Part III of the 1956 Act is not operational.  It is quite clear that the court should have turned down the certificate application.  It seems the court was in defiance of the law.</p></speech>

When a certificate is issued by the court, an operator applies to the Revenue Commissioners for the necessary gaming licence.  A licence must be issued for every gaming machine and the operator must have a separate licence for the premises, again issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners' compliance manual, like District Court form 66.2, makes it clear that a gaming licence can only issue where Part III of the 1956 Act is in operation.  If Part III of the Act is not in operation, as in Dublin city, a certificate should not issue and no licence should be issued.  The Revenue Commissioners issue amusement machine licences under separate legislation.</p> <p>Operating a gaming machine without the necessary licences is illegal.  In spite of this, premises dotted around Dublin city centre openly operate hundreds of gaming machines and have been allowed to so operate with impunity for years.  Many of these gaming premises openly advertise their operations.  Across the country as a whole, tens of thousands of gaming machines are being operated illegally in cities and towns where Part III of the Act has not been adopted.  The hundreds if not thousands of gaming machines operating in Dublin city and county are operated illegally as, with the exception of premises in Balbriggan and Skerries, no gaming licence can be issued in the capital.  If there are between 18,000 and 28,000 machines in operation without the legally required gaming licence, as industry sources suggest, not only is the law being openly broken on a grand scale, but the State is being short-changed on annual licensing receipts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Allowing gaming schemes, many of which are being operated illegally in areas where Part III is not operable, to be licensed as amusement machines, in addition to allowing operators to dodge fees being applied to gaming machines, leaves the Revenue Commissioners open to some very uncomfortable questions about their attitude to upholding the law.</p><p>There is also the question of the lack of enforcement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Why is it so coy about this?  Why has it taken so long to take action?  Why, in the operations that have taken place, were only a small proportion of the gaming machines in operation seized?  Other than seizing machines, what further action will be taken?  I have a series of questions for the Minister of State.  In particular, it is clear that the operation of the 1956 Act is being openly flouted.  There are thousands of illegally operated gaming machines in existence.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Craughwell and all the Independent Senators on bringing forward this motion.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  As has been said, he has a deep interest in this issue and wants to find solutions.</p> <p>Gambling, in all its various guises, has increased and multiplied and is now literally in people's faces on a 24-hour cycle.  It is far removed from going down to the local betting office, having a bet on a chosen horse and calling back later to see the results of the races on the window of the bookie's office.  That is almost like a time warp.  It is now at the stage where it is all about online and digital betting and livelihoods can be whittled away in secret unknown to friends and family members.  Gambling is an addiction.  It is unlike other forms of addiction in the sense that there are no visible signs until it is too late in many cases.  We are all aware of the curse of alcohol and drugs but at least there are visible signs where people can be alerted to the difficulties people are in, but it is too late sometimes in the case of gambling.  Careers, relationships and companies have been destroyed in the process.  It is expanding at a rate of noughts in all directions.  </p> <p>We hear of match-fixing in sports.  There have been investigations into soccer clubs in Ireland.  High profile sportspeople and high performance elite athletes, particularly in the GAA, have recently told their stories of how they developed the addiction, their stealing of thousands of euros from their employers and their parents having to remortgage their family homes to bail them out.  I commend the people who have come clean in their attempt to get their lives back in order, </p></speech>

They are  horror stories about how a person's life can spin totally out of control.  Such case studies may make a perfect case for establishing a gambling regulatory authority.</p> <p>The advertising, sponsorship and promotion of gambling products need to be examined.  I was a Member of the other House when the lottery licence was to be sold to a new company.  One of the new companies wanted to make more opportunities available online for people to get involved.  Everybody is complicit in this.  There is a big hubbub about sponsorship and promotional advertising of alcohol, and rightly so.  That issue has been dealt with to a certain extent.  Looking across the water, many of the premiership soccer clubs were sponsored by betting companies in the past, and obviously we have no control over that here.  One famous GAA club in Ireland, Crossmaglen GAA club, was sponsored, and I am not sure if it still is, by a betting company.  Sporting organisations, the State and the Government need to take control of this.</p> <p>I note the Minister of State will bring the final report of the interdepartmental working group on gambling to Government in a few weeks.  I very much welcome that and urge him to implement the recommendations of that report without delay.</p></speech>

It is important we take account of the motion under discussion, which &quot;notes the establishment of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Gambling in January 2018; considers it appropriate that due regard be given to establishing a Gambling Regulatory Authority; acknowledges that problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest economic and personal costs; recognises recent research published by the UK Gambling Commission and others which provide a list of the social costs of gambling, including loss of employment, experience of bankruptcy and/or debt, loss of housing/homelessness, crime associated with gambling, relationship breakdown/problems and health-related problems.&quot;  The thrust of the motion is its call &quot;on the Government to publish the final Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Gambling and accelerate plans to introduce a Gambling Regulatory Authority.&quot;  I and my party will support the motion.</p><p>It is important to articulate that in February 2018 Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the Gambling Control Bill 2018.  This legislation has the dual objective of effectively regulating the expanding gambling sector that has emerged in recent years, while also protecting vulnerable adults and young people.  The legislation updates the heads of Bill published in 2013 by the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, which was never moved by that Government.  After half a decade of delay, it gives me no pleasure to say this, and I am not attributing responsibility to the Minister of State personally, but Fine Gael does not have credibility on this serious problem that is silently destroying lives.</p><p>We need effective regulation of this industry to give those who work in the sector certainty through socially responsible gambling.  We are committed to working with the industry to build this new framework but the time for delays has long since passed.  Legislative action is now needed.  It is our understanding that the Minister of State has indicated that the group&rsquo;s report is currently being finalised.  We call on him to ensure that the publication of this report is expedited and that primary legislation is introduced as soon as possible.</p><p>The Bill establishes an office of gambling control as a licensed provider and regulator of the gambling industry across all its facets such as online, casinos and bookmakers.  The office will be funded by the industry and is based on a comparable UK model.  It would be the unified national regulator.  This new agency will be self-financed through the industry based on levies and fees for licences.  The Bill will include powers to prohibit or restrict certain games or equipment if they are harmful, including devices and games that are not yet in use.</p><p>It is a pity that there is not a single Government Senator in the Chamber, other than the Acting Chairman, who, like all of us, is independent when she is in the Chair.</p><p>These flexible powers given to the new agency are key to the Bill.  They enable the State to move quickly along with technological developments and advancements and ensure that regulation is not left lagging behind by rigid fixed rules.  The Bill also aims to curb money laundering and criminality that may use the gambling sector with robust checks and powers with respect to the Garda and international bodies.</p><p>Ireland has the third highest <i>per capita</i>rate of gambling losses in the world.  We lose approximately &euro;470 per adult on different forms of gambling each year.  It is a fair assumption that many people do not gamble but many others are losing an awful lot of money.  The latest figures show that gambling losses in Ireland totalled &euro;2.1 billion in 2016, with more than &euro;5 billion gambled, which amounts to &euro;14 million per day.</p><p>According to a UCD study, more than 40,000 people in Ireland are known to have a gambling addiction, with single men under 35 most at risk.  There have been at least 800 cases in Ireland where people sought help for gambling addictions in 2015.  As the Chair outlined, a series of high-profile cases have heightened the scale and depth of gambling problems and the pressing need for regulation among sporting people.  The book, <i>Tony 10</i>, which tells the story of a post office manager who gambled more than &euro;10 million, highlights a lack of regulation of the sector.</p><p>The Minister of State is aware of many of these matters but it is important that we put on the record the harm that gambling can cause, although not to everybody.  Many people bet on the Grand National and buy lottery tickets.  We all accept that but in a modern age we need to move on from the Gaming and Lotteries Act of 1956 and various other laws which were probably valid and useful in their day.  Technology has moved matters on.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The growing sophistication of online artificial intelligence measures used to attract and entice gamblers means it is more important than ever to regulate this growing sector.  Using similar methods to the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, the industry can micro-target advertisements at those they know to be gamblers.</p><p>This Bill draws on long delayed legislation from 2013 which the Government has failed to move on.  I accept that the Government is busy, particularly with Brexit, but this has been in the ether since 2010.  We are committed to pressing forward with a legal framework to protect vulnerable people and restrict the sector.  We will work with the Government and others to strengthen the Bill but after five years of no action, we will not accept any further delays.  The Bill sets out the twin aims of regulation through a new gambling authority and protection through a social fund, age restrictions and staff training.  It will be financed through a levy on the industry.</p><p>Gambling remains an extremely weakly regulated sector in Ireland despite the explosion of online gambling in recent years.  We need a clear framework for socially responsible gambling.  The Bill establishes an office of gambling control as the licence provider and regulator of the gambling industry across all its facets such as online, casinos and bookmakers.  The office will be funded by the industry.  </p><p>I wish to echo everything that Senator Norris said on gaming machines.  It might be said that this is an issue for Revenue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Director of Public Prosecutions but the Minister of State, as a representative of the Government, must use his influence with his colleagues in the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Justice and Equality to find out why we have so many unlicensed machines and so many others with the cheaper amusement type licences rather than the more expensive gaming machine licences.  It is estimated that this is costing the State more than &euro;8 million in lost revenue every year.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the motion before the House but would point out that we have already published a Gambling Control Bill and would be more than happy to work with Senators from all sides of the House to progress it.  Gambling is not a problem for everybody but it is a problem.  As recently as yesterday we spoke about a person who is missing and who apparently lost a lot of money in a poker game the night before he disappeared.  I hope that the individual in question is discovered safe and well but gambling is an enormous problem for some people.  It is very invidious and is a silent addiction in some ways.  When people drink too much or take too many drugs, that becomes apparent but gambling has cost people their jobs, their houses and caused untold horror and terror for their families.  As legislators, we need to move on this issue and to do so quickly.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister of State for being here this evening and for the work he has already done on this issue.  I commend the Sinn F&eacute;in MEP, Ms Lynn Boylan, for all the work she has done to address problem gambling.</p> <p>There is an urgent need for tighter regulation of gambling.  Despite what some in the industry might argue, we are in the grip of a problem gambling crisis.  Problem gambling is a condition where the affected individual has a continuous urge to gamble despite harmful negative consequences or, indeed, a desire to stop.  In Ireland one can usually tell if there is a problem with an industry and its products when that same industry begins to fund support services.  We have already seen the alcohol industry do this with DrinkAware.  </p> <p>In 2017, industry experts H2 Gambling Capital produced a report into global gambling losses across the world.  It found that Ireland has the highest online gambling losses in the world and the third highest gambling losses overall, per head of population.  To put that into real numbers, Irish people gamble and lose around &euro;2.2 billion a year, or &euro;470 per adult.  Given the large numbers of people who never lay a bet, the data suggest that there are a lot of problem gamblers losing a considerable amount of money per year.  In reality, we do not have exact figures for the number of problem gamblers in this State because the Government refuses to conduct a survey that would allow us get the full picture.  This type of survey was carried out in 2017 in the North of Ireland and showed the rate of problem gambling there to be 2.3%, which is nearly five times higher than in England.  If we were to use that figure for the South, it would indicate that we have close to 100,000 problem gamblers.  The fact that we do not have a dedicated survey for the island of Ireland hinders our efforts to direct the necessary resources and support to those who need them.</p> <p>The Gambling Control Bill, which is supposed to address issues in the gambling industry, has been gathering dust since 2013, despite the scale of the problem increasing.  I am not calling for gambling to be banned but it is long past time for proper regulation of the industry by the State.  People should be able to watch sporting events and children should be able to go online without being bombarded or targeted by gambling advertisements.  We need proper protections for problem gamblers who want to stop gambling.  We need responsibility from the gambling industry and above all, we need proper regulation.</p> <p>Despite the great work of highlighting the issue of problem gambling by many journalists, advocates and charities and by a small number of politicians, there has been a complete lack of engagement from the Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see a gambling regulator in place to administer a problem gambling fund, the purpose of which would be to help minimise problem gambling and its effects.  The functions of a gambling regulator would include commissioning studies on the prevalence of gambling and problem gambling in particular, developing models of best practice in the prevention and treatment of problem gambling having regard to international experience and the views of relevant medical bodies and support groups.  The regulator would also be responsible for public education and awareness raising programmes, the production of associated materials and resources for use by services, the distribution of funding to addiction service</p> <p>I used to work for William Hill in marketing and public relations and for Mecca bookmakers many years ago.  The psychology behind targeting people and getting them to gamble is a science in itself and we really need to do something to address it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That ranges from the colours used.

I thank Senator Craughwell and the Independent Group for facilitating this discussion.  I thank the Minister of State who has the support of all of us in this House to do everything that is needed to put the proper regulation in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-27a.431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019022700002#DDD00200"><p>I strongly support this motion in the name of the Independent Group of Senators.  I want to acknowledge some basic truths.  When I was Minister for Justice and Equality the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 came under pressure because poker clubs started being established in Dublin.  Some were funded and owned by very rich and powerful people.  It was clear to me that they were illegal, as unlawful gaming was defined under the Act.  These commercial institutions masqueraded as members' clubs for a while but that was not a defence under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  I convened a meeting of garda&iacute; and a representative of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution to see what should happen in this matter and I was told that the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 was inadequate and needed to be strengthened.  I brought proposals to Government to amend and strengthen the Act and to knock out these casinos into which the poker clubs were rapidly developing because where poker came roulette tables and all the rest followed.  These were right in the city centre.  Very prominent and influential people were associated with them.  When I got to Cabinet, the Department's and my proposals ran into huge opposition, that effectively we were being illiberal and unrealistic, that amending the law to suppress these institutions was wrong.  Consequent on that, a study group was established under a barrister, Michael McGrath, to deal with the question of whether we could have one or two national casinos or whatever.  As far as I recall, it reported.  I do not know whether I was still in office when it reported but these institutions went unregulated and they went from poker to roulette, to gaming machines.  They were all over the city of Dublin like a rash.  What Senator Norris said about the fact of their being in clear breach of the Gaming and Lotteries Act went ignored because of the inability of the garda&iacute; and the DPP to work out where they stood on the issue.  Now we are in the situation that all of that is unregulated.  In the meantime, and it is 12 years since I was a Minister, online gambling has increased massively.  The legislative proposals we had at the time were going to be based on domestic activities under the Gaming and Lotteries Act but something broader is needed now.</p> <p>Having explained my own part in all this, I think it has been a huge failure on the part of the Department of Justice and Equality, starting before my time, in my time, and up to now, that we have not taken this issue by the scruff of the neck with a view to dealing with it.  All the social consequences, and I know of them, suicides, ruination, people's careers being destroyed and all the rest that flow from an unregulated gambling industry in this country are there for us all to see.  Collectively, in these Houses, we really should have it on our conscience how imperfect our response has been.  I know the Minister of State has consultative processes and that Deputy O'Callaghan has tabled a Bill, based on the Minister's heads of Bill, but we have to face up to it seriously and implement something because it is a stain on all our consciences that things have developed to the point they are at. </p></speech>

My fellow Senators have made many arguments and there is no point replicating or repeating them.  We need to understand the problem to understand how we fix it.  Experts used to think that addiction was dependence on a chemical.  However, it is now defined as repeatedly pursuing a rewarding experience despite serious repercussions.  This could be a drug but we now know that we do not need to ingest a drug to change the neurochemistry of the brain.  Furthermore, gambling addicts may learn to confront their irrational beliefs, namely, the notion that a string of losses or near misses such as two out of three cherries in a slot machine signals an imminent win.  Some 80% of addicts never seek treatment and another large percentage do not recognise themselves as addicts, therein lies part of the problem.</p> <p>Like most things in life this issue is fast-moving and ever-changing, especially with the advent of technology.  As Senator Conway-Walsh said, everyone has easy access to gambling, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  It is often within arm's reach for all of us.  As a consequence, protection and the law to protect the individual must change.  The complexity of the problem has been well described by fellow Senators, the pain and distress gambling causes to Irish families should not and cannot be underestimated.  It is imperative that a regulatory body and framework are established to oversee and manage this growing concern.  This motion concerns a responsible approach to gambling, not outlawing, banning or disadvantaging an industry.  We must recognise that there is an extensive, regulated, responsible industry contributing significantly to the Exchequer and the economy.</p> <p>Science has enabled us to understand the phenomenon of gambling and to understand better how addiction functions and affects us but it has not suggested mechanisms to deal with the problem.  For this reason, I am happy to support this motion, along with my fellow Senators. </p></speech>

It is important to say, as has already been eloquently said in the House, that there is a need for regulation, for a regulatory authority and a regulator.  Senator McDowell speaks about the failings of the past and we cannot but learn from them because the social cost is mounting.  We have all heard about the high profile cases of the celebrity or prominent sportsperson.  Equally, there is the person who we will never know, who is living in a three-bed semi-detached house or whatever and is gambling, his or her addiction mounting up a store of problems.  The social cost, as Senator McDowell rightly said, is one we count in the number of lives and careers lost.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The world of gambling has changed.  It has gone from the high street and is now online.  We probably all have the Paddy Power app on our mobile phones to check the general election odds in constituencies.  Before I came in, I downloaded the app to see what it was and the first thing I saw was a rewards club being advertised as more than just betting.  This entices a person to go on further.  <br/><br/>I want to make another point which is not necessarily on the same topic but which is linked.  I refer to the issue of loot boxes, which I have spoken about in the House before, and to gaming in general.  I thank the Minister of State for the courtesy he extended to me and to my adviser on this matter, Mr. Eoin Barry, who has done a lot of work with me on the issue of loot boxes and gaming in general and on the issue's links to online gambling.  Again one can spend money, which can build up resulting in personal effects.  I have had the privilege of working with Mr. Barry and meeting representatives of the Interactive Software Federation of Europe, ISFE, which is the European representative body, as well as Mr. David Sweeney and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton. <br/><br/>We recognise that we must enact change.  That is why I was struck by a petition brought before the Committee on Public Petitions, of which I am a member.  It sought to have a regulator set up for the gambling and gaming industry.  It in interesting that it was the third petition of this nature to be considered.  I do not want to pre-empt the Minister of State's speech, but we are working towards the establishment of an independent gambling regulatory authority.  <br/><br/>With regard to the gaming and lotteries (amendment) Bill, it is important to recognise that we need to see how the legislation can be kept relevant and able to address issues which are evolving every day.  Many of us do not understand half of what is happening in respect of online activity around loot boxes and gambling.  The points Senator Craughwell has made in previous debates are worth considering and should be reflected in the Bill.  We have had pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill and I hope the Committee on Public Petitions will have another opportunity to discuss the issue in April.  <br/><br/>The important point is that we are giving this topic consideration and an airing and that we are highlighting it.  Senator Conway-Walsh made a point about the <i>modus operandi</i>of companies and about the intent and import of their activities.  It is not just to get us all to spend money, but to keep us spending money.  That is what they are trying to do.  I will conclude on that.  I welcome this debate.  I commend Senator Craughwell not only on his contribution tonight, but on his other contributions on this particular matter in other areas.  I hope that the Bill will be fast-tracked in the overall scheme of legislation because it is an issue which is not going away or diminishing; it is getting worse.  All of us who recognise that want to see action, as does the Minister of State.</p></speech>

It is not my thing.  I took out an account with one of the online companies merely to watch St. Patrick's Athletic play Derry City in the League of Ireland.  It says something that the rights to video recordings of the last season of League of Ireland games were sold to a betting company.  There was obviously no other interest in the national soccer league.  A betting site was the only place for me to see my local team play up in Derry.  To see the match one had to place a bet.  I put a euro on the game.  St. Patrick's Athletic started to win the game, which was not to the plan of Bet 365 or whichever company it was, and so it was constantly engaging with me to get out now.  I was fascinated by how one could become completely immersed in online gambling.  That is about as far as my own personal experience goes, however.</p> <p>On the points raised by Senators Norris and McDowell, I recently raised issues around licensing laws and the Give Us The Night campaign, which started in Dublin.  Many people I knew at the time I left school went to the casinos which have been mentioned after the clubs, because clubs close at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.  Would it not be better for us to have places where drink may not necessarily be on sale but where one could continue to dance or have a night out and whose opening hours are staggered rather than one's only option being a 24-hour casino where drink is also available?</p></speech>

From my experience, this is especially true in respect of young men.  The State has the third highest gambling losses per adult in the world and we have no dedicated gambling addiction treatment service.  Gambling companies profiting from Irish users do not care about or respond to those who have shown by their online behaviour that they have an issue with problem gambling.  Their business model is to maximise profits.</p><p>The levels of gambling company sponsorship not only in the League of Ireland and the Irish league in the North, but in the Premier League are just huge.  It is to be seen on the jerseys, on the hoarding on the sides of the pitch, and during the advertising breaks.  Newstalk now have a section during half-time where the presenters will not necessarily reflect on the game but analyse the betting side of it.  Gambling companies invest massive amounts of money in targeting those who watch sport.  The level of advertising budgets at their disposal is extremely worrying.  </p><p>Just as alcohol companies have Drinkaware, gambling companies have their own support service; Gamble Aware.  Its logo appears on advertising.  Aaron Rogan of the <i>The Times</i>, Ireland edition uncovered that Gamble Aware's helpline was left entirely unmanned during games at the World Cup last summer.  Its voicemail was full so it could not refer callers to another service.  When asked for comment, the director of Gamble Aware said that the funding from the industry had dried up.  He stated &quot;It's a volunteer service, it is what it is.&quot;  If that is not lipservice, I do not know what is.  The website <i>gambleaware.ie </i>is no longer active.  Despite the fact that gambling companies are still giving the impression that Gamble Aware is active and that they are doing their bit to help problem gamblers, they are fully aware they have underfunded the service to the point that the website is non-operational.  </p><p>Furthermore, Aaron Rogan reported last month that Paddy Power and Betfair have been paying customers to sign confidentiality agreements and to drop complaints they have made to the Data Protection Commissioner or to the British gambling regulator.  The Data Protection Commissioner is currently investigating that matter.  It is another in a long line of behaviours by the gambling companies that disregard the rights of users to interact safely with these businesses.  The British gambling regulator is also investigating the same matter but the difference is that Irish users will not have recourse, whereas British users will.  This is due to Government's failure to effectively regulate gambling or to implement the gambling control Bill 2013, the heads of which have been with the Minister of State's Department for almost six years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It has been established fairly that the gambling industry has not shown itself to be capable or responsible enough to regulate itself.   The case has been made that the State needs to regulate and I do not believe anyone in this Chamber, including the Minister, disagrees.</p><p>The health-led response to problem gambling is not good enough.  The response to a parliamentary question received by Deputy Louise O&rsquo;Reilly from the HSE showed that in the past three years some 800 people had been treated for a gambling addiction.  Aside from the motion, the HSE and the Department of Health must own up to their responsibilities.  The Institute of Public Health in Ireland has shown that the health and social costs of problem gambling exceed the Government revenue gained from the gambling tax and businesses.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, might consider making the increased revenue from the changes to the betting tax in budget 2019 available to the HSE for the purpose of providing gambling addiction treatment.</p><p>I commend the members of the inter-departmental working group on gambling.  I hope publication of the group's report will result in a quick turnaround in bringing the Gambling Control Bill 2013 before the Houses this year.  We are paying too high a price for being inactive in dealing with this matter.</p></speech>

There is no reason to suspect there has not been gambling on this island for the same length of time.  As everybody knows, Ireland has a history of funding projects from the proceeds of gambling.  The sale of the national lottery was trumpeted as providing hundreds of millions of euro towards the building of the national children's hospital.  That is ironic when one considers that the Government seems to have acted like a reckless gambler in planning the project, given the way the projected costs have spiralled out of control.  Perhaps the same negligence can be seen in the political establishment's inadequate response to date to the problem of gambling.  While the national lottery does fund good work - we hear constantly about how it funds community projects throughout the State - one must wonder about the hoopla and the amount of advertising carried on the public television service on the lottery that encourages people to gamble more and more, by putting before them aunrealisable goals, albeit sometimes in very humorous ways.  As I said, there is a tradition.  The Great Wall of China was part funded through a form of lottery, as were the great Ivy League colleges of Harvard and Yale.  The things are fite fuaite - progress, on the one hand, but vulnerability, on the other.  Gambling is not inherently bad or wrong, but we have to confront the fact that it is doing great harm to some people's lives.  As policy makers, we have to ask how this problem can best be managed and regulated to ensure it will not damage or impinge on the dignity of citizens or their families.</p> <p>Generally, in our minds we associate gambling with being a problem for men only, but research carried out by the Rutland Centre and other groups shows that increasingly it is becoming a problem among women also, although it is still far more prevalent among men.  The most difficult feature of the problem is the impact it has on families.  We have seen and heard recently the very honest testimony of Davy Glennon, the Galway hurling star, who has spoken about how he became a compulsive liar and thief.  We heard about the sacrifices his family had to make to repay the debts that had flowed from his gambling problem.</p> <p>While it is not a great personal interest of mine, I have cause to see a lot of advertisements for gambling since I have a close family relative who loves the bloodstock industry and has a great passion for the turf, although she is not a gambler.  I have often arrived home to be shushed as she shuttled between the television in one room on which racing was being shown on RT&Eacute; and, between races, to watch the racing at Kempton Park on another in another room.  It always strikes me how manipulative the advertisements are for the various betting companies.  Making any association with glamour or manliness in advertisements for strong liquor has become taboo, but that is not the case with the advertisements of betting companies.  Something has to be done about this.  I say this in the knowledge that people involved in the bloodstock industry who do so much for the gaiety of the nation will say that, to some degree, they are dependent on the sponsorship moneys of the companies.  I suggest, however, that, on balance, the issue has to be tackled.</p> <p>As a country, we must ask if we are glorifying gambling to an unhealthy extent and if the State sanctions or encourages many forms of gambling in unhealthy ways.  I referred to the national lottery.  We have to think, for example, about the EuroMillions lottery and all of the coverage given to the recent win.  It seems there is doublethink on gambling which perhaps often mirrors the doublethink on the problem of the excess consumption of alcohol, on the one hand, and the inability of the State, on the other, to really grasp the nettle in dealing with that issue.  There is almost a cult surrounding the lotto and the EuroMillions lottery and the way they whip us up into a frenzy, in which the media play its part.  I am not aware of any research to determine the amount the average person might spend on the lottery each week, but I am sure there are some who participate to an unhealthy degree.</p> <p>As a person who comes from rural Ireland, I have noticed that in towns where very little else seems to be happening the presence and prevalence of bookies' and betting shops.  What does that say about people's dependency?  It is a tragedy that towns that are down at heel in many ways still seem to have thriving betting shops.</p> <p>I was shocked by the recent comments of a former Fine Gael Minister, Ivan Yates, when he told a Sunday newspaper that he paid for his car, which is worth up to &euro;40,000, through huge high stake bets.  I am not picking on Mr. Yates; he is a fine communicator and so on, but in the interview he said: "Once every 10 years I have to raise a humongous amount of money, up to about &euro;40,000 to pay for a car ... so I line up a bet, no word of a lie."  At one level, it is entertaining to hear it, but in terms of the public good I would probably have preferred not to have heard it.  One could argue that it is incredibly irresponsible-----</p></speech>

I will pass on from the matter, but I warn all of us, myself included, against making blas&eacute; comments that could be seen to be irresponsible and symptomatic of a too casual attitude to gambling in Ireland.</p> <p>I commend the motion to the Seanad.  I pay tribute also to the people who are tackling the problem, even as big businesses profit, sometimes in a cynical way, as we heard from Senator Warfield when he referred to non-existent industry attempts to promote responsibility in this area.  It is not so much it is what it is - to use their own words - but it is not what it is not.  I had the good fortune to visit Tiglin recently to see the wonderful work being done by Aubrey McCarthy, staff and former clients.  There is real hope for people with aaddictions, including gambling.  I also acknowledge the great work being done by Sister Consilio and Cuan Mhuire.  They are the real heroes.  The State should take the lead from their courage, initiative and persistence to come up with solutions to the problem; solutions that are long overdue.</p></speech>

I thank the Senators who brought forward the motion which the Government is not opposing as it is broadly in line with Government policy.</p> <p>The debate provides me with a welcome opportunity to report to Seanad &Eacute;ireann on the efforts made to review and enhance the original Government proposals set out in the general scheme of the 2013 Gambling Control Bill.  I thank Senators for their interest and support in dealing with this matter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I commend Senators on the debate thus far, which has been interesting, responsible and thought-provoking, as is usually the case in the House.  </p><p>I have been actively engaged in the past two years in efforts to develop and bring forward revised proposals in this complex and evolving area of policy broadly based on the 2013 scheme. The motion addresses two broad issues, namely, the new regulatory approach to be adopted and the consequences for persons whose gambling activities result in problems for them, their families and society in general and how best we might address those problems.  Since I assumed special responsibility in this area, my guiding principle has been that we must license and regulate in a modern, transparent and proportionate manner the many gambling pursuits in which many citizens participate.  In doing that, we must ensure the best possible enforcement of the law and compliance with licensing conditions, increase revenue to the Exchequer, improve services to the consumer and support the optimal protection for persons who may be vulnerable to addiction. </p><p>On 10 January 2018, the Government approved a review of all provisions of the 2013 scheme of the Gambling Control Bill 2018 to determine if they remained fit for purpose, a rationalisation of the licensing approach to gambling activities, the clarification of the provisions concerning the licensing of gaming machines and the concept of establishing an independent regulatory authority for the gambling industry.  Through the chairing of an interdepartmental working group on the future licensing and regulation of gambling, the Government tasked me with reviewing all of the provisions of the 2013 general scheme.  The group was to determine whether these provisions remained fit for purpose and what revisions and additions might be required in the light of domestic and international developments in the interim.  I intend to bring the report of the group to Government for approval before the end of March.  Once it is approved, I will seek permission to publish it, as Senator Craughwell requested, and I look forward to hearing the views of colleagues in both Houses at that time.</p><p>Gambling activity is of considerable economic impact in Ireland.  In the 2017 returns published by the Revenue Commissioners, the 1% betting duty amounted to &euro;52.2 million, suggesting a market size of &euro;5.22 billion, while national lottery ticket sales for 2017 amounted to &euro;800 million.  These figures alone suggest an industry worth more than &euro;6 billion annually.  In addition to this, there are no figures published for revenue from online gaming, gaming in arcades and private members&rsquo; clubs, bingo - including online - or for the thousands of local community lotteries and raffles in the State.  It would not be unreasonable to estimate the value of the Irish gambling market annually as being between &euro;6 billion and &euro;8 billion.</p><p>A great deal of change has taken place in the gambling industry since 2013.  The industry is large, growing and evolving from a largely land-based manifestation to an online one.  We currently apply a mid-20th century approach to gambling activities that have changed dramatically in nature, that are increasingly digital in format and that are conducted online.  As the gambling industry changes, so must the State&rsquo;s licensing and regulatory approach.  The development of modern, fit-for-purpose gambling legislation is necessary and is a priority for the Government, whose objective is to ensure the proper licensing and regulation of the many varied forms of gambling available in the State.  We need a modern regulatory approach that will enhance consumer protection in all forms of gambling, increase the protection of vulnerable persons and potentially increase Exchequer revenue from the gambling industry.</p><p>Our current legislation, however, does not provide for a coherent licensing and regulatory approach to gambling activities.  The responsibility for licensing and regulating gambling activities is shared among a number of Departments and agencies, as Senator McDowell and others have noted.  Such fragmentation does not facilitate a consistent and effective approach to licensing, compliance and enforcement, consumer protection and the protection of vulnerable persons, including of underage persons.  In addition, this fragmented regulatory environment limits the potential for revenue-raising possibilities from licensing fees, duties and taxation, which could better fund regulatory activities and treatment for gambling addiction, as Senators have pointed out.  Devising and implementing modern licensing and regulation for the gambling industry presents the State with a significant challenge, as Senator McDowell outlined from his vast experience.</p><p>The working group which I chaired met six times and, having regard to the Government decision on 10 January 2018 to establish, on a statutory basis, an independent regulatory authority for the gambling industry, devoted considerable effort to examining the modalities, including resource implications of the establishment of such an authority.  I thank the members of the working group and my officials for their work.  When we carried out pre-legislative scrutiny on the 2013 general scheme, under my chairmanship of the Oireachtas committee, it was envisaged that an office would be established in the Department of Justice and Equality.  When I was given responsibility, however, I considered the matter and recommended going beyond that.  The significant change was the establishment of an independent regulatory authority with considerably more resources and powers because my view at the time was that an office in the Department would not have cut it. </p><p>The working group considered whether the number of proposed licensing categories for gambling activities might be rationalised from those recommended in the 2013 scheme, of which there were many.  In determining applications for gambling licences, extensive background checking would be required.  All licences were to have appropriate terms and conditions to protect consumers and vulnerable persons and to assist in combating fraud and money laundering, while licensing conditions would be clear, fair, legitimate and transparent to all.  The group considered the need for the further development of an appropriate licensing, monitoring and enforcement regime for land-based gaming machines in casinos and elsewhere that may be played for monetary reward.  It would not be realistic to seek to enforce prohibition on certain physical gaming machines over other types of machine as it would risk further migration to online versions that are widely available on most operators&rsquo; websites and may be difficult to monitor effectively.</p><p>The group discussed the current minimal effective protection for consumers of gambling products and considered the positive development of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms by gambling regulators in other states to settle disputes.  The critical element in improving consumer protection in respect of gambling will be the establishment of the proposed regulatory authority to enforce new licensing conditions and other provisions designed to prevent unfair practices by operators through gambling offers, which is a serious point.</p><p>The group also discussed the issue of advertising, sponsorship and promotion of gambling products and activities and examined a range of possible options on the future approach to regulating these activities.  These matters have attracted much public interest and comment and many references to sponsorship, advertising and promotion were made earlier.  Potential restrictions on gambling advertising and sponsorship must be carefully considered, targeted and effective.  Sectors of Irish sporting activity that depend heavily on advertising and sponsorship would risk being negatively impacted by restrictive measures if they were introduced quickly, as I am sure Senators will understand.  The national lottery, for example, is a prominent and significant gambling advertiser and sponsor, as was also noted earlier.</p><p>Our future legislation must deal with aggressive promotional offers by gambling operators to entice customers to their product.  I am anxious to ensure, however, that unintended negative consequences do not arise in this regard and I must caution against unrealistic expectations as to what can be achieved.  In regard to combating criminal activity through gambling, the group noted and discussed the transposition into domestic law of the fourth EU anti-money laundering directive in November 2018, which will give added impetus to national efforts in the combating of money laundering attempts through gambling activities.  The group also discussed reports of possible attempts of match fixing concerning Irish sporting events, which the Acting Chairman, Senator O'Mahony, noted.  It considered that maintaining integrity in sports betting was vital and, in this context, noted the work of the dedicated sports betting intelligence unit in the UK.  Senators will understand how deeply complicated the matter is.</p><p>As highlighted by the motion, the main element of the Government decision was approving the concept of the establishment of a new gambling regulatory authority as an independent statutory body.  Independent regulation would mirror the situation in most EU member states, would bring the State in line with best international practice and would offer assurance that decision-making would be free from any potentially undue influence.  Senators will appreciate that effective modern licensing, regulation and enforcement of the Irish gambling industry will require additional significant resources, primarily for the operation of the new regulatory authority.  Similar authorities in other EU member states involve large numbers of staff, of 100 and more in some cases, and extensive IT provision.  The group is firmly of the view that without the establishment of a new gambling regulatory authority of sufficient scale, modern effective licensing and regulation could not be achieved as desired.  I will make this point clear to Government colleagues when I present the report of the working group for consideration in the coming weeks.</p><p>The group agreed that any new regulatory authority should, to a large degree, be ultimately self-financing, with income from licence fees, fines imposed on operators and other duties.  Such self-financing potential, however, may take some time to realise and Exchequer funding would be substantially relied on in the initial phase of operations.  In order to assist with the development of a business plan for a new gambling regulatory authority, the legal firm McCann FitzGerald was contracted by the structural reform support service of the European Commission to conduct a research project entitled Establishment of Modern Regulatory Environment and Authority for Gambling Activities in Ireland.  The project, which was commenced in early December 2018 and is expected to conclude by mid-summer 2019, is intended to outline the structure of the authority.  </p><p>The issue of problem gambling has been the primary focus of discussion about the regulation of gambling.  The working group was conscious of the issue of problem gambling in Irish society, which can involve severely negative impacts for the person as well as his or her family.  It considered that the approach taken in the 2013 scheme towards the protection of vulnerable persons remained broadly valid.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This included establishment of a social fund, funded by levies on licensed gambling operators, to assist with research and information campaigns and to support addiction treatment.  Our focus must be to develop the best possible regulatory measures for the gambling industry in respect of vulnerable persons.  This would include age restrictions, staff training, self-exclusion measures and controls on advertising, promotions and sponsorship.  A key potential of new effective regulation is that it will permit the establishment and operation of a social fund supported by industry levies.  Such a fund will support those professional and expert organisations involved in addiction treatment.</p><p>Senators may wish to note that Prevalence of Drug Use and Gambling in Ireland and Drug Use in Northern Ireland 2014-15, a drug prevalence survey, revealed that 64.5% of respondents engaged in some form of gambling in the 12 months prior to the survey, while 41.4% reported gambling on a monthly basis or more often.  Spending on the national lottery was the primary gambling activity.  However, it is noteworthy that the survey also indicated that prevalence of problem gambling in the general population was 0.8%.  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, and I have just this evening published that survey.  I was anxious to have it published before the debate so that colleagues would have it to hand and I was glad that Senators were able to use it in the debate.  A further survey for 2018 and 2019 is being conducted under the auspices of the Health Research Board.  I am informed that the findings of the survey should be available in the next 12 months.</p><p>I have appreciated the opportunity to inform the Seanad this evening of the developments with regard to the working group.  As I said, we will be in a better position to further debate this topic when the recommendations of the working group have been considered by Government.  A modern and effectively regulated gambling environment will ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that gambling will be a safe and entertaining activity for the majority of those who choose to take part in it.  We must ensure that it will provide enhanced consumer protection for players while limiting to the greatest extent possible the harmful effects on young people and those who may be susceptible to addiction.</p><p>Incremental change is not a viable approach to the reform of gambling licensing and regulation.  Effective reform will require fundamental and significant change.  This will take some time to develop but with support from Senators I intend to proceed with this reform as quickly as I can.  It is essential that sufficient resources are committed to support the reform.</p><p>Even where there is robust and long-standing regulation and regulators, there is still problem gambling.  The UK, Malta and New Zealand still have this issue.  Setting up a regulator will not address the issue on its own.  Addiction is, in many ways, a health matter, as Senator Marshall pointed out in his contribution.  We have to be cognisant that people require treatment and so on.  Even where there is a robust regulatory regime, it does not solve the problem.  We should be careful about pinning our hopes to the regulator sorting out problem gambling because it will not do so.  There is much more to this issue than people with problems and addiction, although that is a very serious matter.  The regulator will assist in that regard.  In response to Senator Craughwell, we aim to publish this report.</p><p>As an interim reform measure, I intend to amend and update the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  This is something that I am able to do relatively quickly.  Subject to Government approval, I intend to publish the gaming and lotteries (amendment) Bill in the very near future, hopefully at the same time as the publication of the report of the working group, and to commence debate on the Bill in the Seanad.  I intend to bring the Bill to this House first.  I am sure Senators will give it adequate consideration as they always do.</p><p>Senator Norris spoke about all kinds of activities going on but these activities are under the remit of Revenue and the Garda.  As I alluded to, action is being taken in some of these areas.  I cannot comment further in that regard.</p><p>Senator O'Mahony spoke about match-fixing and the brave people who tell their stories.  Pupils in every secondary school should hear about this.  Maybe there is something in that.  Perhaps there should be education in schools about the dangers of gambling.</p><p>Senator Horkan spoke about the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill.  At the time, we agreed with the legislation but the problem was that we have moved on.  That Bill proposed only to establish an office in the Department, whereas I want to be far more ambitious.  The proposal was not produced by Government and it did not go beyond heads of Bill.  That debate was useful in the Seanad but hopefully we can move beyond that together.</p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh spoke about the highest online gambling losses in the world.  The Senator is correct that this the industry is moving online and changing.  It changes every time we look at it.</p><p>Senator Buttimer and others brought to my attention the issue of loot boxes, skins and mystery boxes on the gaming side and the blurring of the distinction between gaming and gambling.  We have joined colleagues in other countries at European level in articulating our concern about that development.</p><p>I notice that Senator Conway-Walsh is not calling for gambling to be banned.  If we ban something like that, it goes underground and one cannot regulate it.  We could not ban in it in any event.</p><p>Senator Warfield's contribution relating to the need for treatment, the number of people treated and the role of the HSE was interesting.  He articulated what I said about gambling addiction being a health issue and not losing sight of that.</p><p>Senator Mullen went back to China in 2300 BC, which seems to indicate that gambling and addiction are part of the human condition that have been around for an awfully long time.  He spoke about glorifying gambling, which we hope to address through the establishment of a regulator.  I want the regulator to be nimble, to be able to adapt to changing circumstances when it is established, and to keep up with an industry that is changing almost daily.  Something new is happening in it every time one looks at it.</p><p>I thank colleagues for a very important debate and for tabling the motion.  I also than them for the support they have given on this issue.  I look forward to coming back to the House with a small Bill.  I hope we will be able to discuss the report when it is published.  I look forward to hearing the opinions of colleagues on the report.  We can only add to it.  I commit to doing the best I can to bring this forward.  Listening to what the former Minister, Senator McDowell, had to say, I have to be careful because this is a very broad and difficult area.</p></speech>

I want to put into context what we are talking about.  The criminal who imported young girls into this country on the pretence that they were coming as waitresses beat the living daylights out of them in the midlands, put them into prostitution in Dublin, and laundered his money through betting shops in Dublin.  That is gambling.  The man who stopped me outside the gate in 2014 to tell me that he recognised me as the new Senator and wanted me to bring in amendments to the betting Bill politely informed me that he was going home to tell his wife that he had lost &euro;87,000 gambling.  That man haunts me to this day.  I do not know if he ever arrived home and, if he did, I have no idea what impact that news had on his family.  Two elderly parents came to see me.  Their son had run up debts to the tune of &euro;15,000.  One evening, there was a knock on the door and two brutish men gave them a very cold option of paying the &euro;15,000 or visiting their son in hospital.  That is gambling and that is what is going on in this country.  We are all aware of gambling machines, online gambling and so on.  None of us can explain the addiction.  A person cannot understand it unless he or she is sucked into it.</p> <p>It would be simple to get the online companies to shut a person out of a site automatically after one hour, and to prevent people from going online to gamble between 12 midnight and 7 a.m.  These technological solutions could be put in place.  I accept that we need a regulatory body for this but we have to think about these matters.  Kids in the rugby schools in various parts of the country are betting and companies are taking bets on school rugby, GAA and soccer matches.  That is gambling.  If one is living with an alcoholic, that person will fall in through the door, fall asleep and do whatever alcoholics do.  A drug addict will go through the horrors.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">  Senator Gerard P. Craughwell :</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If one is living with a gambler, one can be sleeping beside him or her when he or she takes out the smartphone from under the pillow and bets on some ridiculous football match in some godforsaken part of the world that he or she cannot identify on a map.  He or she bets on the next goal, the likelihood of the next free or a penalty.  That is what we are talking about in gambling.  The Minister of State is correct; it is an extremely broad subject.  I have discussed it many times with the Minister of State and I am convinced of his determination to move it along.  I do not think, in the time that remains to this Government, that we will see the completion of any legislation but I believe the Minister of State will move along the sections he can and for that I thank him.</p><p>I will not call for a vote as I think we have cross-party support for this motion.  I thank my colleagues for their comments and commitment to regulate gambling.</p></speech>
