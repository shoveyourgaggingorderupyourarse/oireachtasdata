    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1671" speakername="Erin McGreehan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#B00900"><p>I welcome the Minister.  It is great to have the senior Minister with us.  As he knows, the sheep sector is important to me.  My family are all in the sheep sector and it is how I was born and reared.  It is also important to the country, so I am glad we are having this discussion.  I hope that what I have asked in the Commencement matter will be answered without prejudice about other parts of the agricultural sector.  I would like to know the rationale behind the difference in the direct payment for sheep compared with beef suckler cattle in the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and how the Department will work to support the sheep sector further.</p> <p>The sheep sector is a vital part of the agri-economy and all rural communities.  There are approximately 34,000 sheep farmers.  As the Minister knows, County Donegal has the largest number of sheep in the country.  In the counties with the most marginal land, hilly land, and the poorest of farmers, one will find farms with a combination of beef suckler cattle and sheep.  I want to highlight a specific mathematical discrepancy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Fifteen cattle equals 100 ewes.  Fifteen cattle will receive &euro;3,350 while 100 ewes will get &euro;1,200.  If sheep farmers were getting the same supports as suckler farmers, it would represent a payment of around &euro;33 per ewe, rather than the &euro;12 per ewe promised.  It would be beneficial to get an answer to this question on why a vulnerable sector like the sheep sector does not get the same level of support as the suckler sector, which is also a very vulnerable and valuable sector.  The Minister may know that the sheep sector has had a few difficult years, but sheep farming is a love and a way of life.  It must be supported to encourage young farmers back into the sector.  I grew up in it; it is an industry I understand and I have a deep connection with my sheep.  Nothing highlights that more than when the Cooley Mountains were depopulated of sheep due to foot and mouth disease.  No person in this Chamber would understand the trauma of that for my community, but the resilience of my community in the Cooley Mountains to restock and come back after those dark days proves my point about the importance of the sheep sector to our economy, culture and heritage.</p><p>The average age of farmers is increasing and is currently 56 years in sheep farming.  If anyone is familiar with sheep farming, particularly sheep farming on marginal land, they will know that it is time-consuming and labour-intensive.  The hours are long and hard with clipping, dipping, dagging and dosing.  The time is spent on manual task.  I can tell the House first hand that it is difficult.  If you have ever tried to turn over a stubborn sheep to check her feet or her udder, you will understand the strength you need.  This is not an older person's game.  We need youth in the sector and we need to encourage youth into the sector.</p><p>I am putting forward a case for the sheep farmers of Ireland for more direct support for their sector and particularly an increase in the payment in the new sheep improvement scheme next year.  I acknowledge the new scheme will see farmers getting &euro;12 per ewe rather than the &euro;10 they receive in the present sheep welfare scheme, but a &euro;2 increase is clearly not enough.  I also acknowledge that there are other supports coming but we need to protect, support and encourage sheep farmers who are often an afterthought in national policy.  With the Minister's background and knowledge of County Donegal and my knowledge of County Louth and the sheep farmers in the Cooley Peninsula, I know we will not allow that to continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#C00300"><p>I thank Senator McGreehan for putting this issue on the agenda today.  It is certainly not the first time she has raised it with me.  She has been a very strong advocate for the sheep sector throughout the CAP process and since then as she has been for the agricultural sector and family farms across the board.</p> <p>The short-term and long-term viability of our beef and sheep farmers is a key priority for me, as it is for the Senator.  Having grown up, like her, on a sheep farm in County Donegal, I am acutely aware of the importance of these crucial sectors not only to agriculture but to the wider rural economy.  I continue to lead and support the agrifood sector by putting in place appropriate supports for the sector, including through the CAP strategic plan.  The next CAP is fair and well-funded and will support our farm families over the course of the decade regardless of their size, system or location.  The plan recently approved by Government will provide almost &euro;10 billion to farm families over the next five years to support them to continue to produce world-class, safe and sustainable food as well as supporting them in their important work on meeting our future climate ambitions.</p> <p>This enhanced climate ambition will be met through a number of measures, including eco-schemes in pillar 1 and a new &euro;1.5 billion flagship environmental scheme, the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, and the organic farming scheme in pillar 2.  Almost &euro;6 billion will be paid in direct farm payments to farmers with a number of specific supports for the livestock sector under pillar 2.  For example, the supports for both suckler and sheep farmers are at higher rates, as the Senator pointed out, than in the current programme and will improve the carbon footprint, genetic merit and animal welfare of our national herd.</p> <p>In relation to the suckler scheme, an allocation of &euro;260 million has been provided between 2023-2027 for the suckler carbon efficiency programme and &euro;100 million for the same years for the sheep welfare scheme.  It must be recognised, however, that both beef and sheep farmers can avail, as the Senator pointed out, of a range of other CAP measures, including areas of natural constraints, ANC, payments, the new environmental scheme and the organic farming scheme.</p> <p>Another significant support for the beef and sheep sectors is the enhanced support for early-stage producer organisations in the upcoming CAP strategic plan which, in addition to providing administrative and advisory support of up to &euro;33,000 to groups, provides under competition law for collective bargaining on output prices thereby strengthening their position in the supply chain.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I have maintained the levels of specific sector supports for both sheep and beef.  If we look at 2023 specifically, the budgetary provision from my Department in 2023 is &euro;2.14 billion which is the highest ever level of funding for the Department and represents a &euro;283 million, or a 13%, increase on the previous year.  In the coming year, I will introduce a new scheme to continue the beef welfare measures which were previously funded under beef environmental efficiency programme - suckler, BEEP-S.  I have also maintained the annual budget for targeted beef and sheep supports of more than &euro;100 million.  Beef and sheep farmers will be well placed to benefit from the enhanced supports I have in place this year for fodder aid, as well as a number of other support schemes, including the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, and the organics scheme which I mentioned.</p><p>In terms of the payment rates under the new rural development programme sheep welfare scheme, the payment rate is being increased from &euro;10 previously to &euro;12.  The payment rate per animal is also being increased in the beef data and genomics programme for suckler cows.</p><p>I am pleased to be able to maintain the funds.  In terms of the sheep sector and throughout the CAP consultation process, the request for additional sheep funding was a very strong theme.  I, along with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, delivered an extra 50% in national co-funding for pillar 2 schemes, meaning significantly increased payments for farmers.  One still had to make choices and decisions in terms of how one would allocate that and which sectors were most under pressure.  I increased that for sheep, although I know sheep farmers would have liked more.  What I would say is that as we step out over the next number of years the potential is there to look at that year-on-year to see if we can increase it.  It has increased in recent years and I know the sheep sector very much wants to see that happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1671" speakername="Erin McGreehan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#D00150"><p>I thank the Minister.  I spoke to him previously about a wool council.  I reiterate the need to continue those indirect supports.  As he well knows, part sheep welfare is that they must be sheared and they must be protected.  It is now costing a farmer more to shear their sheep and to look after them in that way than they are getting for their wool.  If they are not getting it in a direct payment, it is really important these indirect payments are sufficient to make sure they get all the benefit and that they are supported within their industry.  One glaringly obvious support is wool.  It is a sustainable, renewable product and we must create the markets and create the space for them to sell it into.  Maybe there could be an extra payment, or a small payment, to support the shearing and clipping of sheep in the sheep welfare scheme and an acknowledgement of the work in regard to a wool council.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#D00200"><p>I thank the Senator again for raising the issue.  The sheep welfare scheme has been a popular one among sheep farmers.  It is regarded as being straightforward, accessible, practical and very useful in terms of the measures contained in it.  The funding has been welcomed.  There has been a request for additional funding, for which Senator McGreehan has strongly advocated, over the last couple of years.  Thankfully, over the last three to four years sheep prices have been much stronger than they have been in recent years.  We need them to be like that all of the time and we need to ensure farmers get a fair return for the work they put in, whether in the Cooley Mountains, in the lowlands or in Donegal.</p> <p>When the previous CAP programme was launched in 2014, there was no sheep programme in it.  This CAP, which I have brought in, has a sheep programme plugged in from the very start at a rate of &euro;12.  The fact there was not one there at the start of the last CAP but that it evolved over the course of that CAP programme shows that schemes can evolve and be strengthened over a CAP programme.</p> <p>I will certainly be looking to see what capacity I have to further improve supports for the sheep sector.  If one looks at the last year, the fodder scheme, in particular, was an important scheme to support sheep farmers and sheep farmers very much availed of it.  I thank Senator McGreehan for raising this issue today and I look forward to continuing to work with her on how we can support the sector.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#E00700"><p>Indeed.  You cannot get around a Kerryman.</p> <p>The Minister is very much aware of this important issue.  Senator Carrigy and I tabled this Commencement matter to seek clarity about the new forestry programme.  There has been significant worry in the industry, especially in the past two or three years, about afforestation rates and how we can move the sector forward.  Unfortunately, the afforestation rate is at an all-time low and restoring confidence in the forestry sector has been a major issue for many of us.  This new forestry programme is an important part of that and aims to get confidence back into the system.  We need clarity regarding afforestation rates for 2023 and up to 2027 in order that people on the ground know what they can do.</p> <p>We had hoped the new scheme would be announced around the time of the National Ploughing Championships and it would give an indication of what would be in the scheme so people could start planning.  Unfortunately, that has not happened and we do not have an indication of the contents of the scheme.  The timeline of the scheme is also a major issue.  There are rumours it will be launched in January.  We are now hearing from the rumour brigade that it may not happen until February, March, April or May.  We need clarity that it will be launched in January and the rates, grants and premiums will be confirmed so the entire industry can have clarity.</p> <p>Legacy licences are also an issue.  I believe they will never be acted on because the majority of the licenceholders have moved on to other farming enterprises and may never get involved in the forestry sector.</p> <p>It appears likely we will have a large cohort of foresters with nothing to do for the next six, eight or 12 months until the licensing scheme under the new programme is put in place.  The knock-on effect is that we could have people left with no jobs and plants destroyed.  I heard of such cases last week.  It would be helpful if the Minister could provide clarity on these issues.</p></speech>

I am speaking on behalf of farmers in my local community in Longford-Westmeath.  I have met the chair of the forestry committee of the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, and individual landowners who are looking for certainty and want to plant in future.  I have spoken to Glennon Brothers, one of the biggest companies in this country which also operates abroad.  It provides timber products throughout Ireland and the UK and is responsible for hundreds of jobs in my community in Longford and also in Cork.  It also has a factory in Scotland.  Glennon Brothers is looking for certainty that the company will have a future.  I cannot understand why we do not have clarity about the funding available to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to move the new forestry programme forward.  As Senator Lombard stated, it was our understanding that this scheme would be ready for the National Ploughing Championships and we now hear it might not be ready until April or May.  We are looking for certainty on behalf of the landowners who want to plant their land.  We want to increase the amount of land we plant, yet we cannot tell the people who are considering planting what the grants or premiums will be with any certainty.  Individual landowners will make alternative decisions with their land.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to provide clarity on whether the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform has allocated funding to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for a scheme to be put in place.  Will he also confirm that we will hear what those premiums and grants are sooner rather than later?  April 2023 is far too late; we need this now.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to address this issue in the Seanad.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, is otherwise engaged and could not be here.  I am happy to address the matter.</p> <p>We want to be in a position to ensure people have clarity about the new rates before the start of January in order that they can plan and afforestation will proceed.  The programme will be 100% funded by the Exchequer, as has been the case for previous forestry programmes.  It is not co-funded by the European Commission.  It is all national funding and the payment of the grants and premiums is an integral part of the programme and vital to encourage an increase in afforestation over the coming decade.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Before I deal with the issue of the approval of this funding, it is worth reflecting on the efforts to date to design a shared vision for forestry in Ireland, which of course informs the new programme.  Following extensive engagement and consultation, Ireland has, for the first time, a Shared National Vision for Trees and Forests, which was published on 12 September 2022.  This shared national vision is ambitious and calls for an expansion of multifunctional and diverse forests, delivering multiple benefits for climate, nature, wood production, water quality, people, the economy and rural development.  The overarching statement of this vision provides for:</p><blockquote>	The right trees in the right places for the right reasons with the right management supporting a clean, healthy and well protected environment and a sustainable economy and society. </blockquote><p>With due consideration given to the shared national vision, a new forest strategy to 2030 has also been developed, which is underpinning a new forestry programme that will run from early 2023 to late 2027.  The strategy's implementation plan comprises a list of actions and measures, including the forestry programme for the period, which will be the main implementation vehicle for the forest strategy in the immediate to short term.<br/><br/>The forestry programme is subject to an ongoing strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment process.  As part of this process, it is currently out for public consultation.  Together with the draft forest strategy and associated environmental reports, the draft forestry programme was published on my Department's website last week and will be open for public consultation until 29 November 2022.  This means that stakeholders and interested parties will be aware of the measures and schemes being proposed under the next programme and will have an opportunity to submit any feedback they may have.  I encourage anyone with an interest in the future of forestry to participate in this consultation.  Once the public consultation process has been completed, the submissions received will be considered in the finalisation of the programme.<br/><br/>I acknowledge that the draft programme, as published, does not include the proposed changes to grant and premium rates.  I am aware of the need to make these details available at the earliest opportunity.  Having secured an additional &euro;12 million in budget 2023 for forestry to reach a total budget of &euro;112 million, my Department is engaged in detailed and ongoing discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform around the entire funding package for the new programme, particularly regarding the new grant and premium rates.  Once we get approval for the new grants and premium rates from that Department, we will make them known.  This will be on the understanding that they will be subject to securing state aid approval from the European Commission.<br/><br/>It is my intention to introduce a programme which will deliver for society, landowners and the forestry sector in Ireland.  A comprehensive and well-subscribed forestry programme has the potential to deliver lasting benefits for climate change, biodiversity, wood production, water quality, economic development and quality of life.  I am hopeful that once the programme is launched, public and private actors will support it to realise its ambition.</p></speech>

Our original intention was to table this Commencement matter and seek a response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, before it was changed, because we believe there is an issue here that we need clarified by that Department concerning the rates of payment and timelines for this programme.  Reading the report, it is clear that approval must be given to the proposal first by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It then goes to the European Commission and can then be launched.  I think this is the timeline being proposed.</p> <p>We are weeks away from Christmas, and mid-term is next week.  I am genuinely concerned that we need to get clarity on this scheme.  We have no timelines and no indication when it is going to begin.  The people we spoke to told us about job losses and a lack of confidence in the sector.  The last thing we need now is for January 2023 to arrive without this programme having been announced.  That would be a disaster for the entire industry.  I am genuinely concerned in this regard.  I emphasise the need for urgency here.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to provide us with some timelines concerning when he proposes to launch the scheme.</p></speech>

We are hearing about job losses, a lack of confidence, no timelines and blockages.  We need certainty, as do the people in this industry considering laying off employees and the landowners contemplating alternatives.  Otherwise, we are not going to hit the ambitious targets we have set out for afforestation.</p></speech>

We have not yet published information on the grant aids and premiums that will be in place from January 2023.  We are finalising those with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  What is clear is that they will be attractive and higher than the outgoing scheme.  The engagement we are having is about the size of the overall funding over the course of the programme and, therefore, how strong the rates can be.  We want to give that clarity in advance of January.</p><p>The new programme will start in January.  I know it is proving to be a challenge because people are reluctant to start planting before the new programme comes in as they know the rates are likely to increase.  However, it will be a strong and good story for the sector.  We need to instil confidence and drive it on.  We want people to plant.  We want new afforestation to drive on from January.  We will give clarity in advance of January as to the rate.  Like everything, it will be subject to state aid approval and needs approval from the Commission.  We cannot give a black-and-white answer and a 100% guarantee, but we expect approval to come.</p><p>Once we can provide clarity on the rates we are planning to set, people will know and understand the system.  The rates will be higher.  I advise people who are thinking about applying to plan and work ahead on the basis that the rates will be published in advance of January and they should plan to be in a position to do that work.  We need to increase our afforestation rates.  It is a massive priority for the Government and we will back it financially to drive it on.</p><p>We have worked hard to address the backlog in licensing, which is undermining confidence.  The backlog is reducing every week and we are driving it down.  We are almost at the stage of equilibrium.  We want new afforestation applications in particular and we will back that with grant rates.  We will try to provide clarity on what they will be as soon as possible, and certainly in advance of 1 January 2023.</p></speech>

The Rosslare to Waterford line was closed in 2010, having operated since 1906.  It connects with the Waterford to Limerick railway line, which continues to operate.  Many in south Wexford knew it as the sugar beet track because for a long time the railway line was synonymous with the transportation of sugar beet.  It served communities in south Wexford, including Campile, Ballycullane, Wellingtonbridge and Bridgetown.  There is a very active local campaign group, South East on Track.  Councillor Michael Whelan, who is based in Ballycullane, has been active in terms of examining supporting improved services.  The communities in the area would like the development of a greenway which could run in parallel with the rail line.</p> <p>The Minister of State may be able to update us on the all-Ireland strategic rail review.  It is very clear that Government policy is shifting towards a greater use of railway lines.  We know that shifting goods onto a railway line rather than using roads reduces the carbon footprint by 75%.  The more we can shift freight onto rail, the more environmental sense it makes and the more we can, ultimately, encourage passengers to use railway lines, which makes environmental sense.  I appreciate Rosslare Europort is a roll-on roll-off port and therefore may not be ideal for some areas of freight.  However, in terms of transporting freight around the south east this is something that would be of particular benefit.  While we continue to have infrastructure in place, which includes the longest railway bridge in Ireland over the River Barrow, it is important that we maintain that infrastructure and try to determine whether we can reopen the line.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know the Minister of State is particularly passionate about re-opening the western rail corridor.  If we can look at also redeveloping that south-eastern rail corridor, we can have that link between the Dublin to Rosslare line, the Waterford to Limerick line and on to Foynes and so on.  That would make a lot of sense.  I understand the all-Ireland strategic rail review is to be published shortly and it is imperative that we see this not just specifically for this line but so we have a real debate around transport in Ireland.  If we are serious about meeting our climate targets with regard to transport, then we have to look at serious investment in rail.  This is not just about re-opening old lines.  It has to be about ensuring those lines are attractive to use from a freight, and also from a passenger, point of view.  This is something that is growing in interest.  I would love to see this rail line re-opened at some stage over this decade and a greenway running parallel to it.  This would have huge benefits for the local community if it could be done and I would certainly hope in the context of the rail review that the possibility of re-opening this line could be considered.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, for the opportunity to address this issue.  As the Senator has acknowledged, I do a lot of work with West on Track and we are very much aware of South East on Track and indeed the work of Councillor Whelan on this matter.</p> <p>As the Senator indicated, rail services on this line ceased in 2010 under an agreement made between the National Transport Authority and larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  A number of improvements were made to bus services at the time to ensure continued public transport connectivity.  While the line has been closed in recent years, the port in New Ross remains open for business.  The location of the Barrow bridge on the River Barrow means that the ability to open the bridge is critical to ensuring navigational access to the port.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann continues to operate this bridge with all its unique properties as referred to by the Senator, for this purpose.  </p> <p>A maintenance arrangement is in place to allow for the line's continued maintenance since the decision to remove passenger services.  In 2019, a number of revised arrangements were agreed between the National Transport Authority, NTA, and larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann regarding the line.  These revised arrangements include: obligations to review level crossing surfaces each year; to review the boundary protection along the line each year; and to conduct bridge inspections every two years, in line with larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's technical standards.  In addition, the agreement between the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann requires that a general review of the line be undertaken on an annual basis.  The purpose of the general review is to assess the overall condition of the line to provide a current status assessment of the infrastructure each year.  As acknowledged, the Minister for Transport, in cooperation with the Northern Ireland Minister for Infrastructure, has commissioned an all-Ireland strategic rail review to help inform the development of interurban and interregional rail on the island of Ireland in the coming decades.  It will also consider the potential scope for improved rail services and infrastructure, alongside the various existing or future potential corridors of the network including disused and closed lines.  The provision of rail services on the Wexford to Waterford line is being considered in this context.  An important aspect of the review will be to consider the potential for rail freight and whether opportunities exist to increase its role.  </p> <p>It is also the case that Waterford and Rosslare ports handle different types of cargo and that influences the potential suitability of developing rail freight at each port.  As the Senator acknowledged, Waterford Port handles lift-on lift-off freight, which is suitable for rail freight, while Rosslare is principally a roll-on roll-off port, where freight is accompanied by drivers, which does not lend itself easily to rail freight. </p> <p>The Minister for Transport believes there is real potential for Ireland's ports in the area of offshore renewable energy.  That is why he published a policy statement on the matter last December which makes it clear to the offshore industry that the Government is committed to the provision of port facilities in Ireland for offshore energy developments.  In that regard, he very much welcomes the fact that Rosslare Europort has ambitious plans to develop an offshore renewable hub.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Dara Calleary:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2201"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2201&amp;amp;pid=DaraCalleary&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->At a broader level, the Minister for Transport has no doubt but that the Senator's wish is to see rail services running again on this line.  The Minister is also aware that there are those who would like to develop the route as a greenway and build on the work already undertaken or under way in the south east to create a network of attractive greenways spanning the region.  As the Senator acknowledges, however, there is nothing to stop the two projects from running together.  I will forward that view to the Minister.</p><p>The future development of the line, in whatever form it takes, will be informed by the results of the forthcoming final report of the All Island Strategic Rail Review, which I understand from my work with the western rail corridor will come relatively shortly.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position for the Senator.</p></speech>

I think we all look forward to reading the All Island Strategic Rail Review.  I think it will encourage a lot of debate about how we can more effectively use rail in this country.  I think we could see the reopening of the railway line with a parallel greenway connecting to the very successful Waterford greenway operating over the course of this decade.  I think we are now realising that the future is in rail.  There is enormous potential there because there is a rail line currently in existence and, as the Minister of State said, it is being maintained quite well by Irish Rail at present.</p> <p>We need to be ambitious.  I certainly support the extension of the western rail corridor, but we need to look at connecting all these parts of the country.  I think a real possibility now exists to reopen the south-east rail link as well to provide that link between Rosslare, Wexford and Waterford.  I hope that, coming out of the strategic rail review, the Government will consider it positively.</p></speech>

I know that Senator Cassells, in particular, is passionate about the Navan rail line.</p> <p>The Minister wishes to assure Senator Byrne that the potential of rail connectivity from Rosslare to Waterford is being fully considered as part of the strategic rail review.  As I have said previously, the review is unique in that it is being conducted on an all-island basis, in full co-operation with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive and at official level within the Department for Infrastructure.  This will provide a holistic overview of the potential of rail on an all-island basis.  The review is considering the scope for improved rail services and infrastructure alongside various existing or potential future corridors of the network, including disused and closed lines.  The provision of rail services from Wexford to Waterford, as requested by the Senator, is being considered in that context.</p> <p>It should nevertheless be noted that if a reopening of the line is endorsed by the review, reopening the lines to passenger traffic would entail a comprehensive body of work.  Initially, this would involve a detailed baseline survey to understand the requirements to bring the line back within operating safety and regulatory compliance.  While the funding requirement has not been established, some significant cost items would arise, most notably on the Barrow bridge, which would need substantial investment along with investment generally in the railway corridor, some track works, interventions at level crossings and station buildings and the rehabilitation of infrastructure which has been dormant for a long time.</p> <p>The review is considering the scope for improved rail services and infrastructure.  Rail connectivity to our international gateways, including Rosslare Europort, and the potential role of rail freight will all be considered in the context of considering the reopening of the Rosslare-Waterford line.</p></speech>

My Commencement matter relates to the back-to-work enterprise allowance, which has been dramatically reduced for persons with disabilities or disabled citizens.  I wish to put a human face on this.  The text of my Commencement matter refers to supports for people with a disability establishing businesses.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tom Clonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=TomClonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This matter is drawn from one of hundreds of representations I received since my election from people in the disabled community.  It comes from a man called Donal Coade who was a general manager for SuperValu and Tesco for 25 years.  Let us imagine what that environment was like, with fast-moving consumer goods and human resources management.  In 2011, Donal was diagnosed with a potentially fatal brain tumour.  He had a craniotomy, which is when part of the skull is removed surgically.  He had a titanium mesh inserted following the removal of the tumour.  It is such a struggle to survive in those circumstances, because life goes on when people have a disability or when they suddenly have an acquired brain injury.  People still have to pay the mortgage.  They still have to squander whatever meagre resources they have on groceries and feed the kids.  Life does not stop; it continues.</p><p>Unfortunately for Donal, the titanium mesh did not take well and he had some scarring on the brain that caused repeated seizures.  The mesh was duly removed and for a period of years he had no skull, just a covering of skin, and he had to live and cope with that.  The seizures continued and he had up to seven per week.  Eventually, a solution was achieved through the insertion of a vagus nerve stimulator, VNS.  I am telling this story to explain the challenges, obstacles and thresholds people with disabilities must survive and endure just to make it from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day.  The VNS is inserted into the chest cavity, connected to the heart and then through the voice box connects to the brain itself.  The vagus nerve is one of the largest nerves in the body.  It goes from the brain right down into the gut.  With a magnet on one of Donal's wrists they managed, after a number of years of tuning the device, to get rid of the seizures.</p><p>Then Covid hit in 2020.  What did Donal do, as person confronting considerable challenges?  He has hemiplegia and so is unable to use one side of his body because of these complications, but he decided to set up a hands-free sanitiser dispensing business.  It is extremely successful.  He used his experience of disability and so-called impairment to devise a device that can be used throughout Covid.  It is robust, self-servicing and self-contained.  The business is successful.  He became eligible for the back to work enterprise allowance but his disability allowance of &euro;208 per week was taken away from him.  According to the Cost of Disability in Ireland report, that figure is not even sufficient to meet the extra costs per household incurred simply by having a disability.  The back to work enterprise allowance is reduced by 50% after one year and 75% after two years so unfortunately Donal now finds himself in a situation where, as he cannot write and must employ somebody to scribe his business communications, he has to survive on &euro;156 a week.  The purpose of this matter is to ask the Minister of State to consider urging the Department of Social Protection not to put obstacles in the paths who have disabilities, or disabled citizens.  They are exemplars for what our citizens should be when it comes to ingenuity, endurance and resilience and we should support them every step of the way.  We are not talking about huge sums here.</p></speech>

The Senator might send me on the details so we can pursue it.  It definitely sounds like it would be worth pursuing.  I have a general response on the general query.</p> <p>The Department of Social Protection provides a wide range of employment-related supports, for all jobseekers, including people with a disability.  The back to work enterprise allowance offers support to people receiving certain social welfare payments, including disability allowance, to develop a business while retaining a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment for two years.  The payment is 100% of the person's social welfare entitlement in year 1 and 75% in year 2.  The scheme alleviates some of the risk involved with a new venture and provides an element of financial security along with business mentoring and supports.</p> <p>In addition, the enterprise support grant of up to &euro;2,500 provides financial support to back to work enterprise allowance recipients to assist with initial business start-up costs, for example to purchase business related equipment, advertising or website development costs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Dara Calleary:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2201"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2201&amp;amp;pid=DaraCalleary&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A person moving from a long-term disability payment to take up a job or self-employment can retain entitlement to free travel for a period of five years.

Where a person with a disability requires a more accessible workplace or adapted equipment, the Department offers support through the workplace equipment adaptation grant under the reasonable accommodation fund.</p><p>In circumstances where a self-employed person decides to employ an additional person from the live register on a full-time basis, they may be eligible for support under the JobsPlus scheme.  Under the scheme, an employer can receive a grant of &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 over a two-year period.  The scheme will be expanded from January 2023 to people receiving disability allowance in order that they can take up a JobsPlus-supported job.  Where a person's entitlement to the back to work enterprise allowance is exhausted and the person is operating at reduced levels of business activity, there may be alternative income supports available and the individual should engage with their local Intreo centre.  I will do so, on behalf of the Senator, in respect of Mr. Coady.</p><p>Disability allowance is structured to support recipients who wish to avail of opportunities to pursue employment.  When an individual commences employment, he or she can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week.  In addition, 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;375 are disregarded for the purpose of the means test.  Earnings above &euro;375 are assessed at 100%.  As part of budget 2023, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has increased the earnings disregard for disability allowance by &euro;25 per week from &euro;140 to &euro;165.</p><p>The partial capacity benefit scheme allows a person in receipt of invalidity pension or illness benefit to enter or return to employment or self-employment and continue to receive a partial or full payment, depending on his or her capacity for work.  There are no restrictions on the earnings the individual can generate from employment while on this scheme or on the number of hours worked.</p><p>In the wider context, local enterprise offices, LEOs, are the first-stop shop for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports for anyone, including people with disabilities, intending to start or grow a business.  LEOs can provide additional support to entrepreneurs with disabilities such as mentoring or accommodations to assist with the completion of grant application forms or training courses such as start your own business.</p><p>I thank the Senator raising this issue and for his ongoing advocacy for disability.  This is my first time to acknowledge that publicly.  If he sends me the details of his Commencement matter, I will certainly pursue them with the Minister for Social Protection.</p></speech>

I am trying to make a more general point about citizens with disabilities.  Equality does not mean treating people the same.  It means treating people differently recognising and celebrating difference.  We cannot treat disabled citizens in the same way we would treat other citizens who are able-bodied and who do not face the same obstacles.  We must recognise the deficits in the disability allowance and the current supports.  Extra supports need to be put in place.</p> <p>We have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons of Disabilities and that ratification should be used to able-proof all of our legislation and supports from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for people in the workplace.  However, we need to scaffold and support our citizens with disabilities in a radically different way than we have thus far.  I appreciate the Minister of State's comments and have utmost good faith in his goodwill with regard to these issues.</p></speech>

University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is in the headlines again today.  It is the most overcrowded hospital in the country, with over 80 people waiting for a bed.  There are approximately 670 people waiting for a hospital bed across the country but  Limerick has the highest number of such patients and is consistently in that position.</p> <p>When the CEO of UHL, Ms Collette Cowan, and her team led by Professor Lenihan, appeared before the Joint Committee on Health in September, they spoke about the proposal for an elective hospital for Limerick.  The Taoiseach admitted in the D&aacute;il that this proposal needs to be considered.  A report commissioned by UHL referred to the need for extra beds for Limerick.  It is estimated that 302 additional beds are needed in Limerick and the wider mid-west region, across six hospitals.  UHL is having to deal with a growing population and is constantly in the news.  We must think of the workforce there as well as the patients.  Those attending the hospital want to be treated in a safe and compassionate manner.  They deserve timely treatment and should not have to wait for hours to be seen or to get a hospital bed.  I want to pay tribute to the staff who work so hard.  </p> <p>I am aware that the Minister for Health was not supportive of this proposal in the past.  However, when he visited the hospital recently he gave a commitment to Ms Emer Martin, the CEO of St. John's Hospital, that he would consider its proposals.  When Deputy Harris was Minister for Health, he made a commitment to consider locating an elective hospital at St. John's Hospital in Limerick.  St. John's Hospital has 99 beds currently.  It is a nightingale hospital but there is huge potential to add on to it.  The original proposal was for 120 beds but this has been increased to 150 beds.  The proposal is for so-called replacement beds which would allow for procedures to be carried out in the hospital.  It is an old-style hospital but the proposed new extension would make an enormous difference.  There is also a proposal from University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre, UPMC, for a new hospital which means, in effect, that there are two proposals on the table.  </p> <p>An elective hospital is needed for Limerick and the mid-west.  The people of the mid-west deserve better.  The day on which the Minister for Health visited UHL was a particularly quiet one but if he was there today he would see over 80 people waiting for a bed in the hospital.  Obviously when there are so many people waiting on beds, elective surgery appointments have to be cancelled because of the overcrowding.  It is just not right that the people of the mid-west are disenfranchised in this way.  An elective hospital is badly needed.  This has been acknowledged by the Taoiseach and I understand it has been discussed at Cabinet.  Something needs to happen quickly.  The weather has been very mild up to now and we have not really had cold winter weather yet.  I dread to think what we will face in the mid-west in terms of overcrowding and people not being able to receive the attention they need at UHL.</p></speech>

The cross-party Sl&aacute;intecare report in 2017 articulated a new vision for healthcare in Ireland, including the provision of elective-only hospitals to provide protected capacity for elective care.  This policy has also been informed by a number of subsequent policy documents and Government decisions including the 2017 Sl&aacute;intecare report, the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy of 2018, the 2018 National Development Plan, the programme for Government in 2020, the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy and action plan up to 2023, as well as the new national elective ambulatory care strategy agreed by the Government in December 2021.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This new strategy aims to change the way in which day-case scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists at a national level.</p><p>The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, stand-alone elective hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin.  The elective care scope of service will be provided in two phases commencing with day cases, diagnostics and outpatients, and then by inpatient treatment.  On this basis, the elective care centres, ECCs, will be designed to provide sufficient capacity to facilitate future phases, including some elective inpatient capacity, thereby providing a sustainable and strategic response to cater for the highly dynamic landscape of healthcare policy and practice.</p><p>It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement a national elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis.  This means the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and, in doing so, will operate to meet the demands of as wide a catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas, including Limerick and the mid-west.</p><p>The locations were chosen in line with good practice, which suggests that in order to maximise economies of scale, dedicated, stand-alone elective centres should be as big as is reasonably possible to meet identified demand while providing appropriate population coverage.  Locating the new facilities in Cork, Dublin and Galway will enable the provision of a national service that aims to maximise the coverage of the ECCs as far as is reasonably possible.  A central point of introducing these new facilities is not that they will only benefit the subset of the population that sits within their direct catchment, but, rather, that the introduction of this new delivery capability into the public healthcare system will benefit the whole population, including those who do not fall within the immediate geographical catchment.  An additional elective facility in Limerick would have a minimal impact on population coverage relative to the significant increased investment to build and operate.</p><p>Nonetheless, I am conscious of the desires expressed by the Senator and I take on board her point that there are 80 people on trolleys today in Limerick.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was in Limerick the week before last and discussed this matter with local representatives and the senior management team at St. John's Hospital.  As the Senator will know, we are fully committed to the continued improvement of the elective care system in Ireland and have been impressed to see innovative care solutions developed locally, such as the Reeves day surgery unit at Tallaght University Hospital, which has succeeded in significantly reducing day surgery waiting times for patients.</p><p>As well as the strategic intervention under the national programme for elective care, the Minister will consider any similar proposal by University Limerick Hospitals Group to deliver elective day care in the shorter term.</p></speech>

I am not blaming her for that.  As the Minister stated in the report, he only met the team ten days or two weeks ago.  The issue of an elective hospital was highlighted in the report commissioned by UHL and its CEO, Professor Cowan, and Professor Lenehan reiterated that when they were before the joint committee.  It has been called for by many of the top people in the mid-west as an overall solution.</p> <p>All hospitals are overcrowded.  Elective hospitals are proposed in Dublin, Cork and Galway but that will not solve the problem in the mid-west, which has the worst overcrowding.  People are waiting for days on trolleys.  I am not exaggerating as I know somebody who waited five days recently before getting a bed.  It is totally unacceptable.  There is a need for an elective hospital in the mid-west.  I would like the Minister of State to take the message back to the Minister that he needs to listen to the people of the mid-west.  This is a very serious issue.</p> <p>I know meetings were held with the senior teams of St. John&rsquo;s Hospital and UHL.  The Minister needs to wake up and listen because the people of the mid-west deserve better.</p></speech>

I understand this development will take up to two years and I appreciate the challenges that are there, but progress is being made.</p> <p>I assure the Senator that he remains committed to the continued improvement of the elective care system in Ireland.  I have just come from the D&aacute;il where a similar question was raised about the proposed hospital to be located in Cork.  As part of this, the Minister will keep an open mind to any considered proposal brought forward as to how elective day care can be delivered in the shorter term for the Limerick area.</p></speech>

I hope to receive an update about the White Paper on the end of direct provision.  I understand there are additional pressures on the system this year.  I am aware the Department stated this week that it is accommodating more than 58,000 people who arrived in Ireland this year, including 42,000 Ukrainians and 16,000 people seeking international protection.  However, we must also acknowledge that this year marks the 22nd year of direct provision in this country, which was only meant to be a short-term solution.  It seems that bringing an end to direct provision is never a top priority for the State and it gets pushed aside when other priorities arise.</p> <p>I understand our response to Ukrainian refugees is outlined by the EU temporary protection directive, but I need to Minister to listen to me when I say this.  Many people have said to me that there is a difference in the definition of what a refugee is, but we are, unfortunately, creating a two-tier system in our country for refugees and that needs to be stated honestly.  As a member of the Traveller Community, I know exactly what it is like to be treated less than people from other backgrounds.  I believe this is what we are doing in this country and for that reason, it is important that we set and meet clear deadlines to end direct provision for international protection applicants in this country.</p> <p>I welcome Ireland's response to refugees from Ukraine.  What human rights organisations and myself are looking for is the equal treatment of refugees in this country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn :</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is the message today.  My point is about ending direct provision.  We know there are 11,689 people living in direct provision, of whom 4,000 have residency status and are ready to move out.  However, with the housing crisis it is very hard for people to find accommodation.  Last week a man came to see me.  He is looking for a one-bedroom house in Cork.  Last week we heard the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, speaking openly about people who have their papers being charged rent in direct provision centres.  I do not know where the idea came from that people who are living in this dire accommodation should be charged rent.  Obviously, I would agree that we should put responsibility for accommodation for all people with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has many things to deal with in making sure people are safe.  People who have their papers to move out of direct provision have nowhere to go.  We must look at that.  Will the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, answer the question on where we are on ending direct provision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.60" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#P00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this extremely important matter, which is close to my heart.  We emphasised this matter when we brought forward the White Paper to end direct provision in February of last year.  I will outline some of the achievements that have been made since the White Paper was published.  We created a unit within my Department to implement the White Paper.  We established some governance structures.  We brought in a programme board which included officials from other Departments, expertise from the private sphere, former residents of direct provision and people who are involved in NGOs to get their expert views and advice on how to develop the new system.  We also created an external advisory group, chaired by Dr. Catherine Day, who has been so important in the work she has done on direct provision and many other areas.</p> <p>Since then, we have been developing a community accommodation model and looking at the development of an ownership model that could be used by approved housing bodies, so that they could bid for funding to develop housing in the community for international protection applicants.  We have had a great deal of assistance from the Housing Agency on the delivery of that.  We have advanced the development of an integration programme to support the principle of integration from day one, which is central to the White Paper.  We have initiated a planning process for phase 1 reception and integration centres.  In August of this year, we launched a new integration fund, offering grants to civil society organisations for projects supporting the integration of international protection applicants.  The awards will be announced in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Senator Flynn is absolutely right when she says that the Ukraine crisis has posed a huge challenge to what we were trying to do.  Indeed, it poses a big challenge to much of what my Department is doing generally.  We have had to create a unit of 100 people in my Department, from nowhere, to respond to the needs of Ukraine.  As Senators know, some 54,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the country, of whom my Department is housing 44,000.  We are also housing 16,000 international protection applicants.  That is a huge jump on last year's number when we housed 7,500 people.  That has created huge challenges, such as the need to strip teams, including the White Paper team, many of whom have had to move over to the Ukraine response.  They were very much involved in City West.  I have prioritised the moving of people back to their original work.  I prioritised the White Paper team so that some of them are now back to focus on the White Paper.</p> <p>It is going to be very difficult to achieve the target of having everyone out of direct provision by the end of 2024 in terms of the accommodation element.  I have to be honest about that.  The landscape has changed absolutely in the context of 7,500 people last year as opposed to 60,000 people this year.</p> <p>However, the White Paper was not just about accommodation.  Accommodation is central but integration and services were also key elements of the White Paper.  I am looking to bring those forward.  In regard to accommodation, I want to increase the State-owned capacity to accommodate people in international protection so that the reception and integration centres, those initial centres where people would be able to get own-door accommodation or singles would be able to get own-room accommodation, will be prioritised.  We might build some or we may acquire some.  We may acquire some existing buildings or residential accommodation or something like that in terms of accommodation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Regarding the two other elements, HIQA will soon be inspecting direct provision centres.  It is important that this monitoring role is being on by an organisation as recognised as HIQA.  Vulnerability assessments were not being done prior to my time as Minister but they are being done now in respect of all new international protection applicants.</p><p>My Department will be funding integration officers in every local authority to assist people in international protection in engaging with services, education and training.  The community fund will be broadened out further to support NGOs and smaller scale community groups that are actively helping to integrate into the wider community international protection applicants living in their respective areas.</p></speech>

We are looking for clarity and, most important, people living in direct provision are looking for clarity.  We are discussing HIQA and integration, which are critical for people living in direct provision, but for people who have been living in direct provision centres for three to four years, or even ten years in the odd case, having a home after leaving the system and being able to participate in society is what they want.</p> <p>There are people living in direct provision centres who are now expected to pay rent.  Is there anything that the Department can do to stop this?  They should not have to pay rent for something that previous Governments came up with, namely, direct provision centres.  I would like to work with the Minister and people living in direct provision.  If we cannot end the system in 2024, when can we and what will be put in place to protect people's human rights and equality?  I was disheartened to see that &euro;2 billion was drawn down in humanitarian funds specifically for Ukrainian refugees.  While I welcome that it was for Ukrainian refugees, what about the black and brown refugees who also need humanitarian support?  We have a great deal of work to do to show people seeking international protection that we care about them.</p> <p>I appreciate the Minister's honesty and look forward to working with him and people living in direct provision centres to see when the system can be ended if it cannot be ended in 2024.</p></speech>

We will not charge them rent.  They are entitled to full social welfare if they are not working, although many of them are.  Some of them are in centres where they get free food points.  It is not particularly fair that, on top of the supports that everyone else gets, they are getting these additional supports, so we may have to regularise their situation and the situation of others compared with those who do not have status, do not get social welfare and do not get access.  There may be some degree of equalisation, but there will not be any charging of rent.</p> <p>The Senator spoke about a two-tiered system.  There was a situation last weekend that we all wanted to avoid, where some people coming to this country were not provided with immediate accommodation.  Some of them were international protection applicants and others were Ukrainian refugees.  Both were in the same situation, in that we were not able to provide everyone with accommodation.  As of lunchtime today, though, we have been able to get to all of the people we were not able to accommodate over the weekend, be they Ukrainian or international protection applicants, and offer them accommodation.  That is a small, but positive step forward.</p></speech>

This has been an ongoing issue during the last two years.  Although there have been quieter periods in that time, the problem has never been effectively addressed or stamped out.  This situation cannot be allowed to persist.</p><p>I was born and raised 400 yards from Eyre Square, so I am familiar with the area.  I spoke to residents and business owners there again in recent days.  Residents told me of being in a state of fear and anxiety, especially at night.  As Members will appreciate, businesses are already facing a challenge without people being reluctant to come to an area due to a growing reputation for hassle, antisocial behaviour, outdoor drinking and drug use, etc.  Some incidents have had life-altering consequences.  These include a young woman losing her sight in one eye.  This happened while she was waiting for a bus after a firework was directed at her.  Less than two weeks ago, on 12 October, a further incident occurred at 8:45 p.m. when a man was attacked.  He was in hospital for a long time.</p><p>Something must change.  Eyre Square is at the heart of our city.  It is opposite the train and bus stations and is often the first impression visitors and tourists get of Galway.  The city has largely been a happy and safe place to live and to visit and we cannot allow the actions of a small minority of people to alter this.  After the situation on O'Connell Street in Dublin was highlighted by the media in recent weeks, a quick response followed.  A Garda liaison office that was to open there has now been changed to a full Garda station.  Pledges have also been made to allocate greater Garda resources to the area.  </p><p>I do not like saying this, but the type of behaviour I have described has happened so often in Eyre Square that it is now a major issue in our city.  This must be prioritised.  It is not good enough for there to be one rule for Dublin city while Galway city, the capital of the west, is neglected.  We need a similar response in our city.  Eyre Square has an unused former tourism kiosk which would be an ideal location for a Garda substation.  Research has shown that Garda visibility is vital in reducing crimes.  An enhanced Garda presence in Eyre Square is essential to ensure the safety of the area.  I would be grateful if the Deputy Leader would ask the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, to join us in the House at her earliest convenience to address this vital issue for Galway city.</p></speech>

I commend the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, on signing the order in this regard.  I commend all involved in the initiative and the effort to ensure the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas receive proper and just pay.  I compliment, in particular, my own secretary, Ruth Lawlor, who was active in the pursuit of this pay claim.  I hope we can have a debate on this issue in due course.</p> <p>I primarily raise an issue pertaining to education and special education in respect of special schools.  I refer to the need for a debate on reform concerning and action on decoupling special schools from the existing provision of posts of home school liaison officers.  I hope the Minister of State with special responsibility for special education, Deputy Josepha Madigan, will come to the House so we can have a debate on the provision of home school liaison officers for special schools.  Posts of this nature are not sanctioned now for special schools in the context of existing home school liaison provision.</p> <p>It is important that consideration is given to the need to expand this type of post to special schools.  This concerns community-based education, releasing teaching posts already sanctioned in the budget and empowering special schools to enable them to have home school liaison for those students and families who require it the most.  I have met with groups of teachers from Cork who are part of the special schools provision in the city.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that the Cork special schools principals group is supported not just by words in the Seanad but by action from all of us.

I refer in particular to the need for administrative leave relating to deputy principal posts to be given to special schools.  I hope to have that debate in the context of a wider debate on education.  </p><p>I welcome the young students from Trim, County Meath whom I met in the corridor.  I assure them that the Minister, Deputy Foley, has listened to their concerns around the provisions of the junior certificate results and they will be released earlier next year.  They are a very energetic bunch of transition year students and they are very welcome.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1699" speakername="Tom Clonan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#V00300"><p>I want to raise an issue that has come to my attention through the national media and a number of representations I have received.  I was approached by a couple, Michael Rynne and his wife, Jan.  She was diagnosed with a blood cancer in 2011.  It cannot be treated, but luckily she managed to get on a drug trial outside of the jurisdiction in Leeds that saved her life.  She went from a 98% reading for cancer in her bone marrow down to approximately 1% because of a cancer drug that is not available in Ireland, even though it has been fully approved by European Medicines Agency, EMA.</p> <p>Unfortunately, people like Jan are not responding to the Covid vaccine.  She has received four vaccines.  I have the permission of the couple to disclose this information.  Jan has not developed any antibodies and as a consequence she is still shielding at home.  She cannot see her adult children, who are in their 20s, for fear of contracting Covid because in the UK and Wales &ndash; we do not have figures for Ireland &ndash; 4,300 people with blood cancer died as a consequence of contracting Covid.  If we extrapolate from those figures, given that we are a tenth of the size, we are talking about possibly 430 people.  In England and Wales, 200 people with blood cancers have died of Covid because they cannot develop antibodies.  The drug Evusheld was fully approved by the EMA in March this year, but is still not available to the 130,000 immunocompromised people in Ireland.  </p> <p>This ties in with an observation made by the Swedish Institution for Health Economics, which carried out a survey of European cancer survival rates.  It found Ireland has the lowest rate of survival for cancer throughout the European Union, in particular for ovarian and breast cancer.  These are issues that impact on women, 51% of our population.  One of the key reasons it identified in this research was that, on average, once a new cancer drug has been approved by the EMA, it takes approximately one year for those life-saving drugs to be made available across the EU to people suffering from cancer.  However, in Ireland it takes two years.  The research found that hundreds of Irish people are dying unnecessarily because of delays.  </p> <p>I would like a debate on the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics and the corporate pharmaceutical unit in the HSE to find out why they are taking two years to do what everybody else in Europe does in one using the same best practice, governance and interrogation of the data.  There is no good reason there should be such a delay and that people should suffer unnecessarily and die.</p></speech>

The agri climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, and the organic farming scheme are fantastic opportunities, but we still hear some criticism.  I suspect it comes from those who are not joining either scheme.  They say ACRES does not pay enough and the organic scheme is not the bed of roses it is made out to be but, as I speak, more farmers are joining and speaking to their advisers about joining.  I thank those who are embracing these schemes and I say to those who are opposed to them that they are voluntary schemes.  No one is forcing anyone onto them but we would love people to join them.  These schemes are there to support farmers to embark upon a different way of doing things on their farms.  It is not money for standing still or business as usual.  These schemes come with terms and conditions, as they should do given that it is taxpayers' money we are spending.  Expert advice on the schemes is available from farm advisers and planners across the country and we want people to avail of that.  Again, I thank those farmers who will apply for these schemes over the coming weeks and I say to them that they are making a good decision. They are not only making a difference to their farms, but they are also doing something really positive for Irish society as we fight the challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss and water quality decline.  The world is changing, Ireland is changing, agriculture is changing and our schemes are changing because we have a massive challenge ahead.  The challenge we must rise to is to farm in a way that repairs our broken environment, damaged ecosystems, polluted rivers and dwindling biodiversity, and to farm in a way that enriches our soil, stores our carbon, cleans our air and is kinder to our animals.  We need our food production systems to deliver on all of these things.  It can be done, but it needs everyone to work together.</p> <p>We speak proudly of our grass-based system of agriculture, and so we should, but much of this system is heavily reliant on synthetic fertilisers.  Arguably we are fertiliser-based as much as we are grass-based.  By relying so heavily on fossil fuels to push production and grow grass in this way, we put pressure on our environment and our farmers.  I know many farmers who are presently surprised by how well their grass performed with less fertiliser this year.  It was surprising to them because much of the advice has been telling them that their grass will not grow if they cut back on the use of chemical fertilisers.  The bottom line is this: the sooner we reduce our reliance on fertiliser, the sooner our land will adapt, the sooner our soil will recover and the sooner we will move towards a truly grass-based system.</p> <p>I will conclude with a plug for anyone who is interested in learning more about how they can farm with fewer inputs.  They should check out the BioFarm conference on 7 to 11 November in Carrick-on-Shannon.  In person or online, this is a must for anyone interested in embracing a different way of farming, with presenters from a whole area of regenerative and biological farming disciplines, including my own Department and  Teagasc.  The direction of travel is clear.  How quickly we move is up to us all.</p></speech>

C&uacute;pla l&aacute; thar a bheith fi&uacute;ntach a bh&iacute; i gceist.  I agree with our Leas-Chathaoirleach who has acknowledged what was a very positive British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly meeting in the great county of Cavan over the last number of days.  People will have been listening in intently, given what was happening in London as we were meeting in Cavan, and given the format in which we were meeting.  As I said at our plenary meeting in Cavan, in many ways it is immaterial who occupies 10 Downing Street.  This is certainly the case regarding the Good Friday Agreement process in the North.  It is clear from the elections in May that people there want the Executive, the Assembly and the Good Friday Agreement institutions to be re-established and to work for the betterment of workers, families and citizens across our society.  I hope, therefore, that there will be a renewed focus on precisely this aspect.  I refer to adhering to the will of the people as expressed in May and also to ensuring the Good Friday Agreement is implemented fully.</p> <p>I also acknowledge an important announcement today from the BBC in the North and RT&Eacute; around expanded GAA coverage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I also acknowledge an important announcement today by both the BBC in the North and RT&Eacute; about expanded GAA coverage.  This is an issue on which I and my colleagues, Sin&eacute;ad Ennis, MLA, and our First Minister designate, Michelle O'Neill, have engaged with the BBC for some considerable time.  It is clear from the announcement that the BBC and RT&Eacute; have listened not only to us but to the thousands of licence fee-paying Gaels across the Six Counties who, understandably and for obvious reasons, expected a greater level of coverage that reflected the interest and participation in Gaelic games.  The announcement states that the BBC, as well as upping its championship and league coverage, will show the all-Ireland semi-finals and finals in both football and hurling.  I think I am right in saying the BBC has never broadcast a live hurling game, so it is significant in and of itself that the semi-finals and finals would be broadcast live.  The same goes for RT&Eacute;.</p><p>The point I wish to make in welcoming this is that we should err just a wee bit on the side of caution.  The Deputy Leader will know that for some time in this House I have been raising the very frustrating issue of geo-blocking, whereby satellite providers have blocked certain games if there are competing rights issues.  These are platforms like Sky and Virgin for those of us in the North.  Equally, however, for people in the South who want to watch matches that will now be broadcast on the BBC, the GAA needs to ensure that its games are freely available and accessible to all audiences, all viewers and all listeners right across the totality of the island, particularly when those games are broadcast by public service broadcasters.</p><p>I welcome the announcement, however.  It is a positive step forward that will be welcomed and no doubt enjoyed by Gaels across the country and beyond.</p></speech>

I was on a study trip with the all-party group on workplace equality, supported by WorkEqual and Alice PR.  We were travelling around, visiting people and talking to them about how Iceland became the world's most gender-equal country.  We met with trade unions, advocacy groups, MPs and councillors.  Even the Prime Minister managed to find time to meet with us.  From the research on our trip, it became incredibly clear that there are two big levers as to how Iceland has achieved gender equality.  One is sustainable, affordable childcare.  Childcare in Iceland is part of the country's education system.  It is not seen as a separate, stand-alone system.  The second lever is mandatory shared parental leave, which we do not have, of six months for each parent, six weeks of which is transferable between parents.  We thought, "Wow, that is pretty bold and pretty brave."  Only when the leave was made mandatory did both parents start taking it.  Then a shift was seen in how gender equality was playing out in the workplace.</p> <p>Obviously, all is not yet perfect in Iceland.  There are challenges along the way around public discourse, there are gender-segregated workforces and there is still an issue with the bridging of the gap between the end of parental leave and the start of day care.  However, Iceland is far ahead of where we are going in respect of ending the gender pay gap, gender equality in the workplace, gender equality in the home and work-life balance.</p> <p>We also met with the deputy mayor of Reykjav&iacute;k and heard how local government is empowered and funded.  The Government provides the day care, or what we would call childcare.  The focus is on the right of the child to be educated.  Childcare is not seen as a solution to allow parents to work.  Also, I am sure many Senators would be interested to know that in Iceland 30% of people's taxes go straight into local government.  Can the House imagine the prospect of 30% of our taxes going straight into local government?  Local government in Iceland oversees the provision of school classes, day care, childcare, road planning - all those areas.  We could definitely learn a lot from Iceland, not only in respect of gender equality but also in how we deal with, fund and empower local government, leaving national government to deal with the bigger, broader picture stuff.</p> <p>A key idea I picked up was, as I have mentioned, that childcare, day care and parental leave are rights of the child.  They are not a means of allowing the parents to go and work or to do whatever it is they want to do.  This is about the right of children to get to spend time with both parents and to have childcare as part of their education.  When we in Ireland talk about childcare and parental leave, we just do not look at it through that lens.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are instead looking at it through the lens of how we can get parents into the workforce, or whatever it is, and it is not about the right of the child.  WorkEqual is now gathering hard data around this.  I am sure the all-party group will be reporting back on that and there are some really interesting aspects there.  Icelanders are incredibly happy with it.  Every person we spoke to talked about the two big levers, namely, mandatory parental leave and childcare being part of the education system.  We need to consider how we are thinking about those two things.  Brave decisions would have to be taken if we were to go down that route but we are up for the challenge.</p></speech>

I am proud we have been able to accommodate 60-odd thousand displaced Ukrainians.  However, I have been disappointed by some recent negative comments about Ireland's attempts to accommodate Ukrainians seeking refuge.  I was surprised some saw fit to criticise the State in the mainstream media in terms of all we have been doing.  Like many here, I am at the coalface of it.  Indeed, Senator Dooley even went as far as the front line in Ukraine to witness at first hand what has been happening there.  We have been very accommodating in the State, we will continue to be and I would appreciate a fair, just and balanced discussion on it when it comes up.</p></speech>

These people were imprisoned not because they had committed crimes but because they had somehow opposed or offended Lukashenko's regime.  I adopted a man called Maksim Pauliuschynk who was sentenced to two and a half years for what I believe the Belarussian code terms "hooliganism".  Essentially, he protested against the results of the so-called presidential election, which were widely discredited.  I am happy to say he was released in May, although it did not come through any great insight the Belarussian authorities had into how wrong they were but because he had served the sentence he was given.  Today I have adopted a new individual, a man called Uladzimir Niapomniashchykh.  He is a 70-year-old man imprisoned for two and a half years in December 2020 for insulting an official.  That is the level we are dealing with.  It does not take much to be sent to prison in Belarus.  It does not take much to offend the regime and be thrown behind bars in a very difficult situation.  It is not the case that prison is enjoyable in any jurisdiction but there is a particularly harsh regime in Belarus and it is in reality being used as a tool of Lukashenko's shame regime.  I encourage Members who have not yet done so to adopt political prisoners through the Libereco programme to ensure they put on record their opposition to Lukashenko and the dictatorship and autocracy he maintains in Belarus and to send a clear message Ireland does not stand in any way with the regime running Belarus, but against it and in opposition to what is happening there.</p></speech>

The Deputy Leader and Senator Crowe were in Tuam on Saturday for a very well-attended meeting.  A number of Senators, county councillors and public representatives from the west were present.  There was a strong case for the full roll-out of the western railway corridor for both freight and passenger transport.  It made sense and there was strong, co-ordinated, cross-party support for the initiative.</p> <p>Last night at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, we talked again about regional development.  I talked to people about it in the context of Scotland and Wales.  It is a very big issue.  Today, as I was coming back from Cavan - the beautiful Cavan as the Leas-Chathaoirleach outlined to us - I was thinking about how important regional development is.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Visiting the major town centres outside of Dublin, we suddenly realise how Dublin-centric we are in our spatial planning and how we need to reinvigorate what were once thriving communities and rural towns.

In the context of the all-island strategic rail review, which is due to be published imminently, a full debate in this House would be welcome.  I will also talk about regional development but first, I will speak about the question of the regional uplift for film, television and animation production.  This applies to any production that occurs outside Dublin and Wicklow.  It has helped the development of content creation in the regions, allowed those who are working in this sector to hone their craft and encouraged producers to move outside the greater capital area in order for filming and content creation to take place.</p> <p>While the regional film uplift was only introduced a number of years ago, it was starting to gather momentum before Covid interfered to a certain extent.  There are no guarantees the regional uplift will continue.  While the Government extended section 481 relief and the film tax incentive in the budget, which was very welcome, no statements were made on the regional uplift.  If we are to see greater levels of film and television production, as well as animation creation, outside of the greater Dublin area, the regional uplift needs to be continued.  Its continuation has been sought by Screen Ireland, Screen Producers Ireland, the Writers Guild and all of those operating in the industry.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to write to the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, to ask if it is the Government's intention to continue with this very worthwhile initiative and that have a broader debate on film, television and animation production in Ireland.</p></speech>

We have Troy Studios, Odyssey Studios and Film in Limerick.  The regional uplift is due to be phased out by the end of December.  I support the call by Senator Malcolm Byrne.  I have already written to the Minister of Finance about this and I hope something might come forward or be introduced in the Finance Bill.  The regional uplift has led to employment in the area.  Irish film companies and others from the USA and other regions have come to the area and provided jobs.  It has also given local employment because a local painter will be brought in to paint a studio and the Limerick School of Art and Design, for example, has been involved in costume design.  The uplift has a considerable knock-on effect.</p> <p>I will also welcome the fact that Pathfinder has started at University Hospital Limerick and congratulate the staff involved.  Pathfinder is a service provided to people aged over 65.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When a person rings 999 or 112, a senior team, including a paramedic, a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist goes out to that person.  In most cases, the team is able to treat the person in his or her own home.  This saves people, particularly vulnerable older people, from having to go to overcrowded accident and emergency departments and is a very welcome addition to our health services.  It started as a pilot scheme in Dublin and has now been rolled out in Limerick and Waterford as well, which is very welcome.</p><p>I welcome the fact that Limerick has been included in the night-time economy scheme announced today by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.  At one time there were more than 500 nightclubs in Ireland but now there are only 80.  There has been a huge reduction and the hospitality industry needs this welcome boost.</p></speech>

Colleagues may be aware that today a new record has been broken.  Nationally, we have 669 people on trolleys, including 28 children, without a hospital bed.  Given that this is 25 October, God knows where we will be in another month or in December.  As usual, UHL tops the list, with 80 patients on trolleys today.  There were 86 patients on trolleys there yesterday.  The hospital has apologised as usual and has advised people not to attend there if at all possible.  I do not know how people are supposed to react to that.  Frankly, people are afraid to go to the emergency department anyway.</p> <p>I want to quote from a letter written by a doctor in UHL to a senior consultant, in which he explained how on one night in UHL, 20 patients had been at the hospital for 16 hour without having blood taken, any monitoring of their vital signs, or being given essential medications or fluids.  He said that staff at the hospital were "grossly overwhelmed" and were using "extremely dangerous practices".  He said that triage nurses were being inundated.  &ldquo;We had no idea what was in that box [patient list], nor did we know what was missed over the course of the night ... This thought follows me home and I can only hope that this mess has not led directly to the deterioration or death of a patient.&rdquo;  Patient's lives are most certainly at risk.</p> <p>For 12 years, the crisis in our hospitals has gotten worse and worse under both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  I cannot count the number of times I have asked for fundamental change at UHL and yet it continues to be ignored.  Now we are facing into another stark winter.  We have been told that additional beds will be provided in 18 months' time but even after those beds come on stream, according to the manager of UHL, the hospital will still be 87 beds short.  This is a failure of planning and of staff retention and recruitment.  I have been told that there is now a crisis in University Maternity Hospital Limerick too.  We do not have enough midwives and mothers are being sent home early.  That is how bad it is there.  How long more will this crisis have to go on before we have fundamental change?  I am asking for an urgent debate because the people of Limerick should not have to put up with this for one day longer.</p></speech>

Forestry and the continued planting of trees is really important to our economy from a couple of perspectives.  First, there is a shortage of timber in Europe for construction and Ireland could benefit handsomely into the future if an appropriate level of planting is done to meet the needs of the next generation.  In addition to that, the planting of forestry has a really positive impact on the environment, in that it removes carbon from the atmosphere and continues to do so over its life cycle.</p> <p>I have met foresters in recent weeks, as have others in this House.  They are really concerned about the lack of an initiative from Government in terms of what will be ready for planting next year.  State intervention and incentives are required and there is real concern that there is no plan in place to allow foresters to plan for next year's forestry planting.  I would like to see that resolved without delay.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The next aspect of that is those who want to plant forestry and cut their timber have to go through a licensing process, which takes forever.  There are people waiting two, three and four years to get licenses and permissions.  We have to find a simpler way.  </p><p>When trees and cash crops are planted, such as Sitka spruce or whatever it is, they are planted with the expectation that they will be harvested when they are ready, within 25 to 30 years.  Why do we have to have a whole series of licensing at every step?  Can we accept that if somebody is given a licence to plant a wood with the ultimate purpose of cutting it, there should not be a need to go back progressively to get more permissions to put a road into it in order to take the timber out or have another licence to fell or replant?  If it is to be planted, let there be a one-stop shop and one permission to get it done.  Put it all in at the beginning, even if it takes a little bit of time then.  There should not be this elongated process that goes on for a decade.  I would like to see that as soon as possible and have a solid debate here on that issue.</p></speech>

This is something that has concerned me for some time.  For example, I put in a freedom of information request recently and I sought information regarding the tender for consultancy for the Department of Transport in the area of search and rescue &ndash; the Irish Coast Guard contract.  I asked for the results of the tender and the names and qualifications of the committee that assessed it.  One might ask why I would want the names and qualifications.  It is a well-established fact in this House that there is no aviation expertise in the Department of Transport.  So who advised on the five tenders that were submitted as to which one would be the ideal one for the Department?</p><p>It is simply not good enough that the Department hides behind such things as the need to preserve confidentiality with regard to the subject matter, circumstances and communications with the following reasons: the release of records would impair future decisions; premature release could contaminate the decisions-making process; and premature release of records would impair the integrity and viability of the decision making.  The decision was made, so what is the problem with telling us who helped to make it?  </p><p>This is constantly happening in this House.  We are all here to ensure that our taxpayers, including ourselves, get the best value for money.  When people start hiding behind GDPR, other pieces of commercial sensitivity and nonsense such as that, they are stopping us from doing our job.  Unless we stand up and put a stop to this, it will get to the stage where we will be just merely filling the furniture in this House and the Lower House.  It has to stop.  It behoves all of us to get behind this and put an end to it once and for all.</p></speech>

I have raised this a number of times here in the Seanad on the Order of Business but also through Commencement matters.  It was a crisis for our GP network.  I am so grateful that the Department of Health and the Minister are looking, seeing and supporting GPs in our region.</p> <p>It has been a long haul for those GPs.  They have been working excess hours and it has been a long time since they have had any type of support.  This support for out-of-hours services potentially could be for expansion of the Westdoc scheme into the east Galway area to the Ballinasloe and the south-east Galway side.  It is important that we see this is an ongoing support and it will continue in future budgets.  From what I understand, this is coming out of our main budget, which is fantastic news.  It is absolutely vital support and it means that GPs in our rural areas will be supported into the future.</p></speech>

I welcome the new north Kerry greenway, which will be opened by the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, on Friday.  It is something we in north Kerry are particularly pleased with.  I want to acknowledge that and pay tribute to the many people who made this a reality, including the local councillors, particularly Councillor Jimmy Maloney from Listowel whose project it was from the beginning, in conjunction with the local authority and the roads agencies and everyone else involved.</p> <p>Having walked the greenway prior to its opening, it is only now that we realise how important it was that local landowners and farmers were on side with this project and the effect it could have on them.  All the local group of landowners wanted was that the greenway would be delivered to the highest standards.  They achieved this under the leadership of a former Fine Gael councillor, a neighbour of mine, Denis Keane Stack, who the Leas-Chathaoirleach will know very well.  They played their part.  All they wanted was the highest standards, for which future generations of Listowel people and north-Kerry people will thank them.</p></speech>

I read about the issues in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>pertaining to our aim of reaching the target of 500,000 houses.  Where are we with those targets?  It is an interesting debate.  Perhaps we need to look at where the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is in this debate.</p><p>From my point of view and that of the people I meet in my clinics, there is a complete breakdown in communication.  People do not know how the one-stop shop works, how active it is or how to engage with it.  There is also a need for a debate on whether we need to have that kind of one-stop shop for small projects, such as windows and doors.  For the elderly population that want to apply for a grant, the one-stop shop is very daunting for them.</p><p>It is time we had a real debate in this House about what the next step forward will be.  The figure of 500,000 units is significant, and if we want to achieve that target, we must have complete buy-in from Departments and the public.  I think we have lost that communication battle.  In the past few weeks, I have seen the number of people coming into my clinic asking about how we can engage and deal with the one-stop shop.</p><p>There is a need for a real debate on this so we can get the communication issue sorted.  On whether the one-stop-shop model has been effective, I think a review is required as well as a review of the target of 500,000 units.  That is a significant figure.  Is it achievable at present?  We have to be honest and say that it probably is not.  If it is not achievable, we need to put a plan in place to make sure it will be achievable.</p></speech>

I draw the House's attention to a public transport safety survey that my colleagues and I conducted over the summer months, to which we had more than 1,300 respondents, largely from across the Dublin area.  Of those who responded, 93% had witnessed antisocial behaviour on public transportation; 36% were victims of antisocial behaviour; 63% said they did not report the antisocial behaviour; and almost 80% favoured our proposal, which is to have a dedicated Garda unit on public transportation.</p> <p>We need a debate on antisocial behaviour and public safety.

It is important to recognise that although it is a difficult situation for people who come into this country, 52,000 have come from Ukraine and they have been housed and protected through a range of measures.  The support that the Irish people have given in opening their homes to Ukrainian citizens for an indefinite period needs to be recognised.  There are challenges, which will be greater over the next couple of months.  Those challenges are no different here than in other countries.  The Czech Republic is only double the size of Ireland and has taken in 400,000 people.  Warsaw, the capital of Poland, has increased its population by 25% in six months.  It is not as though they have all the houses to be able to accommodate everyone.  The people who are fleeing Ukraine are not looking for protection.  What they are looking for is safety and education for their children.</p> <p>The Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland has my full support and I admire her hugely but I was deeply disappointed by her comments at the weekend when she said that the people of Ukraine were not warned about the housing situation in Ireland.  That is just not the case.  The ambassador has been told that the housing situation is a real challenge in Ireland for Ukrainians coming.  The four Ukrainians Members of Parliament who spoke in this Chamber, which has played a key role in building relationships between both parliaments, knew that the two serious challenges that we in this country have regarding Ukrainians were housing and childcare.  That is why those MPs left this country, went to the UK and put huge pressure on Michael Gove who was Minister at the time, to open up the UK's borders more to relieve some of the pressures that Ireland was under.  The ambassador has my support always but in this aspect her comments were not factually true and were unhelpful in many ways.  It is important that we a debate here, especially on the modular units.  Seven modular units are meant to be up and ready.  One is in Thurles, County Tipperary.  We were informed of that approximately six weeks ago.  We have heard nothing about it since.  The people in Thurles and in County Tipperary would like to support that modular unit going up but it needs to be done quickly.  The engagement with the public in Thurles needs to happen as well.  Can we have a debate here as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>

Throughout the country families, through no fault of their own, are living in apartments and houses that are unsafe.  They are living the real-life effects of the light-touch regulation that successive Governments presided over.  Recently I met with residents in Hunters Wood who have had to have their balconies removed because they are defective and unsafe to stand on.  They are at their wits&rsquo; end and do not know how they are going to be able to fund the works.  Likewise residents in Park West have been in touch outlining how they are being asked for &euro;15,000 per year for three years and then a further &euro;8,000 in the fourth year.  How on earth are families expected to find more than &euro;15,000 while paying their mortgages and struggling with a cost-of-living crisis?  They are being told that if they do not put up the money they will not get the fire safety certificate and they could be moved out of their apartments.</p> <p>Families need clarity on the redress scheme.  They need to know it will be 100% redress and that it will be retrospective for those homeowners who have paid thousands of euro just so that they can remain in their homes.  Families need to know that there will be interim measures for those living in unsafe buildings.  We are all realists and know it is not going to be possible because, unfortunately, we are dealing with hundreds of thousands of defective homes.  That is again down to the light-touch regulation and not any fault of the homeowners.  It will not be possible for all of them to be dealt with and processed immediately and, therefore, what they need are interim measures so that those living in the most unsafe buildings will not be made homeless.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What they need to hear is that, as a bare minimum, fire wardens will be employed so that they can remain living in those buildings.

In my home town, we will eventually have no taxi service if things keep going as they are currently.  When a person has a taxi, the plate dies with that person if he or she retires or passes away.  The plate cannot be handed over to a son, daughter or other family member and it cannot be sold on or given to anybody.  We must remember that those taxi people have built up a business and have built up goodwill.  They have the proper vehicles, some of which are wheelchair accessible, but they can do nothing with them other than sell them and close the business down.</p> <p>In our town, we have a day service but we do not have a night service.  The proposed new licensing laws will extend opening times into all hours of the morning but we will have no taxi service to bring people home from the hostelries.  There are lots of things wrong with taxi plates and the regulation of taxis.  If one gets a new licence, one's vehicle has to be wheelchair accessible but it is not necessary for every taxi to be wheelchair accessible.  If taxi drivers buy a new electric vehicle, they can get a grant of &euro;20,000.  However, the outlay could be &euro;60,000 and they have to scrap their old car which might only be six or seven years old.  These days second-hand cars are worth a considerable amount of money but the old vehicle has to be scrapped, which is ridiculous.  I ask that a debate be arranged on this issue at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

It was a case involving a taxi driver who was not able to pass on the business and it is a very serious matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#EE00400"><p>I concur with the comments and second the proposal from Senator Burke regarding taxis.  The exact same problem exists in my own area in a number of towns, where a parent is not able to transfer the business to a son who is willing to run the business and where there is a shortage of taxis.  The vehicles are wheelchair accessible but they cannot transfer the licence.  As Senator Burke said, there is a proposal for longer opening hours in public houses.  I have my own opinions on that and do not fully agree with it but regardless of that, we need to have a taxi service.</p> <p>Senator O'Sullivan mentioned the greenways, which are a fantastic addition to our countryside.  There are more and more people out walking and cycling on them but it has been brought to my attention that lots of people, particularly children, do not wear helmets.  It is not mandatory to wear a helmet but that may need to change.  We will be dealing with legislation with regard to e-scooters and so on and we should consider making it mandatory for children and adults to wear a helmet when on a bike for their own safety.  It is worth considering and if children start wearing them when they are young, they will continue to do so later in life.   </p> <p>I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Edgeworthstown enterprise hub in Longford, co:worx, which was nominated for an EU award.  Approximately 800 projects from across the EU were shortlisted down to 20 and co:worx is one of the 20 projects on the shortlist.  The project started with a voluntary group in Edgeworthstown approaching me and the local authority.  We worked with the local authority to purchase the former Ulster Bank building that was for sale in the town.  The project received funding from Government, including from the town and village renewal scheme, enterprise funding and LEADER funding, which was used to turn the building into a working hub that is the envy of many around the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It shows that with collaboration between the community, the local authority and the Government, we can develop a project like that.  I pay tribute to the voluntary committee in the local area that has seen this from the start through to fruition, and has now seen it actually nominated.  I hope it is successful.  I congratulate the committee and the local authority that supported it along the way.</p></speech>

I agree with his remarks in that regard.  A debate has been scheduled with the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on public order and safe streets for Wednesday, 23 November.  I note that Senator Fitzpatrick requested a similar debate on antisocial behaviour.  We will have that with the Minister in the latter part of November, which is great.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on special education, particularly home school liaison officers, with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  That request has been sent to the Minister of State.  He also welcomed the pay increases for staff of the Oireachtas, which we all welcome.  I know that a number of secretarial assistants in this House worked very hard on that campaign over a number of years to get not just the pay increase but also a change in their title and acknowledgement of the actual work they do.  The change in role and duties is important as well.</p> <p>Senator Clonan spoke about cancer care and particular drugs available in other jurisdictions that are not available here.  He requested a debate on the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  I suggest that a Commencement matter might be more appropriate, to start off with, regarding the specific question of why it takes two years here as opposed to one year somewhere else.  He might see how that one goes.  We can look for a further more in-depth debate if that is not successful.  </p> <p>Senator Hackett spoke about two new schemes that have been launched by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine along with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue: the agri climate rural environment scheme and the organic farming scheme.  She made the point that while some people are being negative about these schemes, from her perspective they reflect the way things are going.  It is just about how quickly we get there, not if we get there.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke about the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly gathering in Cavan and commended all Members who were involved in what looks like a successful event.  He also made comments in regard to the Northern Ireland protocol in the context of what is happening in the UK and the change of Prime Minister.  We will be watching closely to see what happens in that space.  He also welcomed the fact that the BBC will now provide coverage of certain GAA championship games.  That is welcome.</p> <p>Senator Hoey spoke about her recent visit to Iceland with the WorkEqual group.  It was interesting to hear that they look at it from the perspective of the right of the child as opposed to getting a parent back to work.  I am not sure we have got the balance right in this country in many respects because it is difficult to be a parent and to work.  Parents are going back to work sooner than they would like.  The current approach does not work for families.  It puts a lot of pressure on families, marriages, relationships and children.  Households are very stressed.  While I am not sure about the mandatory aspects of it, the question of more leave for parents merits discussion.  At the outset, providing or offering more leave to parents would be a welcome start in that direction.  Society as a whole would benefit because children would have a less stressful environment rather than people coming and racing, day and night.</p> <p>Senator Hoey also spoke about the prospect of 30% of taxes going to local government.  She clarified that in Iceland, local government does a good deal more and has responsibility for education and other areas.  It would be interesting to debate whether we should have more devolved local government or keep things more centralised.  There are always different views on that.  I would favour more devolved government.  We have had much tinkering around with local government in recent years, some of it successful and some not so successful.</p> <p>Senator Davitt spoke about Ukrainian refugees and criticised some of the negative commentary about the State&rsquo;s response.  I agree with him.  There is no doubt that we face challenges.  Countries such as the Czech Republic were mentioned.  Countries closer to Ukraine clearly have taken in more refugees simply by virtue of their geographic location.  A country like ours, which is further away, is taking in more than many other countries per head of population.  We are a destination that Ukrainian refugees are coming to because we are hospitable, we have been welcoming and we are doing a very good job in providing a safe place to be.  We have 12,000 Ukrainian children in our schools and between 42,000 and 45,000 Ukrainians are in State accommodation.  That is a success story.  That is not a negative story; it is success.  We need to acknowledge that because there are people, particularly in the public service and the Civil Service, who have been working around the clock to put it in place.  My own local authority in Mayo meets on a weekly basis as a crisis management team to address the situation and deal with the people who are coming in every week.  For those people working on the front lines here, it is a question of the State&rsquo;s response in a wartime situation.  This is not something we could plan for.  We did not foresee it.  We have not had war in Europe since 1945.  It is worth acknowledging that all in all, we are doing a pretty good job considering what we have had to deal with.  Less of the negative commentary would be welcome.  I note that some of the commentary, such as the contention that we are housing Ukrainian refugees but cannot manage to house our own people, is divisive and dangerous.  We need to call it out when we see it because it is not a question of us versus them.  We are all in this together.  Every member state is struggling with the pressures of this and it is not going away any time soon.  It is incumbent on us as public representatives to show leadership and be responsible in our commentary.</p> <p>Senator Ward spoke about Belarus and the gentlemen he has adopted, which is his own term.  Some of those with whom the Senator is working have been imprisoned for very minor matters.  We could hardly even call them offences.  He said that the regime needs to be consistently called out for what it is.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan spoke about balanced regional development.  He referred to the West on Track regional development conference that I attended, along with Senator Crowe and others, at the weekend.  There was a big focus at the conference on the reopening of the western rail corridor, WRC.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned the all-island strategic rail review.  A debate request has been submitted in that regard.  We hope to have that debate when the report is published, which is imminent.  We will wait to see what the comments are in regard to the WRC but I agree with many colleagues that it is not a matter of if it opens, because it will open.  We are determined to get that rail line open not just for freight but for passengers as well.</p> <p>Senators Malcolm Byrne and Maria Byrne spoke about the regional uplift scheme.  It might be worth a Commencement matter at the outset to see if there are plans to extend it or replace it with something else.  However we can certainly request a full debate on that issue after the recess at the start of November.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about Pathfinder being initiated in University Hospital Limerick.  It was a pilot in Dublin, but it is now being rolled out to Limerick and Waterford.  This sounds like a fantastic scheme whereby older people are treated in their homes as well as possible which avoids those over 65 years of age having to come into hospital.  She also spoke about the nightlife economy scheme and the fact that it is being extended to Limerick.</p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke about the numbers at University Hospital Limerick.  I know there has been an ongoing problem in the hospital.  It seems that there has been more of a focus on this hospital than any other hospital in the country from elected Members across all parties.  The Minister has responded by having meetings there and setting up a task force.  Additional beds are coming in.  There are challenges in the health service, but I would caution against creating an expectation that it is fixable overnight.  Other parties have created an expectation, if they are ever in a position to deliver.</p></speech>

I agree with his comments about having one licence to plant and to fell.  Obviously if you are doing one, you are likely to do the other.  There should have been a bit more foresight in that.  I believe it is mandatory to replant if you fell, so all three should be put into one licence.  That debate is scheduled.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised a specific issue about the use of GDPR and commercial sensitivity as excuses to restrict access to information.  As he always does, the Senator raised the issue of the Irish Coast Guard contract.  I do not have a specific reply for the Senator in that regard other than to say it might be worth raising the use of GDPR, and where it is appropriate, as a specific Commencement matter.</p> <p>Senator Dolan spoke about and welcomed the funding for the out-of-hours GP service.  I commend the Senator, who has raised that issue on many occasions.  It is a welcome service for people in the locality.</p> <p>Senator O'Sullivan raised the north Kerry greenway, which is opening on Friday.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He commended Councillor Jimmy Moloney on his hard work, and all the local landowners.

It is a big task, and achieving it is commendable.  I am aware a large team of people was working on that in Kerry.</p><p>Senator Lombard asked for an update on SEAI and the retrofit programme.

The Bill aims to address issues raised by the European Commission in infringement proceedings with regard to the State&rsquo;s transposition of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA on European arrest warrants and the surrender procedures between member states.  Enactment of the Bill will ensure that Ireland will not be referred to the European Court of Justice and it will allow for the closure of the European Union infringement case.</p> <p>The Bill also makes a number of additional amendments to the existing European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 in order to ensure the continued efficient operation of the European arrest warrant system in this State.</p> <p>By way of background, any EU member state may use the European arrest warrant system to seek the return of a person who is wanted in that member state in relation to a crime.  The warrant may be used to seek the return of the person to stand trial, face sentencing after conviction, or serve a sentence already handed down by a court in that country.</p> <p>The original European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 transposed EU Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA and came into effect on 1 January 2004.  It replaced the previous extradition process between EU member states with a much faster and more simplified system that has been very successful and is regarded as vital in the fight against crime within the EU.</p> <p>The 2020 report of the Irish central authority on the operation of the European arrest warrant, published by my Department earlier this year, noted that arrest warrants received and issued during 2020 cited a wide range of offences.  Among the principal offences cited were murder; grievous bodily harm; sexual offences, including rape and sexual abuse of children; drug offences; robbery; assault; fraud; and human trafficking.  This shows the full scope of serious offences that can be subject to effective criminal law enforcement as a result of the arrest warrant system.  The State executed 91 orders for surrender in 2019, involving 79 individuals.  In addition, 47 individuals who were the subject of Irish-European arrest warrants were surrendered to the State in 2020.</p> <p>Senators may wish to note, notwithstanding the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU in early 2020, there is still a European arrest warrant regime in place as a result of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation agreement.  The UK remains the state which is the source of both the highest number of European arrest warrants received and issued by the State by far.  A total of 262 warrants were received from the UK in 2020, and a total of 105 warrants were issued by Ireland to the UK.</p> <p>I will briefly mention some of the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 4 amends section 10 of the 2003 Act setting down the general provisions on the obligation to surrender persons on foot of an arrest warrant.  The aim is to reflect, as unambiguously as possible, the requirement that a person will be arrested and surrendered by the State to the state that sent the arrest warrant, known as the issuing state, where a criminal prosecution will be or is being brought against the person concerned.</p> <p>Section 4 was drawn up in parallel with section 26(a) of the Bill, which provides for the repeal of section 21A of the 2003 Act.  Section 21A, as it stands, requires the High Court to refuse a surrender request where a decision has not been made to "charge the person with, and try him or her for" an offence.  The Commission&rsquo;s view is that section 21A currently represents an additional mandatory ground for non-execution of a warrant that is not provided for in EU law.  On legal advice, it is proposed to accept this approach and thus delete section 21A.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am advised that the State will still be able to rely on section 10 of the 2003 Act to provide a similar safeguard, as the language used has a clear legal basis in Article 1 of the framework decision, which provides that a European arrest warrant is issued with a view to the arrest and surrender &ldquo;of a requested person, for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution or executing a custodial sentence or detention order&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Section 7(a) provides that there is certainty with regard to the full release of individuals who are on bail where an arrest warrant is not produced in court on the required date.  Section 7(b) provides that any such release does not prejudice any potential rearrest and surrender and provides that a standard notice is to be added to the Schengen information system to reflect the fact that release has taken place.  The Schengen information system is the EU-wide system for security and border management which is administered in Ireland by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>Section 8 inserts a new section 14A into the 2003 Act, providing for the temporary transfer of the person who is the subject of an arrest warrant to the issuing state, under conditions agreed by the High Court and the judicial authority in the issuing state.  Subsections (4) to (6) provide for an alternative to that temporary transfer where the person who is the subject of an arrest warrant can be heard by a court in the State on the basis of a request made by the issuing state.  Senators may wish to note that my Department is currently in contact with the European Commission to confirm the exact nature of the legal changes required in this regard.  Accordingly, this section is likely to be the subject of amendment on Committee Stage.<br/><br/>The purpose of sections 9 and 10 is to align the timelines in the 2003 Act for the making of the High Court decision on the arrest warrant and the surrender of the requested person with the relevant provisions in the EU framework decision.  The effect of the changes is that there will be a need for more expeditious processing of arrest warrant cases in this jurisdiction, based on the requirements of the EU framework decision.<br/><br/>A consequential amendment is made in section 11, providing that failure to adhere to the revised timelines for processing an arrest warrant for any reason does not constitute a ground to refuse to surrender a person and does not preclude the continued detention of the person under the 2003 Act.  This reflects the case law of the European Court of Justice, which requires that the deciding court must always retain the capacity to process arrest warrant cases to finality.<br/><br/>Section 15 relates to the operation of the &ldquo;rule of specialty&rdquo; in the 2003 Act.  This rule is codified in international extradition treaties and states that an extradited person shall not be proceeded against, sentenced, detained or reextradited in the requesting state for any offence committed before surrender other than the offence for which extradition was granted.  At present, this rule may be waived by the High Court where certain criteria are met.  Section 15 provides that the High Court &quot;shall&quot;, not &ldquo;may&rdquo;, waive the rule of specialty where the criteria are met, as provided for by EU law.  The section also provides a time limit for the High Court&rsquo;s decision in this area.<br/><br/>Section 21 amends section 39 of the 2003 Act, which deals with the prohibition on surrender on foot of an arrest warrant due to the person being immune from prosecution or punishment due to any amnesty or pardon.  The amendment consolidates the existing provision into one paragraph dealing with all forms of legal amnesty or pardon.  In addition, the amendment clarifies that the State must have jurisdiction to prosecute the offence concerned if a person is not to be surrendered due to amnesty or pardon.<br/><br/>Section 24 amends section 45 of the 2003 Act, changing from mandatory to discretionary the power of the High Court to refuse to order the surrender of the person where he or she did not appear at the original proceedings in the issuing state that gave rise to the arrest warrant.  The section also provides that the High Court shall arrange for the issuing state to be informed of any request from a person for a copy of the judgment which was the basis for the arrest warrant.<br/><br/>Section 26 provides for repeals, including the proposed repeal of section 37(1)(<i>b</i>) of the 2003 Act.  At present, section 37 of the 2003 Act provides that a person shall not be surrendered if doing so would be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, would contravene any provision of the Constitution or would be otherwise discriminatory or against human rights.  It is proposed to repeal section 37(1)(<i>b</i>), deleting the reference to a contravention of the Constitution, as this is not provided for in the EU framework decision.  I am advised that this is required to align Irish law with the EU framework decision and that the remaining references will still ensure that there is no overall change in the level of human rights protection provided by this section.<br/><br/>Apart from the issue of temporary transfers under an arrest warrant, which I mentioned earlier, I wish to advise that I will be tabling a limited number of amendments to the Bill on Committee stage.  These will include amendments regarding procedural rights, such as the right to translation of documents and to be advised of the right to legal assistance.<br/><br/>I look forward to Senators&rsquo; contributions on this Bill, which will underpin a more efficient system for the European arrest warrant in Ireland, a system that is central to the fight against crime.  I am pleased to commend it to the House and look forward to continuing to work constructively with Senators.</p></speech>

As was referred to recently by Deputy Catherine Murphy in the D&aacute;il, it is not something that most of us are ever going to have to experience or deal with.  Nonetheless, some examples of where it has been used include the cases of a person involved in the Paris terrorist attacks who was caught in Belgium, an attacker of the Brussels Jewish museum who was arrested in France, a failed London bomber who was caught in Italy, a German serial killer tracked down in Spain, a suspected drug smuggler from Malta who was surrendered by the UK, and a gang of armed robbers sought by Italy whose members were arrested in six different EU countries.  Therefore, it is a very effective and useful tool in dealing with crime.  Certainly, given my perspective and that of Fianna F&aacute;il, it is no great surprise that we are supporting this legislation.</p><p>The European Commission launched EU infringement proceedings against Ireland in 2020.  It is calling on Ireland to comply with the requirements of the European arrest warrant, in particular the mandatory time limits.  In the past, we have failed to comply with the mandatory time limits to execute a European arrest warrant.  The Bill provides additional grounds for refusal of a European arrest warrant, which affects judicial cross-border co-operation on criminal matters.  It is important legislation and it is timely that the Minister of State is bringing it to us.  We need to deal with this.  We need to give the authorities across Europe every tool they need to deal with transnational crime and with people who are fleeing one jurisdiction within the EU to another.</p><p>As the Minister of State noted, the UK is still involved through the British agreement with the EU on its departure from the EU.  From our perspective, that is very important because, as the Minister of State said, the source of most European arrest warrants that we get is the UK and <i>vice versa</i>.  This makes sense as the UK is our closest neighbour and we are more likely to have interaction with our closest neighbour than with others.  It is useful for both jurisdictions that the United Kingdom is still part of the arrangement.  For all of us who want to reduce and be able to deal with crime properly, it is a very important Bill.  I commend it to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1699" speakername="Tom Clonan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#HH00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  I commend this legislation.  I have an abiding interest in transnational crime within the European space.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the primary intelligence agency within the State, although we have new emerging structures.  The discussion of this legislation prompts me to comment that we, as a House and a Legislature, need to be apprised of the development of that new intelligence entity within the Department of Justice and the Department of the Taoiseach, in particular any powers that might be assigned to the individual who heads up that new entity.  However, that is for another day.</p> <p>Most of us in this House are old enough to remember the advent of heroin with the Dunnes in Dublin.  That was the beginning of transnational crime and it is what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na referred to as &ldquo;crime ordinary&rdquo;.  Back in the day, crime ordinary was criminal activity that involved traditional housebreaking, public order offences and so on, whereas &ldquo;crime special&rdquo; referred to the activities of paramilitaries, subversives and other groups on this island.  There was a clear distinction identified within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na between crime ordinary and crime special.  However, over the years, as the drugs trade has become more and more entrenched in the Republic and throughout the island, people who would formerly have engaged in activities that were categorised as &ldquo;crime ordinary&rdquo; have come to be engaged in tactics and strategies that would be consistent with crime special.  Hence the extension of some of our legislation to cover organised crime gangs.</p> <p>There is a very blurred distinction and, in fact, there is no distinction whatsoever.  The United Nations report on international terrorism states that organised crime and terrorism go hand in hand, and that is particularly so on this island.  Paramilitaries from the loyalist community, dissident republicans and so on cross over into the activities of organised crime gangs, including drug smuggling and people smuggling, and they will mobilise nationalist and loyalist rhetoric in order to screen their criminal activities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tom Clonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=TomClonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Something they are interested in is us not having a seamless jurisdiction on this island or the type of interagency co-operation that would be supported by this legislation.  It suits them to have a hard border on the island, although that is not something that anyone is contemplating.</p><p>They remain a serious and persistent threat to the security of the State.  We have seen recent successes by the Garda and its partners in Spain and elsewhere in the arrests of senior figures in the Hutch and Kinahan extended gangs and their repatriation to Ireland.  This legislation is important.</p><p>I have been in this space since 1989.  Due to the rupture between me and the military authorities in 2000 following the publication of my research on the treatment of women within the Defence Forces, I have had to rely as a security analyst on international contacts to inform me about the defence intelligence and security situation, which I have been writing and publishing about for the past 22 years.  It is an interesting picture they paint.  It differs to a certain extent from the concerns being raised in traditional Irish media, by which I mean the mainstream print and broadcast media.  My principal concern about transnational crime, which is integrated both vertically and horizontally throughout the EU and far beyond its borders, is that the main threat to the security of this State resides in elements that are active across the island.  For example, the gang responsible for the shooting of Lyra McKee, which rightly attracted a great deal of international attention, was, according to my sources, also involved with the sourcing of a weapon that was used in the murder of a garda in County Louth.  These people operate on both sides of the Border and internationally.</p><p>Whatever happens on this island in the next ten to 15 years, we must have seamless co-operation across the jurisdictions.  We need to plan for the administration of justice, police intelligence and defence intelligence gathering on the island.  The Bill covers the European Arrest Warrant and agreements that have been agreed over the years within the EU, but we must be careful that, post Brexit, we do not lose the cohesion and close co-operation that we need with those agencies and services in the UK to ensure that we can guarantee the security of our citizens, particularly in light of what may happen on this island in the next ten to 15 years.</p><p>Ireland has not been a net contributor of intelligence for quite some time.  One could call that a part of the peace dividend from the peace process.  We are net recipients of intelligence and, therefore, we need to be careful that, as we bring forward our newly emerging intelligence structures, they are amenable to oversight by the Houses.  That will be crucial.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#JJ00200"><p>I welcome this important Bill.  It is also important that we keep up with our obligations to transpose this legislation under our partnerships with other states across the EU.</p> <p>I will comment on the Bill's structure.  As other Senators have acknowledged, it is not a Bill that is likely to be read by ordinary people on the street.  I hope that the vast majority of ordinary citizens will never have to interact with extradition procedures.  Notwithstanding that, there have been a number of amendments to the European Arrest Warrant Act 2013.  This is just another one in that sequence, and to read and understand it, one needs to have a few other Acts in one's hand.  A point I have made a number of times in the House in respect of various legislation is that consolidation is an important tool that we have.  Without the benefit of the Acts that precede this Bill, it is unreadable.  I would favour a situation in which we repealed the preceding versions and re-enacted a consolidated version.  That would be more helpful for practitioners as well as anyone else who, for whatever reason, had to interpret the legislation.</p> <p>It is necessary to recognise the importance of extradition.  Reference has been made to how effective extradition is now.  For those who are not familiar with it, the European Arrest Warrant framework that was put in place in the EU more than 20 years ago is an incredibly effective and streamlined administrative process now.  It has brought together many aspects of the criminal justice elements of member states so that it is now very easy to have someone extradited within the EU from one state to another.  That is exactly the way it should be.  For this reason, there is nowhere for criminals to hide within the EU.  It is an effective administrative tool that allows us to ensure that there are no hiding places for people who seek to evade justice.</p> <p>I believe the Minister of State mentioned that there had been 105 requests from Ireland to the UK for extradition of people from there to here.  We have sent more than 400 requests to other European countries.  It is interesting that, in the post-Brexit era, this is one of the instruments that the UK thought to be so valuable as to retain, which is why its provisions continue to exist there.  Under the Extradition Act 1965, extraditing people was clunky and difficult, so we can see how much the situation has changed and how much the European Arrest Warrant benefits us.  This is not to say that it is appropriate for Poland, which has been criticised by the Supreme Court in this regard, to seek to extradite a Polish citizen in Ireland for having a very small amount of cannabis on the street in Warsaw 15 years ago or something like that.  That is not what the European arrest warrant should be used for, yet some states are doing so.  However, when we talk about the real criminals who have committed offences against the person, drugs offences, people trafficking, murder and rape - serious-level criminal activity - it is a fantastic tool that the State can use to bring those people to justice.</p> <p>I recognise what has been said about Ireland being a net recipient of intelligence.  That is undoubtedly the case.  Of perhaps all member states, we have the most to gain from further engaging in international co-operation with our colleagues across the EU, specifically their policing organisations.  The European Arrest Warrant is a powerful tool that allows us to link into our colleagues throughout the EU.</p> <p>I will raise a number of small issues.  Some of them are semantic, but I wish to flag them at this stage because they are matters that should be considered for amendment.  Section 7 inserts in section 14 new subsections (6) and (7).  The proposed section 14(6) states: "The release of a person under subsection (5) shall not prevent his or her re-arrest and surrender if a European arrest warrant for his or her surrender is received by the Central Authority and subsequently endorsed by the High Court for execution."  My understanding is that this is a saving provision to allow the State to rearrest and reprocess a person where the High Court has not surrendered him or her because an administrative or other mistake had been made or for some other reason.  The way it is phrased suggests to me that the person could only be rearrested where the arrest warrant for surrender was received and subsequently endorsed.  I do not know if that is the intent.  My understanding of the section is that it tries to reapply an extant warrant.  Perhaps the Minister of State could re-examine the new subsection to see whether it should be amended to say that, where there is an extant warrant, there is an opportunity to re-execute it and the warrant does not necessarily fall simply because the surrender was not possible.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State also examine the proposed new section 15(6A) in section 9(l) of the Bill?  Section 15 allows a person to surrender voluntarily to the country seeking him or her.  The new subsection seems to suggest that, where the person has consented to his or her return but 40 days have passed, the court is prevented from remanding that person on bail.  I have concerns about this provision.  Maybe I have misread it and that is not the intent, but it would be a negative provision if the person could not be remanded on bail.</p> <p>I will raise a semantic issue relating to section 4(a)(i), which amends the 2003 Act by changing the terminology from a person "against whom" proceedings are to be issued to a person "who" is going to be prosecuted by a state.  I believe this should still read "whom".  We have removed the construction, but the indirect object pronoun still exists.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Again, a very semantic matter to raise but it might just be worth looking at in advance of Committee Stage.

C&eacute; go dtaca&iacute;onn Sinn F&eacute;in leis an Bhille seo, cos&uacute;il le mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir Ward, t&aacute; c&uacute;pla rud gur mhaith liom a lua ag an Ch&eacute;im seo.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  In supporting this legislation, similar to my colleague, Senator Ward, I have some observations which I will relay in due course.  As the Minister of State knows, the broad purpose of the European arrest warrant is to legally unify the EU in relation to the extradition cases and to enable free movement of judicial decisions in certain criminal matters across the European Union and to do so on a basis of mutual recognition and respect for the judicial processes of member states.  It further requires each state's judicial authority to recognise and act on requests made by the judicial authority of another.</p><p>In practice, if passed, this Bill will result in the European arrest warrant, EAW, replacing the extradition system that existed between member states previously.  The arrest warrant permits a state to request the arrest and surrender of a named person for the purpose of prosecuting or to put into a fact a custodial sentence within a specific deadline.  Extraditing citizens of one state to another raises human rights issues so it is not a matter that has been entered into lightly.  The warrant must be used properly and take into account the gravity of the offence, the sentence likely to be imposed, and whether there are other less coercive measures available.  The warrant seeks a criminal prosecution and the imprisonment of the person.  It applies in cases where an offence, punishable by imprisonment for a period of at least one year and where a custodial sentence had been passed for sentences of at least four months.</p><p>There are circumstances where a member state can refuse to act on a warrant such as if the person concerned has already been convicted for the same offence in a member state; if the offence is covered by an amnesty in the member state asked to act on the warrant; or if the person concerned is a minor who could not be held criminally responsible by the member state asked to act on that warrant.  It is unclear where the appeals court stands in relation to EAWs, if this Bill is enacted, as a suspect refusing surrender could potentially appeal the enforcement of the warrant.  We are in favour of the ability of a member state to make a judgment on the enforcement of a warrant.  We are concerned about the extradition of an individual to serve a custodial sentence of at least four months.  This seems punitive and Sinn F&eacute;in will table amendments in that regard.</p><p>We will also table amendments on the Bill's failure to allow for minor sentences to be served within the Irish prison system in this State.  This legislation may have a significant effect on the Ian Bailey case.  Mr. Bailey was convicted <i>in absentia</i>in France of murder.  However in 2003, the courts here refused the EAW request to extradite him.  While there are concerns from some civil liberties groups regarding the use of a standardised system of warrants across the EU, it is important to note that each member state can potentially refuse the warrant.</p><p>There are potential flaws in this Bill and as I have said, Sinn F&eacute;in will be tabling amendments to correct these.  Nonetheless, we will support the Bill and I hope due consideration will be given to the amendments we bring at a later stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1684" speakername="Mark Wall" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#KK00300"><p>I too welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The European Arrest Warrant (Amendment) Bill 2022 amends the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, thus ensuring as the Minister of State said, Irish law is fully consistent with the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002.  It adds timeframes for making certain decisions and makes certain actions obligatory rather than discretionary.  The changes will result in a more accurate transposition of the Council framework decision of 13 June, as required by the European Commission.  The Bill also makes other technical changes to the 2003 Act.  This follows the initiation in 2020 of the EU infringement proceedings by the European Commission against Ireland.</p> <p>The Minister of State outlined in his contribution the largely technical nature of this Bill and the fact that most of the changes being brought about are procedural and technical in nature.  As he set out, the issues within the Bill include confirmation of time limits, the ability to make decisions and for the surrender of a person on foot of arrest warrants, which seem to be reasonable and acceptable.</p> <p>The Bill, as presented, allows for greater and closer co-operation with other states involved, which is necessary and much-needed.  As other colleagues mentioned, given the growing international aspect of crime and its total disrespect of country borders, it is essential we have robust and workable mechanisms in place in every EU state so that those intent on committing serious crime can be pursued across these country borders.  We seem to be seeing a growing custom of the leaders of these crime gangs living in other jurisdictions while living off the criminal proceeds in other state.  The laws and enforcement that will allow us to apprehend such criminals must also be border-free, in the same way many of these criminals seem to be able to ignore and exploit these same state borders.</p> <p>As I have already said, the Bill is quite technical.  It deals with updating and simplifying the procedures we have surrounding the application of extradition right now.  As colleagues said, the extradition system has come a long way in this country over the last number of years and this legislation will improve the process for the betterment of our own security and that of our neighbours.  On behalf of the Labour Party, we wish to support the Bill and we look forward to the amendments to be debated as it passes through the House in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I reiterate that the changes provided for in this Bill will enable the State to effectively respond to the issues that have been presented by the European Commission in formal legal infringement proceedings against this State.  It is in our collective interests that there is consistent and effective operation of a European arrest warrant system.  This remains one of our obligations as an EU member state, a status that is very much valued by our citizens and aspired to by many other nations.</p> <p>I welcome Senator Horkan's positive comments on the Bill.  In response to a number of the other comments, I would say that the transnational element of crime is becoming more and more of concern.  Criminals are becoming more technical and more savvy and we have to move at pace with those criminals to be able to get ahead of them.  I assure the House that there is extensive co-operation with the United Kingdom.  The importance of this legislation on the European arrest warrant is reflected in the fact that, as Senator Ward pointed out, it was one of the key areas on which the United Kingdom moved to ensure its continuation.</p> <p>In response to Senator Ward, I will certainly have another look at sections 7, 15 and 4 and I note his comments.  I agree with the Senator that we have to ensure there is nowhere to hide.  In response to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, I look forward to seeing the Sinn F&eacute;in amendments and will give them due consideration.  I acknowledge the Senator's general welcome for the Bill.  I also welcome Senator Wall's general welcome for the Bill and the acknowledgement that it is largely technical.

It was agreed that amendment No. 4 would be included in the group.  They all seek to amend section 9.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Section 9 provides for the membership of the commission.  It provides that the commission will be chaired by the Chief Justice.  It provides for an equal number of lay members and judicial members, that is, four of each.  Judicial membership comprises the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal and the two nominees of the Judicial Council.  The Attorney General is a non-voting member.<br/><br/>As has been stated, the purpose of amendment No. 4 is to increase the number of Judicial Council nominees to the judicial appointments commission by one from two to three.  I cannot support amendment No. 4.  There is no particular basis for increasing the number of Judicial Council nominees by one.  While I would accept the intention is that this is read with the Senators&rsquo; separate amendment No. 6 to remove the Attorney General from the commission, amendment No. 4 would pose significant difficulty within section 12 for the process of nominating the judges in question.  To have two nominees is balanced and this is critical in the context of the requirements for a nomination: one is to be male and one is to be female; one is to be from the higher courts and one from the District Court or Circuit Court; one is to be a formerly practising barrister and one is to be formerly practising solicitor.  Membership is balanced, taking many things into consideration, including the nominee that is advanced by the council.  I cannot support this amendment.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 6 would remove paragraph (d) of section 9.  This would delete membership of the commission of the Attorney General.  Amendment No. 11 would presumably in a consequential way delete subsection (3), which provides for the status of the Attorney General on the commission.  Separately, amendments Nos. 12 and 13 would restrict the Attorney General's role on the commission to particular functions or appointments.<br/><br/>The concern the Senators appear to have is not shared by me.  In respect of this group of amendments, I would say that the Attorney General will sit on the commission in an <i>ex officio</i>, non-voting capacity.  I would point out that the Attorney General is a constitutional officeholder who has a particular role in upholding the independence of the Judiciary.  He or she does not represent the Government on the new commission.  The Attorney General is independent of the Government and this position has been recognised and confirmed in the decisions of the Irish courts.  The Attorney General also has a role in upholding the Constitution, including a duty to ensure the independence of the Judiciary.  In that context, there is no reasonable basis, in my view, for removing the Attorney General from this process or, indeed, any part of it as some of the later amendments propose.<br/><br/>The Bill in all its elements, including in particular those relating to the composition of the commission, was drafted on the basis of careful legal consideration of the relevant committee, the Minister&rsquo;s recommendations and the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of the Constitution.  This is the case notably in its inclusion of a substantial number of judges and an equal number of laypersons, along with the Attorney General.  This approach will serve to strongly underpin the independence of the Judiciary.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 11 would also have the effect of amending section 9 by removing the voting provision relating to the Attorney General.  Several Senators subscribed to this for different reasons, as they have explained.  The provisions of the Bill have been very carefully designed to provide a balance of membership on the commission between judicial members and lay members.  The role of the Attorney General on the commission will be an extremely important one and, of course, the Attorney General has been a member of the advisory body, JAAB, since its inception.  I would be concerned about putting, and it may be invidious to put, the Attorney General in a position whereby his or her vote might be a casting vote.  That could be the effect of these amendments.  This would, of course, happen in circumstances where there was an equivalence of votes between the judicial and lay members.  I believe the commission will be a consensus-based body and I indicated as much on Second Stage.  I would not wish to speculate on precisely how the commission will operate its procedures as that is a matter for the commission to regulate.  However, I am not in a position to put the lay members of the commission in a minority position by providing for five votes against the judicial members and the Attorney General.  This would change the nature of the Bill substantially and I am not prepared to provide for that.  On that basis, I cannot support the amendment.<br/><br/>Let me address amendments Nos. 12 and 13.  The approach of Senators Higgins and Ruane is perhaps innovative but, nonetheless, in paring back the involvement of the Attorney General, the amendments are still unacceptable.  Amendment No. 12 prohibits the Attorney General&rsquo;s involvement in the appointment of judges to any court in the State and amendment No. 13 prohibits his or her involvement in appointments to the superior courts.  The former amendment would allow for his or her involvement in nominations to courts outside the State and the other functions of the commission under Part 5.  The latter amendment would allow for that and for a remit in respect of appointments only to the Circuit Court and District Court.  I cannot support these amendments.  I agree with what would appear to be the understanding here, which is that the Attorney General is eminently suitable to have a function in regard to Part 5 matters and the development of selection statements.  The thinking would seem to extend to his or her suitability to have a function in regard to nominations to the European Court of Justice and other courts outside the State.  I agree.  It extends in amendment No. 13 to his or her suitability for the function of the commission's recommendation of persons for appointment to the District and Circuit Courts.  I agree.  For all of the roles that the amendments appear to envisage the Attorney General being suitable to discharge, I would simply add that of selection and recommendation, as a non-voting member of the commission, of judges for appointments to the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.  This is where the understanding and knowledge of the Attorney General will apply just as suitably as to all other court positions and commission powers.  This is what the Bill provides for.  Therefore, I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#LL00200"><p>The question is not the suitability of the Attorney General as part of the process.  The question is where he or she fits in the process and that danger and concern of him or her being involved twice in the process, as we heard in the debate.  There is a role for the Attorney General in the second part of the process where nominations have been suggested but not made, with the names of nominees having been put to the Government.  The Attorney General has that role in advising the Government and will, of course, exercise that role.  The concern is not about the suitability of any individual Attorney General.  It is that there are two parts of a process and, effectively, there is an actor who is acting in both parts of that process.  That is the nub of the concern.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for recognising the innovation of some of the amendments.  In particular in regard to some of the very senior roles around the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Court of Appeal, it would seem that while there may be a role for the Attorney General in advising between three candidates that have been put forward, there is a concern if he or she is taking part in the recommendation or search for candidates at the early part as well.  It also creates a dynamic where there is an actor within the first process, then a formal process of recommendation and then another process that comes out of it, so somebody has full access to what is meant to be an independent process but is then not necessarily accountable in terms of how he or she represents what has happened in the process going forward.  It is almost that there are two representatives coming out of the judicial appointments commission in that there are the recommendations from the judicial appointments commission and then one of the actors within the judicial appointments commission indirectly and privately goes and gives advice to the Government in that respect.</p> <p>The concern is when we look to the process in the round, not just at the judicial appointments commission but the wider process.  That is why I regret the Minister of State is not able to accept the amendments, although I will press them.</p></speech>

As our amendment suggests, we are looking for a member to be nominated by the IHREC to be appointed by the Minister.  We ask that the amendment be accepted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#MM01300"><p>Senator Currie and I tabled an amendment, No. 9, which is on the same lines as this.  As my colleague has outlined, in the original iteration of the legislation, there was a provision to allow the IHREC, an important State body with important functions, to be involved in the decisions of the commission about who would be proposed to Government for appointment.  It was originally included specifically as nominating a member of the commission.  In this iteration of the Bill, that has been amended so that there are now four lay members.  It is possible that one of those lay members might also be a member of IHREC.  We are trying not to leave that up to chance and for the Minister to decide that he or she may, when appointing people to the commission, appoint a person from IHREC.</p> <p>The other difficulty that arises is that the legislation provides for the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to make recommendations to the Minister.  He or she is quite hamstrung about how he or she can approach the recommendations of the PAS with regard to who might be appointed to the commission.  The danger is that somebody from IHREC, for whatever reason, might not come through that process.  I have a great difficulty with this process.  It is the subject of other amendments that I have tabled.  I cast no aspersions on the PAS as a body because it has a particular function that it carries out in a particular way, but that particular way does not necessarily suit everybody who might be coming through that process or who might apply.  The reality is that the PAS must have measurable targets in its system to assess the suitability or otherwise of a candidate.  It ignores the fact that not everybody will fit into the metric provided for by those Civil Service systems.  I would much rather see the Minister having much greater flexibility and autonomy with regard to who he or she appoints to the commission than is provided for in this legislation.</p> <p>That all amounts to the fact that it is harder and harder for a member of IHREC to get onto the judicial appointments commission and, therefore, have a bearing on who is recommended to the Government for a judicial appointment.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission correctly perceives that it has a role to play here.  The judicial appointments commission would benefit from its expertise.  I have tabled other amendments about reordering the criteria that would apply for appointment to the commission, for example.  What is most important is that we have an opportunity in this legislation to say that it should have the right to be part of the commission and to have its say.  It will not necessarily be determinative because, at the end of the day, one member out of nine will not necessarily hold sway, but having somebody from IHREC who has perspective on human rights issues to have his or her say is tremendously important.  I am concerned about the way that section 9, which provides for the membership of the commission, is phrased.  It does not mean that there will necessarily be any consideration for those issues.</p> <p>Section 13(4) has other definitions for how it would decide or what criteria would be applied.  Experience in business, finance, public service, corporate governance and human resources appear to be foremost among the criteria, which, to my mind, have little to do with the assessment of skills, criteria, expertise or the skill set that an individual might have that would make him or her appropriate for appointment to judicial office.  Notwithstanding that, the point of this is that judges, in their day-to-day business, will have to grapple with human rights issues.  The benefit of having somebody on the commission who has seen things through the prism of a human rights perspective, that is, a nominee of IHREC, though it does not have to be a member of the commission but could be somebody who it chooses, is that he or she would be able to represent that perspective at commission meetings when looking at a nominee to send to Government.  There is an opportunity to put that person on the commission.  The way the Bill is phrased at the moment totally ignores that.  It sidelines IHREC.  I do not believe that is the intention, but it is the reality of what happens.  IHREC will no longer have direct input into the commission's output, which is the shame.  It will also degrade the quality of the representative or nominee that the commission will send to Government, which is a shame.</p> <p>This group of amendments would amend that so that we have a specific reference to IHREC and a place for it.  We are not adding an additional person.  I tabled alternative amendments that would have done that.  We are saying that one of the four lay members should be nominated by IHREC rather than the Minister because the reality is that the Minister has been hamstrung by the legislation since he or she cannot choose people beyond the recommendations that come from the PAS.</p> <p>I suggested in amendment No. 10 that we would add an additional person who would be appointed by IHREC.  That is apparently out of order.  The point that I was going to make is that it is regrettable that when Senator Currie tabled that amendment, she received an email that she was asked to pass on to me, stating that my amendment had been ruled out of order.  I do not understand why there was not a provision in the Houses of the Oireachtas whereby that email could not also have been sent to me or I could at least have been copied on it.  I did not know about it until that information was shared with me by the Senator.  I do not agree with it being ruled out of order but that is another day's work.  The point I am making with these amendments is that there is a space for IHREC and it has a role to play.  It should be entitled to play that role and it should not be left to chance.</p></speech>

I do not believe that IHREC should be represented on the judicial appointments commission.  The legislation that established IHREC states that one of its functions is to develop law and to make proposals on the development of law on the protection of human rights.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One of its functions is to develop law and to make proposals on the development of law on the protection of human rights.  It is a quasi-political body.  I do not believe it is appropriate for somebody who has membership and a part to play in law development from a particular perspective, which is the human rights perspective, to be brought in to the process with a view to vetting candidates, interviewing candidates or exerting influence on the identity of people to be appointed.  There is an element of ideology to the human rights community.  There are other attributes that judges need to uphold.  One of these is to be guided by the Oireachtas on these matters rather than the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I am against the amendments of Senators Ward and Wall.</p></speech>

Representatives of IHREC were in Leinster House recently to update us on the public sector duty.  This is to ask public bodies to have a positive provision on equality and diversity.  This does not line up when I compare the general scheme with the text of the Bill.  The Bill does not have a specific provision for a nominee from IHREC.  We need to listen to the commission on this.  It is an independent body.  Diversity has featured throughout the Bill.  There is a diversity statement.  As I said, it is a positive provision.  As Senator Ward said, it does not have to be a member.  It is a nominee rather than someone specifically from the commission.  Four positions have to be shared between nominees from the justice system, business and corporate governance.  I am afraid the human rights and equality element would get lost.  I strongly believe we need to reconsider this and listen to IHREC.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#NN00300"><p>Amendment No. 9 is in this grouping.  It also makes it clear that one of the laypersons appointed should be nominated by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  This is fundamental.  It was fundamental in the understanding we had during pre-legislative scrutiny.  It was in the original heads of the Bill.  When I do pre-legislative scrutiny I look to make sure that all of the relevant voices and bodies are there.  The heads of Bill as presented to the committee provided that a nominee from IHREC would be included in the lay membership.  IHREC understood that it would be a nominating body.  It might not nominate an employee or a commissioner but it would be a nominating body because of the very specific expertise it can bring in identifying a voice on human rights and equality or expertise in human rights and equality that will be pertinent to any particular situation.  This was to copper-fasten and guarantee there would be in-built human rights and equality expertise in the process and in the judicial appointments commission.</p> <p>This approach was largely welcomed.  It was not criticised or opposed by the committee.  It seems to have been removed from the draft Bill.  The legislation as it now stands states human rights and equality should be protected in the process but there is no mechanism for doing so.  There are many areas of expertise considered in respect of laypersons.  There is no guarantee that human rights and equality will be carried through.  It is one among a series of broad selection criteria.  This is not like any other area.  Human rights is not an ideology issue in this sense.  We have passed that point.  It is very well established and is now part of the international legal structures within which we all operate and in which Ireland has played an active and leading role.  We look to our record.  S&iacute;ofra O'Leary is leading the European Court of Human Rights.  Three Irish individuals have been appointed as special UN rapporteurs.  Human rights is an area where Ireland has hung its hat internationally.  It champions this as international law.  It has a perspective that is international but also belongs to every individual with regard to those international human law instruments that we have ratified as a country and made part of our legal architecture.  One of the crucial elements will be judges who understand this, are able to engage with it and have shown a good understanding of it.</p> <p>This is not an opinion on some industry.  There are relevant legal aspects to this.  There is also relevant law on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  That legislation specifically sets out the public sector duty on equality and human rights.  There is a duty on public bodies such as the new judicial appointments commission to ensure they are acting in a constructive way in terms of human rights and equality.  We do not have a guarantee.  There is no mechanism without IHREC being given a nominating role to ensure the human rights and equality duty is reflected.  This is a statutory obligation for the judicial appointments commission.  A very elegant and simple way to address it is to ensure IHREC will, as promised and expected, have a role in nominating the other layperson.</p> <p>It is notable that in the text of my amendment, that of the similar amendment tabled by Senator Wall and that of the similar proposals made by Senators Ward and Curry, the Minister of State is hearing this from across the House.  It is consistent with other legislation.  For example, the text of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, in establishing the Legal Services Regulatory Authority in section 9(4)(a)(iv), states that of the persons to be appointed to be members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, one shall be nominated for appointment by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  We have a clear precedent in this legal area of regulation that a particular useful expertise would be added by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.</p> <p>We have legal precedent, statutory obligation, the strong expectation and understanding of the relevant Oireachtas committee, the fact it was in the original heads of Bill, the importance of international human rights law and Ireland's stated commitment on international human rights law.  All of these point to the importance of making sure we have an IHREC nominee as one of the four laypersons.  If it is felt that we need to expand to have one more person, so be it.  An additional layperson is something the Minister has indicated she is open to.  This is an amendment that only the Government can table.  None of us as individual Senators can do so given how the Standing Orders are interpreted.  It is open to the Minister of State to do this on Report Stage.  I urge him to accept one of the amendments today or to commit to coming back on Report Stage with a proposal to ensure a nominee from IHREC is part of this new commission.</p></speech>

It provides for an equal number of lay and judicial members, with four each.  Judicial members comprise the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal and two nominees of the Judicial Council.  Section 12 provides for a more detailed prescription for the nominees of the Judicial Council.  All four lay members will be recommended by the Public Appointments Service nominated under section 13.  The Attorney General is a non-voting member.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Amendments Nos. 7 and 9 appear to have a collective objective of providing that one of the four lay members shall be nominated by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I considered carefully in the drafting of the Bill the most equitable approach to take to the appointment of lay members.  The Senators will be aware that a draft provision had originally been made for one of the members to be nominated by IHREC.  On consideration of the matter, it appeared to me that many organisations and bodies in our community and society might have a positive contribution to make in this respect.  It did not appear to me to be the best option to designate one body above all others as the only nominating body in the selection of lay members.  On balance, therefore, I decided that all nominations in this context should be made through PAS.  I believe that it is critical that expertise and knowledge in the area of equality and human rights are brought to bear on the functions of the commission.  I have included that requirement in section 13 as objectives PAS must bear in mind in the determination of selection criteria, that is, in the selection of all four lay members.  I believe that the service is the most appropriate model to employ for this purpose.</p><p>A person associated with a body or organisation that may have an interest in this area can come forward, as, indeed, can any individual who has expertise and knowledge in the areas set out under section 13, including human rights and equality.  The section provides for the selection and recommendation of lay members of the commission by PAS for appointment by the Minister and stipulates the categories of knowledge and experience to which the service shall have regard in selecting lay members.  As I have indicated, amendment No. 26, in the names of Senators Currie and Ward, reflects what they seek to achieve in the earlier amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-25a.197" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102500002#OO00200"><p>It is not that there are a lot of bodies and that it would be nice to have them represented.  This is quite different.  Yes, there are lots of different interest groups and expert groups, but we have outlined the fact, that, with respect, has not been addressed, that the public duty and equality and human rights are a statutory obligation.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is the point at which many different areas of interest and expertise have their intersection with the law.  For example, there are many disability organisations with a significant perspective and expertise, but where they intersect with, for example, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, IHREC is able to provide a connection point in that regard.  In lots of specific areas across civil society there are expertises and perspectives, but what IHREC has is that cross-cutting perspective as to how these rights issues in the wider sense and the multifaceted sense intersect with the question of international human rights and national human rights law.  That is why IHREC has been given key advice not just in respect of international human rights but also in respect of constitutional law and other matters.  It, therefore, has significant expertise.  It is not simply a matter of an interest.  It is an expertise that IHREC can bring and that cuts across rights in the widest sense.  Again, this is a statutory obligation.</p> <p>As for what the Minister of State has outlined in respect of section 13, there is no guarantee in that section that there will be an expertise on human rights and equality brought to play in respect of this important task of identifying potential judicial roles.  There is no structure in place for that.  There is every possibility that we may have somebody with human resources expertise, which is of narrow relevance to this, somebody else from the field of finance, somebody else from the field of corporate governance and somebody else with experience of the operation of the courts and nobody in the fields of human rights or equality.  There is no mechanism to ensure that would not be the case.  Even if there were to be a guarantee under the section, the Public Appointments Service would not necessarily be best placed to identify who might best carry forward that expertise.</p> <p>Again, this is different, and I worry about the idea of human rights being treated as merely one of the things we would like to see represented.  It is cross-cutting.  It has legal weight.  It is not simply that there are lots of bodies.  This is not the same as saying that, for example, education and training boards and Teagasc would all love to be represented on the commission, asking why not and saying, "Sure, everybody could be on it."  There is a specific reason IHREC was expected to be represented on it and was originally placed as such, as in other Acts, such as, as mentioned, the Legal Services Regulation Act.  There is a strong precedent in that regard.  This is not simply not doing a nice thing; it is a backwards step from the heads of Bill and a backwards step from previous legislation in this area.  It is a downgrading of the focus we give to human rights and equality in respect of these legal matters.  Since 2015, we have been on an upward curve.  I worry that this will become legislation whereby we start on a downward curve.</p></speech>

The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the independence of the judicial appointments commission and ensure that persons who may have held positions of relevant power in the Oireachtas, the Government, a Department of State or Cabinet in recent years do not have undue influence.  </p><p>I note that in section 11(2) there are some provisions already there that seek to limit the role that a person appointed as a consultant may have in relation to the selection process.  I welcome that there is some level of safeguard already there under section 11(2), which suggests that the consultant or adviser would not be part of the function of selection and recommendation of persons for appointment.  However, this is an area where we want to illustrate the clear separation of powers and best practice would be to reflect that.  I would note there is perhaps almost an excessive period later - I think it is 12 years - in terms of the requirement for a cooling-off period from having engaged in practising law.  I will come to that at ten years.  I think a five-year period here and a two-year period in respect of ordinary Oireachtas Members is reasonable.</p></speech>

It preposterously presupposes that it is appropriate for this House to rush headlong, as it has done in lots of other legislation, towards excluding former Members from any kind of operation after they leave this House.  Oftentimes, in fact perhaps most of the time, people leave this or the other House without very much notice and find themselves in a situation where they have to get a job.  I am not sure necessarily that the Judiciary is a place that they are likely to bet on ending up.  However, the notion behind this amendment excludes four different categories of person: former Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas; former members of Government, which obviously have an overlap; the Attorney General; or persons who have served at a certain level within the Civil Service.  Again, it presupposes that these people are in some way inappropriate-----</p></speech>

It is two years for Deputies and Senators, five years for a member of the Government, five years for the Attorney General and five years for somebody who served at the Secretary General level in a Department of the Government.  The notion that that somehow debars people from the appropriateness of serving in judicial office is wrong.</p> <p>First, what is much more important than qualifying somebody to serve in judicial office is their actual qualifications.  For any person to even fall into this category they would already have to have served for more than ten years in a legal practice role or the other things that are provided for in the Act.  This person will already be an accomplished legal professional who has a considerable amount of experience.  That is the first thing.</p> <p>Second, in proposing her amendment, the Senator talked about cross-contamination and the notion that if one has served as a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, in the Government or whatever the other categories are, somehow one is no longer fit to hold that office.  It presupposes there might be some kind of cross-contamination, instead of looking at the job that is done in these Houses and in government and acknowledging someone has a wealth of experience or an expertise that might lend itself very well to being an effective judicial figure or recognising that when a person works in here for a number of years, they develop a skill set that can be of benefit to the country, be it at judicial level or wherever else it might be.  There are so many other areas of legislation where we have told people that if they have been a Deputy, a Minister or even an adviser to a Minister, they must wait a year before they can do jobs in an area where they have built up an expertise and a skill set.  I know that there are reasons that might exist.  However, I do not understand why, on the one hand, we say we want to encourage people into politics, and on the other hand, we spend all of our time telling people that if they get into politics, they will be hamstrung in getting into any other area of work.  I do not think we should be doing that.  It is not necessary.  This amendment is totally misguided.</p></speech>

I talked about the separation of powers, which is quite different.  I have huge respect for the work that we do in the Oireachtas and the political work the Government does.  It is because of that respect and recognising that it is a separate role that it is important for it to be able to be done, and have the confidence of the public that it is done in a way that is clearly separate from the other arms of the State.</p> <p>I would note that this amendment is not in relation to who is eligible for judicial office, rather, it is in relation to who is eligible to become consultants, advisers or enter into contracts with and work for the commission.  It is around the independent functioning of the commission.  In general, there are excessive measures, particularly in terms of local authority members, most of whom cannot solely work as local authority members.  Some of us are lucky enough to be able to be full-time Senators, but that is not something that is viable for many local authority members.  In that context, there have been overly restrictive measures.  However, in this case, it is appropriate because it is around the functioning of a commission that is appointing people.  There is a situation whereby this very important function of the commission needs, by its nature, to be seen to be completely separate from Government because it gives these independent recommendations to Government.  For the commission&rsquo;s clarity of independent function and others, it is an appropriate period.  Two years and five years are not excessive. </p> <p>I regret that we have sadly seen an excessive number of very senior members of Government who have gone into roles too quickly for the public confidence.  I will not mention them, but we have had situations where we have been discussing an area of legislation with a Minister and then that person goes on to represent an interest group in that area a month or two later.  I do not think that is good practice.  There is an onus on all of us.  It is not around the individual examples.  There is an onus on us to restore confidence in the public and that is why I am suggesting these safeguards.</p></speech>

I thought she had used that term.  I absolutely agree with her in terms of what she said about local authority members.  In fact, if one looks at any State board, for example, one of the things that will more often than not debar a person from membership is membership of local authority.  That is another short-sighted move by successive Governments, including my own, that have precluded often very talented, experience and qualified people from local government, as much as from these Houses, from holding offices where they could be of benefit to the public.</p><p>In fairness, the proposal the Senator made is consistent with the other amendments that have been submitted in relation to, for example, the Attorney General.  The difficulty I have with it is that is presupposes that there is a crisis of confidence and there is somehow some public lack of confidence in the Judiciary when, in fact, I think the opposite is the case.  All of the objective evidence in relation to the operation of the Judiciary in this country is that it is the opposite.  People have confidence in the Judiciary for good reason.  The Judiciary operates at a level that is fair and transparently legal and it applies the rule of law.</p><p>I contrast this with the British judiciary, for example, and I said this during the Second Stage debate and when I spoke earlier during the Committee Stage debate.  I recently read a book in which a practitioner in the UK was extolling the virtues of the British judiciary and how it has been very effective in establishing the rule of law.  According to her, that is why so many people choose the UK as a jurisdiction for international law.  There may be some truth to that but, unfortunately, we can also look at a judiciary in the UK that has an appalling history, in particular in terms of our countrymen and dealing with them in legal processes.  In fact, an article in the <i>Guardian</i>last week referred to a survey that found the judiciary in England and Wales was found to be institutionally racist, for example.  I do not think that could ever be said of our Judiciary.  We have a coterie of men and women who serve in the Judiciary in this country who are beyond compare globally.  They stand above people, particularly in the common law world.  It is certainly not true of the United States and I do not think it is true in the United Kingdom.  In other common law jurisdictions, there are problems with the judiciary that we do not have.  There is a consistently high performance here.</p><p>The difficulty that I have with this amendment is that we can talk about independence but, again, we are talking about a body that is making a proposal to Government.  The notion that people who are advising or are members of that body have experience of Government at whatever level that might be is not a bad thing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The other thing is that when people get involved in judicial issues, they separate themselves from their former lives.  I have no difficulty excluding sitting Members from being involved in that; that is a given.  In my experience of individuals who, let us say, have been politically active or, in the case of some judges, have been Members of these Houses or a member of Government, once they have achieved judicial office, they separate themselves from that past life.  I understand the Senator's point that this is not what we are talking about but I think the same is true of people who leave these Houses.  They are often very happy to leave politics behind and move on with a normal life where they can be home in time to eat dinner with their families.  However, they also separate themselves from the policies that are involved in that and take on the role with the dedication and independence that is required of them.  This amendment presupposes that they either do not or cannot do that.  That is not true and that is why I think it is misguided. </p></speech>

That is the concern.  We have also had senior former members of Government telling us they are not answerable to the Standards In Public Office Commission, SIPO.  In those contexts, there is an understanding that we need to work collectively.  I say that with absolute respect for colleagues from all parties and right across the Oireachtas.  Those who want to contribute to the world through politics may well want to go on to contribute in many other different ways but we need to make that separation clear.  This is not about any individuals.  Individualising the issue is probably not useful.</p> <p>I will press the amendment because this is an area on which we could be clearer.  Having a two-year wait period and, in the case of former Attorneys General or Ministers, a five-year wait, before working in such a role is probably a lesser evil when compared with the danger of a misconception arising.</p></speech>

The effect of the amendment would be to provide that for the stated number of years, the commission shall not appoint a person as a consultant or adviser where the person has been a Member of the Oireachtas, a Minister of the Government, an Attorney General, or the Secretary General of a Department of State.</p> <p>The proposed power of the commission in section 11 has been carefully drafted to reflect a policy intention that a consultant or an adviser shall have the role of assisting the commission rather than adding to, or even replacing, it.  In particular, section 11(2) provides that a consultant or adviser shall not be enabled to do anything for the purpose of the performance by the commission of the function of selection and recommendation of persons for judicial office.  I am not in favour of prohibiting, for the periods of time suggested in the amendment, these former officeholders unless a compelling argument exists that such a prohibition is necessary to achieve an important objective in relation to the operation of the commission.  I am not convinced that there is such a compelling argument.  Accordingly, I am not in favour of the proposed amendment.</p></speech>

The section 12 provisions provide for the appointment, essentially of judges, to the proposed judicial appointments commission.  There are three amendments in the group.  Amendment No. 15 deals with section 12(2), which provides for two nominees from the Judicial Council, one of whom shall be from the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal or High Court and one of whom shall be a judge of the Circuit Court or the District Court.  In addition, one of the nominees shall be a former practising solicitor and one a former practising barrister and one must be male and one female.  Amendment No. 16 deals with subsection (4), which provides again for having a certain number of practising barristers and solicitors.  Amendment No. 17 is to subsection (6), which provides that where a judge appointed under the section ceases to be a member of the commission, the person who replaces that member must fulfil the same criteria in terms of gender and former practice.  </p><p>I spoke about this matter on Second Stage and earlier on Committee Stage.  The gender quota is one thing.  Gender diversity is tremendously important but can be achieved in different ways.  I am less concerned about that than I am about the notion that judges, no matter how long they are in judicial office, somehow remain former practising solicitors or barristers.  This section proposes to essentially divide judges into those two categories and qualify or disqualify them, as the case maybe, on the basis of their former practice.  That might have been yesterday or, more likely when dealing with the Judicial Council because by virtue of practicality, it is unlikely that new judges will be in a position to be appointed under this section and nominees will usually be judges of some experience, it may have been up to 20 years since they practised in that area.  I have said on many occasions that I do not believe once a person achieves judicial office that he or she continues to represent one profession or the other.  I am not saying that is what the Department or Minister of State is saying, but there is a presupposition in this section that somehow they are never just a judge; they are a former solicitor or barrister in a judicial role.  This fundamentally misunderstands the role that judges take.  It also ignores the fact that in reality, different courts are made up predominantly of one profession or the other.  A greater proportion of barristers will be found in one court and a greater proportion of solicitors in another.</p><p>In these circumstances, judges who occupied one former profession are effectively being hamstrung from moving into the commission through membership of the Judicial Council.  More importantly, judges are not former solicitors or barristers but judges who have sworn an oath to uphold the law and to apply it as it applies in this jurisdiction.  As I said on the previous amendment, they do so very well and diligently.  This section starts from the view that they do not do that and it is wrong to place them in that category.</p><p>The other issue with the section is that it makes the re-appointment or replacement of a member of the commission incredibly clunky and awkward.  Instead of just leaving it up to the Judicial Council to appoint the people it believes to be the appropriate persons to represent them on the commission, this section is, incorrectly and erroneously, dictating to the judges the type of person they should chose from the Judicial Council to be on the commission.  That is misguided as well.</p><p>I put forward these three amendments essentially to undo these provisions and put back in the hands of members of the Judicial Council, the right and, perhaps more importantly, discretion to appoint the person or persons, from whatever background, that they think best represent them.  That is what is important.  The starting point in section 12, particularly in subsections (2), (4) and (6), is that we somehow need to dictate to the Judicial Council what the background of that person is when in fact that person is simply a judge, irrespective of his or her gender or whether he or she was a practising barrister or solicitor, how long he or she has been practising, whether he or she was an academic or whatever the case may be.  My respectful submission to the Minister of State, to use legal parlance, is that we should do away with this provision and leave it up to the discretion of the members of the Judicial Council.</p></speech>

While I am in favour of clear measures on gender equality in general in legislation, and we have been waiting a very long time for incremental progress, there is a problem with the way in which section 12(6) is worded.  That is the subsection Senator Ward is proposing to amend.  It is possibly inadvertent but it addresses the fact that a number of intersecting criteria are being applied.  The subsection provides that when somebody stops being a judge, or when a judge ceases to be a member of the commission, the Judicial Council shall nominate a judge of the same gender as the judge who has ceased to be a member and of the same set of courts.  If that judge who has ceased to be a member was in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal or High Court, it would be a judge from one of those courts.  If it is a judge from the Circuit Court or District Court, he or she would be replaced by judge from one of those courts.  Given the small number of appointments to be made, these two criteria will create a situation, which I do not imagine is the policy intent, whereby if the judge is a man from the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal or High Court, he must be replaced by a man from the same courts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Similarly, if you have a woman from the Circuit Court or the District Court, the subsequent appointment must be a woman from the Circuit Court or the District Court.  You could end up in a situation where there will never be a woman from the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court, or a man from the Circuit Court or the District Court, which means you would end up reifying the genders into court groupings.  I do not believe that is the intention.  The intention is to ensure there will be a balance from all the courts and a gender balance.<br/><br/>As a result of the decision to tie it so closely to the role held by the previous member of the council, however, there is a danger of having a situation whereby if there is once a man from a certain set of courts, it will always be a man from that set of courts, and <i>vice versa</i>.  That is not good in terms of progression or gender equality and parity.  It might need to be examined by the Government between now and Report Stage.  A simple way to do it would be to remove section 12(6)(b), which is part of what Senator Ward is seeking to do in his amendment.  His amendment is wider and seeks to remove a number of subsections.  The question of the appointee needing to be from the same court grouping could be removed.  If there was simply a separate provision to the effect that the Judicial Council in its appointments under section 12 should endeavour to have a balance from the various court groupings, that could be addressed as a separate point.  By tying it to the previous appointee, we are potentially creating a trap that might lead to a lack of diversity and a lack of movement.  That is not what we want to have in that context.  Section 12(6)(c), which provides simply that the appointee must qualify as a judge &quot;on the same basis as the judge who is being replaced&quot;, seems to be wide enough without specifying that they have to have served in the same court, as section 12(6)(b) does.  Sections 12(6)(a) and 12(6)(c) seem to be enough.  I do not really know what section 12(6)(b) adds, but I suggest there is an inadvertent consequence there which is a danger.</p></speech>

It is important for me to be clear about these arrangements.  The Judicial Council shall nominate two members of the council to be members of the commission.  These nominees shall be appointed to the commission by the Minister.  Three criteria are set out in respect of the nominations.  First, section 12(2)(a) provides that one of the nominees "shall be a judge of the Supreme Court, of the Court of Appeal or of the High Court" and one "shall be a judge of the Circuit Court or the District Court".  Second, section 12(2) further provides that one nominee shall be male and one shall be female.  Third, section 12(2)(b) provides, regarding the two nominees, "one of whom shall be a judge who, at the time of his or her appointment as a judge, was qualified for such appointment by virtue of having been a practising solicitor and one of whom shall be a judge who, at the time of his or her appointment as a judge, was qualified for such appointment by virtue of having been a practising barrister".  Amendment No. 15 proposes to delete section 12(2) and therefore would eliminate the three separate criteria I have mentioned that pertain to Judicial Council nominees.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are consequential.  Amendment No. 16 would delete section 12(4), which is a technical qualification under a provision related to the prior practice qualification.  Amendment No. 17 would delete the provisions of the section that provide for replacement nomination of the Judicial Council nominee when the member ceases to be a judge.  It would delete the three criteria also in that context and it provides necessary text in substitution.</p> <p>I cannot support these amendments.  It is reasonable that nominations bring the perspective of both the higher and lower courts to the work of the commission.  It is essential in my view that there is a gender balance on the commission.  It is provided for in the lay members.  I believe it can also be provided for in the Judicial Council members. </p> <p>Senators will be aware that the Bill does not provide for representation of nominees of the Law Society of Ireland or the Bar Council of Ireland on the commission.  Judge members can bring a perspective reflecting prior practice in the two areas of legal practice.  That is a good thing and I am of the view that it is adequate to achieve that purpose.</p> <p>Apart from the matter of legal profession representation on the commission, which we will discuss separately, it is reasonable and desirable that there is some certainty in the Bill in regard to what we are asking the council to do.  Additionally, the considerations I have mentioned in regard to participation are important for different court experience and gender balance.  Therefore, I am not in a position to support the changes proposed to section 12.</p></speech>

I do not agree that there needs to be clarity about what we are asking the council to do.  It is being asked to appoint two people.  I do not believe any clarity beyond that is required.  I reiterate the point I made earlier on the previous experience issue: the reality is that you just have judges; you do not have judges for former solicitors and former barristers.  The danger is that when you talk about judges who are former solicitors and former barristers, you do two things.  First, you ignore the fact that decades may have passed since they practised in that area.  Second, you tell them that they should be batting for, or having consideration for, one or either of those professions, and they should not.  They should be acting as judges, which I believe they do.  That is why I think it is misguided.  However, I do not propose to press the amendment.</p></speech>

Under section 12(2), there is one nominee who is coming from the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Court of Appeal, and one who is coming from the Circuit Court or the District Court.  One these is female and one is male.  The danger in how the Bill is set out at the moment relates to what happens at the beginning.  If it happens that the initial appointees are a female from the Circuit Court or the District Court and a male from the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Court of Appeal, when each of them is replaced he or she will be replaced by a person of the same gender from the same court grouping.  Therefore, there is a danger of gendering forever.  This is an inadvertent consequence of the way that section (12)(6) is worded.  However, I would appreciate the Minister of State's thoughts on it or at least an indication from him that he is going to examine this issue.  There is a real danger here of an inadvertent consequence.</p></speech>

He or she is simply a judge.  However, a particular judge will have experience from his or her previous profession, and that insight will add to the commission's process of selection, which could be important.</p></speech>

Failing that, it is important that section 12 would explicitly ensure the public duty on equality and human rights would be reflected.  Amendment No. 18 provides that when agreeing criteria for lay members the Minister would need to demonstrate specific regard to section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 and - as I have also mentioned - the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  I reserve the right to bring an amendment solely focusing on IHREC in that regard.  I pulled up the UNCRPD as an example of international law.  I believe that if IHREC had a nominating role, it would be able to incorporate and reflect the UNCRPD.  However, I do not believe the Public Appointments Service will necessarily have the qualifications to do so.  As I have said, the fundamental part is section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  I have mentioned the UNCRPD as well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ireland is due to ratify the optional protocol of the UNCRPD.  There may well be cases taken on breach of rights under the convention.  There has been significant case law on human rights and disability.  This is to ensure there is an appointments process that appoints judges who have the relevant expertise and ability to engage with an evolving international human rights legal structure and with the fact that Ireland's own ratifications are evolving all the time.  Ireland is signing up to various bodies of law in this regard.  The UNCRPD is interesting because it is relatively new but the case law is rapidly evolving in many countries.  This wider international case law becomes relevant for how the law is put into effect in Ireland.  This is one example but, to be honest, I do not know whether we necessarily need to name the UNCRPD.  It is an example of international human rights law being real law.  It needs real decision.  It is relevant for our Judiciary.  A number of Brazilian judges have taken part in environmental law and environmental human rights law as an area of evolving work.</p><p>There is a statutory obligation regarding the public duty on equality and human rights.  We can allow this to be fulfilled through the role of IHREC.  If it is not fulfilling that, we need to find another place in the Bill to build in a mechanism that ensures the statutory obligation is being reflected.  A potential area is through section 12.</p></speech>

Effectively, the amendment would require the Minister for Justice in developing the selection criteria applicable to a selection process under the section to demonstrate regard to section 42 of the 2014 Act, which deals with the obligations of public bodies to eliminate discrimination to promote equality of opportunity and to protect human rights and the UN convention generally.</p> <p>Section 13(3) specifies that the Minister for Justice shall agree with the PAS the selection criteria and procedures applicable to a selection process for the recommendation of persons who are suitable for appointment as lay members of the commission.  The subsection specifies a number of key elements to have regard to in this task.  In particular, it specifies that the recommendation should reflect the diversity of the population of the State as a whole.  I am satisfied it is not necessary to enumerate other provisions of Statute law in section 13 for those other provisions to be effective with regard to the performance by the Minister for Justice of functions under the section.  Accordingly, I am not in favour of the proposed amendment.</p></speech>

Even the wording of section 13(4)(d) is weak.  It refers to matters concerned with the importance of the protection of human rights and equality.  There needs to be expertise and persons who can properly represent these issues.  Simply stating somebody can say it is important is weakly worded.  It is not consistent, even with the language of the legislation, which is not just about protection but also promotion.  It is a positive duty in respect of the public duty on equality and human rights.  This is constrained and limited.  This subsection does not even mention the protection of human rights and equality; it refers to the importance of the protection of human rights.  It is quite a dilute provision.  There is no guarantee as to how it will be reflected.  Will it be reflected in a way, for example, that demonstrates expertise and understanding of the relevant international law in this regard?</p> <p>This legislation is not clear on the public duty on equality and human rights.  It is not robust enough.  It is a dilution of what we have seen in similar legislation from 2015 on the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  I am curious regarding the decision to move away from what was in the heads of the Bill.  Perhaps this is something on which the Minister of State can elaborate.  Moving away from strong measures on human rights is a concerning decision.  It is not a matter of failing to do a good thing.  We are moving backwards in this regard.</p></speech>

It qualifies section 13(3), which states:</p> <blockquote> 	The Minister shall agree with the Public Appointments Service the selection criteria and procedures applicable to a selection process under this section having regard to&mdash;  	(a) the objective that the lay members will, having regard to the functions of the Commission, amongst them possess knowledge of, and experience, qualifications, training or expertise in, the matters specified in subsection (4),<br /><br />(b) the need, in so far as possible, to ensure that recommendations made under subsection (2) should comprise an equal number of women and men and reflect the diversity of the population of the State as a whole, and<br /><br />(c) the need to ensure that a person recommended to the Minister under subsection (2) is a fit and proper person to be a lay member.  </blockquote> <p>This is all very well.  The manner in which section 13(3) and section 13(4) are constructed is difficult to navigate.  It unnecessarily creates a dual system to be applied when all of this could have been done in one subsection.  Perhaps this is a view on the style rather than the substance.  The issue I have is that section 13(4) sets out the matters referred to in section 13(3) and ranks them.  It certainly lists them; I do not know whether the Minister of State would agree they are ranked.  Section 13(4) states:</p> <blockquote> 	The matters referred to in subsection (3) are matters connected with&mdash;  	(a) business, finance or public service,<br /><br />(b) corporate governance and human resources (including making, or recommending persons for, senior appointments), <br /><br />(c) the courts and the operation of the justice system both in the State and in places outside the State, and<br /><br />(d) the importance of protection of human rights and equality.  </blockquote> <p>I take the view they are de facto ranked in the way they are listed.  I understand the need for a board or a commission to have certain expertise on the operation of the commission itself.  There will be a secretariat associated with the commission.  There will be a director of the commission.  There will be a body of professionals in the commission who will take care of those matters that need to be dealt with, particularly those covered by subsections (a) and (b) of section 13(4).</p><p>First and foremost on the list of criteria of experience that people need to have to serve on this commission are not business and finance; they are, in fact, experience of the Judiciary, the courts system, the practice of law, the way our courts operate and the way our system operates.  Without this a person is not fit to serve on the commission.  To have a lay person who does not understand how the court system works or has no experience of it or any legal aspects of the State is a person who does not have the requisite experience to serve on the commission.</p><p>Whatever about the need for people who have business, finance, public service, corporate governance or human resources experience, however desirable these might be in addition, the point of thee amendment is to put up a clear ranking that the first criterion people should look at is experience of matters connected with the courts and the operation of the justice system in the State and places outside the State.  This is a totally legitimate criterion and it should be first.  It should be in section 13(4)(a).  The importance of the protection of human rights and equality is another extremely important criterion that is totally valid in the context of what we have been speaking about throughout the debate on the Bill.  This should be in section 13(4)(b).  If needs be, finance, business, public administration and corporate governance should be included in section 13(4)(c) and section 13(4)(d).<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not have a difficulty with them being there, but when we are putting them in, we should rank them in the order of their importance.  The most important is what is currently listed in section 13(4)(c), which should instead be paragraph (a).  In reality, amendment No. 19 reorders the criteria set out in section 13(4) to list them in the order of priority and importance for the purposes of looking at a person who will be a proper, fit or qualified person to serve as a lay member of the commission.  It is a simple change that I hope the Minister will look seriously at accepting.  It is an important statement of the qualities and experience that we require of a person who is to serve as a lay member of the commission.<br/><br/>I am less concerned about amendment No. 26 because we already had the debate about IHREC.  I suggested earlier that there should be a position on the commission for a nominee of IHREC.  Amendment No. 26 creates two new subsections.  The proposed subsection (5) states, &quot;In furtherance of its functions under section 10 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission shall nominate one person to the Commission, to be one of the 4 lay members provided for by section <i>9(1)(e)</i>&quot;.  The proposed subsection (6) states, &quot;In making a nomination under <i>subsection (5)</i>, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission shall have regard to the criteria set out in <i>subsections (3)</i>and <i>(4)</i>&quot;.  The Government has already made its view on the power of IHREC to appoint somebody clear.  I do not propose to dwell on that.  When Senator Currie and I tabled this amendment, we believed that there should be representation of IHREC or a nominee from IHREC, but I understand the Minister's position.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 27 deals with a different part of section 13, which is the provision in subsection (5), which currently states, &quot;Subject to <i>subsection (6)</i>, the Minister shall appoint lay members from among the persons recommended by the Public Appointments Service under <i>subsection (2</i>)&quot;.  Subsection (2) provides the Minister with power to request the Public Appointments Service to conduct that search or qualification process so it can come up with names to give to the Minister.  In amendment No. 27, I am saying that subsection (5) should say that the Minister may appoint those laypersons.  I do not really understand why the Minister has decided to again restrict herself only to the people who have come through the Public Appointments Service process.  I mentioned this earlier.  This is why I think this should have been debated with an earlier amendment.<br/><br/>I think the Public Appointments Service is good at what it does.  However, without criticising the Public Appointments Service, I do not agree with the Government's move to decide that every public position should be filled through the Public Appointments Service.  When one is dealing with people who require specific expertise and carry out a particular role in the context of commission membership, I think a different approach should be taken.  It is not the case that the criteria applied by a Civil Service metric for assessing the suitability, qualifications and so on of a person to serve in a particular role necessarily suit this kind of appointment.  I do not think this should necessarily come through the Public Appointments Service, but I do not think the Minister is any worse off for having the benefit of the advice of the Public Appointments Service and the process that it has gone through which requires an interview of those candidates, as we know from the Bill.  I think the interview is problematic in itself but that is another day's work.<br/><br/>The difficulty that I have is that the Minister has not just said that she would like the benefit of the view of the Public Appointments Service or that she would like to hear what it has to say and to look at the people that it has suggested, but that she is bound by it and can only appoint someone as a lay member of the commission if the Public Appointments Service tells her it is okay to do that.  I have a difficulty with that.  Why would we hamstring the Minister into only selecting those people when she or he might reasonably be aware of somebody who, in her or his mind, would be a better candidate for the commission?  Amendment No. 28 deals with this.  It states that the Minister should have the power to choose somebody beyond the recommendations that come from the Public Appointments Service.  In the interests of transparency and with a view to avoiding any suggestion that it is a job for the boys, or whatever other criticism might be made, amendment No. 28 inserts a new paragraph to subsection (5), which states that where the Minister, in her or his wisdom, whoever it might be, decides to pick somebody who has not come through the Public Appointments Service process, she or he would explain that.  The Minister would put a clear explanation on the record about why that person outside the Public Appointments Service process has been selected.<br/><br/>What I am suggesting in these amendments is not unreasonable.  It is a measured way to include as many people as possible.  As I said earlier, the Public Appointments Service applies a particular metric to the selection of candidates.  I am not saying that it is a bad metric, but if we approach this with a one-size-fits-all mentality, then we will only get one size.  Sometimes, when we are looking at boards, commissions and bodies like this, we need somebody who does not necessarily fit into the square hole that has been set out by the Civil Service.  I say that with no criticism whatsoever of the Civil Service.  With amendments Nos. 27 and 28, I try to present an opportunity which I would much rather see.  That is an opportunity for the Minister to make a decision based on what she or he wants to do and to achieve with the commission, by putting in place a body which has a real opportunity to look at possible candidates to form part of the Judiciary, which is a branch of our government, and to put in place people who she or he thinks are right.  They should not just be the people who tick the boxes on psychometric forms or whatever it is that people have to do to go through that process.<br/><br/>The reality is that the Public Appointments Service needs to put in place measurable targets and processes that people can follow so that it can rank people against each other.  I am not criticising that but that does not suit every candidate.  My concern is that in section 13, we are iron-cladding a system that only suits certain types of candidate.  We should be willing to look beyond that to the broader spectrum and to a system that includes people who may not fit into that metric but who might nonetheless be excellent lay members of the judicial appointments commission, so that we as a country could have better recommendations to the Minister for appointment to judicial office.</p></speech>

I think the point in amendment No. 19 about the ranking is interesting.  If it is construed as a ranking, then that becomes an issue, because having business and finance placed above the operation of the justice system seems strange if that is the case.</p> <p>I am concerned about the tension in subsection (4) with the aspirations in subsection (3).  Subsection (3)(b) contains an idea of reflecting "the diversity of the population of the State as a whole", but the grounds as set out in subsection (4) are strangely narrow and quite skewed towards one section of the population.  It includes business, finance and public service.  My amendment No. 20 would delete section 13(4)(a), which refers to people involved in business, finance or public service, and would replace it with a broader provision, stating, "commerce, finance, administration, public service, civil society or trade unions".  If we have a goal of reflecting the diversity of society, simply having those who have a business or finance perspective would include business owners and those in finance.  Having people with international finance backgrounds being the laypersons on the judicial appointments commission is questionable when there is no option for it to be somebody with a civil society or trade union background.</p></speech>
