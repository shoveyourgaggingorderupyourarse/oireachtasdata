Let us be clear what is in question here.  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides that the PUP is subject to tax from 5 August but it is only now, in the middle of December, that we will be retrospectively applying income tax to that vital payment between those dates that kept many thousands of households throughout the country afloat during the worst of the pandemic.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This belated decision to retrospectively apply income tax to the payment is mean and unnecessary.  It is a penny-pinching initiative.  Its main impact will be to strike fear into those households that have been so badly hit this year and to cause anxiety.  People in these households are dealing with reduced incomes, the stress of working from home and the great uncertainty that comes from not knowing whether they will have a job next year.  I ask the Minister of State to consider taking section 3 out of the Bill.  We have yet to hear any answers as to how much this measure will raise.  My colleague, Deputy Nash, asked this question in the D&aacute;il and we have not got an answer yet.  </p><p>My second point is that it makes no sense for it to be good enough to retrospectively apply income tax to an ordinary worker's social welfare payment, which is supposed to be exempt from such tax because it is a supplementary welfare payment as per the 2005 Act, while it is not okay to retrospectively change the rules regarding corporation tax or many other taxes in our system, as has been articulated by the Minister for Finance.  FLAC, the Free Legal Advice Centres, has been in contact with the Department on a number of occasions to express grave concern about the legality of the principle of retrospectively applying income tax and the impact this will have on working families.  Let us be clear; this retrospectively applied tax could push someone who did not have to pay income tax this year because he or she fell below the threshold into paying tax or could push a worker from the standard income tax bracket into the higher tax bracket.  All of us in this Chamber today have to ask whether it is good enough to further penalise those families and workers who have been so badly affected this year.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw this section.  It does not stand up and it is not fair.  We will oppose the section.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-11a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121100002#B00200"><p>As the Minister of State will be aware, I have proposed amendments to address this issue.  The section should either be withdrawn or the Minister should exercise his power not to commence it at the same time as the rest of the Bill.  We had an extremely lengthy debate in these Houses when changes were being made in respect of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  We discussed whether it would be a social welfare payment and what obligations and implications might arise with regard to qualifying for redundancy, availability for work and whether claimants could travel for two weeks if it was to be such a payment.  We had all of these discussions because a fundamental change to this payment was made over the summer.  It was a legal change requiring legislation.  We all discussed it and stood over it.  None of us can claim a lack of awareness given that we debated the issue for approximately two hours.  This change resulted in the PUP moving from a supplementary welfare or extraordinary need payment, which was how it was constructed, to an unemployment payment.  It moved to a different part of the social welfare code, which resulted in different obligations being associated with it, including obligations in respect of taxation.  It simply was not the case that this payment was taxable prior to the change on 5 August.</p> <p>I do not know if the Government is gambling that ordinary families will not have the wherewithal or the financial, emotional or psychological capacity to challenge this change.  Is that the logic for pushing ahead with it?  With regard to any such changes to corporation tax for businesses, we are constantly told that tax cannot be applied retrospectively and that these measures cannot look backwards.  We are also often told about things like double taxation.  The arguments made in that regard are sometimes framed in a spurious way.  We have been told on many occasions the reasons we cannot increase taxes even on those who have, as we come to the end of the year, profited substantially during the Covid period in a way that had not been anticipated.  Despite this, we are going back in time to tax those who are in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  </p> <p>We must look at this legislation in the context of a suite of other legislation we have debated.  It should be borne in mind that we debated legislation in this House which allows for somebody who is only 28 days in arrears of rent to be given only 28 days to pay.  We have not only increased the potential financial load on families who are going to be pushed to the pin, but we have also increased the jeopardy attached to falling short financially.  That is the situation into which we are sending people next year, after the eviction ban and curtailment have been lifted.  When people come off the pandemic unemployment payment, they will be left with a very large bill and greater financial risk.  </p> <p>The right thing to do is not to force people to fight this, because I am sure some people will fight it and that they will win.  We are also increasing the workload of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, FLAC and all of those instruments of the State that are meant to help people stay afloat and help families maintain their finances.  It would be advisable not to add on this extra three or four months in a way which is not legally robust.  We should be satisfied to simply tax the portion of the pandemic unemployment payment paid after 5 August.  This is legislatively, legally and morally the more responsible thing to do.  I hope the Minister of State will consider either withdrawing the section or, if he is not minded to do so given the time pressures of Christmas, committing to not commencing it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-11a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121100002#B00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I agree with my two colleagues who have spoken on this issue.  Our view of it is simple; it is well dodgy and does not stand up.  Senator Higgins makes a very good point.  Perhaps the Government is gambling on the fact that ordinary working people do not have the means to challenge this but, constitutionally, it really does not stack up.  To be clear, section 13 of the Finance Act 2018 amended section 126 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to clarify a number of payments made by the Minister for Social Protection which would be exempt from income tax, among which were urgent needs payments.  I know the Minister of State rejected the word "retrospective" the other day, but that is clearly what this is.  It does not stand up legally.  It is a very odd thing to do.  It stands in stark contrast to the treatment of other wealthier sections of society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-11a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121100002#B00400"><p>I thank the Senators for raising this issue.  The Minister, the Government and I have been consistent from the beginning.  This payment was taxable from the day it was introduced.  It always has been.  There is a mass misconception about the taxation of the payment, which has always been possible.  I hope to put the record straight.  People who are not watching this meeting might not get the reality of the situation regarding the taxation of the PUP, but at least the correct position will be on the record of the House, even if it is not known among the general public.</p> <p>Section 3 provides for the taxation treatment of the pandemic unemployment payment.  This is subtly different from providing for the taxation of the payment.  It provides for its taxation treatment.  It was taxable to start with.  This section is about how that tax, which has existed since the beginning, is to be treated.  This section does not introduce taxation but clarifies how the taxation to which the payment has been subject since its introduction is to be treated.  This section does not introduce a tax.  It clarifies the tax treatment of the payment, which was taxable from day one.  Some people have understandably taken this clarification of the treatment of this taxation, which I will explain in a few minutes, to mean that section 3 retrospectively introduces taxation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In fact, we are clarifying the treatment of the taxation of the PUP, which was taxable from day one.  I wanted to put that on the record.  People might not understand what the section is about.  It is not about taxation but about the treatment of a payment that is already taxable.  It is a clarification of the treatment.</p><p>The PUP was placed on a formal statutory footing by the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020, which was passed into law on 5 August.  I have been consistent as regards the PUP&rsquo;s liability to tax from the outset of the payment.  It is fair and equitable that recipients of the PUP are subject to tax on this income - it is an income - just as those who have continued in employment are subject to tax on theirs.  The PUP is an income support and shares the characteristics of the jobseeker's benefit and the self-employed jobseeker's benefit, both of which are taxable.  From the very beginning, certain social welfare payments have always been exempt from income tax, while others have always been subject to tax.  Everyone knows that jobseeker's allowance is not taxable and that jobseeker's benefit, because it is connected to having been in work and is claimed when someone is out of work and might be back in work in the same year, has always been taxable, as are other benefit payments.  The State pension, similarly, is subject to taxation if the recipient has other income that brings him or her into the tax net.  Several social welfare payments are taxable and that has always been the case.</p><p>The PUP is not an allowance payment and we have to consider what it is about.  It is intended for people who were in employment, are not in employment for a period and will be back in employment at a future date.  It is very similar to a jobseeker's payment.  It is intended for somebody who had been in employment, was out for a period and goes back in.  It is similar to the jobseeker's benefit payment and nobody argues about the taxation of that.  It would be inequitable if the PUP was not taxable while the jobseeker's benefit was.  Indeed, as a general rule, all social welfare payments are subject to taxation, unless specifically exempted.</p><p>The section will provide that the PUP will be treated as an emolument to which Chapter 4 of Part 42 of the Taxes Consolidation Act applies and,accordingly, charged to tax under Schedule E.  This means that while taxable, the payment will attract the personal income tax credit and the PAYE credit.  The taxation position will follow the general taxation rule for social welfare payments and, therefore, the payments will be exempt from PRSI and the universal social charge. I will presently explain that in plain English because it is the crux of the issue.  Furthermore, to alleviate any immediate financial burden that may arise, Revenue announced last September that it will collect the liability, interest free, by reducing the individual&rsquo;s tax credits over four years to minimise any hardship.  This reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022.</p><p>As I said on Second Stage, there is some debate about when the tax will fall due and whether people will get a shock at Christmas.  By definition, anybody involved in that debate knew that the payment would be taxable.  Why else would they have asked whether people will get a shock in their tax bill at Christmas?  They understood it was taxable.  The only issue related to when people would have to pay the tax.  The Members involved in that debate cannot now, a couple of months later, say they never knew it was taxable, having discussed the date of when people will find out how much is due on their tax bill.  There is an inconsistency in the argument that Members are making on this Stage versus the arguments they may have made in the summer, which concerned when people would find out how much they owed in tax.  Revenue has decided that it will not collect the tax even next year because we do not know what will be the status of the PUP next year.  We might still be dealing with Covid.  Revenue has indicated, therefore, that it will start collecting the tax only from 2022, which means it will adjust a person's tax credits over a four-year period starting in 2020.  Over that period, it will bring about a reduction in a person's take-home pay of approximately &euro;1.50 per week.  If persons know they have this liability and if they want to keep their tax affairs up to date, they can notify Revenue that they are happy to pay it all as soon as practicable in order that they will not have to spread it over four years.  Nevertheless, the default position of Revenue is that it will collect the tax over four years unless a person comes forward to say that he or she wants to pay it upfront and be done with it.  People will have that option.  That debate has been ongoing for a while because everyone knew what we were talking about.  It was not just a matter of whether the payment was taxable but rather when the tax would be paid.  They cannot now, having had that debate, in which many people were involved, pretend it would never be taxable.</p><p>Some have argued that the PUP is an urgent needs payment and, therefore, is exempt from tax by virtue of section 13 of the Finance Act 2018, which exempted from tax a range of social welfare payments.  While it is the case that the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act referred to the PUP as a payment made under section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, which deals with what are commonly referred to as urgent needs payments, this was used merely as a vehicle to get payments out quickly to employees and self-employed persons who had lost their jobs due to Covid-19.  When Covid first emerged, the Government wanted to respond promptly.  If we had put the payment down as the equivalent of an unemployment allowance payment, it would have taken weeks to process and people would have been left stranded.  The Government took the view that we should help people on the spot, to put the cash in their hands within days of them requiring the payment, and the quickest mechanism was to get it through like an urgent needs payment, without the need for a detailed check and a community welfare officer having to check the person's circumstances.  The idea was to get it out quickly.</p><p>Section 202 of the 2005 Act facilitates urgent needs payments, which are processed quickly, and that was done.  It did not mean it was a supplementary welfare allowance payment, which it is not.  Many people would not accept the suggestion that anybody who was in work and is now out of work because of Covid would go on a supplementary welfare allowance payment.  People will argue that they were in work and lost work because of Covid, and similarly to the case of the jobseeker's benefit, if somebody is out of work due to no fault of his or her own, he or she should be able to claim the payment based on having been in work.  The payment is related to the person's work and he or she has an entitlement to it because he or she was paying PRSI contributions.</p><p>Everyone knows that if somebody is getting the jobseeker's benefit in such circumstances, he or she pays tax on it in due course.  It is applied to the person's taxable income at the end of the year, depending on the income that has been earned from employment.  We wanted it to be related to a person's work and PRSI contribution record, analogous to the jobseeker's benefit, but we also wanted to get it out promptly, which we did.  The only way of meeting both objectives was to treat it like an urgent needs payment, but not to classify it as a supplementary welfare allowance.  I do not suggest that everyone who got the PUP was on a supplementary welfare allowance because many people might not like to be forced into asking for a supplementary welfare allowance.  That is normally a difficult process in any event.  We used that section purely to get the payment out quickly.  The suggestion that we got the money out quickly as an excuse to say it should not be taxable like the jobseeker's benefit is not accurate.  The Government did the right thing   We got it out quickly and we used a mechanism to do that.  It is not to be confused with a supplementary welfare allowance.</p><p>Nevertheless, the PUP, by its nature, is not an urgent needs payment.  To return to my earlier point, this section concerns the treatment of taxation.  It has been implicit from day one that the PUP would be taxable.  This is where it gets complicated.  There are various headings relating to taxation in the tax code.  Cases I and II of Schedule D tax deals with trading and professional income, while cases III and IV deal with investment, foreign income and miscellaneous income.  The PUP, therefore, comes in under case IV of Schedule D.  Case V concerns rental income, while Schedule E covers employment income, the heading we are all used to.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A person in employment is taxed under Revenue rules and rules set out under Schedule E of the Finance Act.  Under Schedule E, people are entitled to tax credits and a PAYE allowance.  That PAYE allowance is specifically for people whose income from employment comes in under Schedule E.  As the PUP is not an income from employment, it does not come in under Schedule E in the tax code.  It is a miscellaneous income, which comes in under Case IV of Schedule D.  If I were to do what people have asked me to do and withdraw this section, it would make the situation dire.  I do not believe any of the Senators who asked for the section to be withdrawn understood the consequences of what they were asking me to do.</p><p>Under Schedule E, income from employment, a person is entitled to a PAYE allowance and a tax credit allowance.  There is no equivalent allowance in respect of PAYE allowance for income under Case IV, which is investment income, foreign income or miscellaneous income as in a social welfare payment.  The purpose of section 3 is to allow for the PAYE and tax credit allowances to be offset against the PUP so that people will not be paying tax on it, save for the &euro;1.40 per week people will pay over a four-year period if they were in receipt of the PUP for the full period.  If we withdrew this section, a person in receipt of the PUP would not be able to offset against that payment the normal PAYE allowance or tax credits he or she would have if in employment and in receipt of an income from that employment.  There are two different strands of employment for taxation purposes, one of which is an employment in respect of which those allowances are available.  Section 3 provides for these allowances that are normally only available to people who receive income directly from an employer also to be offset against the pandemic unemployment payment.  If we did not allow that, the PUP would be 100% taxable.</p><p>The legislation is complicated.  This section provides for the normal allowances that a person would have to be offset against the pandemic unemployment payment because it is a different category of income under the existing Tax Acts.  If we did not do this and we withdrew this section, the PUP would be 100% taxable from day one and recipients of it would have no benefit from a PAYE allowance or tax credits.  I have gone a long way around the house to explain it.  I hope I have explained it.  I am not reading from a script.  I am trying to explain this in a way such that people listening get the message of what I am saying.  I am convinced 99% of the people who have been talking about this do not understand the intricacies of it.  We are paid as Oireachtas Members to go through things line by line and we are doing so here today.  We are doing a good job in allowing section 3 to remain in the Act so that the PUP will not be taxed to the extent it would be taxed if we did not allow the tax credits and PAYE allowances to be offset against it.</p><p>This is not about taxes.  Rather, it is about allowing the normal reliefs that a person in employment would have against tax to be offset against the PUP.  As I said earlier in my initial reply, this is about taxation treatment and not whether the payment is taxable.  It is taxable but this is about the treatment of it.  This provision seeks to ensure people in receipt of PUP do not fall into an unforeseen tax net.  I hope when people understand what section 3 is about, they will see 100% merit in it.</p><p>I cannot accept the amendment because there would be uproar tomorrow morning if people learned they could not offset their PAYE allowance and tax credits against their pandemic unemployment payment.  We are doing a good job here today.  I accept it is tricky to understand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-11a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121100002#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed and considered response.  I would like to make three points.  It is well within the power of the Government to allow on a <i>pro rata</i>basis the application of the PAYE allowance and personal tax credit during this tax year.  It is within the power of the Government to allow those tax credits to apply against whatever earned income is generated in 2020.  My understanding of the Minister of State's response is that it is a dressing up the section as an act of charity or mercy to those who have been on the PUP and are earning again in 2020 and that if the section is withdrawn the PUP will be 100% taxable.  It is within the wherewithal of Government to apply an amendment here that allows the application of the tax credits.</p><p>As I understand it, for 20.5 weeks this payment was considered a supplementary welfare payment.  Under the tax code, that payment is not taxable.  On 5 August the status of that payment was changed to make it taxable and now, in December, the Government is trying to change the status of the payment retrospectively from 13 March to 5 August.  I do not think that is necessary.  The Minister of State has given no figures in terms of how much is likely to be generated.  If he thinks it will sufficient to blow a hole in the public finances, then let us have that conversation.  Thus far, there is no evidence as to what it will generate other than fear and anxiety among workers.</p><p>It is good that there is a four-year period for repayment.  Let us call a spade a spade.  This means five years of workers living with this hanging over them.  Workers will have to repay tax because they were misfortunate enough to have lost their jobs because of the pandemic.  I think we can do better.</p><p>The Minister of State made the point that to put the tax treatment of the PUP in place in March would have taken weeks.  To me, that is a nonsense.  As a new Senator I sat in this House in the months of July and August when we passed legislation dealing with billions of euro in one day.  We have taken all Stages of a Bill in one day.  It was within the power of the Government to make this payment taxable in March but it chose not to do so.  It did so in August and we cannot go back and rewrite that, but the Government can apply the tax credits for earned income for this year and ensure that the 20.5 weeks of the PUP between 13 March and 5 August are not taxable.  I reiterate the call for the Minister of State to withdraw or amend section 3.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-11a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121100002#D00300"><p>Potentially, the Minister of State has made the case for amending the section rather than not commencing it.  He has not made the case for taxing income between March and August other than the narrative that the Government said it would do it.  In my five or six years as a Senator I have heard a great deal said by Ministers, some of which has not happened, but some of which has.</p> <p>We are not simply talking about the Revenue code although the Minister of State talked at great length about it.  Nobody has argued against the move from Schedule D to Schedule E or the taxability of income since August.  That is not the case.  It would be a misrepresentation of the arguments being made to suggest that that is what is being sought.  People are looking for solutions for the Minister of State.  We are on Committee Stage.  Perhaps the Minister of State is correct that an amendment would be a better way to address it that would capture the nuance so that we ensure we do move all the payments since August into Schedule E rather than Schedule D, Case IV.</p> <p>The key point remains that it was in the social welfare legislation that the decision was made in terms of where this was placed.  There has been much commentary and rhetoric around what the Minister of State said or what was said in the Chamber.  I regularly argue for tax.  I am looking at this legislatively as somebody who is often arguing for tax.  I am in favour, in general, of taxation but I am not in favour of it being retrospectively applied.  We have multiple cases where, for example, Ministers have spoken about unforeseen loopholes in regard to corporation tax and they were not panning out as planned even when that was well signalled.  I am thinking, for example, about capital gains tax, how the capital gains tax waiver was above, and I am thinking of some of the schemes in regard to real estate investment trusts, REITs and so on.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, I have never yet seen a Minister refer back and say "This was not doing what we thought it would do and our intention was clear when we spoke".  In fact, in any case where there has been anything remotely resembling a tax gap, a potential relief, an allowance or a loophole in the case of some corporations that could be exploited, it has been left until it has been fixed legislatively.</p><p>This is not an argument against the urgency of the payment.  It was the right thing to do and I supported it.  Members of the last Seanad came to the House from our various election campaigns for the Seanad to pass that legislation.  I did and still applaud the State for introducing an urgent payment.  It was worth it for what it did in keeping our economy and society together.  It was a social cohesion measure which has been praised.  That was worth it, as will be forgoing two or three months extra payments, which will be very small although we have not heard the amount it will gain.  It will be very significant on a family and household but not significant for the State.  That is also worth it.  I am not saying the Government should not have done it this or that way but that it did the right thing by introducing a payment quickly.</p><p>As Senator Sherlock said, we would have allowed for it to be properly put in another location, if the Minister of State wished, but that was not the choice.  That is not what we are criticising.  We are saying that legislatively, in terms of the placing of this payment in the social welfare code, the basis the Minister of State has been citing and the description he has given are based on the legislation that was introduced on 5 August.  We should deal with the period from 5 August to now and should regard the other as it was, an exceptional needs payment which came from that relevant part of the social welfare code, the part which Senator Gavan has cited that contains such payments.  We should be very glad of it and what it did for households and we should continue in the same spirit of understanding that the resilience of households is the resilience of our State.</p></speech>

At the risk of repeating myself, this payment was quite correctly introduced as an urgent needs payment.  Under the Finance Act 2018, an urgent needs payment is exempt from income tax.  Saying that the Government said it would be taxable does not matter.  What matters is how the Government introduced the payment.  It was introduced as an urgent needs payment and such payments are exempt from tax.  I do not know if the Minister of State is a fan of Doctor Who, who likes to travel back in time in the Tardis.  The Minister of State does not have that power, and I am surprised that he might think he does.  He is basing his argument on the legislation of 5 August, but we know how this was introduced.  We support how it was introduced.  It received universal support.  It appears to be extremely mean-spirited to try to recoup some of these moneys now.  It will bring hardship to families.</p> <p>Frankly, I am surprised that this is a message Fianna F&aacute;il is prepared to convey because there will be repercussions from families in terms of how they feel about Fianna F&aacute;il.  They do not feel great about it at present according to the opinion polls.  This is another massive misstep.  It is not even going to bring in much money in gross terms, so it does not make sense from a revenue perspective.  In addition, the Minister of State is not addressing the key point, which is that this payment is exempt from tax under the Finance Act 2018.  If somebody challenges it, the Minister of State will have to eat all the words he said this morning.  It is far better to accept the suggestions of my colleagues, particularly that of Senator Sherlock, and fix it without going down this route.</p></speech>

The date of 5 August was mentioned because it was put on a statutory footing, but Senator Sherlock says it should be in the power of the Government to sort this out.  Thank God we live in a democracy and the Government cannot do what it likes.  It must go to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to change legislation when it affects people's income.  I am worried about what the Senator suggested, that if she felt it was appropriate, the Government could change the taxation of people's earned or unearned income.  That is what she said - can the Government not do it?  A Government has no authority-----</p></speech>

No Minister can unilaterally change anything when it comes to these taxation matters, and I say "Thank God" for that and that we have a parliament.  I would not like to have the route that was suggested.  It might not have been intentionally suggested, but that is what was said today.</p> <p>The other point I wish to make is important.  There is a Schedule to the social welfare legislation of social welfare payments that are exempt from income tax.  The same Schedule is included in the Finance Act 2018.  If something is on that Schedule, it is exempt from tax.  Every other social welfare payment is taxable.  The only ones that are not taxable are those on the list of payments exempt from tax.  The PUP did not exist when that Schedule was put in the Finance Act two years ago, so by definition, PUP is not on the list of payments that are exempt from tax.  It could not be.  Now the Senators are going back in time and asking us to have the PUP listed in 2018 as a payment of income that is exempt.  That is the logic of what Senator Gavan said.  To make the case, he quoted the 2018 Act that has a list of the exempted payments and he is saying it is a supplementary welfare allowance or an urgent needs payment.  It is not a supplementary welfare allowance payment, which is in that Schedule.  This is not a supplementary welfare allowance and, by definition, it is not in the Schedules to the Social Welfare Acts or the Finance Acts.  The PUP was never listed as a payment that is exempt from income tax so, by definition, it is taxable.</p> <p>I am worried about what I have heard today.  Where a person lost his or her job this year, unconnected to Covid and as happened this year and happens every year, and the person goes on jobseeker's benefit, I am shocked that there is a move here today to say that those people who lost their jobs through no fault of theirs and are on jobseeker's benefit should be taxable - Members are not arguing otherwise, and it is taxable - but the person next door who lost his or her job because of Covid should get his or her payment tax free.  I am shocked to hear Members picking out people who are getting a payment for loss of income this year and saying some should be taxed, such as the people on jobseeker's benefit, while those on the other payment because of Covid should not be taxed on the same amount, and sometimes it can even be a higher weekly payment.  I am surprised to hear that case being made here.  It is the logic of what has been said.</p> <p>I have made it very clear.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government cannot do it.  It came in and was taxable at the beginning.  We passed the legislation on 5 August and that was the formality of it.  The purpose of this section is to give retrospective benefit to allow people who have got the PUP to claim the PAYE credit allowance and the tax credit allowance.  Section 3 is a retrospective measure which benefits people who receive the PUP.  It is not charity.  It is their entitlement, having been at work, lost their jobs due to Covid and gone on the PUP.  As the payment is not from their employer, it does not come under the normal PAYE tax credit rules.  We recognise that and for the avoidance of all doubt we are amending it to say the PAYE credits and tax credits a person would get if they were in employment can be used while they are on the PUP.  We are making a retrospective move to benefit people who went on the PUP.  Without this section, we would be penalising those people to no end.</p><p>The effect of being asked to withdraw or change this is that, although the Senator is setting out to say it should not be taxable, her recommendation, if passed, would make it 100% taxable without the benefit of being able to have the PAYE allowance or the tax credit offset against it.  I know that was not her intention as nobody in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or Seanad &Eacute;ireann would suggest that.  We are removing all doubt, just in case somebody made that case without this section in the legislation.  It could have been 100% taxable so we are doing this to remove doubt on this matter.  I hope I am making myself clear.  That is the position.  If this recommendation were accepted, everybody would get a massive bill for tax on PUP unless we allow these allowances to be offset against it.</p></speech>

Then the Minister of State came back again to contribute completely inaccurate perspectives in respect of the taxation of other unemployment payments and to suggest that anyone who says the Government could take action is suggesting Executive power by the Government with no recourse to the Parliament.  I ask the Minister of State if, by his own logic, every single time any Member of this House or any Minister refers to "the Government" in future, they should refer to "the Government with the permission of the Oireachtas, having followed due process".  That is what they will have to say.</p> <p>As the Cathaoirleach acknowledged, Report Stage is coming and the Minister of State's hands are not tied.

The Government can bring forward recommendations which would ensure what we all want, namely, that PAYE benefits and so forth under Schedule E would continue to be allowed in respect of taxation on payments since 5 August, but not including March to August.  The period from March to August is at the nub of the issue raised and, with respect, the Government has the power, in bringing this Bill through the Oireachtas, to introduce a Report Stage recommendation to address the issue.  The only question is why the Minister of State is not choosing to table such a recommendation to exclude the months from March to August in respect of the measures of the Bill.  The power sits with the Government to propose it.  We can only make recommendations as Opposition Members of the House during debates on the Finance Bill.  The power lies with the Government to bring forward those proposals and I imagine they would get the permission of this House.</p></speech>

Everybody wants taxation applied fairly across the board and everybody should be treated equally.  My understanding is we all receive tax credits and how we use them is up to ourselves.  If I was on the PUP from March until August which I was not able to use the tax credits for, they are accumulated into the period after that.  Is the Minister of State saying I can use them retrospectively in relation to the income I earned in that period or use them in relation to any additional income I received from August onwards?  It is an annual credit and it is up to me to decide how I use it.  I can use it for income since August or retrospectively in relation to the PUP from March until August.  If I was to apply my tax credits to the PUP from March until August, what will my tax liabilities be?  Will the Minister of State answer that?  My understanding is that I get a personal tax credit, the same as everybody in here.  I can decide to use that credit for my income in the Oireachtas or my income in relation to my business in the hotel.  That is my choice.  If I was an individual on the PUP for those months and I accumulated those tax credits over that period, I can use that moving forward or I now have to option to use it retrospectively in relation to the payment I received.  Perhaps I am wrong but that is the understanding I am getting from the debate.  I think everybody agrees that the taxation system should be applied fairly and equally to everybody.</p></speech>

I thought it was implicit in my comments that I was asking the Government to put forward a recommendation in the context of this Bill coming through our House.  Senator Higgins has eloquently articulated how it is well within the power of the Government to bring forward recommendations on Report Stage.  I am disappointed that the Minister of State would seek to attribute comments to me that are a complete misrepresentation of what I said.</p></speech>

It is a source of regret to me as a new Senator that, when a Minister of State has his back to the wall and is looking for arguments, he would seek to attribute to me something that I simply did not say.  It is most disappointing that the Minister of State made that comment.  I have made my comments on the section and I urge that we move on because we have a large number of recommendations to get through and it is not productive that we are back and forth in this fashion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-11a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121100002#F01100"><p>I take the Senator's clarification on what she meant.  She meant the Government here in the Oireachtas tabling the recommendation.  I interpreted her as suggesting the Government could unilaterally make a change by statutory instrument, through a Minister in his office.  I accept she meant the Government could put it through the House because it has the numbers to do so.  I take the point.  I interpreted it one way and the Senator is clarifying that is not what she meant.  I accept that.</p> <p>It is important to recognise that the PAYE credit is &euro;1,650 per annum.  That is the maximum.  Nobody has the entitlement to get &euro;1,650.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It depends on whether one has the taxable income to attract the credit.  It is like social protection payments.  When we discuss the headline figure for jobseeker's allowance, that is the maximum rate, but not everyone can get the maximum.  Similarly, &euro;1,650 is the maximum PAYE credit above which one cannot claim.  There is no guarantee that one has an entitlement to claim all of it either.  It depends on one's income.</p><p>I want people to understand another point.  I want to help the Senators, although they might not like me putting it this way.  I urge them not to oppose section 3.  Taxation is complicated and we have Finance Bills of this nature every year.  We can see how various issues are handled year by year.  A social welfare payment does not fall under the normal earned income Schedule because it is not earned through employment.  Rather, it falls under a different Schedule.  Without section 3, the PUP would not have a social welfare payment's benefit of attracting the PAYE and other tax credits.  Section 3 provides that benefit.</p><p>I urge Senators to take my comments as being genuine.  If they vote against section 3, they are voting to prevent tax credits being used to offset the PUP.  If they were to win the vote, the PUP would be 100% taxable with no PAYE or other tax credits applicable.  We are proposing the section at this point because the Financial Bill is so technical.  It will ensure that the maximum credits can be set against the PUP.  To vote otherwise would be to prevent that and tax the PUP.  I know that is not Senators' intention, but it is what would happen if section 3 was not included.  We have ventilated this matter a great deal.  The section is designed to help people who unfortunately had to go on the PUP.</p></speech>

There is an error in the ruling.  This is an issue the Minister of State may also very well be interested in.  The purpose of the amendment is to address an abuse, as I see it, in the current availing of the artists' tax exemption.  The effect of my recommendation, of course, because it is not an amendment being a money Bill, would be that a provision in the tax code that allows those responsible for works of artistic or cultural merit to avail of a tax break of up to a limit of &euro;50,000 tax-free earnings in the year in which the exemption is granted would not apply to public representatives, Oireachtas Members, retired public servants in receipt of a pension of &euro;20,000 or more, or those who have earned at least &euro;100,000 in any of the preceding three tax years.  The artists' tax exemption was originally introduced in 1969 by Charles Haughey.</p></speech>

This was a provision of the tax code designed to prevent artists from starving in the garret.  The reason I believe this is wrongly decided is that Standing Order 41, under which the recommendation has been ruled out of order, states: "An amendment to a Bill, which could have the effect of imposing or increasing a charge upon the people or upon the revenue, may not be moved save by way of Government amendment."  Obviously we will have to allow that we are not talking about amendments here.</p></speech>

The issue is not what the recommendation is about.  The issue is whether this is a recommendation that can be properly excluded under the terms of the Standing Order 41.  If the Leas-Chathaoirleach bears with me, I will explain.  A charge "upon the revenue" clearly means a lessening of revenue coming in.  This recommendation of mine does not propose a tax break.</p></speech>

A charge upon the people means a public expense.  An increase of a charge upon the people means an increase in that public expense.  The narrowing of an exemption under the tax code is not the imposition or the increase of a public expense.  It is not a charge upon the people.</p></speech>

In this context it surely means within this limitation we should, therefore, otherwise have the broadest latitude.  Where there is an ambiguity in the meaning of the Standing Order, it surely has to be resolved against those who would impose the burden.  That would certainly be the precedent in contract law where we have the contra proferentem rule.  As far as I know, it is also a provision of statutory interpretation.  Where there is any ambiguity it is to be resolved in favour of the person who would bear the burden of what is being proposed.  I take what the Leas-Chathaoirleach has said on this and I thank him for allowing me to return to this issue.  I am a fortiori asking the Minister of State whether I am precluded from bringing forward this recommendation.  I ask him to pay special attention to it so the Government may bring it forward on Report Stage if it deems fit, leaving to me whatever other avenues I may have to seek clarification or, indeed, reversal of this ruling.</p></speech>

I might not agree with the exact letter of Senator Mullen's proposed recommendation of two of every three years.  To recognise the fact that sometimes artists will get a very large payment once in perhaps five or ten years, this might have been a better nuance, although there is value in the overall proposal to be examined.  Senator Mullen is correct in his interpretation of the Standing Order and it needs to be examined.  It came up last year on the Finance Bill-----</p></speech>

As Senators will be aware, the so-called artists' tax exemption was originally introduced by Charles Haughey, the former Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Finance in 1969.  When he spoke later in his life, in an interview in 2003, he spoke about the thinking behind this exemption.  He said it was designed to address the "sad history of our creative people going abroad for economic reasons or from what they felt was an unsympathetic or even hostile climate".  He stated, "I wished the modern Irish State to make a positive gesture to our creative people.  I wished to say to them, in effect, 'you are valued members of our community.  Your contribution is of unique importance.'"</p> <p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach will be interested to know that in the same interview he said a number of artists had said to him that from time to time without it they would not have been able to continue to devote themselves to their art.  We are all familiar with the culture, and even in some Italian operas we have the image of the artist starving for the sake of his or her work in the garret.  This is clearly what the artists' tax exemption was all about.  It was not meant to be about career politicians or highly paid sports people writing their memoirs and getting a significant tax exemption for it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Its aim was to encourage artistic creativity within the State and to give assistance and encouragement to those with creative talents.

I sat through a very interesting and important exchange on the previous section.  We have had a problem before with legislation going through the House in very short order where Ministers do not have time to engage with proposals that might be the subject of a Government amendment on Report Stage.  I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach's indulgence briefly.  I promise not to repeat anything.</p> <p>Artists' income is often low and infrequent.  We must work to prevent people with creative talents from taking those talents abroad.  Those are aims all Senators would fully support.  We have a proud tradition in literature, art and music.  Therefore, this expenditure on public funds, which is what the artist tax exemption is, is entirely justified.  However, we have known for at least 15 years that exemption has been availed of by individuals who are in no way low-paid or impecunious.  In addition, many who qualify are not even artists in the true sense of the word.  The exemption is being availed by a small number of persons who derive large incomes from other sectors, in many cases directly from the taxpayer.  They either have or have had successful careers in other sectors and yet they qualify for this exemption.  If my recommendation had been allowed to be discussed, it would have sought to change that by ensuring that high-earning individuals do not qualify for tax exemptions designed to assist low-earning artists.</p></speech>

It would result in a small number of the 3,000 or more people who quality for the exemption being excluded in future years.  This would not save the State a significant amount of money.  However, from the perspective of the integrity of our taxation system, particularly at a time of economic hardship for so many, it would send an important message.  We have already had an unfortunate controversy in recent weeks arising from the treatment of student nurses, contrasting starkly with the pay rises handed to Ministers, judges and other highly paid public servants.</p> <p>This recommendation would have helped - and if it is brought forward on Report Stage by the Government it will help - to undo in a small way the damage done by these controversies by ensuring that high-earning individuals on high wages, funded by taxpayers cannot avail of special treatment.</p> <p>The current scheme operates under section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which allows income from the sale of artistic works which have cultural and artistic merit to be exempted from income tax in certain circumstances, up to a limit, as the Minister of State knows, of &euro;50,000 tax free in the year in which the exemption is granted by Revenue.  Applications are made annually in respect of specific works, for example, a book, a play, a collection of art works and so on, rather than on a blanket basis for all works produced by an individual artist.</p> <p>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, you will be interested to know that what does or does not qualify as having cultural or artistic merit is assessed by the Revenue Commissioners but with advice from the Arts Council based on a set of guidelines put in place by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  You will also be interested to know that on at least one occasion, the Arts Council has expressed concern about how Revenue is interpreting the meaning and scope of the artist tax exemption.  That is why this important recommendation was brought before the House.</p> <p>The number of exemptions granted by Revenue has grown every year in recent years, rising from 2,840 in 2015 to 3,270 in 2018.  According to figures provided to the D&aacute;il recently by the Minister for Finance, the total amount of tax forgone under the scheme is an average of about &euro;11 million per annum over the past five years, which is a significant amount of money.</p></speech>

As I said, my issue with the operation of section 195 is that a number of people with high incomes are availing of the scheme.  Revenue has published a list of those granted the exemption from 1998 onwards.  You will be amazed by this a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  One serving public officeholder with a salary in excess of &euro;200,000 availed of the scheme.  A former public officeholder with a pension of &euro;138,000 availed of the scheme.  Four separate exemptions were granted to serving Members of the Oireachtas, whose salaries were between &euro;66,000 and &euro;87,000 at the time they qualified.</p></speech>

I want to make important points for the Minister of State to consider ahead of Report Stage.  The threshold of &euro;20,000 for retired public officeholder is reasonable.  It will ensure that individuals who have served only for a short time and who might have a relatively small or no pension at all would not be excluded from qualifying.</p> <p>As I mentioned earlier, one exemption of &euro;20,000 was granted to a former officeholder.  Any person who earned &euro;100,000 in taxable income in any of the last three tax years would not qualify for the exemption.  I am very much persuaded by what Senator Higgins just said that perhaps this should be tweaked to provide for two of the previous tax years.  The Minister of State might bear that in mind if he is in any way engaged by the substance of this proposed recommendation.</p> <p>That would apply regardless of the person's profession or employment status or indeed whether he or she was public figures or not.</p></speech>

It is the question of whether non-fictional books are involved.  Most of the small number of people who would be excluded from this scheme had this recommendation been in place in previous years were granted the exemption in respect of books that were political memoirs.  It seems that the granting of the exemption in respect of non-fiction books such as these has been a bone of contention between the Revenue Commissioners and the Arts Council, which are the bodies that manage the section 195 scheme, for more than a decade.  In 2013, the Arts Council complained to Revenue that its role in this was being undermined by the tendency of Revenue to grant exemptions to "ghost written sports biographies" and "political memoirs".  I think the Leas-Chathaoirleach will agree that there is not a word of repetition in what I am saying so I ask him to let me conclude this important point.  The ministerial guidelines say that for non-fiction books to be considered, they should have a cultural theme such as a biography or autobiography of a writer or painter.  In other words, the book must relate to art and creativity in a direct way if it is a non-fiction book such as a biography or autobiography.  That shows how far we have come from the original meaning, aim and intended scope of the artist's exemption.  Even then, according to the ministerial guidelines, a non-fiction book should only qualify if it is a pioneering work casting new light on its subject matter or changing the generally accepted understanding of the subject matter.  That would be in the context of a biography of an artist or writer.  I have to say, and I imagine most colleagues would agree with me, that it is difficult to see how political memoirs or collections of amusing political anecdotes would qualify as pioneering works that cast new light on the subject matter of politics.  Political memoirs are of value to our political system since they inform the general population about matters of political and historical merit but they could hardly be described as having artistic merit so the fact that they qualify for this exemption is highly questionable.  The same can be said for memoirs of sporting figures.</p><p>There appear to be broader issues about how the scheme is administered by Revenue and the Arts Council.  Between 2004 and 2013, 46 appeals were made against unsuccessful applications for the exemption, of which 56% were successful.  That seems to be a very high - a suspiciously high - success rate for an appeals process and it prompts its own questions.  The Arts Council also provides expert opinions to Revenue in the event of an appeal.  In 2013, the Arts Council complained that "all manner of appeals are upheld" and that it felt that some determinations by Revenue implied that the council considered sporting books in particular to be of artistic or cultural merit.  I do not intend to be a snob about this.  I get the cultural merit of sport but we are still a long way from the intention behind the artist's exemption.</p></speech>

Clearly, the ministerial guidelines that apply to the grant of this exemption need to be reassessed so that these strange inconsistencies are ironed out and an exemption that was designed to promote and encourage artistic expression should do just that and no more.</p> <p>In conclusion, and I mean this literally, there are issues I have just mentioned that go beyond the scope of the recommendation.  The recommendation I was proposing today would iron out a main glaring inconsistency in the operation of section 195, specifically, that it is being availed of by high-earning figures in the political, media and sporting world, many of whom are being paid - and paid handsomely in some cases - by the taxpayer.  The current state of the national finances and the significant challenges faced by ordinary working people demand that we make changes such as this to our tax code to ensure that high earners pay their share.  This is not going to change the world or save the Exchequer a huge amount of money but what it would do is send a message to the taxpayer that there is prudent management of the resources coming into the State and that includes ensuring that tax exemptions are not abused, and I do not mean that in any morally judgmental way, by high earners for whom the exemption was never intended.</p></speech>

From what I understand, he had a recommendation that was ruled out of order.  The recommendation was effectively to insert a new section between sections 3 and 4.  Section 4 is about home sharing host allowances in respect of the HSE providing a tax allowance for people looking after people in their houses so it is not connected to anything we have discussed to date.  The contribution we heard is certainly nothing to do with section 4.  It was in respect of a recommendation that was ruled out of order, which involved a new section, but I will take on board everything the Senator said.  That is all I can say.</p></speech>

My recommendation has been ruled out of order on a technicality and as a result, I was advised by the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach that I was within my rights to speak to the section.</p> <p>What I am saying is that section 4 should include a recommendation of the kind I am making, which proposes the insertion of a new section 5 that would amend section 195 of the principal Act.  If the Minister of State is going to talk in respect of the content of the recommendation I am proposing being different in its scope to other matters covered within the section and to claim in this House that there is no such thing as a Bill of an omnibus nature or a Bill that treat of different issues, I can tell him that only a few weeks ago, we had considerable debate in the Seanad about how completely discrete issues were tacked into the same piece of legislation at the last moment.  I seem to recall that it was in the context of the mother and baby homes commission legislation.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to credit this House with some intelligence by sharing his thoughts with it.  He is a fine legislator who knows his stuff so he knows as well as I do that it is no argument against the possible inclusion of this recommendation were the Government to have brought it forward that it somehow differs in scope, content or application from other things that might be covered under section 4 of the Bill.  I ask the Minister of State for his specific response to my procedural point because he seems to be suggesting that not only does he not have to engage with what I have said because my proposed recommendation was ruled out of order, even if it had not been ruled out of order, there is no need to engage with it-----</p></speech>

The Minister of State seems to be saying that even if my recommendation had not been ruled out of order, there is no need to engage with it because the scope of it is somehow different to other matters treated within section 4 of the legislation.  That is certainly a very novel approach to legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The better approach would be to acknowledge that the recommendation has been deemed out of order but that it is not out of order for the Government to take good lawmaking seriously and to consider what I am trying to do on its merits, not on the basis of whether, as a mere Senator, I am entitled under Standing Order 41 to make a proposal of this kind.  The Government should make a call on whether there is merit in the proposal and, on that basis, bring forward a proposal on Report Stage.

My only point was that we are on section 4.  I just want people to know what we are talking about in this section of the Finance Bill.  I will not read out the section in full.  It amends section 192BA of the principal Act, relating to an exemption in respect of certain payments made or authorised by the Child and Family Agency.  Section 4, which this debate has been connected to, is about payments by Tusla and their tax treatment.</p> <p>I will put it this way.  I will give Senator Mullen 100% for creativity for being able to link the debate on the artists' exemption to the tax treatment of a payment by Tusla to a host sharing a house.  That is what section 4 is about.  I accept that it might be possible, if one is exceptionally creative, to link the debate we have had to the Tusla payment.  My understanding of the recommendation was that it was ruled out of order.  Essentially, it sought to insert a new section.  The recommendation we are discussing has been ruled out of order, and not by me.  Senator Mullen has raised an issue discussion on which has been ruled out of order but the Leas-Chathaoirleach has facilitated that discussion.  I was ready to deal with section 4, which is about a payment by Tusla.  I understand that the exemption of certain earnings of writers, composers and artists allows the Revenue Commissioners to make a determination in respect of artistic works in the following categories only: a book or other writing, a play, a musical composition, a painting or other like picture, or a sculpture.</p> <p>The Senator has made a good point, and perhaps it can be addressed by the House again separately.  Guidelines are drawn up by the Arts Council and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to determine whether a work which falls within the scope of the activity listed in the section is an original or creative work and whether it has or is generally recognised as having a cultural or artistic merit and consequently can qualify for the exemption.  The Senator makes the point that the Revenue does not adhere to these guidelines and regularly grants the exemption where, the Senator claims, the Arts Council has voiced criticism at the Revenue's approach in that regard.  Again, the policy basis for the artists' exemption is to provide further encouragement to creative artists in our midst and to help create a sympathetic environment in which the arts can flourish.  I do not see how it is relevant to the objective of the measure to exclude a person solely on the basis of his or her former employment.  A work could be artistic, but the purpose of the Senator's recommendation is to exclude people from the exemption based on their former employment.</p> <p>I was a little surprised the Senator went so hard and was so specific in referring to a particular highly paid individual who availed of the exemption.  He did not refer to a name but he clearly publicly identified the person in this House in respect of their tax affairs.  I was surprised by the specific nature of where the Senator went in that regard.  That person is identifiable, not specifically here today, but identifiable to many people listening to the debate.  I was surprised the Senator went that far.  As I am sure he will agree, however, artists' inspiration and talent can be found in all unexpected places, even among public servants and public representatives, so we should not be excluded solely on the basis of our previous occupation.</p> <p>As the Senator has said, the cap was previously &euro;40,000 and has been raised to &euro;50,000.  In light of that, I do not believe it is necessary to limit further the relief to those who had a particular income outside the scheme in any of the three previous years.  Creativity and talent can be found everywhere, including among public servants and politicians, and it is not right to exclude from the scheme, solely on the basis of the category of his or her previous employment, somebody who would otherwise meet the criteria of the scheme.</p> <p>I take on board what the Senator has said.  The topic he has raised merits a serious debate in its own right.  I suggest that some mechanism be found for a serious debate on the issue he has raised.  It is not, however, relevant to the HSE home sharing tax allowance, the payment by Tusla detailed in section 4.  I have tried to respond as best I can to the substance of the debate raised by the Senator.</p></speech>

First, I am going to do something that is relatively unusual in this House.  I will apologise and say I was wrong on one point.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State is correct because I now understand what he was saying about the purpose of the section.  What I was clearly proposing here was the insertion of a new section 5, thereby renumbering all succeeding sections.  Therefore, the Minister of State's question about that issue appears to have been, since we are at this point speaking on section 4, why should I speak on the insertion of a new section 5?  In answer to that, while I apologise and say he is absolutely right on that point, I would follow on from his point in saying that what I should then do is speak to section 5 and suggest that we should not accept section 5 because the section 5 we should accept should be my proposed section 5.  I am not sure a whole lot rides on the Minister of State's intervention if he thinks about the implications of what he has said.  I grant that he is literally correct but, as I said, the implications of what he has said suggest that it is something of an absurdity, although he was literally correct.</p> <p>I wish to note something else in passing.  The Minister of State is a bright man, and I have no doubt that he has his own views on the artists' exemption, but he did not come here today entirely unprepared or unbriefed on the subject.  That makes its own point about the farcical nature of the exclusions under the-----</p></speech>

However, the fact is that the artist exemption was designed to protect those who were at risk of poverty.  In reverse order, the two legs of the proposed recommendation were as follows: a person who, in any of the three years preceding the assessment, was in receipt of income in excess &euro;100,000.  Such a person is not at risk of poverty.  That is the merit of that part of it, and it applies to anybody, regardless of whether he or she is a public servant or not.  As the Minister of State knows, the first leg of the recommendation concerned serving officeholders - I named the kinds of officeholders involved - or a person in receipt of a pension in excess of &euro;20,000.  The reason for limiting it to a public servant in that situation, as opposed to, for example, someone in the private sector who might have a pension of &euro;30,000, is that members of the public sector enjoy particular advantages.  I do not need tell the Minister of State the difference between a defined benefit and a defined contribution pension scheme.</p></speech>

There is a very obvious difference between being Member of the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, a judge or the Attorney General, or someone like that, and being in the private sector.  It is generally speaking that we are cushioned in a way that people in the private sector and county councillors are not.</p></speech>

I do not know if the Minister of State is suggesting, for example, that there is some kind of constitutional obstacle to placing this kind of particular burden on public officeholders.  There certainly was not a constitutional obstacle to the pension related deduction that was introduced after the financial crash.  Therefore, there is a clear rationale and I ask the Minister of State to reflect on it, and not just him personally.  With the greatest of respect to the Minister of State, as he has seen, I have been willing to acknowledge the bona fides of his argument where it eventually became clear to me, and I apologise for my own slowness in that respect.  However, I ask him to take this recommendation on its merits and not just to fob it off by saying that it is useful for a discussion at another time.  Now is the time.</p></speech>

Section 7 amends section 477C(5A) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to extend the enhanced help to buy relief.  The help-to-buy scheme provides income tax relief to assist first-time buyers with obtaining the deposit required to purchase or build their first home.  The enhanced help-to-buy relief is set to expire on 31 December 2020 and this section provides for an extension of the enhanced relief by 12 months to 31 December 2021.  The Government's policy change allows first-time buyers purchasing a newly built home or building one themselves to claim back up to &euro;30,000 in income tax paid, as well deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, on bank deposit interest, over the last four years.  As previously, people cannot claim back either universal social charge or PRSI paid over that period.  This is a substantial increase on the current rules that allow home purchasers to claim back a maximum of &euro;20,000.  It doubles the purchase price the scheme can cover.  Under the scheme, people can claim up to 10% of the price on houses priced up to &euro;300,000, or &euro;30,000 on more expensive properties up to a maximum value of &euro;500,000.</p><p>Covid-19 has severely stunted house building, reducing the number of new builds available to those using the help-to-buy scheme.  There is no guarantee that the extra &euro;10,000 will make homes more affordable and there are reasons to believe it will push up prices.  Indeed, speaking at an ESRI conference on budget 2021 on 16 October, Dr. Barra Roantree said:</p> <blockquote> 	It is likely to fuel property price growth.  So, it will push up prices  </blockquote> <p>When the hospitality sector sought a dramatic VAT cut in the stimulus plan, it was quite transparent that it did not intend to pass that on to customers but wanted to allow businesses to recover margins.  With current supply constraints, the expanded help-to-buy scheme will likely deliver precisely that outcome for developers.  There is also a distributional and equity issue regarding the policy change.  The most recent data show that 40% of those who availed of the help-to-buy scheme already had the required deposit to secure a mortgage. </p></speech>

The figures show that 16,412 people applied for the help-to-buy scheme from January to November and even more people have applied in the last few months.  If the Senator were successful in removing the section, can he imagine how many first-time buyers would be let down by him and Sinn F&eacute;in?  The UK has brought in a similar scheme, which is a tax-free loan of up to 40% for first-time buyers.  In Ireland we are only giving them up to 10%.  It is not ideal that we have to intervene in the market and provide such schemes but there needs to be some incentive for builders in the short term to increase supply.  This scheme has worked.  It has helped young couples who have been paying rent as they do not have to put money aside for a deposit.  The help-to-buy scheme is one way of overcoming that requirement.  It is very welcome and we acted before the UK when it came to the scheme.  We were in there first.  Generally, we follow its legislation but in this case it has brought in similar legislation to ours.  One of the better elements in the UK legislation is that if builders want to benefit from the help-to-buy scheme or engage with it, they have to comply with extra standards of house building and extra requirements.  That might be something for the Department to look at, in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It is a very helpful scheme.  There could be improvements but I do not agree with Senator Gavan's opposition to the section.</p></speech>

Having been on the housing committee during the previous D&aacute;il, I have a fair and deep understanding of this issue.  The same cases were made when the initial scheme was brought in and they were proved incorrect.  In the absence of affordability, the State needs to intervene to give young couples who aspire to own their own homes that opportunity.  It might not be the ideal solution but it is a solution that gives families hope of owning their own homes.  This scheme did not increase house prices when it was introduced originally and there was a shortage at that time.  We have now increased it by another &euro;10,000 and I guarantee that the same sceptics will make the same comments they made when the help-to-buy scheme was first brought in.</p> <p>I have no problem with supporting anything that helps a family own their own home.  Our party is strongly behind home ownership, unlike Senator Gavan's party, which does not stand behind home ownership.  It believes everyone should rent for the rest of their lives.  We are a party that believes families should own their homes.  There is no alternative.  This scheme has been successful and should be supported and all Sinn F&eacute;in wants to do is remove it completely.  There is only this scheme, and a shared equity scheme which the Minister for housing will be launching shortly, to allow families the opportunity to own their own homes while we try to tackle the bigger challenge of dealing with affordability in the long term.</p></speech>

Second-hand house prices are rising more dramatically than new house prices.  This scheme tries to put extra stock into circulation.  There have been huge complications in Dublin where some funds have bought large numbers of units.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify this but as far as I am aware these funds cannot claim the first-time buyer's grant on these properties as well.  These two things are certainly helping first-time buyers and are bringing more stock into the market, because that is a problem.  Builders are not jumping up and down and we are not being overrun by new builds, as Senator Gavan knows.  Unfortunately, we still have to try to coax builders into building at present.  That is just the market we are in and if there is anything we can do in that regard, we should do it.  This scheme has been successful.  It is not a miracle cure by any stretch of the imagination.  In England, new homes have no VAT on them and that would certainly be a prudent way to go forward.  People could say the same thing about that and claim that builders would only use it for profit.  I support this section.</p></speech>

I am in favour of supporting first-time buyers but one of the reasons they need support is that they are up against speculative purchasers that are also helped by other schemes which outweigh this one.  They are in a situation where builders have been allowed to hoard land for strategic housing developments, get planning permission and not deliver on that housing.  That is creating a shrunken market in which investors are disproportionately powerful.  I do not have a fundamental objection to this scheme but it is a band-aid and we are allowing the wounds in the system to continue untreated.  That is my concern.</p></speech>

To briefly summarise, the help-to-buy scheme announced in budget 2017 is an income tax incentive measure designed to assist first-time buyers with a deposit required to purchase or self-build a new home or apartment to live in as their home.  The relief is only available in respect of new builds with a view to increasing supply.  This measure is to encourage supply, more housebuilding and more opportunities for people to buy a house.  Building more houses will help in keeping prices down.  If supply is tight, prices can be higher.  This measure is to encourage supply and to encourage people to purchase their own homes.  The issue of funds investing in companies or otherwise to carry out development for rental purposes is not part of the amendment we are discussing here today.</p> <p>As stated, this is a measure to encourage supply and to assist people in buying their first home and getting their foot on the ladder in a home to live in.  I can think of nothing more important in society today than helping people to own their own homes.  I cannot accept the proposal that this should not be accepted and I support this section.</p></speech>

It is outside the scope of this Bill to retrospectively tax them but it is a marker that we need to review, which is why I am encouraging the Minister to prepare a report in order that we might look in our next budget at a new tax threshold for high wealth individuals.  Let us be in proportion.  Globally, the very wealthiest have increased wealth of &euro;10.2 trillion during the Covid-19 crisis.  For billionaires globally, there has been a 27.5% increase in their wealth during the pandemic.  Even at a time when many have struggled and when all involved in every kind of business, together with employees, and all of those different groups upon which we have debated at length, it is important to note that billionaires and indeed millionaires in many cases have become much more wealthy.  This is not an abstract issue talking about the 27.5% increase globally because in Ireland, the very wealthiest have increased their wealth by 7.3%.  Nobody is getting increases of that level of income when one talks about SMEs or PAYE employees but for the very wealthy in Ireland, the 300 individuals who have wealth of &euro;93.7 billion between them, there has been a 7.3% increase in their wealth.  It is very reasonable to ask those who have become extremely wealthy, at a time when every other part of society and of our economy has been strained and pressed to the pin of their collar, to pay little bit more.  This would give the Minister of State the option of looking at what might be the case to introduce a threshold for high wealth individuals.  </p><p>We are not talking about those people on &euro;100,000 a year, as was discussed on a previous amendment, but are talking about those with net assets of &euro;10 million or more.  They can contribute more.  It is worth bearing in mind that in this crisis that has strained and pressed all of us, not only have the very wealthiest become much more wealthy, as I have said to the tune of billions and trillions of euro, but these people are also endangering us more in respect of the next crisis.  That is because the next crisis is climate change and a report from Oxfam this week pointed out that while those on lower incomes have decreased their emissions by 20% to 13%, the top 5% of the wealthy have increased their emissions by 3%, even at a time of significant climate crisis.  The top 1% of persons, that is again the super-wealthy that we are talking about - for example, the 300 individuals in Ireland but their equivalent globally - have increased their carbon emissions by 5%.</p><p>We have, then, the very wealthiest creating greater danger and jeopardy for us in the future by way of another crisis, which will be a significant crisis and will take a toll on our collective economy, and we are not asking that they increase what they contribute.  It is very reasonable that we would and I urge the Minister of State to do a report to look at this issue.  This recommendation does not require that to be done for this budget.  I urge everybody to bear in mind what we know, and this is not from left-wing economists but from mainstream economics, from the research of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the World Bank, and others.  There is no trickle-down from billionaires.  We know, and I have quoted this in previous Finance Bills, that research by the IMF over 30 years in more than 100 countries found that when one increase the income of the bottom 10%, the national GDP and the economy grows.  When one increases the income of those in the top 10%, it can actually be bad for the economy.  This is a chance to address and redress this issue.  We do not want to emerge from this crisis with an even more skewed and imbalanced economic system, as it does not serve any of us.</p></speech>

I am always fascinated by the fact that the one thing that neither of the conservative parties opposite ever concede to do is to try to measure the wealth in this country.  Every opportunity is taken to avoid doing that.  As Senator Higgins has so eloquently pointed out, there has been a huge gain in wealth for the wealthiest, the top 1% in this country.  All this recommendation is requesting is some information on this.  Why should anyone be afraid of a report detailing where that wealth is actually at?  Surely, in the interests of understanding where our country is that, all of us should be supporting the call for this report.</p></speech>

Wealth is highly mobile nowadays, which is why gold has doubled its value in the past three years and this has fed into a significant increase in the value in minerals, gold and stocks of that sort this year in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.  For all of these people, their wealth is highly mobile and is all over the world; not just in Ireland.  It is okay to say we have 300 people in Ireland with a net worth of a particular value and that it has increased by 7%.  I would be fearful if we started heavy taxation and targeting a section of society made up of 300 people as they would simply move out of our country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aidan Davitt:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2475"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2475&amp;amp;pid=AidanDavitt&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Those figures have been proven.

There is a special section within the Revenue Commissioners, known as the large cases - high wealth individuals division, deals with high wealth individuals.  It is important the public knows that these individuals are not treated in the same way as any other taxpayers.  There is a special section in Revenue which compiles information on individuals.  This is done through its knowledge of and co-operation under double-taxation agreements with Revenue authorities in other countries.  Revenue has a detailed list of everybody in the high wealth category.  These are high wealth individuals with assets in excess of &euro;20 million.  The previous threshold was &euro;50 million.  The Revenue previously dealt with this issue on the basis of assets worth in excess of &euro;50 million.  I will make a couple of points in that regard.</p> <p>There are people in Ireland who have high wealth assets, but little or no income.  They may have an investment here or a large family legacy located here but wealth does not always equate to income.  It is important to make that point.  Normally, there should be a connection between both, but not always specifically.  The Revenue's medium enterprise division also has a unit dealing with high wealth individuals and this remit covers individuals whose assets are between &euro;10 million and  &euro;20 million.  The review which led to the reduction in the high wealth individual threshold from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million was conducted in 2019 and the report was published in June 2019.  Senators should bear in mind that following on from Revenue's review and report produced last year, we have very new information in respect of this area and this led to the threshold being reduced from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million.  I understand that the rationale behind using the threshold of &euro;20 million included facilitating the close alignment of Revenue's resources in the context of risk.  Revenue has a serious risk unit which looks at circumstances where revenue to the State could be at risk.  The threshold was &euro;50 million and it has been reduced to &euro;20 million.  Revenue is of the view that, in terms of risk, this is an appropriate level.  The reduction from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million is a big one.</p> <p>A further rationale was the engagement between Revenue and the Comptroller and Auditor General on chapter 18 of the 2018 report on the management of high wealth individuals&rsquo; tax liabilities and - I have a particular interest in the next line of my script - discussions during the attendance of the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners at the Committee of Public Accounts in November 2018.  In the previous Oireachtas, I was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The 2018 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General included material on high wealth individuals, which is an issue I took particular interest in, as Senators are doing today.  The Committee of Public Accounts took the view that the &euro;50 million threshold was too high.  I think everyone would agree with that.  I drafted and published a report on behalf of the committee recommending that it be reduced.  In terms of accountability and transparency in the Oireachtas, the committee's input into that arising from its detailed examination of the chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, its discussions on it with Revenue and the report it produced, did contribute to the threshold being lowered.  That is an important point to make.  I acknowledge the work of the Members of the Oireachtas who contributed to that report.  As an issue, this has been live.  As I said, Revenue reviewed it and subsequently published a report on it last year.</p> <p>The adjustment of Revenue&rsquo;s organisational structure is an ongoing process, influenced by a wide range of factors, both external and internal.  Revenue proactively and continually evolves its structure to ensure that it optimises the alignment of its resources with risk to the taxpayer by not collecting all the money that is due and to ensure taxpayer compliance.  Revenue is independent in its administration of the tax and duty systems and the threshold within which cases are managed by the different divisions in Revenue is an operational matter for Revenue.  As part of its ongoing management of its case base, I understand Revenue continues to prepare reports and evolve that base.  The management of issues in regard to the collection of taxes is a matter for the Revenue, which, at operational level, has reduced the threshold from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million.  It continues to examine the risk and should a future risk be identified Revenue will prepare a report on it.  As I said, it published one such report last year.  In these circumstances, a further review is not appropriate at this time.  It would not be a productive use of Revenue resources coming so soon after the previous review.  On that basis, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p> <p>There are ongoing major improvements in this area.  The threshold has been reduced from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 and Revenue will keep the matter under review.  As I said, it produced a report.  Revenue staff are the best people at the coalface to assess the risk and they are doing that and they will continue to issue further reports.  I have no doubt the issue will come up again, not just here in a future debate but also, perhaps, at hearings of Oireachtas committees, be that the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach or the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p>There are good mechanisms in place and there has been substantial progress on this issue in the past two years.  I think we should accept that and leave it to Revenue to come forward with further reviews.  I look forward to that.  I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I am of the view, however, that a threshold of &euro;10 million would be better.  There are two issues here.  One is the question of the gathering of the information and the other, which is outside my prerogative as a member of the Opposition, relates to what we do with that information.  I believe that we need to consider the introduction of an additional tax or some form of levy on high wealth individuals, be the level of such wealth categorised, as I suggest, at &euro;10 million-plus or &euro;20 million-plus, which I do acknowledge is an improvement on the &euro;50 million-plus that applied previously.  I think this would be appropriate.  It is a way of reflecting and allowing people to make a contribution.  I do not accept that, for example, a 1% tax on such wealth will mean that people will automatically take their children out of schools, sell their homes and move lock, stock and barrel out of the country.  We know that we have an issue with tax exiles but that is a separate issue.  We are talking about high wealth individuals and appropriate contribution.</p> <p>The Minister of State indicated that he took an interest in this issue in the past in terms of the Committee of Public Accounts and the report it produced, which resulted in the threshold being reduced from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million - not &euro;10 million as I would like.  It is important that we do something with the report from last year.  Much as I would welcome a new report, I would prefer to see something done with the previous report.  As I said earlier, these are not issues that I can seek to amend because that would require financial amendments.  Given the Minister of State has taken an interest in this matter it would be good if he indicated that he is looking to see what aspects of Government policies in the context of the next budget cycle might be informed by the information in that report.</p></speech>

If Revenue has more information available on the next occasion we come to deal with a Finance Bill, that information should be made available for consideration in the context of the drafting of that Bill.  Given that a report was produced as recently as last year, we have the most up to date information available.  The Senator's point is well taken for the future.</p></speech>

He will be aware that there is a relief in our tax code known as the transborder workers' relief, which people can claim if they are working wholly outside of the State that is the jurisdiction and commuting to work.  In most cases, this involves people working on a cross-Border basis.  In other cases, people resident here could be commuting to Manchester or London and be working five days per week in Britain or elsewhere.  Again, the problem in this area has been exposed by the pandemic, but, in fairness, Revenue and Department were quick to act on it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If people carry out any work that is more than incidental in this jurisdiction, they will lose this trans-border relief.  For example, if people work from home for one day or half a day, they lose this relief.  That would be the case as long as it was deemed something more than incidental.</p><p>As a result of the pandemic, the Revenue waived the requirement because we are obviously trying to encourage people not to travel.  However, that is not the issue.  The issue concerns changing work patterns.  For example, if an employee living in Donegal and working in a company in Derry is availing of this relief, it will mean the tax the person pays is calculated in Derry and there is no tax liability in this State.  If the person works one day from home, however, that will all be gone.  He or she will have a tax liability here and the difference between what will be applicable in Derry and this State would have to be paid to the Revenue here.</p><p>Let us consider the reverse case, where an employee is resident in Derry and working in a company in Letterkenny.  That employee could work from home for up to something like 60 days and still be able to gain the relief.  I am not suggesting this should be right across the board.  There is, however, a need to carve out space within our Finance Bill regarding these cross-border workers on the island of Ireland.</p><p>I mentioned looking at this issue through the prism of Brexit and in respect of the Good Friday Agreement.  I do not believe we should allow those who live on one side of the Border and who work on the other side to work remotely most of the year.  However, we should try to bring the situation into line with what happens in the North.  We should allow for several days where people can work from home.  It could be for different reasons.  It could be a case where two partners are working.  One could be a nurse, a teacher or someone working on the front line.  Perhaps a child is sick on a given day and the worker who was supposed to travel to Derry cannot do so and works from home instead.  If that person works from home on any substantive issue, anything more than something incidental, he or she stands to lose the trans-border relief.  There should be flexibility built into the scheme to ensure it is possible for people to work in their place of residence for several days and still be able to avail of the relief.</p><p>An energetic group has been established to represent cross-border workers.  It is an important issue that affects many people.  I am not stipulating what the number of days should be.  The Minister can decide that.  It could start with 12 or 14 days or whatever number of days he chooses.  There must be some flexibility, however, because it is far too rigid now.  The criteria state that the employment duties must be wholly exercised outside the State with none performed in the State, save for duties considered incidental to the foreign employment.  That is a situation of a bygone day.</p><p>Although we have double taxation arrangements, where there is offsetting of tax from one jurisdiction to the other, trans-border relief is a different matter.  We must build into our tax code for workers resident here but working outside the jurisdiction the flexibility to prevent the complete loss of the trans-border relief if the workers work from home on a certain number of days in the calendar.  This recommendation simply calls for a report to examine all these important issues and I hope the Minister of State will support same.</p></speech>

I applaud the Cross-Border Workers Coalition for driving this issue and bringing it to the attention of people.  It is not only a tax issue; it is a quality of life issue and an all-island economy issue.  The fact that it was addressed for Covid-19 is fantastic.  Given the acceleration of remote working and the expected changes in how we work, I hope we can find a more permanent solution to this.</p> <p>I raised the matter in a Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting and I was supported by Deputy Joe McHugh.  The Minister agreed to look at this.  He has since said that he will examine it as part of the work of the tax strategy group.  That is going to be important.  I realise this is being brought forward in the Finance Bill but it is not as simple as dealing with it or finding a solution for it through the Irish taxation system.  It involves the EU and the double taxation network regions as well as Ireland's taxation system.  The Minister has agreed to look at it.  I encourage my colleagues to raise it with their MEPs as well because it is relevant to them.</p> <p>As I have said, it is an all-island economy issue.  We have done extraordinary work to protect the all-island economy.  Thankfully, this week we have seen agreement in principle on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.  Last week, we saw the Brexit Bill, which will help to continue cross-border life as we know it.  This week is critical for the all-island economy.  I urge the Minister of State to consider that in advance of the work of the tax strategy group.  The Revenue Commissioners have shown flexibility because of Covid-19.  Will the Minister of State consider maintaining that flexibility until the work of the tax strategy group during the summer is complete?</p> <p>I wish to emphasise the importance of finding a solution.  We do not want double tax liability for people who are working in one jurisdiction and living in another.  We want to ensure they can avail of the same flexibility as other workers.  It presents a problem in terms of attracting talent.</p> <p>This is an important issue.  The Cross-Border Workers Coalition has done fantastic work on it.  I know the Minister has said that he will meet them.  That would be a positive move.</p></speech>

I note that the relief applies not only to persons with a UK-based employment but also for employment in the EU and countries with which we have a double taxation agreement in compliance with Ireland's treaty obligations.  While it is most acute on the island of Ireland, these arrangements are in place not only between the UK and the EU but in countries with which we have a double taxation agreement.  It is a worldwide issue from an Irish taxation point of view and it affects a large number of countries with which we have a double taxation agreement.</p> <p>I note there is no equivalent provision in UK domestic legislation to match what we have.  In the case of a person who lives in Ireland but works in another jurisdiction, the general tax position is that as an Irish resident the person is subject to Irish tax on worldwide income from any source, including the employment exercised outside the State.  At the same time, the employment may also be subject to tax in the country in which the person works.  In accordance with general principles of international tax, where instances of double taxation arise on the same income, relief against Irish tax may be claimed by way of a credit for any foreign tax already paid subject to the terms of the applicable double taxation agreement.  Unilateral relief may also be available in certain circumstances under domestic Irish legislation.</p> <p>What if a person has taxable income on both sides or lives on one side and works on the other side?  The essence of all these double taxation agreements is that the person only pays tax once.  If the person pays tax in one jurisdiction under these arrangements the person gets relief in the other country, whether the home country or wherever the person is tax resident, against the tax already paid.  There is never a question that the person will be doubly taxed.  The double tax agreements are in place to prevent that from happening.  A person is taxed once but not twice.  That is why the revenue authorities in the various jurisdictions ensure taxpayer X who has paid X amount of tax gets relief in the country in which he is resident for the tax he paid in the country.  That is the essence of the double taxation agreement.</p> <p>In the case of a person who lives in the State but who works in Northern Ireland, the terms of the Ireland-UK double taxation agreement provide for relief by allowing the Irish resident to claim relief for the UK tax paid against the Irish tax that may be due on the same income.  That is exactly the point I was making but it applies to more countries than the UK.  That is the basic position of all taxation agreements.</p> <p>The trans-border relief referred to by the Senators is in addition to the relief provided by the double taxation agreement and may apply, subject to certain conditions, where a person lives in Ireland but works wholly outside of the State.  As set out in section 825A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to qualify for trans-border relief the individual must be tax resident in Ireland; must work in a country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement in an employment held for a continuous period of 13 weeks in the year; must exercise the employment duties wholly outside of the State with none performed in the State, save for matters considered incidental to the foreign employment; must have paid tax in the other country and must not be due a refund of the tax; and must be present in Ireland for at least one day for every week the person works abroad.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One could say it is almost customised for people in Northern Ireland and the UK.  If one is working exclusively in the UK, one must be present in Ireland at least one day in every week.  Where the trans-border relief applies in the case of an Irish resident who works in the UK, it operates in such a way that only UK tax is charged on the employment income and there is no charge to Irish tax on the same income.  Any additional Irish tax that may be due is forgone under the Irish domestic legislation.<br/><br/>This tax relief is not normally available for Irish residents who work from home in Ireland.  However, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, Revenue has confirmed that if employees are required to work from home in the State due to Covid-19, such days spent working at home will not preclude the individual from being entitled to claim this relief, provided all other conditions of the relief are met.  I have listed out the five conditions, one of which relates to being present in the State for one day per week.  Due to Covid restrictions in travel, Revenue has made those flexible arrangements.<br/><br/>In the event that the existing arrangements were to be revised, specifically for Northern Ireland Border workers, a number of issues could arise, including: questions of equitable treatment of Irish residents in respect of employments carried out in Ireland; the competitive position of Irish employers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>those in other countries; concerns regarding the potential for double non-taxation of such workers, which means there might be a case where they would end up not paying tax in either place, which would be a risk to our Exchequer; and questions around compliance with established principles of international tax.<br/><br/>Any such consideration would also need to be examined in the overall context of Ireland&rsquo;s EU membership, noting that it would likely not be possible for Ireland to give preferential treatment to UK-based or Northern Ireland-based employments without also giving similar treatment to EU member states or other countries with which we have a double taxation agreement.  When one is in the EU network, one cannot have separate arrangements for one country outside of the EU and not have it for other countries outside the EU.  It would have to be a similar arrangement for all countries that have a double taxation agreement.<br/><br/>As is the case with all taxation matters, this position will be kept under review, especially in the context of Brexit.  However, I assure Senators that in circumstances where this relief does not apply, relief for foreign tax may be applicable in the normal course under the double taxation agreement.<br/><br/>This was introduced in the context of Covid.  That is why, even if I, as Minister of State, wished to accept this proposal, the six-month deadline would be an issue because we might have Covid here for longer than six months after passage of the Act.  Revenue has made the required alterations on an administrative basis in its management.  It is satisfied there is no great risk to the Exchequer as a result.  Revenue has introduced this on an administrative arrangement basis, using its own powers of discretion to look after tax revenue but always to treat taxpayers fairly.  It has done this and I expect that to continue as long as Covid continues to be an issue, which could be well beyond the six months we are talking about.  There is no immediate prospect of this being withdrawn as long as Covid is, unfortunately, with us.  It is only in the context of Covid that this is arising.  After that, in terms of Brexit and so on, it is another day's work.  In terms of seeking a report now, this matter may not have come to a conclusion in six months and people are satisfied with some of the arrangements currently in place, that the Revenue is taking a practical approach and that it is a good organisation.  On that basis, I do not accept the recommendation relating to the six months issue.</p></speech>

We all know the crisis in the rental market and the extortionate rents that are in place on our doorsteps and throughout the country.  In my city of Limerick, there are two-bedroom apartments that one could not give away years ago.  They had to install flat-screen TVs to entice tenants to take them.  Such apartments are now going for &euro;1,200 a month.  Working people are pushed to the pin of their collar. </p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently proposed a tax relief for renters.  It would be the equivalent of one month's rent.  It is a reasonable proposal which would make a tangible difference to hundreds of thousands of people in this State.  The Government has rejected that consistently.  It is disappointing that whenever these things come up, for better or worse, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael tend to side with the landlords rather than the tenants.</p><p>The proposal we make today is to do a report.  It is a simple request to do a report on the issue to tell us how it would look in terms of taxation.  It would be a step in the right direction.  It is a reasonable and sensible proposal and I would hope someone on the Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael benches would have something to say in defence of renters, as opposed to landlords.</p></speech>

Years ago, there was such a provision but it was abolished, I think, in 2010 or 2011, following a recommendation from the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued.  The view of this independent commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increased the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation.</p> <p>I would link this to the previous points made on the help to buy scheme, where people said that by giving an incentive to the person, one is helping to put up the price and put money in the builder's pocket.  The Senator felt the scheme was bad because of that.  I would say the scheme the Senator is proposing would have the exact effect he warned against under a previous recommendation.  If we gave tax relief, it would allow landlords put up the price of rent, knowing the renter was getting such relief.  To use the Senator's logic, the outcome of this would be to make landlords wealthier.  By increasing the incentive for a purchaser or a renter, who is the ultimate beneficiary when they know the taxpayer is giving a subsidy or support?  The logic the Senator has used tells me that the only beneficiary of this would be landlords who would get extra money because they would put up the rent in the knowledge that the tenant is getting tax relief.  On that basis, I am not in a position to accept the recommendation that we have a report on this matter within six months.</p></speech>

I accept that there is some contradiction in the logic on the Senator's side and ours.  Previously, the logic of his point was to put money in builders' pockets, but now he wants to put money in landlords' pockets.  That is a contradiction.  The difference on our side was that I was in favour of helping people to buy houses.  That is our priority.  We are not in favour of creating a culture of renting and making landlords wealthier.  There is a difference in each of our approaches, but we are favouring people who want to buy their own houses.  I am not in a position to accept the recommendation.</p></speech>

We have engaged on this matter previously.  I welcome the CRSS, but I have an ongoing concern.  Businesses are relying on the CRSS, tax warehousing and many other measures that will collectively add to their problems down the road.  The CRSS is allowing us to stay viable and keep our doors open while we park the losses we are making to be dealt with later.  It is welcome from that point of view but, as I told the Minister of State the last time we spoke, there is no harmonisation or gradation of the payment.  Either a business qualifies for the payment or it does not.  The Minister of State said that we could be dealing with this situation for a further six or nine months.  The CRSS needs to be reviewed and tweaked.  It should not be the case that a business getting it is an either-or situation or that qualifying is based solely on access to premises.  Under level 3, a restaurant can be open and, therefore, will not qualify even though it is only operating at half capacity.  Will the Minister of State bring my suggestion to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe?  Could we review the CRSS to make it more flexible?  It is important to the business sector, but we can be more creative and flexible in how we make it available to businesses that need it to survive.  We all know we are talking about next June.  Businesses that are accumulating losses week after week need the CRSS to be reviewed and tweaked.  The level of debt that is going into warehousing is worrying.  All businesses will have to face them next September.</p></speech>

Senator Casey just outlined part of it.  The CRSS was a crucial piece of budget 2021 and provided businesses with certainty and necessary supports, which was especially important during the lockdown.  More than 13,000 businesses have already received support under the CRSS.  As the Minister of State is aware, the hospitality sector is facing difficulties.  For hotels in Galway and beyond, the prohibition on leaving one's county has created considerable issues in terms of occupancy rates.  Many gastropubs and restaurants up and down the west coast and beyond are not in a position to open because there are no tourists.  Opening would not be feasible or viable.  These businesses are now more or less seasonal, be they in Connemara or the Burren, on the Aran Islands or wherever.  Opening is not viable, yet they are not eligible for the scheme.  This issue needs to be examined and a three-month review may need to be conducted.  It is causing difficulties and, as Senator Casey alluded to, has financial implications through putting issues on the long finger.  We need to be fair to businesses.</p> <p>Thankfully, we seem to be through the worst of the pandemic.  Senators believe so.  Today's announcement regarding the distribution of a vaccine was welcome.</p> <p>I seek a comment from the Minister of State.  I have gone through the Bill.  I understand that the reduced VAT rate has proven effective.  As the Minister of State is well aware, it was welcomed by the hospitality sector.  Those who operate in the hospitality and tourism sectors feel strongly that having the reduced VAT rate of 9% for all of 2021 would be a great boost to them.  It would also bring certainty, which is what businesses require now.  They have come through an incredibly challenging 2020.  I appreciate that reducing the VAT rate would be a major cost to the State, but is consideration being given to extending the temporary reduction, which is due to expire on 31 December?  Will we be sending a message that the 9% rate will be extended for all of 2021?</p></speech>

I support the comments of Senators Casey and Crowe regarding the CRSS.  There is an issue if businesses are supposed to open at a certain level but there is no business to sustain them or not enough to prevent them making losses, for example, in the tourism sector.  Will this matter be examined?  Valid points have been made.  A continued support, be it at a 50% or 75% sliding scale, needs to be considered.</p></speech>

It is not subject to any recommendation, but it is a significant element of the legislation.  On Second Stage on Tuesday, Senators Casey and Buttimer referred to the issue of warehousing tax.  I did not have the figures with me then, so I will confirm now that the total amount of tax debts warehoused is &euro;1.9 billion.  As such, this has been a major scheme.  These debts are mainly VAT and employer's PAYE.  There is also &euro;8 million in income tax debt.  Approximately 70,000 businesses have availed of this tax debt warehousing.  We all know that this debt has to be paid.  It has not gone away, but businesses have shoved it down the line.  As an aside, perhaps this is why the appetite for other schemes, for example, funds advanced by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, is not strong.  People know they have large debts to pay.  The &euro;1.9 billion is a substantial figure and I undertook on Tuesday to provide the information to the House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have provided that figure here.<br/><br/>The issue of the thresholds has been well aired.  The level of restrictions in the country due to Covid is relevant because if goes below level 2, some restrictions are not available at all.  The key issue is that this matter be kept under close review.  I am not in a position to make any comment on extending VAT rate reductions.  That matter is not deal with in this legislation.  Regarding the important point about this scheme, section 11(e) states:</p><blockquote>	Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (d), the Minister for Finance shall cause an assessment, at such intervals as he or she considers appropriate but no less frequently than every 3 months beginning on 13 October 2020, of the following, and any other relevant matters ... </blockquote><p>This means the Minister has given a commitment in the legislation that because Covid, businesses and restrictions are so fluid and getting people back to earning a livelihood is such a priority, he will review the position every three months.  This is effective from essentially budget day around 13 October so it is November, December and January.  A report on this will be prepared in January and every three months as long as this situation continues to obtain.  It will be very closely monitored and there will be an opportunity for Government and the Oireachtas to debate this on an ongoing basis.  It is good that we will have a review so early in the new year and regularly afterwards as long as we are dealing with Covid.  On that basis, I thank the Senators for their contributions on this section.</p></speech>

I think he realises how vital it is - no more than supporters across the House like Senator Carrigy - that the review is done in January.  Hopefully, we should be able to have an input into that.  My next point is very relevant to the hospitality industry.  The temporary reduced VAT rate of 9% applies until the end of December.  I take it that this will be extended for a minimum of six months.  It is important that we send out the right message from this House.</p></speech>

It is quite staggering and goes back to my fundamental concern about what businesses will do in September when they are faced with this bill.  It is all tied in together because what is happening in businesses such as my own is that we are using the CRSS to pay suppliers and for energy and everything else.  The only thing we can park into the future is State debt - our taxes such as VAT and PAYE and PRSI - but we still owe that.  I do not know whether the Minister of State can start looking at how we are going to deal with that in September because if businesses are faced with 3% interest, which is proposed at the moment, and have to fund that after September, it will be another challenge for them.  This is why the CRSS needs to be looked at in a more sympathetic manner, rather than having this hard rule of access to the premises only.  Other criteria need to be taken into account to see how we can help businesses to get over that hump.</p></speech>

The recommendation seeks a report on implementing an 80% cap on capital allowances.  This arises from recommendation No. 18 of Seamus Coffey's review of Ireland's corporation tax code, which states:</p> <blockquote> 	In order to ensure some smoothing of corporation tax revenues over time, it is recommended that the limitation on the quantum of relevant income against which capital allowances for intangible assets and any related interest expense may be deducted in a tax year be reduced to 80%. </blockquote> <p>This policy was endorsed by Stephen Kinsella, associate professor of economics at the University of Limerick, in January 2020.  It is worth quoting what Professor Kinsella had to say.  He stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Sinn F&eacute;in have correctly identified that intangible assets are a key resource for the Irish economy in the 21st century.  I argued for a rethinking of Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with intangible assets some weeks ago, but more importantly, so did the Fiscal Council's Seamus Coffey.  Sinn F&eacute;in want to tax these intangible assets properly.  Introducing an 80% cap on profits in intangible assets, particularly those on-shored between 2015 and 2018 by multinationals. </blockquote> <p>He went to state:</p> <blockquote> 	This is an excellent idea that will result in some capital flight from the country, no doubt, but which will fund the Exchequer handsomely and help offset the inevitable loss of tax revenue from the introduction of new OECD rules on digital taxes. </blockquote> <p>The amount of capital allowances claimed by companies increased by &euro;27.4 billion in 2015 to reach a level of &euro;51.8 billion.  These are truly eye-watering amounts.  The use of capital allowances has increased significantly from &euro;8.5 billion in 2011 to &euro;45.2 billion in 2015.  This likely reflects a greater amount of capital allowances available but also increased profitability of companies carrying capital allowances and thus able to use existing allowances.  Unused capital allowances in one year are carried forward as trading losses for use in subsequent periods when there is taxable income to offset against them.  Capital allowances for intangible assets are claimed under section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This section provides for the offsetting of capital expenditure on the development or acquisition of a range of intangible assets against the income arising from the use of that intangible.</p><p>Ireland's national accounts have been impacted by a number of intangible onshoring events in recent years with the profit generated by these intangible assets now included in gross measures of Ireland's national income.  Most notably, there was an increase in the stock of intangible assets in Ireland of approximately &euro;250 billion in quarter 1 of 2015, while the quarterly national accounts for quarter 4 of 2016 show investment in the acquisition of intangibles of approximately &euro;25 billion.  There may have been other events that were not as readily identifiable in the accounts while the possibility of future large onshoring events cannot be discounted.  In nominal terms, Ireland's gross capital stock rose from &euro;756 billion to &euro;1.088 trillion, an increase of &euro;332 billion.  Changes in the capital stock are usually driven by investments, either outright purchase or internal development, and obsolescence, withdrawal from use, giving entries and exits to the capital stock.  However, in 2015, investment in capital was &euro;54.1 billion.  As a result, nearly 85% of the &euro;332 billion increase in the capital stock cannot be explained by investment.  Table 9.8 of Seamus Coffey's review of the corporation tax code gives the composition of Ireland's gross capital stock for 2014 and 2015.  In the 2015 data, two categories were suppressed for confidentiality reasons, namely, those relating to transport equipment and research and development.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The categories reflect aircraft leasing and the onshoring of intellectual property assets.  The categories for which data are provided recorded an increase of &euro;42 billion in 2015, so the remaining &euro;289 billion is accounted for by the missing categories of transport equipment and intangibles.  It is probable that the bulk of this was due to intangibles.</p><p>From an industrial policy perspective, the decision of companies to locate some of their intangible assets in Ireland can be considered another spoke in the wheel.  Although these assets are inherently mobile, the decision to locate them here strengthens existing investment in Ireland.  The link to future investment is less clear but ongoing changes at international level in how corporate income tax is assessed have the link between profit and substance as a key motivation.  Many companies that are likely considering the location of their intangibles in this changed environment already have significant operations in Ireland.  This substance will likely be a factor some companies will consider when making these decisions, and it is likely that further substance will follow to the location chosen.</p><p>We are asking for a report on this.  It is a very reasonable and important request that has the backing of key respected economists who already do good work for the Government.</p></speech>

While these costs are not fully tax deductible in the year in which they are incurred, tax relief is available through capital allowances, which spreads the cost of the asset over a number of years.  This gives a fairer reflection of the performance of the business for accounting and tax purposes, which is why capital allowances are a well-established feature of most OECD tax codes.</p><p>By the early to mid-2000s, it was clear that the development and exploitation of intangible assets had become a significant driver of economic growth in OECD economies, some of which had introduced specific tax schemes to address the particular features of these assets.  Therefore, the Finance Act 2009 introduced capital allowances for certain intangible assets that a company manages, develops and exploits.  These intellectual property, IP, allowances encourage substantive activity and high-quality employment in the management and exploitation of intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, know-how, customer lists and research rights.</p><p>The success of Ireland&rsquo;s approach to encouraging real substantive investment is clear from Revenue&rsquo;s analysis, which shows that claims of intellectual property allowances accounted for 24% of net corporation tax payments in 2019.  In addition to corporation tax, claims of IP allowances are making a significant contribution to the Exchequer from all payroll tax receipts.</p><p>When IP allowances were introduced, the maximum deduction for IP allowances and related interest was restricted to 80% of income from the relevant trade.  No such cap applies to other capital allowances, so the cap was removed in the Finance Act 2014 to bring the tax treatment of intangible assets into line with the tax treatment of other assets and of similar assets in other jurisdictions.</p><p>The 80% cap was reintroduced in budget 2018 in response to a recommendation in the Coffey report, with the aim of smoothing corporation tax receipts and helping to support their sustainability.As the Senator is well aware, changes to tax law are generally made on a prospective basis such that they apply only from the date on which they have been given effect.  I know the Senator was referring to prior years in his contribution.  The cap does not affect the overall quantum of relief.  It merely extends the period over which intellectual property allowances are used, with any restricted amounts carried forward for use in later periods, subject to the 80% cap in those periods.  It is relevant to note that IDA Ireland&rsquo;s assessment is that Ireland offers a strong and growing research, development and innovation environment and found that a third of multinationals in Ireland have had operations here for more than 20 years.  These companies have long-established and deep-rooted links with the Irish economy, which are supported by Ireland&rsquo;s stable and transparent taxation approach.</p><p>The Coffey report said that it is right that we tax these companies, and we clearly do so.  It also said it is essential that our tax regime is robust, is not subject to challenge and allows companies to plan ahead, invest and generate real activity and employment in the country with reasonable certainty.  It is important to maintain this certainty as part of our overall tax regime, and to change it from year to year would cause uncertainty.  People would not know the implications of making long-term investments if significant changes were made every year.</p><p>Seamus Coffey's report goes on to say:</p> <blockquote> 	In order to ensure some smoothing of corporation tax revenues over time, it is recommended that the limitation on the quantum of relevant income against which capital allowances for intangible assets and any related interest expense may be deducted in a tax year be reduced to 80%. </blockquote> <p>The tax came in at 80%, went up to 100%, and Mr. Coffey reckoned it should be brought back to 80%, and we have done that.</p><p>None of these issues will increase the amount of corporation tax that will be paid.  All it is doing is extending the period over which to pay corporation tax.  The Senator mentioned in his contribution that this may lead to a flight of capital from the country.  I would not support a measure where the person proposing it recognises that, if it were implemented, it could lead to a capital flight from the country.</p><p>Essentially, what the Seamus Coffey report has done, which is good, is to say that by putting a cap on how much of the allowances can be claimed each year, it will take longer for them to get the full tax relief for their intellectual property intangible asset.  When we know a company is going to make a certain amount of profit in the years ahead, and bear in mind these multinationals we are talking about pay the majority of corporation tax already, we are now saying to them that we want a more sustainable flow of corporation tax rather than a big surge one year, a drop-off the next year followed by another big surge.  We cannot plan our health services if the tax coming into the country goes up and down like that.  That is why we have restricted it to 80% as it will allow for a more stable environment.  Companies can only write it off over a longer period so there cannot be any major reduction in tax in a year if they have a bigger write-off allowed in any particular year.  Having the 80% limit spreads out longer the amount of tax that will be paid.  There will be no more and no less tax paid but it can be paid over a longer period.  That ensures we have, in the years ahead, a certain level of corporation tax coming to us in the medium term rather than taking a big bulk of it now and being short of tax in two or three years' time because we grabbed it all now.  I think that it is far better, and I am not talking from the  multinational perspective but from the perspective of the Irish public, that we have a little stability in the flow of corporation tax into the Exchequer, and that we do not try to grab it all now and leave ourselves short next year and in the following years.</p><p>The regime that is in place is excellent.  We have had a very recent review and I do not see a need to review the matter again because by doing so it may cause uncertainty about this issue.  We have certainty and a guaranteed sustainable tax flow from this system for a number of years ahead.  I would not like to interfere with that plus I do not think that we need a report because we are satisfied with the regime as is.</p></speech>

I do not suggest that real estate investment trusts, REITs, are the sole or main cause of our housing issues.  There are other issues, as we have highlighted, such as the hoarding of land and planning permission.  It is a fact that the opportunity to attach a use-it-or-lose-it clause in a more robust and stronger way to strategic housing developments was not taken at the time when it was suggested, and we again have the hoarding not only of land but of planning permission and situations where the Government somehow feels it has to coax builders and developers to build rather than leading out on building, as it should.  Those are all of the wider issues.</p><p>I want to address here the issue of REITs.  It was said again, I believe by a Government Senator, that there are stories of how these investment companies are buying up hundreds of housing units at a time.  They are being bought before they have been built.  They leave first-time buyers completely out of the market.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They become a speculative investment to be leaked onto the market bit by bit and in a way that maximises profit by creating a scarcity and ensuring there is desperation, and there is desperation for some persons with regard to accessing houses at this point.</p><p>The Government gives generous tax terms to REITs and there is a question as to whether prioritising funding to these bodies and giving them tax breaks are a positive intervention in the market.  I argue that it requires review.  The review I am seeking from the Minister is to examine the introduction of a new capital gains tax at a rate of 33% where a REIT or a group of REITs is disposing of its property or property rental businesses.  This is an important measure now because we know how many REITs and speculative funds operate.  They look for the next big opportunity.  There are going to be opportunities in the UK, for example, and we do not want to have a situation in which a number of large-scale owners of rental property or homes can put the Government in the position of being a hostage in the future.  We do not want a situation whereby a REIT disposes of property rental businesses on a mass scale.  If it does that, we want the State to recoup a decent amount of revenue which it can put towards the other measures it takes in respect of housing.  It is appropriate to have a capital gains tax that recoups the very large profits that have been made, given that so much of that profit depended on the preferential tax treatment originally afforded.</p><p>In addition to examining the question of a capital gains tax at the rate of 33%, the report should examine the introduction of a surcharge for REITs that are buying residential property.  Instead of the State having to add itself alongside first-time buyers, perhaps we could consider introducing a surcharge on the rival purchasers in this regard to ensure individuals and homeowners would be able to compete effectively.  I also ask that the report examine the effect or otherwise of REITs generally on the supply of residential housing on the open market for private house purchase.  Again, these measures have been in place for some time.  There are strong individual and anecdotal examples of cases in which they have had a negative impact either in terms of rental security or in terms of access to home ownership.</p><p>I am asking the Minister of State to examine that and to consider the measures I have set out, or such other measures as he might find, that will ensure we do not have a set of negative and potentially avoidable consequences to the treatment of REITs in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-11a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121100002#X00200"><p>The real estate investment trust framework was introduced in 2013 to facilitate long-term, risk-diversified investment in rental property, by removing a double layer of tax which otherwise would have applied.  Income and gains from Irish property are not taxed within the REIT but are instead taxed in the hands of the investor when the funds are distributed.</p> <p>In 2019, Department of Finance officials produced a report on REITs, Irish real estate funds, IREFs, and section 110 companies as they invest in the Irish property market.  This paper provided a basis for policy discussions and for a number of amendments to the taxation regime for REITs as part of the Finance Act 2019.  The amendments aimed to ensure that an appropriate level of tax is levied on REITs.  As the Senator&rsquo;s recommendation refers to capital gains, it is relevant to note that two of the amendments focused specifically on property disposals.  The first related to the application of dividend withholding tax on capital disposals.  If the net proceeds from capital disposals are not reinvested in the REIT business or distributed in the 12 months prior to the disposal or within a two-year period following the disposal, they become part of the profits of the REIT business, at least 85% of which must be distributed annually.  That means the recipients, or the investors, will pay tax on that at their top tax rate.</p> <p>The second change limited the regime in the case of REITs in operation for less than 15 years.  Prior to the Finance Act 2019, upon a company ceasing to be a REIT all its property was deemed to be disposed of and reacquired.  This ring-fenced gains within the REIT regime and mirrored the treatment for a company electing into the regime where all pre-REIT gains were crystallised as taxable.  An amendment was introduced to limit this cessation measure to REITs in operation for a minimum of 15 years.  A company had to be in existence for 15 years to avail of that capital gains tax regime.  Obviously, companies that were here for a short period were now excluded.  This was done in line with the policy objective of the REIT regime, which is to encourage stable, long-term, collective investment in the Irish property market.</p> <p>As regards the impact of REITs on the residential property market, although institutional investors have increased their presence in recent years, they continue to represent a very small share of the residential housing market.  Central Statistics Office, CSO, data show that in 2019, property funds, real estate firms and REITs combined purchased a net 0.8% of all transacted units.  This equates to 479 net purchases out of a total of 58,376 property transactions.  More broadly, financial, insurance and real estate companies were net sellers into the market in 2019.  This means they sold more housing stock than they purchased.</p> <p>An increasing volume of investment by institutional investors is reported to be by way of forward purchase deals, meaning agreements for the purchase of stock not yet built, with much of this investment targeted towards urban apartments.  This funding source is particularly important in apartment developments where it is not possible for the developer to fund the project in stages through the sale of different phases, as can more easily be the case with housing estates.  This investment is a likely reason behind the recent increase in apartment construction as of the end of 2019.  It is, therefore, increasing the badly-needed supply of housing in these locations.  In light of the fact that the report was prepared only last year and given the measures introduced in the Finance Act 2019, it is not appropriate to undertake a further review at this time.</p> <p>Of all the investment by these investment companies in the Irish market, 28% of it is residential and 72% is commercial.  The vast majority of their investment is in the commercial office space and that type of development rather than in the residential sector.  They have less than 3% of the Dublin housing stock and less than 2% of the housing stock nationwide.  They have a role in financing apartment blocks where no builder would have the funding to do it alone.  The builder cannot do the development in stages because of the complex construction, whereas if there are 100 houses in a housing estate, the builder can build them 20, 30 or 40 at a time.  One cannot do that with an apartment block when it has be built complete.</p> <p>The bottom line about the REITs is that the investors in the REIT pay the full tax.  There is a requirement for 85% of the profits to be distributed by way of dividend, and the dividends are taxed at the full tax rate of the investor.  It is important to recognise that.  As mentioned previously, where investors are outside the State, this is caught in line with the normal double taxation agreements that exist across the planet.  That is the mechanism whereby any income that is not taxed in Ireland is caught under a double taxation agreement, depending on where the investor is resident.  On the basis that we recently concluded a report and amendments were made in the Finance Act 2019, I am not in a position to agree to a further report on the REIT regime.</p></speech>

We all have a concern about the potential homeowners and those in rental situations.  The Minister of State is correct that approximately 70% of the money has gone into commercial office blocks, many of which are empty.  We can take a walk in the square mile around these buildings and see thousands of square metres of empty commercial office space.  In many cases we also see, and this was highlighted during the Covid pandemic, the hollowing out of the city centre and the fact that it has been deadened by the presence of speculative, often empty, open-plan commercial office space that is already doing its work by being built and serving as a speculative investment.  It is taking up spaces where we might have a vibrant city centre.  REITs have a role in that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would be very happy if the Minister of State did wish to conduct an investigation that looked not just at the interference and engagement of REITs in respect of housing but also looked at the favourable and unusual tax treatment in place for REITs.  Many people have incomes and if they sell a property or another asset they are subject to capital gains tax at a certain rate.  As Members know and the Minister of State is well aware, many of the investors are not based in Ireland and, as such, will not pay tax in Ireland in that regard.  Those who are based in Ireland do not pay tax at anything like the rate they would pay in capital gains tax.  Some people argue that it is double taxation if one is taxed again anywhere down the line.  Most people and small businesses do not experience that.</p><p>There is a question around the capital gains tax waiver.  We know the capital gains tax waiver from 2012 onwards is considered to have contributed significantly to the overheating of the market.  The  very favourable treatment of REITs in respect of capital gains tax has been and is a real concern.  It is creating a dynamic of speculative investment.</p><p>The Minister of State referred to the fact that more property is sold.  That is the case because much of it is flipped.  A person buying a house to live in will buy it, live in it and then sell it if they decide to move on.  A very large scale investor can afford to buy numerous offices and housing units and leave them empty and then, exactly as I described, pick the point of greatest pressure in the market to make them available or sell them on.  Of course, there are investors buying units and then, drip by drip, selling them at a point such as the period in the market previously when there was a significant amount of selling as prices had sufficiently inflated, as the Minister of State described.  I acknowledge we are in a different market now.</p><p>We cannot and should not be placing a speculative model at the centre of building.  Sometimes we hear about having to coax builders to build houses.  How will we coax builders to build houses when it is far more lucrative and easier for them to just build yet another empty office block?  The Minister of State himself made the case in that regard in terms of the problems relating to REITs.</p><p>The problems go far beyond the housing issues at which I have looked.  The Minister of State referred to reports that were done in the past.  I urge him to really think about and examine potential changes we may see in respect of the operations of REITs in the forthcoming 12 months or 24 months post Brexit.  I refer to the many international commercial investors that may currently be working through REITs.</p><p>The principle in respect of double taxation was based on a previous model relating to pension funds.  The idea was that people were paying into a pension fund and that the fund would then invest the money and the investors would be taxed when they got their pension.  That was the investment principle and it had some basis.  It was based around the idea of collective investment by pension holders who paid in their pension.  That is from where it originally came.  The extension and widening of this kind of space that is being given to speculative investors is really problematic.</p><p>Although there may have been reports in the past, I urge the Minister of State, now that he has responsibility for this area, to consider a re-examination of the issue.  I of course am very open to his examining the issues relating to commercial office letting, as well as those he has mentioned.</p></speech>

The problem with the Finance Bill is that it leads one on to other issues of principle.  At one time, REITs played a role in the market and were considered to be part of the housing solution but it has evolved into something bigger and is actually causing more problems than it is providing solutions.  It is disappointing that we need REITs to come in to build apartments.  We should be able to find ways in the economy of building apartment blocks.  We should not need REITs to do it.  That is the fundamental problem.  If one is developing houses, one can sell five houses and then move on to building the next five or ten or 15, whereas with apartment blocks one must build them to scale and in their entirety.</p> <p>Senator Higgins referred to the hollowing out of the city centre.  I would not necessarily blame REITs for that.  Rather, I would look towards the planning system and county development plans and see what we, as a society, are looking for in city centres.  We looked to REITs to solve the issues in the rental market.  Although Senator Gavan and I may differ on this issue, he will acknowledge that the vast majority of landlords, approximately 85% of them, own fewer than two properties and do not get the same breaks as do REITs, yet they provide a valuable source of accommodation for families and individuals.  Before giving out about landlords, we must remember that between 85% and 90% of landlords own two properties or fewer.  The RTB is clear that the relationship between small landlords and their tenants is much more beneficial and personal and has a much greater understanding of the issues tenants are going through than is the case with regard to some of the REITs and their tenants.  The issue of REITs was looked at.  I have questions regarding the role REITs play in the property market and the whole housing solution.  The problem with speaking on the Finance Bill is that we get into other issues.  I agree with many of Senator Higgins' remarks regarding REITs and their impact on the housing market.</p></speech>

There is much on which I agree with him.  It emphasises the frustration of those of us on this side of the House.  The requests that are being made are very reasonable.  We are asking the Government to prepare a report.  It is very disappointing that, recommendation after recommendation, the Minister of State is refusing to engage in terms of taking on these reports.  To be frank, it strikes far too conservative a tone.  What is the Minister of State afraid of in the context of the recommendation tabled by Senator Higgins?  What is he afraid we will find out from that report?  There is a problem in this area, as has been acknowledged by his party colleague.  All Members know there are problems in this area.  What is the fear of preparing a report such as this?  I cannot see what there is to fear.  What do we have to fear from information?  Surely we need more information on this issue.  The Government should do more in this area.  It has an opportunity to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-11a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121100002#Y00400"><p>Information published in the 2019 annual reports relating to this area and the organisations involved indicates that the total value of REITs in the Irish market is &euro;3.7 billion, 28% of which is residential and 72% commercial.  That information only became available this year.  We examined the matter this year based on financial information produced less than 12 months ago.  I do not think the Revenue or the Department of Finance should spend all their time every year examining every report.  It is sometimes necessary to prepare a report, make changes if necessary and then see how it works after a couple of years, but this matter was examined within the past year based on financial information published less than 12 months ago.  The fact that the matter was examined based on the annual reports that have been published recently means there is up-to-date information available.</p> <p>Reference was made to REITs being largely concerned with the rental market and that they focus mainly on the office premises market.  Investment decisions were made on the basis of being able to rent certain city centre properties etc., but Covid is changing the complexion of the city centre and where people wish to live.  People may wish to live closer to the area from which they originally came.  That will work its way into a much wider planning issue in the Dublin region in particular.</p> <p>On the basis that REITs are obliged to distribute 85% of their property profits annually for taxation in the hands of their shareholders, there is no taxation issue to be dealt with here.  Matters contained in the Finance Bill may stray into the broader issue of planning or apartment blocks versus houses, but those are really matters for the housing side.  I know the Seanad will be dealing with the issue of housing.  From a taxation point of view, 85% of the profits are distributed and they are taxed fully in the hands of the recipients.  That may be at the top rate of tax.  In some cases, the profits may be taxed at a much higher rate than the corporation tax rate.  There are double taxation agreements in the context of investors not resident outside the State.  There is a dividend withholding tax.  When REITs declare a dividend each year, which must be a minimum of 85% of their profits, 25% must be deducted by way of dividend withholding tax.  That is taken into consideration in the double taxation agreement.  Some other countries may only have a dividend rate of 15%, which is kind of the norm.  In Ireland, we can be sure that a dividend withholding tax of 25% applies to all those dividends.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A significant level of taxation is being obtained in this area but only where the REITs make a profit.  Let us be clear.  Anybody who invests a lot of money and has an empty building that they cannot rent is not making profit.  We are only talking those who make a profit.  Every property that has been referred to here, the empty properties and the apartment blocks that are under construction, have not yet yielded a rent roll and have not yet produced a penny or profit.  The investment has all been one way, that is, into construction of housing and office blocks.  There will be no profit out of those until they begin to get rent roll to make a profit.  The profit comes long after the original investment and even when there is a profit, there is a withholding tax and the recipient pays that tax at the highest rate.  </p><p>As I said, the most recent information is based on last year's annual reports which were only published earlier this year.  The information we have is only six months old so I do not see the reason we would need to do a report every six months.  We have good current information and those annual reports will be coming out again early next year for the end of this financial year and everybody will be able to see some of those reports at that stage.  It will assist the wider discussion.  I would not like to see the Department of Finance or Revenue having to stop its work and do a detailed report every six months when a company or sector of society issues an annual report.  We have current information.</p></speech>

This has not been a normal six-month period.  The complexion of how our towns and cities might work has entirely changed.  I do not think it is by choice that everybody is moving home.  It is also because property has become very valuable, in a speculative way, over the past few years.  Office blocks have been favoured in many cases, even in areas where housing is desperately needed.  It is commercially and financially advantageous to those investors to invest in such properties.</p> <p>These have been six months of change and the Minister of State needs to re-examine this matter.  In particular, he needs to examine the measures in terms of commercial office blocks and whether we want to have advantageous tax relief for the building of office space when we have vast amounts of it that are empty.  That is a substantial question of public finances, which is something in which I know the Minister of State, from his previous role, is very interested.  I suggest it is an issue.  If the Minister of State feels these are going to be examined again as a part of the annual review, it would be important for him to look at a cost-benefit analysis of the rationale for greatly incentivising an advantageous tax relationship for those building commercial office space, given the different choices we make as a State.  Why are we doing it and why is it more important than other things?  That is, ultimately, the core question relating to finances.</p> <p>The Minister of State has already outlined the dividend withholding tax of 25%.  The 33% capital gains tax would indeed be higher.  The thing is that the buying and selling of properties is something the real estate investment trust, REIT, scheme is doing.  The dividend question for investors comes at a later point.  As I said, if a small business owner decides to buy or sell a property, or whatever, they will be paying capital gains tax and so forth.  It is normal that the actions taken around the generation of profit by a scheme would attract tax.  There is no small business owner in Ireland who does not pay VAT on whatever they buy in order to make profits.  When selling or buying properties to generate profit for a REIT scheme, it would be normal for it to pay the costs along the way, such as capital gains tax.  I do not regard that as double taxation.  Ultimately, it should be the amount that the scheme has to pay in dividends after having paid capital gains tax on whatever purchases and so forth it has done or sales it has made.  The scheme should pay tax as it goes and then give whatever money that remains as dividends and let that be reflected.  One does not have to worry about people not paying because they will be paying tax on their incomes but only on the dividends after the appropriate costs, including the costs of contributing to the State through capital gains tax, have been paid.  I would regard that as a more appropriate system.  It is closer to the experience that most of us have.</p> <p>I know we are not going to be able to move forward on this but I urge the Minister of State to reconsider this issue.  He acknowledged, in his speech, that the past six months have not been like any other six months.  The next six months will not be like any six months we have known either.</p></speech>

We have been here a few times as a result of Covid-19.  There was the July stimulus package and now the Finance Bill, with billions of euro going to support the Irish economy and keep businesses open, or in a suspended state until they get to reopen.  That has come at a cost of billions of euro to the Exchequer.  That has happened because all of those businesses are losing money.  The Senator need not worry about the taxation of people who have empty office blocks because they are losing money.  The Senator does not need to worry about the rate of tax to charge a non-existent property with empty office blocks.  I find it unusual that the debate has centred on empty office blocks that generate zero income, only a lot of investment by the investor, with no rental income or profit.  The Senator has suggested they should be paying 33%.  We said that if a REIT sells an asset that is not reinvested within two years, it has to be distributed by way of dividend at the top tax rate that the investor will have to pay.  The Senator wants a 33% tax on the company and then the investor in the company, when he or she gets a dividend, should pay 40% tax out of income that has already borne a tax at 33%.  That would be a minimum of 75% tax and I cannot go there.  That is all.</p></speech>

We are suggesting a 33% tax on the capital gains that are made when a company makes a purchase.  REITs do not have one person who is the investor, they have multiple investors.  Those investors, at the end of whatever year or quarter of the functioning of the company, get the dividends of the profits.  The Minister of State is arguing that every payment of capital gains tax, as many normal people pay on purchases they have made, is somehow added to their income tax and that means they have paid 75% tax.  That is just not accurate.  The Minister of State should do better than that.  As he is aware, people do not pay 40% tax on their income.  They only pay 40% on such portions of their incomes above certain thresholds and so forth.  The Minister of State has no idea.  I imagine that most of the people who will be affected already have large amounts of income.  The additional part of their income that comes from their share of the profits of a particular investment may well come down the line.  It is a complete misnomer to try to add capital gains tax to income tax and suggest that people are paying 75% rated tax.</p> <p>We should try to be clear on this.  There is capital gains tax on companies and all kinds of transactions that happen in this State, including the sale of companies.  Let us not try to mix oranges and apples to make a scary fruit salad.  Let us try to be a bit clearer on it.  The Minister of State and I may disagree on the question of whether companies should be paying all of what I regard as the normal costs associated with the conduct of business, be it VAT, other charges or capital gains tax, where a company is changing and exchanging properties before it comes to calculating its profit at the end of the year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I believe they should and the Minister of State may believe they should not and that instead it should be reflected in if they make a larger profit, because if they did not have to pay those normal costs and capital gains tax, we would will catch the profit later.  This is a difference of opinion but please let us not be inaccurate in what we put out to the public.</p></speech>

If the Senator or I happen to have a property that we sell and it is not a principal family residence, we pay capital gains tax of 33%.  We might have other income that we pay 20% or 40% tax on, depending on our income.  They are two unconnected taxes paid by one individual but one is not added on top of the other.  What the Senator has done in her recommendation is the REIT as a company would pay 33% capital gains tax but then the people who get a dividend could not offset that tax the company paid against their tax bill because they are not the same as the company, they are just people receiving a dividend out of the investment.  It is a distribution to the investors, who will be taxed at the income tax rate.  I do not think too many people who have sufficient funds to invest in this particular type of investment are not earning more than the average industrial wage and paying tax at the top rate.  I cannot envisage somebody investing who is not on the top tax rate.  If people are not on the top tax rate, they are not on a high income.  The Senator can take it as common sense that people who have funds to invest in REITs must have some income behind them, otherwise they would not be investing.  They cannot offset the capital gains tax the company paid versus their income tax at more than 40%.</p> <p>I am looking at the Senator's recommendation again, and in addition to the 33% in paragraph (a) she proposes the introduction of a surcharge on REITs.  She wants a 33% tax to be paid by the company and now she wants a surcharge but does not specify the rate, and this is on top of the 40% the people will pay when they get their dividend.  I have nothing further to add.</p></speech>

Senator Higgins is asking for a report on what the impact of these proposals would be.  It is very different.  Again, I have to point out that so far today, the Minister of State has rejected every constructive proposal for a report.  We should expect better than this type of engagement.  Senator Higgins is asking for a report that could well elicit very important information on what we could do in this area and he is flatly rejecting a report.  Again, I ask what he is afraid of in terms of the information that a report on these points would elicit.  It is not good enough.</p></speech>

For a very positive moment I thought I was going to get an opportunity to speak about the Debenhams workers but I am very disappointed to see my recommendations in respect of them have been, wrongly, ruled out of order.  It did not name them but it was with regard to workers as creditors.  The recommendations I had noted as Nos. 9 and 10 in my notes related to that issue but in fact they are numbered differently to the official list.</p><p>I am not going to discuss this at length, as we have discussed many times the fact that we still have a situation in Ireland whereby many banks are not paying tax on their profits.  They did not pay tax on their profits even in their most profitable times.  We know that certain banks, including banks that have put questionable kites flying in the public realm about whether they will even continue to function in the State and on whom many individual households and small and medium enterprises are dependent, have been extraordinarily profitable.  Recently, we heard that Ulster Bank paid dividends of approximately &euro;3.5 billion to its parent company over recent years.  These banks do not pay tax because they are able to write them off against previous losses.</p><p>Previously, we had a more balanced situation under the former Minister, Brian Lenihan, whereby only 50% of profits could be written off against previous losses.  This was reasonable because it reflected the fact the 50% would be small if the profits were small but not if a bank was in the position of making large profits.  The impact is almost disproportionate.  If a company or bank is not healthy financially, the cost is quite small in terms of paying tax on whatever small amount at 50% but if the bank is extraordinarily profitable, it is reasonable that 50% of the profit could be considered for tax.</p><p>We know the huge efforts and sacrifices the public made, and I am sure some would argue these were made on their behalf and without their particular choice, in respect of bailing out the banks and bringing the banks through a difficult time.  We now have a situation in which we have a lot of banks that are very profitable.  We are continuing to try to protect those banks against risk with measures such as in the summer when we brought through the new Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act, again ensuring that we were underwriting the banks so they do not have to take risks in the same way because we are taking a huge part of that risk.  It is very reasonable, given how much of the risk in the past was absorbed by the public and how much risk continues to be absorbed by the public, that when the risk pays off and there are profits, the public would get something back from it.  Both recommendations ask the Minister of State to consider the question of putting a stronger time limit or, what I would prefer, a percentage limit on the percentage of profit that can be written off and made immune to taxation by banks in Ireland.</p></speech>

The issue of bank profits not being subject to corporation tax because the loss is brought forward is the essence of what we are discussing.</p> <p>Although the precise impact of Covid-19 for the full 2020 year may not be known until early next year, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB reported an aggregate loss before tax of &euro;1.6 billion in the first half of 2020.  Based on the guidance given as part of the third quarter statement in November 2020, it is expected that additional loan losses were incurred by the banks in the second half of 2020.  We are looking at a situation among major banks whereby the losses are well in excess of &euro;1.6 billion and in these recommendations we have the idea of talking about profits with these massive losses this year.  Perhaps when the banks return to profit, we can have a debate on the issue.  The one thing that is sure is that while it is interesting, it will not have a practical effect this year or next year because of the losses that have happened this year, which may well carry into next year.</p></speech>
