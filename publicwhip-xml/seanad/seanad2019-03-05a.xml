I always seem to be in the Chair to greet him, which I am glad to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-05a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019030500002#B00200"><p>I also welcome the Minister, Deputy Ross, to the House.  I appreciate he is taking time out of his busy schedule.  One thing I can say about the Minister is he comes to the Seanad and engages with Senators and I acknowledge this.  I know Members appreciate when a Minister comes to the House and the Minister, Deputy Ross, does so when at all possible.  I acknowledge this and thank him for it.</p> <p>I do not want to go into this at length as we have had a few argy-bargies about driver tests and I do not want to get too bogged down in the figures.  Suffice it to say, today I contacted the RSA, which I do regularly, and I acknowledge its support in sending on updated details.  While I do not want to get bogged down in the details, the email I received from the RSA confirmed that 76,964 applicants are on the driver test list.  Of these, 30,370 tests have been scheduled and a further 25,079 applicants are waiting for a test date.  The remaining 21,514 applicants are unavailable for testing, for example, because an applicant has not completed the mandatory driver test lessons.  In essence, today 55,000 people are waiting for a driver test.</p> <p>The Minister remembers telling us the RSA was engaging more testers.  I followed this up with the RSA to discover a number of testers were due to retire in November and December.  This means that while new people were coming on stream other people were due to retire.  There is also a training period of six to eight weeks.  What we are saying is we have an issue.  What is really important, and the Minister knows this from speaking to his rural colleagues, is that the majority of young people living in rural Ireland depend on their cars for college, work and daily life.  They need an opportunity to do their test and, therefore, to demonstrate their ability to drive safely on our roads.  I know this is paramount for the Minister.</p> <p>What additional resources can be put in place to speed up this process?  Has the Minister or the RSA considered outsourcing some of the testing?  For that matter, would it be appropriate to consider this?  It was done in the past.  Professional people with competence in this area of testing and examination could be brought in to eat into the backlog.  Today, in Tallaght, 2,754 people are listed as scheduled for an appointment, in Cork the figure is 2,491, in Finglas the figure is 2,699 and in Churchtown, the Minister's home patch, the figure is 1,466.  Will the Minister look favourably at supporting whatever mechanisms are necessary to get a grip on these very long waiting lists that are causing concern, in particular to rural people and rural communities?</p> <p>I am aware that since December there have been 350 cases of cars of unaccompanied learner drivers being seized.  I do not condone learner drivers driving unaccompanied.  It is not right that people who are not fully competent and tested are driving.  We cannot allow people to break the law.  On the other hand, we must support these people to be able to do their test as quickly as possible, demonstrate their competence and be allowed to get out on the road.  Will the Minister update us on some of the figures?  How does the Minister intend to use his office to influence speedier reductions in these lists?</p></speech>

I never get weary of responding to this question because it is important.  I hope the response and the achievements will be acknowledged by those who have, quite rightly, raised it in the past.  The driver test service is provided by the Road Safety Authority.  I am very aware of the current waiting times for driver tests throughout the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I accept waiting times at some centres remain high.  Measures being put in place, however, by the Road Safety Authority are working towards reducing waiting times for the public.  The Road Safety Authority's target for a national average time for a driver test is no longer than ten weeks.  Of the 50 test centres around the country, 33 now meet this target, with many coming in under ten weeks.  The current average wait time, as of 4 March 2019, is 8.8 weeks.  Some centres, such as Carrick-on-Shannon, Castlebar, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Deansgrange, Finglas, Letterkenny, Naas, Sligo, Waterford and Wexford are at six weeks or less.  There are, however, some centres where the wait time is considerably longer.  <br/><br/>The longest average wait times are currently in Wicklow, at 17.6 weeks, and Kilrush, at 15.9 weeks.  The average waiting time for driver tests at all centres are available on the Road Safety Authority's website,<i>www.rsa.ie</i>.  This information is updated weekly.  It should be noted that the figure shown in the longest wait time column is the longest time that one, or more, applicants has been waiting for a test.  It is not the average wait time.  That figure is likely due to issues such as non-completion of the mandatory 12 EDT lessons, fee payments outstanding or an applicant rescheduling an appointment.  <br/><br/>It should also be noted that an applicant can apply to sit the driver test at any test centre in the country.  In 2018, following my approval, the Road Safety Authority recruited 52 driver testers and another 14 driver testers are undergoing training.  In addition, it is planned to recruit eight more driver testers in March.  Including the 14 driver testers in training, there are now 147.94 full-time equivalent driver testers available for deployment.  This provides an annual capacity of 260,000 driving tests.  Despite an increase in applications for driver tests, which may reflect legislative changes in respect of enforcing the existing law on unaccompanied learner drivers, the Clancy amendment, as well as ongoing economic and demographic growth, there is a gradual reduction in waiting times at almost all test centres.<br/><br/>With the additional resources available, as well as those coming on stream, waiting times will continue to reduce at all test centres.  The Road Safety Authority provides a facility where driving test cancellations are made available to applicants who may need an urgent appointment.  An applicant should contact the Road Safety Authority directly and request that he or she be placed on the cancellation list.  In order to be fair to all applicants, cancellation places will be assigned in order of the date of placement on the list.  If an applicant requires a driver test urgently, for employment or emigration purposes, the Road Safety Authority will make every effort to accommodate that person.</p></speech>

It is factually correct.  I accept that but it does not address today's reality.  We have 55,000 people waiting to be tested.  When are we going to tackle this issue and reduce these numbers?  As I stated, in Churchtown, part of the Minister's own area, there are 1,466 applicants scheduled for an appointment as of today at 1 p.m.  I can only ask that the Minister keep this matter under review.  That is all we can do.  I commit to keeping the focus on this issue and to ask questions.</p> <p>In fairness to the Road Safety Authority, it is very willing to update me regularly on any request I make.  That is fair.  The Minister did not know in advance I might ask this question and, therefore, he did not address it.  Might he consider bringing in some private contractors to work on this backlog for a one-off stint, perhaps for three months?  I refer to a situation where large numbers of applicants are still waiting for tests after three months.  If that is the case, perhaps some competent people could be brought in for a few months to augment the current services to see if we can make real in-roads into these waiting lists.</p></speech>

It is down at 8.8 weeks now.  I am delighted to be able to say that today.  That is the lowest figure for a long time.  An acknowledgement of that fact would have been more helpful than to call for some kind of private contractors when the RSA is doing exactly what Senator Boyhan is calling for.  It is getting a grip on the figures and reducing the numbers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I look forward to seeing them going lower but I have no current plans to take up the Senator's suggestion.</p></speech>

On a recent trip to Limerick, I mentioned my interest in using artificial intelligence, social media and a digital strategy in educational supports.  In the school we visited, the Minister saw that the pupils used iPads as an aid in education.  Many schools have done so well over years with textbooks but more is required in these days of digital strategies.  I welcome yesterday's announcement of &euro;50 million in the digital strategy for schools.</p> <p>We are now seeing artificial intelligence in every walk of life, even in farms, factories and schools.  It is a part of the future.  Digital media plays a really big part in this process.  If we are going to educate people, we must start at primary school level and bring them with us.  When those people go on to second and third level, they will be so in tune that they will use the technology to the best of their knowledge and in the best way possible.</p> <p>I know parents may be fearful about the use of social media or artificial intelligence but if people are educated properly in its use, including both its harmful side and positive elements, it is something that could stay with those people for the rest of their lives.  Certainly, it is something that we are beginning to see everywhere, as I have already stated.  It is really important as the lives of so many people have been changed by it as well, including by robotics.  Many people are involved with the research and we are promoting this in a very positive way.  Companies use these strategies to drive their future and make their operations more cost-effective.  I would like the Minister to consider looking at these technologies as we should start when people are young.  Bringing them with us is the way to go.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; m&eacute; f&iacute;orbhu&iacute;och as an chuireadh agus as an fh&aacute;ilte a fuair m&eacute; i gContae Luimnigh coic&iacute;s &oacute; shin.  T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta leis an dul chun cinn agus leis an s&aacute;robair at&aacute; ag dul ar aghaidh sa r&eacute;igi&uacute;n sna bunscoileanna, me&aacute;nscoileanna agus ollscoileanna uilig.  I thank the Senator for the very warm welcome to Limerick.  It was eye-opening to see the level of ambition and work that is going on at both primary and secondary levels, as well as in the third level sector.  There is a great impact from the regional approach.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and allowing me to address it.  I am pleased to advise the House that the primary curriculum is currently being redeveloped.  As part of this, a paper on coding in the primary curriculum will be submitted to my Department in quarter 2 this year by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to inform the development of the primary curriculum as a whole, as well as the computational thinking aspect of the new primary mathematics curriculum.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A draft overview of the redeveloped primary curriculum will be published in the autumn and will form the basis for extensive further consultation, providing an opportunity to input views and concerns on what the curriculum should contain.</p><p>Senators may be aware that under the current primary curriculum, social, personal and health education, SPHE, is the context in which social and emotional learning is addressed.  The strand unit of media education at primary level enables pupils to become aware of and learn about various forms of communication, including digital communication, and to think critically about them.</p><p>My Department does not promote or advocate the use of social media in schools, nor does it endorse any one educational platform.  Such decisions are taken by the board of management of a school which has ultimate responsibility for the direct governance of a school, including the safeguarding of students' welfare.  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, however, sets out my Department's policy on the effective use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment.  A key action of the strategy is the promotion of the responsible and ethical use of the Internet and related technologies.</p><p>In addition, there are a number of resources and supports available to schools.  The action plan on bullying focuses on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyberbullying, are addressed.  Awareness on Internet safety for schools is carried out by the Professional Development Service for Teachers, otherwise known as PDST, technology in education in partnership with the safer Internet Ireland project.  Webwise, an Internet safety initiative co-funded by my Department and operated by the PDST technology in education, promotes the autonomous, effective and safer use of the Internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy that targets parents, teachers and children with consistent and relevant messages, including guidance on acceptable usage in schools.</p><p>A range of resources has been developed which helps teachers integrate Internet safety into teaching and learning in their schools.  Last month, the HTML Heroes resource was launched, which aims to assist and support educators when teaching children aged between seven and ten years about the safe and responsible use of the Internet, including social media.  PDST technology in education also provides continuing professional development, CPD, and resources that help teachers integrate the safe and ethical use of the Internet into teaching and learning.</p><p>Under the broadband for schools programme, schools are provided with a portfolio of network services, including the security and filtering of content.  The Government Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-2019 is being implemented by a sponsors' group under the chair of the Department of Education and Skills.  Yesterday, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, announced his intention to bring forward an online safety Bill, which will set out how we can ensure the further safety of children online.  The legislation will involve, for the first time, setting a clear expectation for service providers to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the users of their service.</p></speech>

It is up to people to make their submissions to the review.  I should have mentioned that a digital safety officer will be appointed, as the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment announced yesterday.  The initiative is most welcome across the board because the two initiatives go hand in hand.  This is all about safety.  Recent scaremongering about false sites caused a problem for a while.  This initiative is the way forward.  It is most welcome that digital technology and artificial intelligence are being brought into the classroom and it is up to schools to embrace such technology.  I look forward to seeing whatever changes are made in that regard.</p></speech>

In my first months in this job, I have deliberately immersed myself in my new role.  Visiting primary schools is a big part of this and it is obvious that there is momentum in primary schools.  Teachers are embracing new ways of exploring the new world that we will live in.  This is not being done in silos because there is co-operation and collaboration between primary schools, secondary schools and industry.  More importantly, the third level sector is examining ways in which it can work in collaboration with primary school students.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> There is a creative world out there.  The message coming from the classrooms is that students are embracing new ways of doing things but, ultimately, protections are in place and parents are very eager to ensure that there are protections for whatever form of access to online platforms their children are using.  That is something of which I am conscious.  Whether it is artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, robotics or automation, every sector is looking at the holistic development of young people, embracing that new world and giving our young people the coping and other skills necessary to face the challenges that new world presents.  We want to develop coping skills in these young people.  We are fortunate that teachers are rising to the challenge by retraining and reskilling.  They are on their own learning curves.  There is positive energy in this area.  </p><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I concur with her that there is an opportunity for people to feed into the new primary school curriculum changes.  That door is wide open.</p></speech>

There has been recent media coverage about issues relating to boom time construction.  I have been dealing with a group of residents in the Belmayne area.  I am reluctant to name particular areas because of the reputational damage doing so can cause but we are at the stage where the relevant information is in media circles.  It is time for action.</p><p><i>The Irish Times</i>reported this week about apartments in Clongriffin and about owners facing a bill of &euro;826,000 to remedy serious fire safety issues found at their block.  Residents have been informed that fire would not be contained within any compartment of the building for more than 30 minutes - rather than the 60 minutes required under the regulations - and the owners will have to pay between &euro;4,246 and &euro;6,676 per apartment to remedy the defects.  A letter was recently circulated as a result of a public meeting I organised with my colleague, Mr. Shane Folan, in Belmayne.  The letter was sent by the management company to residents.  It outlined that the management company was due to proceed with an immediate fire safety inspection and it intended to complete a further survey of the balconies in the block.  The management company has accepted that the balconies are defective.  Further surveys will identify what repair work is required.</p><p>The residents want to know who is on their side.  There is any amount of overlapping interest between management companies, developers, Dublin City Council and the fire officer.  The residents want to know if the Government is on their side.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland is suggesting that the Government establish an emergency fund in order to assist these residents.  I presume the Minister of State will agree that the owners of apartments which are proven to be defective should not be left out of pocket.  Some of these residents have already been obliged to dish out &euro;3,000 in order to find out if their apartments were affected by pyrite.  These residents are victims of boom time construction which has proven to be defective.  They want to know if the Government is going to be on their side.  Is the Government going to advocate for them or is it going to wash its hands of this matter?</p><p>At the time of the Priory Hall issue, the former leader of the Labour Party and former Deputy, Eamon Gilmore, was proactive in meeting and talking with residents and anybody who could find solutions to that situation.  We eventually found a solution, although not before a significant amount of hurt and upset were caused.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One man was driven to take his own life at that time.  I have met residents of the area repeatedly and they are under an understandable amount of stress.  They wish and hope that the Government can assist them by providing some support and can be on their side.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's view on the suggestion by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland that an emergency fund be established by Government to assist residents who, through no fault of their own, are out of pocket and living in apartments which are clearly not safe.  Someone else is at fault here and I will be interested in hearing the Minister of State's response.  </p></speech>

In general, building defects are matters to be resolved between the contracting parties, in other words, owners, builders, developers and their respective insurers or structural guarantee or warranty schemes.  While the Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.  In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for affected homeowners.</p> <p>In the case of multi-unit development such as the Belmayne development to which the Senator referred, the legislative position is very clear in terms of where responsibilities lie.  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the building regulations, including Part B which has regard to fire safety, rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.  The aim of the building regulations is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings.  Enforcement of the building regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities which have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and which are independent in the use of their statutory powers.  As such, I am not in a position to comment on a specific development.</p> <p>When a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for fire safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Act 1981 to the person having control of the building.  In multi-unit developments, the person having control is generally the management company.  Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, the owner or management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement and maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development.</p> <p>In terms of addressing fire safety issues, it should be noted that in 2017 the Department published a framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings where concerns arise.  This framework is a guide for the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified or are a cause for concern.  Furthermore, in the aftermath of the fire at Grenfell Tower in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed in respect of fire safety, the Department's national directorate for fire and emergency management was asked to convene a task force to lead a reappraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  In its report the task force acknowledged the importance of fire safety in apartment buildings and made a number of recommendations, which are being implemented. </p> <p>In response to the building failures that have emerged over the past decade, the Department has advanced a robust and focused building control reform agenda which has included amendments to the building control regulations, the establishment of a shared services national building control project, and the ongoing development of new legislation through the building control (construction industry register Ireland) Bill.  These reforms have brought, and will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with building regulations.</p></speech>

Unfortunately I am disappointed with his reply.  I accept that the Department is doing as much as it can for future developments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->From the Minister of State's answer it seems that while residents face dealing with a series of overlapping agencies including the city council, the fire officer, the developer and the management companies, the Department is effectively sidestepping and saying it cannot intervene.  I impress upon the Minister of State the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland's suggestion of an emergency fund to ensure that residents are not out of pocket.  The Department must take this suggestion seriously.  It does not come from me, but from an eminent organisation.</p><p>If I was one of these apartment owners living in Belmayne or Clongriffin, I would want to feel that the Department was not neutral or on the sidelines but actively engaged, concerned and trying to do something about it.  Unfortunately, I do not get this impression from the Minister of State's answers.  I would impress on him again, and on the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that this is and should be their concern.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government must be cognisant of this.</p><p>I find it ironic when the Minister criticises me and people like me for casting a critical eye over planning applications that reach our desks.  This is what happens when due diligence is not carried out.  Ten years later we find ourselves looking at a situation like this because a developer with a profit motive went into an area, built a couple of apartment blocks and was never seen again, leaving a management company to pick up the mess.  Residents are looking at costs of thousands of euro to fix the apartments in which they live.  The stress this imposes on their day-to-day lives is immeasurable.  I would suggest that we need a better response from the Department, and I ask the Minister of State to impress on Deputy Eoghan Murphy the need for a better response and for him to get off the fence and stand in the residents' corner. </p></speech>

However, the Department and the Government have a responsibility to the taxpayer and they cannot open up a potential liability.  There are more than 200,000 apartments in the country.  A responsible Government cannot be in the business of being the first port of call for building defects.  I am not particularly familiar with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland and its request for an emergency fund, but it strikes me that it might have skin in the game.  Some of its members were surely part of surveying some of these buildings.  It might be opportune for that organisation to suggest that the taxpayer should foot the bill.</p> <p>The people responsible for doing the dodgy work that leads to situations like the one in Belmayne and the other professionals who are involved in such projects should be the first port of call in seeking genuinely necessary compensation for people who find themselves living in a building with big defects through no fault of their own.  Responsibility must be on the professionals who constructed and signed off on such buildings.</p> <p>I take the Senator's general point that the Government and the Department should not be neutral, and I will emphasise this to the Minister.  They certainly should not be and as far as I am concerned they are not.  Equally, the taxpayers cannot be the first people expected to put their hand in their pocket when professionals do not do their job.</p></speech>

I know he will relay my concerns to the Minister.</p><p>Last week, conditions at the department of psychiatry in St. Luke's Hospital came to public attention following a case which the Mental Health Commission took against the HSE under the Mental Health Act, the first such case to be taken.  Staff, parents, patients and loved ones have detailed many of the issues that were found during an unannounced inspection of the unit which took place between 6 November and 9 November.  I am deeply concerned that the voices of those using and working in the facility are not being heard and that it takes an unannounced inspection and a court decision for anything to be done.  I have highlighted the unacceptable overcrowding at this facility a number of times, both here and in meetings of the mental health committee.  I am appalled that it was used as an excuse for not having cleanliness as a standard in the facility.  I have been on record to highlight patients being left on corridors, on floors in the TV rooms and on couches but the conditions in this case are staggering in the levels of deprivation on display.</p><p>How have we arrived at this point?  Is there a culture in hospitals whereby patients seek mental healthcare in which everything is operated without adhering to standards until somebody is caught?  I am concerned that these conditions are standard and I would like to be assured that they are not.  I would like to be assured that these conditions will never happen again and I would like to be assured that there will be some accountability here.</p><p>For far too long, mental health issues have been ignored, stigmatised and demonised.  We have buried our mentally ill in basements and back rooms under the veil of shuttered windows and barred doors.  We need to clean up our attitudes and adopt modern attitudes in our facilities.  We need to shed light on any kind of activity that demonises people who are in need of mental health.  I am getting sick and tired of controversies over how we treat each other in this country.  The patients in these facilities are the most vulnerable people and they matter, but it was disturbing, to say the least, to listen to my constituents tell me stories of being in the facility and leaving their beds to use the bathroom, only to return to find someone else in their bed, sometimes without clothing on, and to hear their harrowing tales of filth, dirt and unsanitary conditions.</p><p>What is the level of supervision of patients across the service?  Why was this type of story repeated to me from several different perspectives?  I heard from staff in the units who were exasperated with the workload, overwhelmed with actual care and unable to rectify maintenance issues.  These staff need help to do their jobs and that is where the HSE comes in.  We cannot have a situation where patients using mental healthcare facilities have nowhere to spend recreational time.  They see blatant drug use and go to their bed at night in fear of opening their eyes and what they might see upon doing so.  These patients are looking for help and what they are receiving is the stuff of torment and nightmares.  It is too late when whistleblowers come forward and when unannounced inspections have to be relied upon to catch these things.  What sort of a culture exists in the service?  The public deserves to know that there is a standard of care across the board.  These are most vulnerable patients.  They cannot rely on themselves or other patients to look after them.  We cannot, again and again, force hard-pressed people into the private system.</p><p>This Government does not care about the people who, through no fault of their own, are in financial distress but have to access the public health system for mental care.  It is unacceptable to have a facility where there is dirt on the floor and walls and the bedding is of an extremely hazardous material.  There has to be a standard from the outset and not in response to a judge.  People die, disappear and lose themselves in our system and the Minister has to find a way to ensure these things do not happen.  There seems to be money everywhere except where it needs to be put and I am asking the Minister to reassure me and the people of this country that not only will there be accountability, there will be root and branch investigations of all our facilities so that we create a culture of operating at the highest standard, and not just when an inspector arrives.</p></speech>

I assure the Senator and the House that mental health is, and will continue to be, a priority concern for the Government.  I have heard the genuine concerns of the Senator on this matter.  I agree that the public needs to know and that standards have to improve.</p> <p>I wish to reassure the Senator on the point about money.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The recent budget, which saw the mental health allocation increase to nearly &euro;1 billion, is a clear indication of the importance placed on the mental health of the nation by the Government.  We have increased the HSE&rsquo;s mental health budget by more than &euro;245 million since 2012.  This has helped to fund a number of initiatives aimed at reducing demand on the mental health services.  It has provided, for example, an extra 130 psychiatric nurse undergraduates places each year to come onstream in 2020 to 2021.  In addition, 40 postgraduate places have been funded.  Together with the recent appointment by the HSE of around 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists into primary care and ten advanced nurse practitioners directly into the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, it is anticipated these posts will help to deal with the increased demand for CAMHS.</p><p>Budget 2019 allocated an additional &euro;55 million for the development of mental health services.  The additional funding allocated to mental health services since 2012 has provided for the recruitment of nearly 1,700 new development posts in mental health.  In the last year, the number of staff across the mental health service has increased by 163.  The number of consultants has increased by 14 while the number of nurses has increased by 41.  There are widely acknowledged difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist mental health staff, particularly consultant psychiatrists.  We accept there is a problem in that respect.</p><p>Every possible option is being pursued in order to recruit while acknowledging the critical impact medical vacancies have on service provision.  To tackle this a dedicated medical manpower officer has been appointed.  In addition, local management is working with 11 national and international agencies to source suitably qualified candidates.  All options are being explored, including the provision of out-of-hours or weekend clinics by a consultant working elsewhere. </p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, will be overseeing the roll-out a tele-counselling pilot project in 2019.  This will ascertain the merits of delivering care from a distance using technology and video-conferencing.  Tele-counselling can provide a range of services, including psychiatric evaluations, individual, group and family therapy, education and patient management.  The Minister of State expects the introduction of tele-health services will expand over time to create additional capacity in psychiatry.  Tele-health initiatives may offer flexible opportunities for consultants to work from their chosen location or in supported tele-hubs located in more convenient areas.  This should increase the overall attractiveness of the advertised posts resulting in a higher success rate of filling the vacant positions.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has also met the HSE's executive clinical directors to discuss the recruitment and retention issues.  He has written to them to request further suggestions on how recruitment might be improved.</p><p>The Mental Health Commission has an important part to play in ensuring that our psychiatric units are of a sufficiently high standard.  The commission has responsibility for the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres.</p></speech>

I understand what he has said and that we need to recruit more psychiatrists and nurses and that would be welcome,   However, the department of psychiatry in St. Luke's Hospital came to public attention last week on foot of a case, the first of its kind, brought by the Mental Health Commission against the HSE under the Mental Health Act.  This is a massive issue.  Many people have telephoned my constituency office about it.  It is unacceptable.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the other Ministers of State in the Department need to step in to address this issue.  What happened in this case cannot be allowed to happen again.  These people were neglected.  This was the first case of it kind.  We need to make sure what happened in this in unit does not happen in any other psychiatric unit.  The Minister of State's reply did not fully answer the issue I raised.  I ask him to bring this issue to the attention of the Department and the Minister and to ensure it is addressed.  This is very serious.  I will raise this issue again in the next few days to get more clarification on it and a better answer, but I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to respond to it today.</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned, neglect is unacceptable.  We accept that.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and the Department.  I reassure the Senator that the Minister of State and the Department are working closely with the HSE to address recruitment and retention issues across the mental health service.  In conjunction with the Mental Health Commission, the Department is also monitoring efforts by the HSE to improve the standards and conditions for all patients in line with rules and regulations, as directed by the Mental Health Act 2001.</p> <p>I will bring the Senator's major concerns to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, because such issues must be addressed.  We must take a more hands-on approach.  The bottom line is that we have to look after the interests and rights of patients and also be more supportive of families.</p></speech>

This leaves just over &euro;90 million in the fund.  More than 1,000 people who have been given loan approval have not yet drawn down these moneys.  The proportion of approved applicants who draw down the loans appears to be higher than 50%.  Using basic mathematics, it seems there will not be enough money in the fund for those who would like to draw down the loans.  These are people on the margins who are vulnerable and are relying on the Rebuilding Ireland home loans.</p><p>There are many questions that we must ask.  I note during Leaders' Questions today, my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, put many questions to the Taoiseach and was unable to get clarification.  For instance, what exactly is the Central Bank's view on the home loans?  The Minister, in December, stated he would provide another fund.  Today, the Taoiseach was unable to give my party any answers as to whether that will be the case and indicated he would ask more questions.  Was this fund a mistake?  Is it reckless lending on the part of the Government?  What is the current status of the fund?  Has the Minister directed that no more loans are to be approved?  The Minister has described the fund as a success.  If it is the case that the fund has been closed and no more approvals will be made, this is a loud noise that we are hearing over and over again.  It is important to have a debate on the Rebuilding Ireland loan scheme.  We need facts because people are relying on these loans and if the shutters are coming down, they need to know what their options are.</p><p>A report from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on struggling families titled, Working, Parenting and Struggling?, has found that one in 11 working lone parents was living below the poverty line in 2012 and that number had jumped to one in five by 2017.  It is clear we are not doing enough for working parents.  Unfortunately, Dublin South Central has one of the highest rates of lone parents, many of whom are women.  The Government needs to do much more to support women who are lone parents to ensure resources are available to them and to allow them to go back to work and support their children and ensure their children are not living in abject poverty and enjoy equality of opportunity, as other children do.</p><p>The use of electric motorised scooters is an issue that has been in the press.  We see these scooters in cycle lanes.  Clarity is needed on whether the Garda should enforce road safety laws or whether this is in the remit of Dublin City Council.  We need clarification on whether these motorised scooters should be insured.  We need a short debate in this House on the issue.  I drive every day and these scooters seem to be on the increase.  They are dangerous and it would be easy to hit them because they are travelling faster than bicycles.  I would like a debate in the House on motorised scooters.</p></speech>

I was very disappointed to have reported to me - I do not tweet or receive tweets - that the Minister for Justice and Equality had stated that the conduct of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 in the Seanad underlined the urgent need for root and branch Seanad reform or a second referendum.  I was disappointed to hear that from the Minister, especially since he is conducting the Third Stage of this legislation in this House.  On 27 February, the European Commission published a report on Ireland, which stated the following:</p><blockquote>The proposed composition of the Judicial Appointments Commission, which - according to the amended proposal - would comprise only five judges out of 17 (including a lay chairperson 'accountable to the Oireachtas') would not be in line with European standards (Council of Europe, 2010) and with the recommendation of the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (Group of States against Corruption, 2018) which require that an independent and competent authority drawn in substantial part from the judiciary be authorised to make recommendations or express opinions which the relevant appointing authority follows in practice.</blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Second, it stated:</p><blockquote>As to efficiency, the Court of Appeal, set up in 2014, has a considerable backlog and appears to be under-resourced as regards the number of judges.<br /><br />A draft Bill providing for an increase in their number has been approved by the government.  </blockquote><p>It complains that this has not been progressed.<br/><br/>With regard to the first one, this is, yet again, a condemnation of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill before this House.  Yet again, the European Commission is warning us that what we are doing is in breach of the GRECO report and in breach of the Council of Europe recommendations, yet it is being persisted with.  We have been told consistently in other places that, somehow, the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill debate is holding up other legislation.  That is false.  It is not true that it is holding up any other legislation and if there is any other legislation the Leader wants to get through, I am sure the majority of Members of this House will accommodate him.<br/><br/>One of the Bills which is waiting to be dealt with in this House is the Judicial Council Bill, which was passed on Second Stage without division in this House, having been introduced here.  It has been deliberately stalled by the Government and taken hostage because the Government wants to make the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill done first and the other second.  I would point out to my friends in Sinn F&eacute;in in particular that they are anxious to have sentencing standards as part of the Judicial Council Bill and I believe the great majority of Members agree with them on that.</p></speech>

Let us do that collectively.</p> <p>I propose that, instead of dealing with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, we deal with Committee Stage of the Judicial Council Bill.

I regret I must rule Senator McDowell's amendment out of order.

These are parents who have done everything by the book.  They get up early in the morning, perhaps even earlier than the Taoiseach himself, yet they have been left behind.  This Government is failing working single parents who are living in poverty.  This is disgraceful not just because of the conditions in which lone parents now live, but because there are actions that need to be taken right now.</p> <p>The activation measures taken during the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government were only going to deliver one result, and this is it.  We said at the time that they would push more mothers and fathers parenting alone into poverty.  Who cares, though, so long as the Government can spin the numbers?  Who cares that there was a failure to back up these measures to increase employment with other policy changes, such as a reduction in the cost of childcare, rent reductions, family-friendly employment practices and greater access to education?  In Ireland, 84% of lone parents were unable to meet unexpected expenses.  This compares with an EU 15 average of 58%.  Unexpected expenses can mean a trip to the doctor or the dentist for either the parent or the child.  There is also a fear of other unexpected expenses.  This is why we see many lone parents being forced to deal with very unscrupulous moneylenders, who charge interest rates in the hundreds of per cent on the money they lend to lone parents and others.</p> <p>One of the recommendations included in the St. Vincent de Paul report is to benchmark social welfare payments, such as the jobseeker's transitional payment and the working family payment, to the cost of a minimum standard of living to ensure adequate income.  Sinn F&eacute;in introduced legislation to this effect last year in the D&aacute;il, and I urge the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, to consider this as one way in which we can lift lone-parent families out of poverty.</p> <p>Another recommendation that could be acted on immediately is to extend the cut-off age for the jobseeker's transitional payment until the youngest child is 18 to assist lone parents in ensuring they are actually better off at work.  I would suggest even beyond the age of 18.  I would suggest this should be extended to children still in education and going into third level education.  In the North there is the child maintenance service.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed that this be established here as well.</p> <p>Finally, SUSI must be extended to students studying part time to allow lone parents to access education while fulfilling their caring responsibilities.  I ask the Minister to come before the House to discuss this report.  I thank the St. Vincent de Paul not only for this report and the numerous other reports it has done, but for all it does for people struggling in poverty in this country.  Time and time again I have had to go to the St. Vincent de Paul on behalf of families, whether the issue be education or that they just cannot live.  They cannot exist.  Such families are dependent on the St. Vincent de Paul.  I commend all the volunteers in St. Vincent de Paul for the wonderful work they do.</p></speech>

May I give the Leader a commitment on behalf of my Labour Party colleagues and Senator Norris?  We will facilitate the passage of any legislation coming into this House as soon as it is ready.  I do not think the judicial appointments Bill is delaying the passage of any legislation through the House.  What we are seeing is what I would call spin rather than content.  If the Leader wants or needs to do so, I suggest he sit down with the leaders of the various groups and let us schedule the legislation he says is being delayed.  I do not believe any Senator is delaying any legislation.  What the Leader does not want is proper scrutiny and debate on the legislation before the House for his own reasons.</p> <p>I will raise one other issue with the Leader.  Both Senator Noone and I have raised the issue of breastfeeding and its importance for women who are returning to the workforce.  Two years ago I published a policy document on this issue for the Labour Party and we had hoped we would see real progress.  I point out to the Leader that teachers who breastfeed on their return to work are given one hour a day to express outside their lunchtime break, which is only correct and proper.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The long-term health and emotional benefits of breastfeeding are well known and well established.  Teachers have that proper and correct entitlement.  Special needs assistants, SNAs, who work beside their teaching colleagues in the same schools, do not, however, have the same entitlement to express breast milk.  They have to do it on an already scheduled 20 minute break.  This has been raised several times over the last eight months with the Minister for Education and Skills.  </p><p>The only response has been that the matter is under consideration.  We know the benefits of breastfeeding for the mother and for the child and there has to be a sense of urgency regarding this issue.  The constant answer that it is under consideration is not acceptable.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Education and Skills and come back to us with a response.  I hope the response will break down this inequality between SNAs and teachers.  If the Minister cannot give a positive answer, then I will be raising this issue again for debate in the House.</p></speech>

I hope he will support the Civil Liability (Capping of General Damages) Bill 2019 that I will be introducing tomorrow.  I hope the Bill will move to Second Stage during Private Members' time in a couple of weeks.  I will seek support for this Bill because it will be very important for people paying insurance.</p> <p>I also want to raise an issue brought to my attention over the weekend.  When I was growing up three Rs were used for reduce, reuse and recycle.  We are all now talking about climate change, climate action and what needs to be done.  We have a situation, however, at the moment where the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, will not license recycling facilities for concrete and allow it be reused.  It has to be put back into the ground instead.</p> <p>As a consequence, more stone and rock has to be quarried and used.  I am referring to concrete that could be recycled and be perfectly usable for roadways and footpaths.  It is not suitable for building as there is a potential issue with pyrite, but it can be used for other construction projects such as in-farm roadways.  The EPA will not, however, grant licences to various highly-regarded companies that could produce this recycled material.  The concrete has to be disposed of in a landfill as a result.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, to come to the House and address this matter.  It is a ludicrous situation.  This recyclable material could be reused in various forms in construction or in the farm sector and that would be good for the environment.</p></speech>

The Government&rsquo;s national broadband plan was announced in 2012.  We are still waiting seven years later.  The delay and uncertainty continues, unfortunately.  That uncertainty has been added to in recent days by comments made by the Taoiseach.  He seemed to indicate that a hard Brexit, and a resultant bailout for farmers, could affect the national broadband plan.  His comments were rejected outright by the president of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, Mr. Joe Healy.  It is important we get clarity on this issue.</p> <p>Broadband is not just an essential tool for the farming community.  It is also vital for rural businesses and rural families throughout the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Rural Ireland has been waiting long enough for broadband.  Why should the people of rural Ireland be treated like second-class citizens when it comes to modern communications?  Rural Ireland needs certainty and clarity on when exactly it will get broadband.

It is very unfortunate that last week at our whips and leaders meeting we were told categorically by the Leader that the Bill would not be on the schedule this week.  I accept the agenda can change.  We have to plan for this and if those meetings are to amount to anything, we must have some assurances.  The Leader explained there is flexibility and I respect that.  At the same time, that is what we were told.  Other stories emanated over the weekend as to how the circumstances changed.

People woke up this morning to hear on RT&Eacute;'s "Morning Ireland" the devastating news that funding had run out for the scheme, which is really disappointing.  We should ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to come in and explain this.  The reality is that the people involved with this finance scheme earn slightly above the threshold for the housing assistance payment or social housing.  They do not qualify for those schemes.  These are the people who get up early in the morning, driving long journeys to work and home again.  They now find themselves outside a scheme that could provide housing.  These are the people we should be encouraging but it is important we have all the facts, so it is important to have the Minister in here as soon as possible to explain the shortcomings in that scheme.</p></speech>

Everybody wants houses built but we must be very careful about building infrastructure to provide for families who move into any new houses.  I recently had a meeting with residents in an area where six new building projects have either got planning or in the process of getting planning.  This will add 400 houses to an area without any overall master plan for the area with respect to the provision of childcare facilities, recreational areas or sporting venues.  I am seriously concerned that six projects can get planning permission in such circumstances.  One scheme has approximately 170 houses and the other five will have 40 or 50 houses each.  They are separate applications so there does not appear to be an overall strategy on how they should be dealt with.</p> <p>We need to watch this very carefully.  In the not too distant future, the area will have many young children and teenagers but there will not be any facilities where they can be involved with sport or recreational activities.  It is important that when something like this happens, a local authority should say, "Hold on a second now, we need to put in a master plan before granting any further planning permission".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government in here on the next occasion to deal with planning, especially in areas outside cities or in new towns that are being created.  I am surprised that no overall plans have been produced for these projects.  Originally, the projects were villages but they are now turning into towns.  If all these projects go ahead, the area involved will be larger than four or five country towns in County Cork put together.  We must invite the Minister in to talk about this matter and ensure that the planning criteria and all the boxes are ticked in terms of amenities for the people who move into the accommodation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-05a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1372" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019030500002#T00200"><p>I welcome the announcement made by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, that he will introduce legislation to appoint an online safety commissioner.  That is a hugely positive result for the people who have long championed the need for a regulator.  Organisations like Cyber Safe Ireland and the ISPCC and the Ombudsman for Children have also called for the commission for some time.  It also reflects the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in its report on digital safety and harmful communications.  Forming a stand-alone office will strengthen the State's efforts to combat micro-targeting, advertisements and cyberbullying.  Ultimately, the initiative will allow users to interact online in a safer manner.  The proposals mirror the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017, which was brought forward by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  I commend him on his efforts because without them, I do not think the current initiative would be happening.</p> <p>I wish to note my concern as to why the Government must spend time and resources drafting its own legislation and taking up the time of the Select Committee on Justice and Equality as it is already working on the Bill put forward by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  I call on the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to work with the committee and amend the legislation, if necessary.  That would be a more prudent use of resources.</p> <p>The Minister for Health said on this week's "The Week in Politics" that some of the Private Members' Bills brought forward in these Houses are poorly drafted.  He is right but in defence of Members who draft legislation, they do not have the resources of an entire Department at their disposal.  If a Department is willing to support, in principle, legislation, then there is an onus and a responsibility on the Department to draft amendments or to work with the legislator.</p></speech>

I encourage everyone, including parents, teachers and students, to get involved in the six-week public consultation launched this week on online safety legislation to improve online safety and to ensure that children especially can be protected online.</p> <p>For far too long we have left the door open for all sorts of awful things to sneak in.  We must ensure that this does not happen.  Fianna F&aacute;il has repeatedly called for the establishment of a regulator for technology giants or an online safety commissioner who would oversee a system that would protect consumers.  This is an urgent matter and, frankly, the State has dragged its heels in terms of this matter.</p> <p>Online platforms are currently required to remove content which is a criminal offence under Irish and EU laws.  However, our laws do not meaningfully prevent such things as the Momo challenge, which had the children of Ireland up all night all last week.  The question I heard repeatedly being asked was what can be done about this matter.  I want giant tech companies to take greater steps to keep their users safe online.  We would be one of the first countries to have such regulations.  Since we are home to so many of these companies, we need to lead the way.  I call on members of the public to make submissions because it is important that they do so.  </p> <p>I second the call by Senator Boylan to invite the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in here for a debate. </p></speech>

That situation is unacceptable.</p></speech>

When the Opposition does a good job, and succeeds after more than a year to introduce legislation, I often wonder why the Member is told that it is not perfect enough.   Is this because the Department does not want to see the Opposition bringing much-need legislation through the Oireachtas?  Be that as it may, we will keep doing it.</p> <p>On the issue of notifiable diseases, last week we had an outbreak of mumps and this week an outbreak of measles.  The incidence of measles is on the rise worldwide.  We have had some 70 cases so far this year, whereas the total last year was much lower than that.  There is a concern about the uptake of vaccination for notifiable diseases because if fewer than 95% of the population are vaccinated we lose the herd immunity.  The undermining of vaccines has gone on for a long time.  There are certain celebrity types in the US who use social media to a great extent to undermine vaccination.  We saw the scare mongering that went on when the HPV was provided.  I would like the Minister for Health to come to this Chamber to talk to us about the HSE health protection surveillance centre's information on the uptake of vaccination and the notification of notifiable diseases.  We need to achieve an uptake of 95% of the eligible population.  I know that the uptake figures are sadly lower.  This is a public health issue but lots of people are allowing a misunderstanding of the science to influence behaviour.  As legislators and as public representatives we need to continuously support the programme of vaccination and highlight the need for it.</p></speech>

Both Senators Ardagh and Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, a Government backed mortgage scheme for first-time buyers launched in February 2018 with a projected 1,000 loans during a three-year period.  The scheme has exceeded expectation.  Some 575 people have been helped through this scheme to purchase their own home.  A further 1,000 applicants have been approved and have not drawn down the funding.  Both the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Taoiseach have said that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in negotiations with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government about continuing this very important scheme which allows people who have been refused a loan by the banks to be able to purchase their own home.  We all want to see that happen.</p> <p>What the Members opposite did not say was that the Government is considering increasing the cap above &euro;200 million.  The Government is consulting with the Central Bank of Ireland regarding loans being approved.  As we all know this is a very important scheme for people which offers a pathway to being able to buy their own home.  I certainly hope that we can have this done quickly.  It is an important piece of the housing market.  Members will know that people who avail of loans under this scheme are those who have had their loan applications rejected for a variety of reasons by commercial banks.  I hope the Government, through the Central Bank of Ireland, will facilitate the continuation of this scheme and I very much look forward to the Government working to have the scheme re-opened.</p> <p>A number of Members have raised the report of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Senators Ardagh and Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I join with Members in commending and congratulating the volunteers of the society for the significant work they do in communities across our country.  They are a very important part of the social fabric of our society and assist many different people in a variety of ways.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the five-year period from 2012 to 2017 our country was in the depths of the worst recession ever.  Government took a number of steps in those times and subsequently to improve supports for lone parents.  For example, the income thresholds for the working family payment were raised, rates for qualified children were increased, the earnings disregard for one-parent families and jobseeker transition payments were increased, and back to school clothing and footwear allowance was also increased.  If an analysis of the four budgets from 2015 to 2019 was done, it would be seen that the average weekly income of lone parents has increased by &euro;43.75 for those in employment and by &euro;45 for those who are unemployed.  This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;39.25 in the earnings of the average household.  As a result of budget 2019, lone parents working 15 hours a week at the national minimum wage are now better off by &euro;1,000 a year.  Senator Conway-Walsh made reference to visits to doctors.  It was this Government and the last Government that introduced the free GP scheme for those under six and those over 70.  I know that does not apply in this case, but some people will want to hear that.  I will be very happy to have the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, come to the House in respect of the scheme.  Last week the Children's Rights Alliance published its 2018 report card which showed that budget 2018 and budget 2019 included measures specifically aimed at supporting families on low incomes.  I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House in that regard.</p><p>Senator Ardagh also raised the issue of electric and motorised scooters and the challenges they present.  I will have the Minister, Deputy Ross, come to the House with regard to that matter.</p><p>Senator McDowell, Senator Boyhan and, indirectly, Senator Humphreys raised the issue of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  I am not going to add any fuel to the fire or add anything to Senator McDowell's comments regarding tweets and newspaper reports in respect of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill last weekend.  Members of this House have their views on the Bill and I respect those views entirely.  As Leader of the Seanad and on behalf of the Government, it is my job to facilitate all requests in the House.  Requests are made every day and I will always try to facilitate them.  If Senator Boyhan was discommoded, I sincerely apologise to him.  The email to the Cathaoirleach went out at 3.30 p.m. the day after the group meeting.  That is one day.  I do not believe that discommoded people but, if it did, I apologise.  As Senator Boyhan knows quite well, the schedule is an indicative schedule.  As I said in this House and in the group meeting, it is my intent to put the Bill on the schedule whenever the Minister for Justice and Equality is available.  That is what I have done.</p></speech>

As the Senator knows quite well, the schedule is indicative and subject to change.  Lest there be any confusion and lest people get upset in the future, I will again say to Members of the House that it is my intention to have the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill on the schedule whenever the Minister for Justice and Equality is available to take it, if it is not concluded this week.  Members should know that.  Let there be no confusion.</p></speech>

I do not have the answer, but a Commencement matter might be useful in getting a quick response.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the national broadband plan.  He failed to recognise that his party in government sold off Eircom and delayed the national strategy by a generation.  The Taoiseach has asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, to prepare a report on costing and the signalling around due diligence on the part of officials.  The Minister and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, will come back to the Cabinet and the Houses of the Oireachtas regarding the matter.  Senator Gallagher also failed to recognise that his party colleague, Deputy Dooley, made reference to the ESB.  We all recognise that the Government cannot just ask the ESB to manage broadband under the national broadband plan.  That is a harebrained idea that should be knocked on the head.  </p> <p>Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of planning.  It is important that due regard is given to a master plan in the drawing up of county development plans and city development plans.  The points the Senator made are very relevant.  I will have the Minister come to the House.  </p> <p>Senators Warfield, Murnane O'Connor and Devine referred to yesterday's announcement by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment of a new digital safety commission Bill that will come before the House.  We will have that debate in due course.  We all recognise that in an evolving and changing world there is a need for a greater emphasis on accountability and transparency.  I cannot say why the Department is pursuing its own Bill as opposed to working with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, Deputy Lawless or others on their Bills.  The Government and Department are coming together to bring their own Bill forward.  However, when we see Bills that are workable it is important to embrace them.</p> <p>The point made by Senator Devine around notifiable diseases is an important one, about which we must be very vigilant.  We should also promote vaccination.  I would be happy for the Minister for Health to come to the House to address the matter.</p></speech>

Where any three members of the Commission make a request to the Chairperson in regard to any person whose name is recommended by the Commission, the Commission shall also provide to the Minister a dissenting statement setting out the reasons that the requesting members are of the opinion that the person is not suitable for appointment to the judicial office concerned.</blockquote> <p>The purpose of this amendment is to insert a section immediately after section 45.  The latter states:</p><blockquote>The Commission shall, in respect of each person whose name it recommends to the Minister, provide to the Minister a statement setting out the reasons the Commission is of opinion that the person is suitable for appointment to the judicial office concerned.</blockquote> <p>The amendment states:</p><blockquote>Where any three members of the Commission make a request to the Chairperson [which here refers to the chairperson of the commission as defined in the Act] in regard to any person whose name is recommended by the Commission, the Commission shall also provide to the Minister a dissenting statement setting out the reasons that the requesting members are of the opinion that the person is not suitable for appointment to the judicial office concerned.</blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As things stand, if this Bill were to be enacted in its present form, there could be a candidate who was strongly objected to by, say, all the judicial members of the commission who were strongly of the view that this particular candidate was an unsuitable person to be put on the courts and they could be outvoted.  As the commission will operate on the basis of a majority vote and a casting vote, it is perfectly possible that a minority, whether it is members of the Judiciary or other people, would be outvoted and a statement would go to the Government in the name of the entire commission setting out why the candidate was suitable.  The opposition to that person's appointment would be effectively silenced and gagged because of the confidentiality rules.  The Government would only hear one side of the story - the reasons the person was considered suitable - and would not hear that there was strong opposition to that person and that a considerable minority of the commission believed the person in question was entirely unsuitable to be appointed and had reasons so to believe.</p><p>If one imagines how the system would work, where there was a strong division of opinion on the commission about the suitability of a person for appointment, the Government would only hear the reasons the person should be appointed.  Those on the commission who had attended the interviews, examined the other candidates, gone through the written application form and all the rest of it, looked at the references provided for that person and had a strong view that was contrary to the majority commission opinion would be required, under the confidentiality obligations, to remain absolutely quiet about the matter and not say a word about it to anybody.  The Government would then get the impression that the entire commission was of the view taken by the majority that the candidate was suitable for the reasons given.  That cannot be right.  It simply cannot be right that nobody on the commission can tell the Government that he or she is strongly opposed to a recommended candidate of the commission.  There is nothing that one or more members of the Judiciary on the commission can do about it.  They have to zip their lips and stay absolutely quiet because it was the view of the majority.  They cannot tip off the Government of their view as to why that person is unsuitable.</p><p>One might ask if this provision would ever be employed and I hope it would not have to be employed.  I hope the commission will operate on consensus and if there was a strong minority saying a candidate was unsuitable, I hope the majority would say that, in view of the strong view of the minority, the candidate would not be short-listed and the shortlist will be done on much more of a consensus basis than having a majority vote.  Unfortunately, this Bill has been cast in the form that there are to be majority votes if there is a disagreement and the chairperson is to have a casting vote.  In addition, the chairperson is to be a layperson and no member of the Judiciary can ever have the casting vote.  That has already been put into this Bill and all amendments to try to shake that situation have been rejected.</p><p>I am strongly of the view that it would be very wrong to have a position in which a significant minority of members of the commission were completely opposed to an appointment and the Government could not be informed of that fact and, not merely that, but would gather the impression, because of what is in section 45, that the reasons given as to why the person was suitable represented the views of the commission in its entirety.  This is hugely important because it is another instance of how this Bill is keeping the Government in blindfolds.  The Bill is effectively keeping the Government in ignorance of the real situation.  To compare that with the position of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, there is nothing to stop a member of the JAAB who is seriously distressed or greatly worried by a recommendation informing a member of the Government of that fact.  There is nothing to stop the Chief Justice informing the Government of his or her misgivings about the wisdom of a recommendation from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  This Bill goes much further and makes it a criminal offence to disclose what happens at the commission and closes off the capacity of members of the commission to bring their misgivings to the Government's attention.  It is part of a pattern of creating a complete cloak of secrecy through which the Government cannot see.  It cannot see that any recommendation was heavily fought and strongly dissented.  It is kept in the dark about that.</p><p>The Attorney General, who will sit as a legal adviser to the Cabinet, is prohibited from telling the Government that a particular candidate on the recommended shortlist from the commission was trenchantly opposed by, say, seven members of the 15-person commission.  Those seven members might totally disagree with the recommendation of that person and the reasons given by the majority as to why the person is suitable.  This amendment is designed not to facilitate just one person who is a crank or a permanent dissentient from alerting the Government to the situation.  It is designed to have at least three people ask the chairperson for permission to put in a dissenting statement and state their grounds for opposing a particular recommendation.  This particular provision is necessary and improves the Bill.  It improves the capacity of the commission to function well.  It improves the capacity of the Government to understand what is happening at the commission, that there are differences of opinion and that, in circumstances such as those envisaged here, there is strong disagreement.</p><p>On the other side of that coin, accepting this amendment would strip away the notion that the Government would be left under the illusion that a particular recommendation of the commission is a unanimous view and the reasons given are shared by senior members of the Judiciary.  Let us imagine that.  Section 45 states that: "The Commission shall, in respect of each person whose name it recommends to the Minister, provide to the Minister a statement setting out the reasons the Commission is of opinion that the person is suitable for appointment to the judicial office concerned."  If a document of that kind arrives on the Cabinet table and a significant minority says this is completely wrong and strongly object to the recommendation of a person, how is the Government even to guess that has happened?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->How is it to even be alerted at all to the possibility that what looks, on the face of it, to be a unanimous endorsement of the person and a statement of why he or she should be appointed, is in fact illusory, and that this was not what had happened during the commission's deliberations?  I ask the Minister to accept this proposal as it is necessary.  The Minister may instinctively reject it but if he does so it will compound the wrong being done by the Bill, which is that it will keep the Government in the dark as to what really went on at the commission and what the strength of the recommendation was.  It will also be in the dark as to whether the reasons for a person's nomination were unanimous or there had been significant dissent.<br/><br/>If the Government is to be kept in the dark, and given the false illusion that the reasons given represented the thinking of the entire commission, and there is no mechanism whatsoever for the Government to be alerted to a controversy as to this person's suitability, it falsifies the whole process and gives a phoney sense of unanimity.  I ask Members to consider what would happen if a somewhat controversial appointment was made on the recommendation of a majority.  The minority, including the senior Judiciary, will be taken by the public not merely to have acquiesced in this but to have supported it because they will not be in a position to signal any disagreement to the Government, to alert anybody to the fact that they disagree or to pull the emergency cord to say they have a problem with it.  If the public sees a notice in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>stating that the person's appointment was recommended by the judicial appointments commission, they will assume that the members of the commission were collectively of that view and that there was no dissent.  I ask the Minister to accept the spirit of this amendment so that a future Government will not to be lulled into a false sense of security on a majority verdict by the commission which it believes was a unanimous verdict.  That would be misleading and unfair to a judicial officeholder who believed, in his or her heart, that the person being recommended was highly unsuitable to be a judge but who had not been able to convince his or her colleagues to that effect.</p></speech>

I spoke on a similar and related topic on the last occasion we debated section 45 and asked the Minister at that time why the statement required to be provided in that section set out only the reasons the commission was of the opinion that a person was suitable for appointment, rather than also setting out the reasons a person may not be suitable for an appointment.  It is eminently sensible to include a provision of the sort proposed by Senator McDowell in his proposal for a new section 46, to be inserted by the amendment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As I said during the previous debate on this, it is pretty standard for anyone sitting on interview panels that the people to whom it is most important to supply reasons are those who are not to be appointed or not deemed suitable for appointment.  This is a very important point.  They are the people who will be disappointed and who will be looking for reasons to be given.  Much more care generally is spent in drafting the rationale or basis on which people are not to be appointed or on which people are not suitable for appointment.  This is a sensible amendment that would assist in the way in which the commission is to go about its business given that the Bill envisages the commission will operate by way of majority vote.</p><p>I do not feel the Minister has given me an adequate response to the questions I asked in respect of how section 45 would work in practice.  Overall there is a real difficulty with sections 45 and 46 and the process as set forth in the Bill.  The process that is to be followed by any future commission is unwieldy and cumbersome.  It is also opaque.  I listened carefully to Senator McDowell's points about a cloak of secrecy.  It seems to me this is a big part of the problem.  While this is purported to be a reform of the process for judicial appointment, what we will be left with if the Bill is passed in its current form, or even in its amended form, is a Bill that provides for this extremely cumbersome procedure and yet a procedure that lacks transparency and a rational basis.  For example, without amendment No. 91g we will see a requirement that the commission will provide the Minister with a statement setting out the reasons a person is suitable for appointment in respect of each person who is recommended but we will not see any detail provided to the Minister as to reasons a person might not be suitable for appointment.  Again, without amendment No. 91g we will not see details provided the Minister, or any requirement for the Minister to be provided with details, as to whether a vote or recommendation is made by way of majority, perhaps a majority of only one, on the commission or whether it is, in fact, a unanimous recommendation where the person is so clearly meritorious there is no dissenter.  The problem is this will be a cumbersome procedure but it is also an opaque procedure that will lack any rational basis.</p><p>The Bill as it came to us originally in the Seanad was inherently inconsistent.  Of course, it has now been amended to resolve at least that glaring problem in terms of the numbers on the commission.  There are still quite a number of areas where the Bill lacks inherent or internal consistency and this is one of the issues we seek to address with these amendments.  This is why I will support Senator McDowell's amendment No. 91g.</p><p>To reflect on what Senator Boyhan has just said, there has been a lot of comment in the press about the way in which the Bill is proceeding through the Seanad and the length of time taken on Committee Stage.  I have not spoken to any huge extent, other than on my amendments.  It is important to make this point in respect of amendment No. 91g and the other amendments.  It has been very helpful that the Minister has indicated to us on the floor of the House where he does intend to bring forward amendments on Report Stage and we all appreciate this.  He has indicated this in respect particularly of earlier sections dealing with the most senior appointments.  He will bring forward quite extensive or significant amendments on Report Stage.  His has also indicated a willingness to accept the points made in some of the amendments already put forward by those of us in opposition.  I withdrew some amendments I tabled with regard to gender balance in the Judiciary with a view to redrafting them and bringing them forward again on Report Stage.</p><p>It would really be of greater assistance if we could engage with the Minister and his officials in seeking compromise and resolution of some of the issues we have raised in an attempt to be constructive-----</p></speech>

There has been no suggestion from the Department that this type of meeting outside of the Chamber or constructive engagement with officials would be possible.  I say this as somebody who has brought forward Private Members' Bills and seen them brought into law, generally after this type of constructive engagement with a view to seeking compromise.  I agreed to amendments to my Private Members' Bills, for example, the Competition (Amendment) Bill that became an Act of 2017.  It introduced certain rights for freelance workers, including the right to engage in collective bargaining to determine minimum pay rates.  That Bill was initially opposed by the Government and reluctantly supported in principle.  I, Senator Nash and officials at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation worked together with a view to achieving compromise.  This is the type of approach that would generally be the case where extensive amendments have been tabled to a Bill or where extensive opposition is expressed to procedures in legislation.  We should see this type of compromise approach being adopted.</p> <p>Amendment 91g is an eminently suitable amendment for adoption, at least in principle, by the Government with a discussion on where it could be improved or how the point it is making could be addressed so we can see an improvement to the mechanisms provided for in the Bill.  Otherwise, the problem is we are just debating these amendments and, ultimately, we will be left with a procedure that, as I have said, will be unwieldy and cumbersome to operate and will not have any merit in terms of increased transparency of or rationality for the basis of the recommendations that the commission will be making.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge her constructive and positive approach to the legislation.  I accept what she says about her contributions not being in any way associated with the filibuster, which has been openly admitted on the part of her colleagues.  I agree with her on the matter of compromise.  This is the essence of Committee Stage debate.  I have listened very carefully, and will continue to listen very carefully, to the views of all Senators.</p> <p>We speak about careful consideration but my understanding is the amendments before us were submitted at a very late stage.  Notwithstanding this, I was very keen that we would have the type of debate we are having this afternoon on them.  I am very pleased Senator Boyhan withdrew his unfair and untrue remark.  He has now accepted in his withdrawal that it was inaccurate, untrue and unfair.  I hope we do not have a repetition on the amendment before us.</p> <p>I accept the points that have been made but I would prefer to leave these issues of the decision to the commission and not have a situation where we introduce minority or dissenting reports to the Government, which would have the effect of creating havoc at some stage.  For example, if the majority of commission members recommend candidates A, B and C and a minority of three would prefer candidates D, E and F, under Senator McDowell's amendment they would notify the Government.  Another three members of the commission could exercise their preference in favour of candidates G, H and I, and forward a further report to the Government.  We would have a situation where the Government would have three reports from the commission with nine candidates from which it would be obliged to pick one.  I would regard this as being less than satisfactory and has been against the spirit of the Bill.  This is why I am reluctant to include it in the letter of the Bill.  We should not stray into the business of minority and dissenting reports, particularly in the sensitive area of appointments and recommendations.  The sensitivity of the issue is probably something that has exercised Senator McDowell more than any other issue by way of common thread and I agree with him in this regard.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not minded to accept an amendment which would introduce the concept of a number of reports coming to the Government.

I am disappointed that the Minister will not take on board at least the principle expressed in Senator McDowell's amendment No. 91g.  It makes sense to me.  The Minister says he wants to leave this matter to the commission.  Again, we are being unduly prescriptive and bureaucratic in some provisions of this Bill.  For example, section 45, about which I spoke the last day, requires the commission to "provide to the Minister a statement setting out the reasons the Commission is of opinion that the person is suitable for appointment".  If the commission is required to provide that statement to the Minister, I do not see why it should not similarly be required to provide a statement explaining why certain persons are not suitable for appointment.  Moreover, where there is a dissenting member, as envisaged in Senator McDowell's proposal, I do not see why the commission is not required to provide a dissenting statement as well.  The Bill seems rather selective as to what information the commission is required to provide to the Minister.  Why require the commission to provide the Minister with a statement at all?  Why not simply require the names?  If one follows the logic of what the Minister has said, all the commission should supply to the Minister is the names of those recommended for appointment.  However, that is not what section 45 says.  In respect of each person it requires a "statement setting out the reasons the Commission is of opinion that the person is suitable for appointment".</p> <p>As I said, it does not seem logical that a statement of reasons of this nature is required whereas a statement of reasons a person is not suitable for appointment, or reasons certain members believe that a majority recommendation is not suitable, is not.  This is an example of an unduly bureaucratic and a fundamentally illogical procedure of the kind we see too often.  I wish to reserve the right to bring an amendment forward on Report Stage, addressing more specifically the issue of a statement of reasons that a person is not suitable for appointment.  Alternatively, I would like time to reflect on whether it is preferable to change section 45 more fundamentally, so that the commission is not required to provide any statement of reasons but rather simply to provide the names.  Does the Minister have a view on that?  Is that preferable given the issues that the Minister has pointed out, that is, he does not wish to see minority reports and different statements of reasons?  In that case the obvious answer is to change section 45.</p></speech>

I must be very clear about this.  Senator Boyhan was informed last Wednesday that because of the Brexit legislation it would be weeks before we returned to this matter.  On Thursday evening we became aware that this had been reversed and we were to have an extra session today.  Furthermore, we learned that in order to meet the deadline for today we were obliged to submit any amendments to sections 45 and 46 to the Bills Office by Friday at 11 a.m.  This U-turn resulted in the Minister not having more than three days to consider these amendments.  It was nothing to do with us.</p> <p>If I might make a more general point, as the Committee Stage debate on this Bill proceeds the Minister is entitled to bring his own amendments.  There is nothing wrong with that.  In fact I would argue, though I do not wish to widen the discussion from the particular amendment-----</p></speech>

On Committee Stage, Members are supposed to debate the minutiae and put their amendments forward so that they can be considered in detail.  This is not meant to be done simply on the basis of Report Stage procedure.</p> <p>If the Minister looks at the wording of the change amendment No. 91g would make to section 46, he will see that it does not allow commission members to talk about other more suitable people.  A minority of three could not say that so-and-so was better.  This is a means whereby the requesting members can state that the person recommended is not suitable - not that somebody else is more suitable, but that the person recommended is not suitable.  The Minister conjures up the notion of three fragmented groups in the commission, each with their own favourite shortlist and each opposing those of the others.  This does not provide for that.  This would mean that where the commission by majority says-----</p></speech>

It is not a licence to say that somebody else is more suitable for appointment.  It allows the minority to say that a particular candidate is not suitable for appointment and to give the reasons therefor.</p> <p>Consider a situation where the judicial members of the commission, who account for five out of a total of 17, have a strong view about the suitability of a certain person.  If the Minister's Bill goes through the Government itself will never know that the five judicial members, namely, the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court, share the view that one of the people on the shortlist of persons recommended to the Government is unsuitable for appointment.  This is what the Minister is trying to enact.  He should not cod himself that he is trying to enact anything else.  He is trying to bring about a situation where all the judicial members could be of the view that somebody is wholly unsuitable and the Government would never have an inkling of this.  Nobody could tell the Government, because it would be a breach of confidentiality and a criminal offence to impart to it that the five members of the Judiciary were of a different view.  We are dealing with "transparency", a word that is sometimes used, sometimes abused and sometimes used to mean its exact opposite.  To echo what Senator Bacik said, how can it possibly be a good idea to enshrine in law a series of measures whose result is that if the judicial members of the commission are wholly opposed to a particular appointment they cannot impart that information to the Government?  That is wrong in principle.</p> <p>I raise a point which has been touched on.  This is the Government's constitutional choice.  The Government is responsible for the decision to advise the President to appoint a person.  It is the Government's duty to consider the suitability of such a person quite separately from the commission.  That is a constitutional obligation on the Government.  It cannot be a rubber stamp under our Constitution.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government cannot state that the commission made a recommendation and that this is fine.  Individually, it has to take responsibility for what it is doing.  If the Government advises the President to nominate a particular woman or man to be a judge, it is its responsibility to ensure that it should be so.  For that reason, it is entitled to the maximum amount of information, not the minimum, regarding what it is doing.  It flies in the face of the constitutional requirement to enact legislation that would make it a criminal offence to tell the Government that the entire judicial component of the commission has stated that a person is unsuitable for appointment to the Judiciary.  Leaving the Government under the utterly false impression that everybody in the commission is of the view that everything is hunky-dory with the recommendation is subversive of the constitutional order.  It is strongly subversive of the constitutional order to attempt to put into law a mechanism whereby the Government cannot know the real views of the senior Judiciary, in whom one hopes it reposes some trust, regarding the suitability of any candidate where those members of the Judiciary have an objection that is not shared by majority because they constitute only five out of 17.<br/><br/>This is not just my view or that of Senators Boyhan, Craughwell and Bacik.  In the past fortnight, the European Commission published the following about this Bill:</p><blockquote>The proposed composition of the Judicial Appointments Commission, which - according to the amended proposal [not the first version of this Bill - the dog's dinner that came to us from another place - but this Bill, as now amended] - would comprise only five judges out of 17 (including a lay chairperson 'accountable to the Oireachtas') would not be in line with European standards (Council of Europe, 2010) and with the recommendation of the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (Group of States against Corruption, 2018) which require that an independent and competent authority drawn in substantial part from the judiciary be authorised to make recommendations or express opinions which the relevant appointing authority follows in practice.</blockquote><p>Let us look precisely at what the European Commission stated.  Its objection was based on the requirement that an independent and competent authority drawn in substantial part from the Judiciary be authorised to make recommendations or express opinions that the relevant appointing authority follows in practice.  Under this Bill, however, we have circumstances in which all the judges together comprise less than one third of the entire commission.  Furthermore, we are now about to reject an amendment, if the Minister persists, that allows that minority of senior judges to warn the Government of its opinion on a candidate whose name is to be included on a shortlist.  If the European Commission is listening, it should please hearken to my words.  This is worse than its worst imaginings.  It is to be a criminal offence to disclose to the Government that the judicial element of the commission objects strongly to an appointment that a majority is recommending to the Government.  We are, therefore, flying in the face of what the Council of Europe, the European Commission and the GRECO report have stated in condemnation of this Bill.<br/><br/>I am not straying irrelevantly because I am of the view that this amendment really crystallises how egregious the departure from European standards actually is.  Why do I say that?  I say so because it prevents the senior Judiciary members from imparting to the Government their collective view that a particular candidate, selected by a non-legal majority, is unsuitable.  Surely the Minister must hesitate when he contemplates that.  Could it possibly be right to penalise, with criminal sanction, any person who informs the Government that the senior Judiciary members are of the unanimous view that one person recommended to the Government from a list of three is unsuitable?  I cannot believe that the Legislature is contemplating doing such a thing.  I am astonished that we would ever contemplate bringing about such circumstances.  Time and time again in this debate - I make no apology for coming back to this - I have said this is compounded by the fact that the Attorney General, sitting at the Cabinet table with the Government, is, by way of a point of deliberate legislative policy enunciated by this Minister, equally prohibited from telling the Government the position of the senior Judiciary regarding the suitability of the candidate.  I find it absolutely astonishing that this could be the outcome of this Bill.<br/><br/>Returning to what Senator Bacik said about consulting the Minister in a collaborative way, I would love to sit down around a table and ascertain, apart from the formality of this House, why the Government believes this is a good, defensible idea or an idea that for one minute should be tolerated by a parliament in a democracy.  I fail to understand why this amendment is not being accepted.  It would not bring about factionalism.  It could not be deployed in favour of another person on the list.  It merely affords a dissenting minority, and potentially the entire judicial component of the commission, the entitlement to inform the Government that it dissents from the recommendation being given and to give the reason it dissents regarding the suitability of a particular candidate that the majority wants to recommend.<br/><br/>I do not want to open old wounds but for the Minister to state that Senator Boyhan is somehow misinforming the House, being incorrect or spreading false information when he indicates that the Government is being leaned on by one of its members to proceed with this Bill.  We all know the Senator is telling the truth.  We all have seen it, to the point where telephone calls are made to Members of this House by a particular source demanding explanations as to why they are voting in a particular way.</p></speech>

There is also a minority report and a dissenting report which is exactly what Senator McDowell is trying to transfer to the new judicial appointments regime.  I do not believe in the circumstances that it is in any way desirable for a Government to be provided with a report other than that which the Bill ordains.</p> <p>Section 15(6) deals with the issue quite precisely where there is no consensus on a question of a meeting of the commission the matter should be determined by a majority of votes.  It is best to leave the power and authority with the independent commission and not have circumstances where the Government is in receipt of an official report, a minority report, a dissenting report or another report.  That gives rise to the type of difficulty that Senators McDowell and Boyhan wish to avoid. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-05a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019030500002#MM03900"><p>The very point I made was that section 15(6) is in the terms to which the Minister has just adverted.  Let us ask ourselves what the words "where there is no consensus on a question" actually mean.  They mean that there is a group, in all probability, of people who are in a minority on this issue, and that it should be determined by a majority vote.  That is the situation where a majority vote comes in.  The Minister is now saying that where there is a dissenting minority and even where that dissenting minority includes the entire judicial component of this commission, the Government must be kept in the dark about the existence of a minority and the fact that the Judiciary is in that minority.  This is wholly insupportable and wrong.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to imagine if he is re-elected, reselected and renominated as Minister for Justice and Equality - as he richly deserves, perhaps, to be, I grant him that - in two years' time when this appalling legislation comes into operation, if such a thing happens, and if he received a report from this commission as Minister and presented it to his colleagues in government, and it said that these are the three people who have been recommended and the reasons for their recommendation and somehow afterwards he discovered that every single judge on the commission had said that he or she strongly disagreed with that person's inclusion on the short list, would he and his Cabinet colleagues not feel shortchanged?  Would they not ask who in heaven's name put into the Bill for the commission a prohibition on the Government being warned that that was the true situation?  When one thinks about it, it is a major responsibility to bear.  The Minister is saying that there is to be no mechanism whereby the entire judicial component of the commission cannot intimate its dissent from a majority decision taken against them, they being, in numbers, less than a third of the commission as the EU Commission has warned us against.  This is not some type of fantastic, exotic or improbable scenario that the Judiciary would say that a candidate was unsuitable or that there would be no consensus on an appointment or that a majority would say that someone was on the list and that they were suitable and the minority cannot tell the Government either that they dissented or the reasons for so doing.  It is remarkable that this is being proposed now, in the 21st century, that this is a good idea and that the Government which, under the 1937 Constitution, bears the responsibility for judicial appointments, should be kept in such a state of abysmal ignorance as to the attitude of the Judiciary to a potential appointee.  It flies in the face of the Council of Europe and the GRECO condemnation of this Bill and the EU Commission's recent reminder.  They have not walked away from this.  They have looked at the amendments that we have made to the Bill and have said that it is still wrong.  Yet we still proceed with it.</p> <p>There is another, less contentious, matter.  Is there anywhere in the Bill, and I ask the Minister to point it out to me, that says this particular statement of recommendation shall itself remain secret?  It does not fall under the confidentiality obligation in respect to the commission's own activities.  It is a message that it sends to Government.  It sets out certain reasons.  Is there anywhere in the Bill, as currently drafted, that says that this statement of recommendation shall remain secret?  Is it even subject, God help us, to freedom of information?  I would like to have a clear answer to that.</p></speech>

I cannot immediately point Senator McDowell to the letter.  I would be happy to do so at the earliest opportunity.  In the event that it is not, I would be keen to ensure that the report itself would be confidential.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As such, this would be subject to the confidentiality rules and conventions of Cabinet.  If there is no specific reference, I would be happy to ensure we would work towards having such a specific statement in an appropriate place in the Bill before its enactment.  I do not wish to open a further flank on the Council of Europe GRECO reports but I remind the House, as I have on numerous occasions, that there are no set international norms in these matters.  The Council of Europe would be aware of our legal system and common law regime, which is considerably different in practice and procedure from what is the norm among Council of Europe members.  That is a point on which we have made considerable argument in the context of our engagement with GRECO, which has been active and will continue.</p><p>What Senator McDowell wishes to support is not something that has arisen with regard to this particular amendment but is common to a number of amendments.  It becomes clearer the longer we debate the matter that there is a desire on the part of a number of Senators to have something of a parallel process, having regard to the fact that this will be a 17-member commission.  There appears to be support in this House for a small group of people who will assemble and be influential within that group of 17 people.  I am concerned that if we accommodated groups within groups and minority or dissenting reports on the part of a group within the commission, we would be going against the fundamental principle of the Bill.</p></speech>

It is following this debate and it is clearly aware that we have amended this Bill to reduce the judicial element to less than one third of the proposed judicial appointments commission.  The Commission has maintained its objection to and criticism of the Bill on the grounds set out.  I am not a person who believes the Commission of the European Union is infallible but it is interesting to note that the T&aacute;naiste spoke about Ireland being absolutely at the centre of Europe in its thought processes, etc.  Nevertheless, the Commission has repeatedly told us that this Bill is not what it thinks is appropriate.  We have increased the size of the proposed judicial appointments commission to 17 and fixed the number of judges at five, which is less than one third of the membership of the total commission.  We have been repeatedly told by the European Commission that this is not a circumstance in which the Judiciary would be a &quot;substantial&quot; part of the body making the recommendations.  It would be less than substantial and in a small minority.  It would be less than one third of the entire body.  The Commission has warned us repeatedly about this but we are ploughing ahead regardless.  That is just an observation.</p><p>It is not a matter of having a faction within the judicial appointments commission.  If the entire judicial component of this commission comes to the view that a person is not suitable, there is to be no mechanism whatever for those members to inform the Government.  The Minister speaks about a desire on the part of some people to maintain a parallel process.  I will put this in a constitutional context.  The starting point is that the Government is free to appoint any person eligible for appointment in accordance with law and its own decision as to whether to advise the President to appoint a person to be a judge.  It is the starting point under the Constitution that this is an executive function.  The derogation that this legislation proposes from that constitutional principle is that there should be an advisory body whose opinions, in the case of judicial appointments, should be brought to the attention of the Government by way of shortlists.  That does not detract from the constitutional right, prerogative and duty of the Government to make a decision by itself on the basis of its own judgment and on foot of its own responsibility as to who it should recommend to the President.</p><p>It is a simple matter and it is not a question of a parallel process.  The purpose of this Bill seems to be to destroy all incoming information to the Government as to the real position and give a false view as to what the choices really are or who is really available.  It also affects information to the Government as to whether there is dissent or consensus on any particular recommendation.  It is what the policy of the Bill seems to be.</p><p>We can go back to what was included in the programme for Government and what was adopted collectively, satisfying one particular member of the Government in doing so.  The programme indicated the shortlist should be as small as possible under the Constitution, meaning as few people as possible should be on it, and not more than three.  There was some vague recognition that the Government had some rights in this matter but there would either be one, two or three persons on the shortlist according to the programme for Government.  We now have three, which I presume arises from the recognition that there is a Constitution and an obligation to allow the Government to make its own decisions.  This is not a question of a parallel process but rather maintaining the right of the Government to really know what is going on and not be dictated to by a commission through a starvation of information and the presentation of a false facade of unity about a particular shortlist.</p><p>We have discussed this adequately and the majority of people present now are of the view that this amendment should be obeyed.  They may not be a majority in the House when the matter is put to a vote.  Let us have no illusions as to what we are doing in rejecting this amendment.  We are saying it will be a criminal offence to tell the Government that the five members of the Judiciary <i>ex officio</i>on this commission were of the minority view that one of the people recommended was unsuitable.  It also indicates there should be no means whatever for that group to inform the Government of the reasons its members are of that view.  Is this not a flagrant breach of the Council of Europe policy on the matter and GRECO recommendations, as well as a flagrant disregard of the European Commission's repeated reminders to us of those standards?  More important, is this not a flagrant disregard of what the Constitution requires, which is that the Government be entitled and free to know all relevant factors when it comes to making a decision on who to appoint to the Bench, including the attitude of people whom it trusts and the Judiciary?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It should be free to know these things.  If it is not that, I do not know what it is.  I have put the point to the Minister as strongly as I can.  I will not prolong the matter any further.  This is yet another flag as to why this Bill is unconstitutional and should be referred to the Supreme Court by the President.</p></speech>

Second, Senator McDowell is incorrect when he speaks about the commission dictating to the Government.  That cannot and will not happen under this Bill.  In any event, it cannot happen under the Constitution.  Throughout this debate people on all sides of the House have been very keen to ensure that nothing in this Bill in any way interferes adversely, or impacts upon, the Government's unfettered discretion on the matter of the appointments.  To use the word "dictate" with regard to the commission is something of an exaggeration.</p></speech>

If the Government has unfettered discretion, why should it not know that fact?  It is all very well to talk about discretion, but discretion can only be exercised in the face of knowledge.  One should know that there are two sets of circumstances.  How can one have unfettered discretion if one has to play blind man's buff, put earphones on, and not know how one is exercising such discretion while pinning the tail to the donkey with a blindfold over one's eyes?</p></speech>

Such a situation still does not pertain and will not until this Bill in its present miserable form is passed.  These provisions are now being introduced for the very first time by this Government.  It is all one-way traffic.  One can say that there is a slight fig leaf in this Bill where it is said that nothing interferes with the right of the Government to make its own recommendation in any event, but the entire Bill does precisely that.  It keeps the Government in ignorance of the true facts and makes it a criminal offence to tell the Government about those facts.  I despair sometimes, but there we are.</p></speech>

At present, section 46 reads as follows:<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->&quot;In advising the President in relation to the appointment of a person to a judicial office the Government shall firstly consider for appointment those persons whose names have been recommended to the Minister or, in the case of <i>section 44</i>,<i></i>the Government in accordance with the provisions of this Act.&quot;  This is modelled on an equivalent provision of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board legislation about which I have often wondered.  In what sense is it open to the Oireachtas, when the Government is considering the matter of how to advise the President, to tell the Government in what order it must deliberate on the subject?  That is the case in the current provisions relating to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  As a matter of fundamental principle, it seems that it is for the Government to decide whether it will look to its own idea of who should, for example, be Chief Justice.  It is for the Government to decide whether it will consider its own proposed name in the first instance and then consider the shortlist of the Judicial Appointments Commission before it makes its decision.  It is a legislative impertinence for the Oireachtas to tell the Government, when it comes to advising the President to, for example, appoint someone as Chief Justice, to consider the people on the shortlist before it considers the person it has collectively decided is the right person.  That is not leaving it as a choice for the Government as to how to regulate its business and approach the giving of advice to the President on judicial appointments.  <br/><br/>Is it possible for the Oireachtas to tell the Government, when it comes to consider a question, that it must first consider this before it decides that?  Is that the case in the context of any issue?  If the Government chooses to propose a certain judge as Chief Justice, is it possible for the Oireachtas to ask it to consider a shortlist of candidates before it makes its decision?  Can the commission ask the Government to consider the merits of three other candidates before considering the merits of somebody who the Government is disposed to appoint in the first instance?  It is not within the competence of the Oireachtas to tell the Cabinet the order in which it must approach the candidates for judicial appointment.  If the Government was fully of the view that a particular candidate was going to be appointed Chief Justice, telling it that it must consider the merits of the candidates the commission proposes before considering the merits of its preferred candidate seems to be invading the discretion that is given to Government.  If the Government has a discretion to make appointments not recommended by the commission, this is telling it that, before it goes on to appoint somebody else, it must effectively reject the commission's appointments.  That is what this means.  If the Government must consider these people first, it must reject them before moving on to its own choices.  That is an interference with the constitutional prerogative of the Executive to order its own business.<br/><br/>That is not a huge point, or one that I will die at the stake for, but it is important.  The language of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board legislation is somewhat unrealistic.  I do not know if this persists, but there have been cases in which the Government has authorised the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Attorney General to approach a particular candidate and ask if he or she will take a position and tell him or her that he or she will be appointed if he or she is willing to accept the position.  To say that, before it does this, the Government must consider all the other options is an invasion of its prerogative and discretion to make such decisions as it considers correct under the Constitution.<br/><br/>I will not speak at length about this matter.  The point I am making is simple but I strongly believe that the word &quot;firstly&quot; performs no useful function here.  The section without the word &quot;firstly&quot; would state, &quot;In advising the President in relation to the appointment of a person to a judicial office the Government shall consider for appointment those persons whose names have been recommended to the Minister or, in the case of <i>section 44</i>,<i></i>the Government in accordance with the provisions of this Act.&quot;  The deletion of the word &quot;firstly&quot; would not fly in the face of the principle of this legislation and the Government is entitled to decide who it will consider first, when and if it wants to make an appointment, whether its own choice or that of the shortlist supplied to them.</p></speech>

There are circumstances in which the issue might be regarded as important.</p> <p>Senator McDowell's referred to the current judicial appointments process and the capacity of the Houses of the Oireachtas to in some way bind the Executive.  If followed through on, that would be serious.  I am not sure if the Senator can draw on any further evidence to support his claim.  I point to section 16 of the Court and Court Officers Act 1995, section 16(6) of which states, "In advising the President in relation to the appointment of a person to a judicial office the Government shall firstly consider for appointment those persons whose names have been recommended to the Minister pursuant to this section."  I do not believe, therefore, that the warnings offered by Senator McDowell in respect of the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature are as serious as he would have us believe.  I cannot recall that 1995 legislative but it could well be that these points were made at the time of its enactment and that the Minister of the day was satisfied to proceed with the section, the import of which is being followed in the case of the Bill we are discussing.</p> <p>Government will be giving a due consideration and I do not believe that in any way interferes with the constitutional position of the Executive.  I am happy to listen to Senator McDowell if he cares to go further on the issue, which I do not believe he is minded to do, but I am happy to accommodate him.</p> <p>I am concerned, as with the previous amendments, that we would be in some way downgrading or reducing the status of the independent judicial appointments commission.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not prepared to do that.  If the Government were not to first consider the recommendations and names coming from the independent commission, the commission would be fatally undermined.  It could be that Senator McDowell would welcome that.  It would be consistent with his argument over the past few months and, ultimately, this is what he and his colleagues would like to achieve.  I understand that position but I certainly do not agree with it and I am not minded to amend the Bill in any way that might undermine, or even downgrade the status of, the independent commission.  I am not going to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Governments are free to choose a judge for a particular office at present and not to go near the commission in the first place but this legislation is a good deal more prescriptive.  It states that the Government has to first consider the people who are recommended on a shortlist by the commission.</p> <p>If the Government is really free to say it proposes to appoint Ms Justice So-and-So to be Chief Justice but tells the Minister for Justice and Equality that he or she cannot propose it until the Government has looked at the other three names, it would be an invasion of the Cabinet's right to decide in what order it deals with its business.  A matter may have been the subject of a recommendation by the commission under a judicial appointments commission Act but the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste in the case of a coalition Government, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Attorney General might say they have come to the view that the outstanding candidate is X and they do not propose to waste much time with the three names on the shortlist that they were given.  It may be a minor point but telling the Cabinet the order in which it addresses those issues does not diminish the commission but it preserves the prerogative and the primacy of the Government's entitlement to make its own mind up on these issues, regardless of what is in legislation.</p> <p>It is quite possible that the Minister for Justice and Equality will come into Cabinet and say he is proposing X and that he has the agreement of the Taoiseach.  He could say he has consulted the Attorney General, as he is required to do under the Cabinet handbook, and that the Attorney General considered the person to be a very good appointee.  He says that X is the best person for the job but to tell him he cannot consider the candidate until he takes out the report and goes through all the reasons offered for the appointment of somebody else would, in my view, technically be an impertinence on the part of the Oireachtas.  Nobody knows if the Cabinet will consider such a matter after a prearranged agreement but if it is firmly of the view that the person it has in mind is the correct person to appoint, the obvious course of action is for Cabinet not to concern itself with the three names it gets from the appointments commission.</p></speech>

We are dealing with consideration and Government will consider all matters in accordance with the constitutional provisions.  To request that it gives consideration to proposals in a certain order does not amount to any undue exercise of authority over its ultimate discretion in accordance with the Constitution.</p></speech>

If the Minister is proposing somebody else, only to be told he or she must first consider the appointment of other people, it will mean, effectively, that his proposal cannot be lawfully made.  That is why I think this is unnecessary.</p><p>Although it is in the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board legislation, it is not something that is going to be challenged on the grounds of unconstitutionality, which is something I had in mind when tabling this amendment.  A Government Minister is not going to go to the courts to get this out of the Bill but we are enacting a new law.  The question is whether we are trespassing on the prerogative of the Executive by telling it the order in which it may consider matters coming to the Cabinet table.  My view is that the Oireachtas is not entitled to tell the Government the order in which it disposes of its business, nor is it entitled to lay down laws for Cabinet procedure.  Under the Constitution, the Cabinet and the Executive meet and act as a collective authority and they decide their own procedures, much as each House of the Oireachtas decides its procedures.  There have been many cases where the Legislature has expressly recognised the right of each House to adopt its own rules and Standing Orders and many statutes make committee procedures conditional on each House of the Oireachtas adopting those Standing Orders.  In this case, the proposal is to tell the Government how it should conduct its business at Cabinet meetings, which I find offensive in principle.  It is an unnecessary intrusion onto the discretion of the Government as to how it conducts its business.  I do not think the section means anything very different without the word in question.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It does not mean that it is an open invitation to Government to wholly disregard the recommendations of the-----</p></speech>

I have to acknowledge that this debate takes place against the backdrop of ongoing uncertainty about Brexit, and rightly so.  We are concentrating our efforts on making sure that we are prepared for 29 March and what that brings.  I want to take this opportunity to restate that Ireland and the EU remain firmly behind the withdrawal agreement.  The Government's focus is on seeing the ratification of this agreement but we must continue to prepare for all possible outcomes and scenarios.</p> <p>A no-deal Brexit would be the worst outcome.  It is not in Ireland's interests, it is not in the European Union's interests and it is certainly not in the United Kingdom's interests, but the Brexit omnibus Bill, which is currently proceeding through the D&aacute;il, will help to prepare Ireland for some of the immediate impacts of no deal.  It is focused on protecting our citizens and on supporting the economy and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors most exposed to Brexit.  The Government is working closely across the Oireachtas to ensure that the Bill will be ready for 29 March and I thank Senators here and all of the Deputies as well for their co-operation and support in both Houses.  It is clear that a Brexit of any kind means change but it is also one aspect of the debate on the future of the EU.</p> <p>Something Brexit will not change is Ireland's commitment to our future in Europe.  If anything, it reinforces it.  Our membership of the EU is our greatest protection, not only from Brexit but from many of the challenges that we face today and those that we do not even know are coming down the tracks.  That is why I am particularly pleased that the House has made time for this debate on the future of Europe but also the value of EU membership to Ireland at this particular moment.</p> <p>Jean Monnet, who was so instrumental in the founding of the European Union, once said: "Make men work together, show them that beyond differences and geographical boundaries there lies a common interest."  For more than 45 years, Irish men and women have been working together with friends and colleagues across Europe and we have found more than a common interest; we have found a common home.  It is a home founded not on transactional interests but on the treaty-based values that underpin our Union.  Those are freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.  These are values that can never be taken for granted, that are ever more important in our turbulent world and on which we will build a common future.  When the President of the European Commission, Mr. Juncker, addressed a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas last June, he stated that Ireland has acted as a founding member state - seeking the European approach and understanding that what is good for all in our Union is good for us all individually.  As a nation that has so fundamentally benefitted from EU membership, we know better than most the value of membership.</p> <p>We cannot attribute all that is good, or, indeed, all that is bad, in our society to the Union but it is undeniable that our country has undergone a remarkable transformation since we first joined in 1973.  That transformation was only made possible because of our membership.  I belong to a generation that has always had the privilege of two identities, being Irish and European.  Like our values, it is a privilege we cannot take for granted.  More than 50% of the population has always had that privilege.  As I know from the statements delivered on Europe Day, Senators are all well aware that Irish support for EU membership is high.  Among the general population, it reaches a 92% approval rating and peaks at an almost universal 97% rate among of young people aged 18 to 26.</p> <p>Clearly, the privilege of membership is not lost on our citizens.  However, we are also challenged to ensure that it remains relevant, and that those figures remain high, in the lives of those who have known only peace, the advancement of rights and the freedom to travel, study, work and make a life in any country in our Union - people for whom the European Union is the norm and not one of the most remarkable peace projects ever imagined.  This is something that has shaped my priorities as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  I have travelled around the country talking to schoolchildren, students and local communities in places such as Donegal, Galway, Cork, Kildare, my own constituency in Meath, and Dublin, to hear their hopes for Europe.  I have listened to those in the charity and voluntary sector, farmers, fishermen, trade unions, employers, businesses and those focussed on protecting the environment.  I have asked them about the future of Europe that they want to see.  They told me that they want to be part of a Union that lives up to its values.  They spoke about peace, co-operation, unity, solidarity and community and, most of all, they spoke about fairness.  They said that they want the EU to continue to do what it does best.  They support involvement in policies such as the Common Agriculture Policy, CAP, which is significant for Ireland, in regional development and in programmes such as Erasmus Plus.</p> <p>They are also ambitious for the unfilled potential of the European Union.  In a Union that provides the privileges of free movement of goods, services, capital and people, they want the completion of the Single Market - one fit for the digital age, one that includes goods and services, and one that Ireland has been particularly pushing for.  They want more countries to join the eurozone.  They want trade agreements, which are good for the economy following on from recent agreements that we have as a Union only recently secured.  They want Europe to play a role in shaping the wider world and the future.  They want to work together on the big issues that we face, such as climate change, migration and cyber security, that no one country can tackle alone.</p> <p>Something that has become clear to me, however, in all of this is that our own people are not always aware of the work that is ongoing and that we are doing on their behalf or some of the European policies that are in place.  On the other hand, sometimes they look to Europe to play a role in matters that rest with member states and that are national competences.  The European Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, joined us at our national citizens' dialogue on the future of Europe in Dublin on 9 May last year.  For all the big aspirations that we have heard from our citizens, she reminded us that people do not spend their time thinking about Europe and it is not a part of their daily thought.  For them, politics continues to be local and about the reality of their daily lives.  It is important, therefore, to recall the human stories showing the value of membership, to connect with stories and to connect with real lives.</p> <p>In September, I had the pleasure of joining the Leas-Chathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, Senator Paul Coghlan, at the formal launch of the European Commission Representation in Ireland's publication, "45 Stories: 45 inspiring stories celebrating Ireland's 45 years of EU membership".  Touching on almost every aspect of Irish life - culture, education and research, community, health, agriculture and fisheries, transport, business, environment and the consumer - the report gives concrete examples of the tangible difference EU membership makes to individuals and local communities.  There are the foreign family holidays, of course, made possible by cheaper airfares brought about by the EU's Single Market for aviation; the calls and texts home made cheaper by the EU's roam-like-at-home initiative; the life-changing medical treatments facilitated by the EU cross-border healthcare directive; and the cross-border communities that have pulled together through the EU's programme for peace and reconciliation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I commend the European Commission on this and other initiatives to show how the EU is supporting our citizens in their everyday lives and their local communities.  There is an onus on all of us to think about how we acknowledge and convey the benefits of EU membership.</p><p>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae also joined us at our Europe Day event in Dublin and I listened to him carefully, as Chair of the Committee on European Union Affairs.  He reminded us that we must resist the temptation to blame Europe for problems and seize credit for its successes.  This is particularly important this year when we - politician and citizen alike - take vital decisions about the future direction of our Union, not least the election of a new European Parliament in May.  We must encourage people to vote to ensure they come out for these elections on 24 May.  In turn, that Parliament will elect the next European Commission President and approve the new European Commission.</p><p>In May also, the leaders of the EU 27 will meet in Sibiu in Romania to discuss the priorities for the next institutional cycle.  The Taoiseach will bring the voice of our citizens into that debate and into the preparation of the EU&rsquo;s strategic agenda which will stretch from 2019 to 2024.  We are currently working on a cross-Government statement that will set out Ireland&rsquo;s priorities for the discussions in Sibiu.  In parallel, my colleagues and I on the General Affairs Council are discussing the EU&rsquo;s next long-term financial plan - the  multi-annual financial framework or MFF - as part of the overall discussion.  The MFF is negotiated once every seven years and we want them to coincide and work in parallel with each other.  There is still a lot of work to be done to reach a common position.  Each member state has its own priorities, as will the incoming European Parliament, and negotiations are always difficult.  Budget negotiations may not capture everyone&rsquo;s imagination, but in how we allocate our resources and finances, we can find a very tangible expression of what it means to be European, in that how we spend our money reflects our values and priorities, and this is no different when talking about a European budget.  I take into these discussions what I have heard from our citizens and what public representatives and political parties across the board have contributed to this debate.  Ireland&rsquo;s top priority is to agree a budget of an adequate size and structure to meet the needs of the Union and our citizens, but also to deliver on our shared ambitions.</p><p>As a net contributor, the Government is open to contributing more to this budget but we must ensure European added value is met.  A well-funded Common Agricultural Policy is a classic example of European added value.  Likewise, we are strong defenders of the need to protect the structural and cohesion funding to ensure newer member states can benefit in the same way we have in the past.  We also believe it is essential that we continue to fund other programmes that work well, such as Erasmus Plus and Horizon Europe, which will support the necessary investment in research and development, particularly for the younger generation.  There is a saying that the best way to predict the future is to create it.  As citizens of Ireland and the European Union, we are tasked with creating a future that matches the needs and expectations of our citizens, a future that lives up to our European values, builds on what we already have, prepares us to meet new challenges and allows the generations that will follow us to thrive.  I look forward to hearing the contributions and perhaps answering questions from Senators.</p></speech>

To be fair, it is almost impossible to try to address a topic as broad as this in statements.  A number of weeks ago I had asked for statements on the benefits of Europe and that was extended in this debate to the benefits on the future of Europe, which is fine.  When I made that point on the Order of Business, I wanted people to remember all of the reasons we should not do what our nearest neighbours have done or even go anywhere near that.  Sometimes we take for granted all of the good things and we forget about all of the benefits that Ireland - as a state, a country and a people - has received.  I have endless briefing notes, as do other Members, but I will try not to rely on them too much and just articulate some of the points I feel we need to remember.</p> <p>We talk about the four freedoms: the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people.  People forget just how big the freedom to travel is, with their purple passport giving pretty much unfettered access to the greater European Continent.  In fact, the EU passport also brings people very easily to other places like Switzerland and Norway that are not in the EU.  Most people of my generation and that of the Minister of State do not ever remember anything other than a purple passport, and most of us of a certain age probably never had a green passport.  Senator Buttimer might just have achieved one but perhaps he also only had a purple passport.  He is smiling, in any case.  There are certainly many of us who never had a passport other than a purple one.  It gives us all great freedom to move and to work, that is, to turn up in any of the EU states and be entitled to get a job and work legally, pay our dues, be registered to work and get all the benefits, such as social insurance, which is very important.  We forget that.</p> <p>In her speech, the Minister of State pointed out that deregulation of air travel is an EU function.  Ryanair would not be Ryanair if it was not able to fly to the various hubs in all of the EU countries and some non-EU countries.  I am old enough to remember when we had a very regulated aviation market and we had a suggestion of, if not a cartel, then cartel-like behaviour among certain airlines, where it cost the current equivalent of &euro;1,000 to fly to London if one did not want to stay a Saturday night or go on an apex fare or some other very complicated kind of fare.  The benefits to all of us of being able to get on an aeroplane for, by and large, a fairly reasonable price in the context of what they were in the past, is something an awful lot of people have forgotten about.</p> <p>There is the Erasmus programme from which so many people have benefited over many years.  My mother was an Erasmus co-ordinator in UCD for many years and really enjoyed that part of her role in bringing in students from France, Germany, Holland and various other EU countries at the time, which would have been before the accession of the new countries in 2004.  We must remember the benefits they got from coming to Ireland and the knowledge they gained.  Equally, Irish students went abroad and learned lots of other things about their own brief, whether they were studying business, social sciences, arts or law, and gained a great understanding of other countries.</p> <p>We sometimes forget a lot of our social legislation to do with equality, for example, on equal pay and equal treatment, gender equality and so on, came from the EU.  Many of those debates started and were encouraged in Europe and they brought Ireland to a place we would not have got to as quickly if the EU - the EEC, as some of us would have known it -  was not there to stimulate those debates.  Equally, environmental standards, food standards and the nitrates, noise pollution, air pollution and landfill directives - all of the things that make the quality of our existence better - are things we might have found difficult to implement ourselves if we did not have somebody suggesting we do it, and maybe contemplating fines or other sanctions if we did not do it.  I think all of us are happy with this, whether in regard to having less smoky coal in the atmosphere or better noise quality, air quality or water quality standards.</p> <p>We could go back and look at the figures for 1973, when Ireland, under a Fianna F&aacute;il Government, joined the EEC, and look at where we were as an economy relative to the rest of Europe and where we are now in terms of performance.  In the 1990s, when I was working and training as an accountant, Ireland's population of a little more than 3 million accounted for less than 1% of what was then a smaller EU population of some 320 million, yet we were getting 35% of all the American foreign direct investment in Europe.  That was partially because we had great graduates and partially because we spoke the English language and for other cultural reasons, but those companies were in Ireland not just for any tax rate but because they had access to a wider market.  People forget that if we were not part of the EU, they could not have come here.  They were here to be a presence in an economy that was part of Europe and could trade freely with the rest of that market, which ultimately expanded with the accession of ten countries in 2004, two more in 2007 and another in 2013, and there are still candidate countries looking to join the EU.</p> <p>I was at the OECD last year and I met a lady from Iceland who told me a pro-EU party is being set up in Iceland.  I told her that is probably because Iceland is not in it and if it was, there would probably be some anti-EU party.  There are many countries, other than our nearest neighbour, clearly, that would love to be and aspire to be part of the EU.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We also forget and take for granted our fantastic motorway programme.  Those motorways were built when my party was in government between 2004 and 2010.  They allow Senators Burke and Buttimer to get home to Cork faster than they would have previously.  I refer to motorways to Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Belfast.  Much of that programme was funded by objective 1 status many years ago, when the entire country had that status.  When we separated the country, in the late 1990s, between objective 1 and non-objective 1, significant funding went into areas in need of it.  It went towards developing water infrastructure, roads, airports, tourism-related products, etc.  </p></speech>

He has proved that it is not possible to cover all of the benefits in the time available.  I have not even addressed the future of Europe.  It is a challenge.  The EU is not perfect, as we all acknowledge.  I am the Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  We disagree with many countries in Europe on closed-circuit television, CCTV, and some of the proposals on digital taxation.  My party believes the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, is a better place for this country to examine the global tax burden and ensure global companies pay their taxes where they should.  The EU is not necessarily the best way of doing that.  It could damage the competitiveness of Europe.</p> <p>If the Acting Chairman will indulge me slightly, I will continue.  It is important that we challenge the extremes appearing in certain countries, whether on the right or left.  We must bring people back to the centre.  I hope people in this country will vote for our European candidates and ensure that Fianna F&aacute;il, as a centrist party, will be represented in the EU Parliament.  I sure other people will profess that view for their own parties when they get the opportunity to contribute.  We need to send good quality candidates to represent Ireland in Europe, whether there are 11 or 13 MEPs.  This is a valuable debate and I thank the Minister of State for attending.  I am sorry I do not have more time because I could go on.  </p> <p>My mother, as I said, was a co-ordinator on an Erasmus social science programme.  She won the Irish European woman of the year award from the European Movement Ireland in 1997.  Europe is something that has been close to my family's heart and mine.  That would be the case even if I had never been involved in front-line politics.  Europe has been an enormous advantage for this country.  That does not mean there are not challenges.  We had challenges with the euro and the ECB.  The euro has given us great stability but there are challenges.  Let us, however, work together for the betterment of the whole of Europe and, particularly, for this island.</p> <p>I did not even touch on the peace process and all of the benefits the Good Friday Agreement brought to this country.  I apologise.  I can only do so much in eight minutes.  I thank the Acting Chairman for indulging me.  </p></speech>

This needs to be an honest discussion about the failures and successes of the European Union.  Constructive criticism is needed to make the EU work better.  This is not, and should not be seen, as a question of being in or out of the EU.  Ireland's place is clearly within the EU.  That does not mean, however, that we cannot and should not work to make it better, fairer and more democratic.  Sinn F&eacute;in has many reasons for insisting on this.  The broadly positive aspect is the support of the EU, and its firm opposition to any attempt by the British Government, as it exits the EU, to impose a hard border in this country.  The other aspect is this State&rsquo;s experience of the financial crisis.</p><p>That crisis was a severe blow to the idea of solidarity between member states and the peoples of Europe.  Weaker, smaller, peripheral states paid the highest price.  That includes the people of this State and the people of Greece.  Austerity imposed by the EU had devastating consequences in this State and in Greece, where public services disintegrated under the burden.  This cannot be allowed to happen again.  To ensure it does not happen again, we believe the EU should work for the people of the EU, and not for the EU insiders, corporate interests or established political parties from the larger states.  The discussion on the future of the EU has been overshadowed by Brexit.  For lreland, the dangers posed by Brexit are real and immediate.  </p><p>Brexit would be problematic for this country under any circumstances.  Britain is our largest trading partner and it stands between us and the rest of Europe.  All the challenges Brexit presents are multiplied by the fact that our country is partitioned.  We face the prospect of having one part of the country in the EU, while the other is dragged out of it against its democratic wishes.  There can be no hardening of the Border in Ireland and Irish citizens in the North cannot be abandoned.  Border communities, which suffered so much due to partition, will not put up with being divided by a hard border.  The EU is, of course, playing a crucial role in ensuring that there is no hard border and that all of Ireland remains inside the EU when Britain leaves.  The EU will also play an important role in the event of a united Ireland by ensuring that the inclusion of the Six Counties is guaranteed within the Union.  </p><p>We were always facing the question, however, of how to make the EU a more democratic and people-centred institution.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes there should be a fairer distribution of Structural Funds and CAP payments and more support for important infrastructure projects.  We oppose proposals, such as the vulture funds directive, that would reinforce the free rein of the banks and vulture funds and tilt the balance even further from Irish mortgage holders.  We are opposed to the EU aggressive, so-called new generation, trade deals, such as Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  Those deals threaten to undermine environmental ambition, public services, workers' pay and conditions, financial stability and our agricultural sector.  Sinn F&eacute;in is also opposed to the policies of the ECB and the European Commission, Europe's unelected government, when they refuse to adopt the needs of vulnerable states and regions.  We are also opposed to increased military spending and the creation of an EU army.  There is no support for that in Ireland and it would violate the Constitution and the State's commitment to neutrality.  </p><p>Our criticism of the EU is consistent and constructive.  Fundamental change is needed and the <i>status quo</i>is not good enough.  It is not working for the people of Europe.  We want an EU that supports progressive social and economic change.  We want an EU that listens to the concerns of the people of Europe who are increasingly alienated from a project that often does not deliver for them.  In 1973, this State joined the European Economic Community, EEC, which was essentially a free trade organisation.  Today, the EU is a political union and its leaders aspire to be a federal state with a common currency, tax raising powers and an army.  The EU is arrogant and bureaucratic.  Lobbying and the influence of corporate interests, which feed off of EU institutions, are a major problem.  We need to recognise that people across Europe are rejecting that model that has created winners and losers, precarious employment, wealth inequality, including inequality between core and peripheral areas, debt dependent growth and privatised public services. </p><p>Failure to recognise this will pose a threat to the EU.  It holds itself up as a project of peace and a defender of human rights.  There are, however, serious questions to answer regarding its treatment of refugees fleeing wars, the situation of political prisoners on our territories and complicity in abuses elsewhere due to economic and political ties.  Across the EU, people want decisions affecting them made as close to home as possible in order that they can have influence on policies that affect their lives.  We have one of the most centralised systems in this country.  There will be a requirement for a transfer of powers back from the EU to member states, including the power to make decisions about public spending and priorities.  The types of changes needed include enshrining social and employment rights in law, returning fiscal powers to member states and ensuring that states can maintain their own foreign policy.  This will require changes to EU treaties.  </p><p>There are two visions for the future of EU.  One is for an increasingly integrated and federal EU empowering corporations and disempowering citizens; the other is for a social EU that puts people first and requires a complete change of direction.  Brussels will have to be democratised.  We cannot have winners and losers.  The failed economic models must change and the privatisation agenda, in particular, must change.  The EU must be radically reformed to become a union of nation states committed to working together for progressive social and economic change.  The EU should be working together on common issues such as taking ambitious action on climate change, advancing social and employment rights across all of Europe, building systems of fair trade and using our common strengths to improve the lives of citizens. </p><p>We should learn from the mistakes made where the concentration of economic and political power in the hands of the larger and more powerful states led to a reaction from people across the EU, and some of this was behind the Brexit decision.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is also evident in the growth of right-wing groups and organisations.

I thank her, as well as the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, for the work they have done defending Ireland's position on Brexit in the negotiations.  They have put up a really good performance in ensuring we do not deviate from what was agreed.</p><p>It is important that when we consider Europe, we think about our access to markets.  With the United Kingdom in the Union, we have access to 500 million people, and when it leaves the Union, that number will be 440 million people.  It is a huge market nonetheless.  Prior to joining the European Union, we were very much dominated by the United Kingdom with respect to trade and the markets available to us.  That has now totally changed and a large part of our market takes in European countries other than the United Kingdom.  It is a major and welcome development.</p><p>In my brief time in the European Parliament over two years, I was a member of the internal market committee.  It was interesting to see how people worked on the committee, as it was not a case of being divisive or trying to score points against one another.  It was a case of sitting down around the table and seeing how we could come to a compromise on a matter.  I remember dealing with the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive, and I led the European People's Party group within the committee on that issue.  It was an important policy change that was required and there were many healthcare services that we would not have had in Ireland.  A person qualified as a paediatrician might have dealt with every aspect of childcare at one stage but now there are many sub-specialties in individual areas, whether that is the maternity, cardiac or paediatric areas.  It is important that we now have access to such specialists if they are not here in Ireland.  The Cross-Border Healthcare Directive was a very welcome development and change and it demonstrates one of the advantages of being part of the European Union.</p><p>It is also interesting to consider healthcare in light of access to information in other EU countries.  There is an amount of co-operation between medical practitioners in other countries and Irish medical practitioners and <i>vice versa</i>, and it is extremely important.  We have now agreed with the United Kingdom to continue with this even after Brexit but it is important that we also ensure that if a patient requires a service not available in Ireland, we can access that care and treatment in another country.</p><p>It is also interesting to look at changes that have occurred.  One of the problems up to 1973 was the presence of a protectionist market because we did not want employment to be affected.  We imposed tariffs on goods coming in from abroad and as a result we were not cost-effective with the goods we produced.  Our costs of production were way higher than those in many other jurisdictions so we could not export to other markets.  There were major changes from 1973 through the 1980s but in the long term, they brought benefit to Ireland.  We became competitive with costs and were able to deliver goods and services at a competitive price.  It was a welcome change.</p><p>Women were at one time forced to retire from employment when they married but the European Union forced a change.  The question is that if we had not joined the European Union, would it have taken another five, ten or 15 years for that change to have been effected?  I am not sure but it certainly could have taken another ten years.  Changes were brought about that were beneficial to everybody in the country.  There is the simple example of consumer rights, as the Consumer Rights Directive means there is now more protection for the consumer with respect to goods and services.  It was an important development.</p><p>I know my colleague spoke about the lack of transparency and democracy in the European Union but we have a structure, including the Council of Ministers, the European Commission and the European Parliament.  There are checks and balances, which are extremely important.  Within the European Parliament we have all the committees that examine each item in detail.  For example, in committee there were 400 amendments tabled to the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive.  We had to work and compromise on those, and many of the amendments were tabled by me.  When it finished in the internal market committee, it went to the full European Parliament before being dealt with by the Council and Commission.  Each item is examined and, in fairness, every country contributes to the final policy.</p><p>We can take the example of roaming charges.  A number of years ago if a person made a telephone call in Italy, a four-minute call could have cost &euro;5, whereas now it is 5 cent per minute.  The change to roaming charges made a huge difference for people and it was an extremely important change.  I dealt with another health and safety issue related to the toys directive.  A large amount of goods came from outside Europe and there was a problem because many toys had a high level of lead.  A European Commissioner went to China at the time and a week later, 700 factories were closed there because China did not want to lose access to our market.</p><p>We have made huge progress but we must work on the provision of services.  Services provided from Ireland make up approximately 11% of GDP.  It demonstrates how we have developed as a country that we can provide services from this country to others.  There has been much growth.  The vast majority of these services have been developed by companies that started in Ireland and which are Irish-owned and Irish-managed.  That is important.  There are other areas in which we must work so it is important we do that over the next few years.  We will face challenges with the United Kingdom leaving but we can face up to those challenges and continue to provide the employment we now see in this country.</p></speech>

I watched her presentation from my office but I am sorry I was not here in person.  Like other colleagues in the Chamber, I recognise her contribution and role in the negotiations around Brexit, as well as the time and effort she is giving to it.  It is a very sincere effort.</p> <p>We are at the point where it very much looks that our neighbour Britain will leave the European Union.

As many Senators have said, the country we live in now is very different from the Ireland of 1973.  It has a much greater sense of independence and it is more prosperous and educated.  Senator Horkan referred to Erasmus and all it has done to the benefit of Ireland, as a member of the EU, and Irish students down the generations.</p><p>Peace and coexistence on the island of Ireland have been really important since we joined the EU.  I am very proud that Ireland is a member of the EU.  My opinions on it have changed over time, as have those of the European Greens.  When the EU was the EEC, the European project was too easily portrayed as an anti-democratic, bureaucratic programme that acted in the interests of big businesses and industries.  The world was then divided by the Cold War.  The EEC seemed to be inextricably linked to old world thinking on the balance of power but the creation and deepening of the EU and the expansion of its activities into new areas, such as social and environmental protection, and its continuing on the path of democracy mean that the Union of today - the one the UK is now choosing to leave - differs as much from the EEC as the Ireland of today differs from the Ireland that became a member state with the UK all those years ago.  To Ireland today, the EU can be used as a force for good, a tool with which to temper the worst excesses of globalisation and effect the change we wish to see globally.</p><p>By pooling sovereignty and uniting in our shared ideals, the EU allows Ireland and Irish people to play a role in the world far beyond what they could otherwise hope to play.  Used correctly, EU membership is one of the strongest assets in Ireland's toolkit.  Sometimes I fear the UK will learn this lesson all too late.  This is not to say that the EU is complete or that the European Greens are happy with its current construction.  More democracy, more controls on lobbying and influence peddling, and greater action on the crucial issues facing us today, such as climate change, energy pressures and the ecological crisis, are essential.</p><p>While I am proud Ireland is a member of the Union, I am sad I cannot be as proud of our Government's record on the issues that face the Union today.  These include digitalisation, financial transaction taxation, strong climate action, and supporting and insisting on the rule of the law and the maintenance of standards of democracy.  We want to see Ireland stand proud in favour of progress of a kind that is not really fought for.  Right now, when relations with our European partners matter most, we are burning up huge amounts of political capital in opposing any progress in the areas I have mentioned.  I want to see Ireland as a leader in Europe and as the open-minded, progressive and enthusiastic nation most Irish people want it to be.  Nowhere has a failure to adhere to the ideals of the EU been more clearly portrayed than in our attitude to the Hungarian governing party, Fidesz.  It is only today that the Fine Gael MEPs came out to say they were voting against the Hungarian party in the European Parliament.</p><p>This week, the European People's Party and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe blocked the student activist, Greta Thunberg, from speaking in the European Parliament.  That is a great mistake because people like her are an inspiration.  She is a young leader of the grassroots.  People like her should be heard because she is speaking to a younger generation.</p><p>The EU is a union of some 500 million people, united in their diversity, moving ahead in a very uncertain world.  I would like to see Ireland taking leadership in Europe and not being led by it.  In my two and a half short years in the Seanad, I have felt Ireland has very much been dragged along by Europe.  I would like to see that change and Ireland becoming a beacon of hope and a nation taking leadership.</p></speech>

I compliment her most sincerely on the tremendous work she has been doing on Brexit, which is important, and also on the way in which she has travelled across Ireland and the rest of Europe forging alliances, building friendships, informing people and having a conversation on the future of Europe.  It is refreshing to have a Minister of State such as Deputy Helen McEntee to do that.  I commend her most sincerely on the approach she has taken and on how she has communicated Ireland's position on Brexit.  I thank her for that.</p> <p>This debate is happening against the backdrop of Brexit and the challenge of a generation.  The next couple of weeks will be critical.  The rise of Eurosceptic voices is of concern.  I am always of the view that the voice of the centre must hold in Europe.  Europe must deliver for its people and the institutions must be seen to be on their side.  It is about strengthening democracy, standing up for and upholding human rights, and challenging those with different viewpoints to change their ways.  It is important that the work the Government is doing is about bringing the institutions of Europe to the people.</p> <p>We are a very pro-European country and are at the heart of Europe.  I welcome the publication today of a Eurobarometer survey, which shows that 75% of respondents expressed happiness over how democracy works in Europe, 64% have a more positive image of Europe, 76% believe the EU responds to their country's needs, and 8% have a negative view, notwithstanding the views expressed by Senator Warfield in his contribution.  Some 86% of citizens are optimistic about the future of Europe.</p> <p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan made reference to Mr. Viktor Orb&aacute;n in her contribution.  She did not have to wait for the Fine Gael MEPs to express their views in Europe today.  She would have heard on the Order of Business my view that the vision of Europe Mr. Orb&aacute;n stands for and his politics do not resonate with me in any way.  He is unsuited to being a member of the European People's Party.  The vision for Europe my party and I share does not include xenophobia or anti-Semitic voices.  It is one of inclusivity and positivity.  That was expressed today and was also expressed by others before today.  Mr. Viktor Orb&aacute;n's view is not in keeping with the vision of Europe I have.</p> <p>Today, the open letter by the French President, Mr. Macron, calling for the reform of the EU is one we need to consider, regardless of whether it entails a new type of European renaissance or a serious, reflective debate on the future of Europe.  We should welcome the letter although we may not agree with everything Mr. Macron says.  That is fine.  I do not agree with some of the views of others but it is important to have a debate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Mr. Macron's open letter to the citizens of Europe is about protecting and defending the EU and ensuring that we are equipped to deal with the challenges in a new and evolving world post Brexit.  We must ensure that the EU is protected from cyber attacks and interference in elections as we face into the critical period of European Union elections.  It is also important in a new Europe and a new world that issues of climate change, security and defence and quality of life are tackled and met.  Equally, it is imperative that we have a strong, united, vibrant and inclusive Europe that works for all its people and has a border which does not have a wall but, rather, a welcome.  We must reflect on the fact that the EU, of which Ireland has been a member state since 1973, gives us, as the Minister of State indicated, our greatest protection.  What type of country would Ireland be if it had not been a member state of  the European Union for the past 46 years?<br/><br/>There are remaining challenges such as the issues of CAP reform, climate change, the Single Market in the digital age and research and development.  In the words of Robert Schuman, &quot;Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan.  It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a <i>de facto</i>solidarity.&quot;  Those words are as relevant today as when they were first uttered.  I congratulate the Minister of State on her work.  She, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach have done a tremendous job building solidarity for our country around Europe as we face into this critical period of Brexit.  I thank her for attending.  This is an important debate which we need to embrace.  I commend Senator Horkan on having the temerity to make the proposal he did on the Order of Business.

She referred to the treaty-based values which are so important to Irish citizens, as highlighted by them in the series of consultations she held in recent months.  Those core decent European values from the EU's treaties and its founding principles are important and still resonate with the Irish public.  The Minister of State spoke of an EU based not on transactional interests but, rather, treaty-based values.  I welcome that important sentiment, but we need to follow through on that logic.</p> <p>In discussing the future of the EU, it is, perhaps, useful to start by looking at the past.  As has been rightly stated, the EU is an extraordinary peace project.  Having raised the issue of the Good Friday Agreement with all of our European partners, surely Ireland should continue to be a voice for peace and neutrality and the building of peace in the EU.  A European army or the militarisation of the Continent is not the way to secure a peaceful future for all our people.  As we know from our experience on this island, the work of peace goes far deeper.  It is about social investment and the building of understandings, and those must be Ireland's priorities.  As such, I deeply regret that Ireland has joined the PESCO military agreement and was very disappointed that we joined Operation Sophia, moving away from humanitarian search and rescue in the Mediterranean to a policing function which has resulted in the loss of many lives.</p> <p>When we look to the past, we must look at what has worked and what has not.  Europe is at its best when we join together to bring the best ideas of how we can do things better and stronger, create ambition for each other and have a stronger voice in the world and, indeed, change the shape of areas such as the online area by using our powers collectively.  The data protection regulation is an example of working together in that way.  However, the one-size-fits-all austerity measures such as those imposed on Ireland during the recession did not reflect the EU at its best.  That led to the social pillar being somewhat belatedly introduced to try to repair some of the damage done during the very difficult period of austerity measures which served to push away many citizens and fray the social fabric in and between our countries.</p> <p>The Minister of State referred to the new EU strategic agenda.  Europe 2020 was put to the side somewhat in favour of the ten priorities of Jean-Claude Juncker, which was a regrettable decision.  We have one year left to fulfil our Europe 2020 targets.  What is the view of the Minister of State regarding the EU's delivery of that agenda and our delivery of the climate change targets by 2020?  Does she agree that, regardless of who replaces Mr. Juncker as President of the European Commission or who will be the new Commissioners, there are issues already on the agenda which must form part of the next EU strategic agenda?  Does she agree that sustainable development goals, climate targets and social commitments must be at the core of the strategic agenda?  Will Ireland make those points?</p> <p>The Minister of State referred to the budget of the multi-annual financial framework.  Will state aid rules be loosened in order to facilitate better public investment in infrastructure such as housing, which is an issue right across the EU?  Will we ensure that the voice of civil society is heard in the European semester process?  That is the case to a small degree in Ireland, but we can ensure that it becomes more widespread.</p> <p>The Minister of State referred to trade agreements being good for the economy.  However, we need trade agreements that are good for society.  We need new trade mandates.  Will Ireland put forward the idea of new trade mandates without investor state dispute mechanisms which allow us to take the regulatory action we collectively need on issues such as climate change?  We know that we cannot afford a chill effect.  We need to be able to respond to the public.  Many of those protesting on the streets and elsewhere, such as the young people protesting on climate change, are passionate Europeans, not Eurosceptics.  It is deeply regrettable that those young persons were not permitted to speak in the European Parliament.  It was a poor decision by the European People's Party and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.  We need those voices to be at the fore and to be given a platform on behalf of civil society and all of our citizens who see themselves as Europeans.</p></speech>

As Senator Horkan pointed out in his contribution, we are here to highlight some of the positives of the EU.  I thank Senators for their views, comments, criticisms and positive remarks on the EU.  I would be the first to say that the EU is not perfect, but it is the best mechanism we have to deal with the many challenges we face.  As all contributors stated, we are stronger and better together.  As a result, we need to tackle those challenges together and make sure to listen to everybody.</p> <p>On Brexit, the EU will be a lesser place without the UK.  Although it has been a somewhat reluctant member for the 45 years of its membership - its media have never portrayed the EU in a positive light - it has contributed greatly to the Union and the development thereof.  Ireland joined the EU at the same time as did the UK and much of our agenda and what we have done and many of our policies have been in tandem with those of the UK.  As well as being worse off financially, we will be far worse off without its knowledge and expertise.  That said, the EU leaders who met at the summit in Bratislava following the Brexit vote obviously did so to consider what we can do next, where we go from here and how we can we plan a Europe of which citizens want to be part.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They also saw it as an opportunity to engage with citizens and to make sure they are aware of the positives and the positive impact membership of the European Union has had on people's lives.  I do not think anybody could dispute the fact that Ireland and many other member states have changed and continue to be utterly transformed through their membership of the European Union.  We have gone from being a small island nation that was inward looking and had very little access to the rest of the world, economically or otherwise, to being an outward-looking country that is more modern.  The very fabric of society has been changed.  We have access to more than 500 million people.  There are also changes to the way we engage and work with people and our culture and traditions have been enriched during that time.  Our country has benefitted financially.  In the 45 years of our membership, we have received net funding of &euro;45 billion.  That money has been invested in infrastructure and in ensuring that people's living standards have improved and in education.  The college I attended, DCU, was built and founded on EU funding, and that is just one of the many important pieces of infrastructure it has provided.  The agricultural sector, which was and still is our most important indigenous sector, has benefited significantly through our membership of the European Union.  Towns and villages have received funding and they have been utterly transformed in that time as well.</p><p>Many Senators touched on the fact that people's rights have been improved.  This week we celebrate International Women's Day.  In terms of equality for women, we would still be facing the many challenges we have overcome in recent decades if it were not for legislation, rules and regulations that have been implemented through the European Union and through our Parliament.  Europe has brought about equality in the workplace, equality for some of the most vulnerable in society, for example, those with disabilities, mental health problems and children.  Much of our legislation has been based on European legislation.</p><p>We have worked with member states on peacekeeping missions.  We have a very proud tradition and history in that regard.  In our membership of the United Nations there has not been one day without Irish troops being on the ground in peacekeeping missions.  We have joined PESCO.  I accept some have doubts about what that means for Ireland, but the reason we were one of the last countries to join is that we were making sure that it did not impact in any way our neutrality.  We also need to make sure that our views and opinions are heard around the table when issues such as security and defence and peacekeeping missions are discussed.  We are already part of various maritime surveillance operations and ongoing cybersecurity programmes.  We have a part to play in that regard because when we asked Irish people about our neutrality and where they want Ireland to be in the future, they were very clear that our defence neutrality should not be impacted.  However, as a country we must acknowledge the fact that terror and threats are changing and the format in which they are now impacting on people's lives is changing, whether it is through our screens, for example, on YouTube, or indiscriminate attacks that take place on our streets, we need to be able to co-operate with other member states to share information to protect citizens.  People were very clear on that in our engagement on the Future of Europe.</p><p>Economically, through our membership of the Single Market, the way we do business and export has been utterly transformed.  We need to continue in that vein.  The Single Market is 80% complete in goods but only about 50% in services and 50% of everything that we export in this country is services so if it were completed that would have a significant positive impact on the economy and people's lives and businesses.  The digital economy is only about 30% complete.  Further integration would transform the way we do business and also how we interact with each other across member states.  That is something on which we must focus.  A significant amount of work is being done in terms of trade deals.  We have already agreed a trade deal with Singapore and negotiations are ongoing with Thailand and China.  We entered an economic partnership with Japan and we are now looking at Australia and New Zealand.  This is all because of our membership of the Single Market.  As a small member state, we have access to the 500 million plus people in the European market, and that will be on an even larger scale following other trade deals.</p><p>We are also working with colleague member states to build alliances and to make sure that the Irish voice is very clearly heard around the table when it comes to other significant issues.  Climate change is one of those.  We acknowledge that we are not on target for our 2020 objectives in that regard.  Recently, the new Minister, Deputy Bruton, who has responsibility for climate change, wrote a letter to the Commissioner, with his colleagues from Luxembourg, Lithuania and Austria about the risk to citizens and the amount of work we need to do on a national level.  As well as working with our European colleagues, the Minister is hoping to implement a new action plan for climate change and a strategy that would transcend all Departments, not just his own.  He also plans on doing that through engagement not just with the Joint Committee on Climate Action that is chaired by Deputy Naughton, but also through engagement with the students we have seen protesting and whom we know will take to the streets on 15 March.  As the Taoiseach said earlier, we look forward to that.  It is extremely positive that young people are protesting, marching and standing up for something they see as being extremely important, which we also see as being extremely important for the future.</p><p>I recently had a discussion with my colleagues at the General Affairs Council on the sustainable development goals.  The outgoing Commissioner, Frans Timmermans, produced a paper with some colleagues on the goals which he hopes will reinvigorate the implementation and the conversations or lack thereof that have been taking place.  What I highlighted at the discussion was that instead of trying to come together for a further plan at a European level that we would focus on the implementation plans of individual members at a national level.  The document that has been produced will be taken on board by the new Commission and I hope it will steer it in the right direction as well.</p></speech>

The conversation we had in terms of the more informal discussion at the General Affairs Council, in particular on the sustainable development goals, is that we would not just look at a European agenda but that there would be a focus on the implementation plans for individual member states as well.  It is a two-pronged approach.  The overall reasoning behind the document was to try to reinvigorate the issue and the implementation of the goals that have already been set out.</p> <p>There is a significant amount of positive things happening.  This conversation is an opportunity for us to highlight that and acknowledge that there are challenges but that we are better and stronger working together and that while people have difficulties, the best way to deal with them is by working together.  Ireland has always benefitted from our engagement with the EU.  In the 45 years of our membership, we have acted in the same way as some of the founding members have and we have taken great pride in being very much ingrained in the very fabric of the European Union, whether it is in the Parliament, the Council or the Commission, and we have held some of the very highest positions within those institutions.  In recent times we have perhaps failed in that regard through lack of applications or individuals not being as interested in applying to work within the European institutions and agencies.  We are now coming to a stage where we have something of a demographic cliff edge as many of our officials are moving towards retirement age.  A significant amount of work is being done at the moment to try to encourage younger people, through universities and the studies they are currently undertaking, to apply for those positions and ensure that when the agendas are being set, when the budgets are negotiated and specific issues are discussed that we have Irish people around the table and that the Irish voice, perspective and opinion is very much at the heart of everything that is being done from the inside out.  I thank Senators for their contributions and I look forward to continuing to work with them.</p> <p>Reference was made to our values.  We must challenge each other when we feel that our values are being in any way undermined, whether it is the rule of law, freedom of expression, humanitarian rights or democracy.  In recent months we have seen challenges to those, especially the rule of law.  As a country, Ireland has always spoken out where we see that those values are being undermined by individual member states or organisations.  We will continue to do that, now more than ever, in particular in the face of Brexit and the many other challenges.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Now more than ever, particularly in the face of Brexit and many other challenges, we must continue to stand up for the values that underpin the European Union: democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</p></speech>
