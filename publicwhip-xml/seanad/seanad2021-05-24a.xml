    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-24a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021052400002#C00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, to the House and thank him for coming here today.</p><p>My question relates to the status of the review of the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, on the recommendations of the Cahill Duffy report on collective redundancies.  What is the Government currently doing with the employment recommendations in the report?  I do not need to tell the Minister of State that five years have elapsed since the report landed into his current Department.  Obviously the report was a response to the situation that arose with Clerys at the time.  We know that with many other companies going into liquidation, and most notably Debenhams last year and Arcadia, and more coming down the tracks we now need to see action by the Government.  Last year, we had a lot of commitments and soothing words that the Government was seriously considering the matter.</p><p>On 4 November 2020, the two authors of the report, Mr. Kevin Duffy and Ms Nessa Cahill, came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and spoke about what they believed needed to be done to implement the recommendations of their report.  In  particular, they said that the recommendations in the employment law sphere could be implemented, needed to be implemented and that there was no need to do anything on the company law side.  The Government in its wisdom decided to ask the Company Law Review Group what company law measures needed to be undertaken and, almost six months on, we still await the review.  At this point in time there is yet another delay and distraction in the much needed implementation of the recommendations in the Cahill Duffy Report.</p><p>We are all very aware of a permanent contraction in some areas.  We know that there are redundancies coming down the tracks in the retail sector and other sectors for which the Government now needs to be ready.  I believe that if we had the report in place we could have saved some of the heartache experienced by the workers at Debenhams and the many days they spent outside day after night trying to fight for what was due to them.  In particular, there would have been advanced consultation on collective redundancies, which is recommendation No. 1 of the Cahill Duffy report, the strengthening of the ability of the State to recover payments from the insolvency fund, which is recommendation No. 4, and increasing compensation to the affected workers by recognising the terms of their collective agreement, which is recommendation No. 6.</p><p>In short, if the recommendations of the report had been implemented before last March or, indeed, now for the thousands of workers who may find themselves in a similar situation that there is a mechanism for recognising the collectively bargained <i>ex gratia</i>payments that are inbuilt into their collective agreement, and a mechanism for paying that out via the insolvency fund but claiming it back from what remains of the liquidation process.</p><p>I ask the Government to get a move on with the report because we cannot afford any delay.  It will be an appalling indictment of the Government if more workers find themselves in a situation where they are left without their fair compensation package arising from a liquidation if the Government has failed to act.</p></speech>

I am aware that she has a strong interest in this area and I share her interest.  I am very conscious of the need to introduce increased enhancements to employee rights.  That is why there is a clear commitment in the programme for Government to review the current legal provisions surrounding collective redundancies and liquidations of companies to ensure that they effectively protect the rights of workers and do not overly impede enterprise in the conduct of business.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The CLRG's report on its review of legal provisions on liquidations and the rights of workers in the context of company law was received by my Department a number of weeks ago.  This will be made available publicly on the CLRG's website once full consideration has been given to those recommendations.  The second phase of the CLRG's work, concentrating on the splitting of operations and the sale to connected parties following insolvency, has commenced and the CLRG will report on that work in September of this year.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy English, and I have jointly looked at the legislative provisions that deal with redundancy and insolvency from the point of view of both employment law, which falls under the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy English, and company law, which falls under my delegated responsibilities.  The recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report have fed into this process, and in developing our approach we met with the social partners on 4 November last year.  They made submissions to inform that process, and our policy response was issued to them on 11 May 2021.  We are due to meet the social partners tomorrow evening to discuss this matter further.</p><p>As part of our response, changes will be brought in under the recently announced small companies rescue package and will provide for the provision of enhanced information on those remedies designed to secure the protection of employees that are already a feature of the existing legal landscape.  In parallel, legislative proposals in the area of company law relevant to the protection of workers as creditors have also been adopted.  While I appreciate that this is a minor development, work continues at a strong pace on the substantive review of corporate restructuring, as I mentioned earlier, and the CLRG is due to report back in September in that regard.  It is our intention to progress this matter as swiftly as possible once the CLRG reports in September.</p><p>As for the two proposals we will bring forward on the small companies rescue package, we have given a commitment that that will be done prior to the summer recess of this year.  I also wish to inform the Senator that we have decided to move to establish an independent forum that will consider employment law issues into the future with membership to include stakeholders such as employee and employer representatives, as well as employment law and other legal experts.  This forum's remit will go well beyond addressing redundancy and insolvency matters and will work along the lines of the CLRG.  The intention is that the complementary range of measures will promote the provision of quality information, enhanced participation and transparency, and provide for continued development of employment law, especially with regard to employee rights.</p><p>I hope this information is of benefit to the Senator and I thank her for the opportunity to put it on the record of the House.</p></speech>

I am shocked.  He is telling me the Company Law Review Group has not one but two reviews ongoing, one that is yet to commence or has only recently commenced and will report only in September.  Separately, the Department has to start an employment law review.  This is not news to the Government.  As the Minister of State said, this is in the programme for Government.  We have known for five years now that these recommendations need to be implemented.  It is simply not good enough that there is a new process followed by another process followed by another process with no outcome.  We need outcomes, decisions and clarity for workers.  I appreciate that the Minister of State is engaging through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC, and that is really good, but we are past the time for new processes.  The Minister of State knows what he needs to do and the Government needs to get on with it now.</p></speech>

We met with the key stakeholders, that is, the employers and union representative bodies, last November.  The CLRG has already commenced the work and published the first phase of its report.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Two of it proposals will be adopted in the next number of weeks when the small business package is brought before the Oireachtas.  This legislation will enable us to implement two of these recommendations.</p><p>The second phase will report in September, which is only a number of months away, and relates to the complex area of the splitting of assets, which we want to ensure that we get right.  I am giving a commitment that the recommendations will be reviewed swiftly when we receive them from the CLRG and any recommendations that need to be implemented or introduced on a legislative basis will be done without delay.  The Senator should make no mistake; this matter is receiving the full attention of both the Minister of State, Deputy English, and me and we are determined to ensure that the relevant safeguards are put in place.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-24a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021052400002#E00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, for her time.  This is a departmental matter and as both the Minister of State and the senior Minister, Deputy Foley, are new in their roles, I will not put the entire responsibility for this on them but work needs to be done in the Department of Education if we are serious about getting our buildings right for the children who spend 183 days of the year in them.  Can the Minister of State confirm how many new buildings have completed design stage with the planning and building unit of the Department?  In a post-Covid-19 greener future, can she confirm that all these new buildings have been designed with whole-school ventilation, fossil-fuel-free heating systems, sufficient outdoor multi-use games areas and safe active travel infrastructure?</p> <p>I will deal with each of these four areas briefly.  First, we know that these types of viruses are not going to go completely away and I received a response from the Department, which is currently putting new gas boilers into new buildings.  That is not good enough in this day and age.  At the same time, the Department is also retrofitting gas and oil burners into schools.  It seems to be insane to be wasting money on new gas boilers in new schools when we are replacing them in other schools.  Gas is a fossil fuel and there are plenty of other options now and the Department itself has been doing research on this for more than 20 years.</p> <p>Second, on ventilation, many new schools do not have proper ventilation.  I have seen a few new school designs for big secondary and primary schools.  They have ventilation in the toilets and perhaps in the home economics room but do not have a whole-school ventilation system. The best practice now is closed envelope, air to water or air to air with a heat recovery ventilation system.  That is what we want and need.  We see that schools currently are not fit for purpose.  The heating is on and the windows are open.  Those days are over, as this is 2021.  This is important because although we tell children that the climate has changed and that we must do everything that we can, we are not putting them in buildings in 2021 that are designed in a modern way, despite 20 years of research from the Department on getting it right.  </p> <p>The third issue I raise is sufficient outdoor space for play.  I spent 14 years visiting schools and all too often I saw the lack of outdoor space.  I see now these new multi-use game areas which are good for basketball and certain games.  In many new schools, however, we do not have new pitches that will be big enough to host any camogie, football or hurling matches.  I refer to one in my home town of Ennistymon in particular, where three schools are being amalgamated into a beautiful new school.  It will have no pitch big enough to host camogie, football or hurling matches, which seems mad in this day and age because there are many sports for which grass is needed.  I am not talking about small AstroTurf or basketball courts but about a proper pitch for the school and the children to be out on and having this space.  It is all about the outdoors now and we want our children and teenagers to have access to that kind of infrastructure in all new buildings.</p> <p>The final item I wish to raise concerns safe travel to schools to access the schools.  The Department has been working with An Taisce's Green-Schools: Safe Routes to School, which is a new programme that has come through the Minister for Transport, which is great, but that involves retrofitting and redesigning existing schools.  I am talking about new school buildings that do not have the proper infrastructure for active travel.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They see it as a secondary thing.  I have seen new designs which have winding roads leading to the school and parallel there is a winding cycling and walking route when we all know well a much shorter route could be put in at much less cost to encourage pedestrians and cyclists.  I spent 14 years working full time on behavioural change and traffic jams outside every school in Ireland.  We have to get the new builds right.  We have to look at short, small infrastructure that encourages walkers and cyclists to see there is a quicker, safer route away from cars.  We should not be running them parallel to cars, they cost more and are longer.  It makes no sense.  I would expect and demand better for our children as we move to a scary future with the new design in the Department.</p></speech>

On the large scale capital building programme, 135 school building projects are ongoing which are at or have completed design stage.  These include: Gaelscoil Mh&iacute;ch&iacute;l C&iacute;os&oacute;g; Gaelscoil Donncha Rua; Gaelscoil U&iacute; Choim&iacute;n; Ennis Educate Together National School; Ennistymon National School; Raheen Wood Steiner school; and Mol an &Oacute;ige Community National School in Clare.  There are also in excess of 1,000 school building projects under the large scale and additional accommodation schemes which are across various stages of planning, design, tender and construction in relation to school extensions and refurbishment projects.  All new builds have special educational needs facilities for ASD classes, etc., which is a commitment that was given in the building and planning unit.</p> <p>Specifically, on a post-Covid greener future the Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings.  This performance has been recognised at both national and international level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in design and specification.  The Department's technical guidance document set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency.  They are based on solid energy research projects.  All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements.  Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments through the Department's technical guidance documents.  The Department's policy is supported by a strong research programme with 53 research projects at various stages, including the energy in education website, a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department's schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 building energy ratings since 2009 with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current building regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.</p> <p>The Senator asked about fossil-free heating systems.  The design guidance also include future-proofing to take advantage of technologies as they become viable.  For example: direct modulating high-efficiency gas boiler systems that can support the integration of heat pump systems; optimum envelope fabric that will not require additional enhancement for compatibility with decarbonised heating systems, low water content radiators and operating temperatures for compatibility with decarbonised heating systems; and the provision of space in new school classroom layouts for mechanical ventilation heat recovery units.  In the interest of sustainability, the potential of renewables is maximised in school design while ensuring that renewable applications are properly suited to needs and reflective of school opening hours and school holiday periods.</p> <p>It is also critical that an energy reduction plan is part of any investment in renewable energy applications.  The climate action plan, due for publication in mid-2021, will outline how energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions targets are to achieved.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Josepha Madigan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As part of our continued research, the Department is undertaking a further review of current school design principles based on the new focus of moving from energy-demand reduction to energy-related greenhouse gas emission reduction for public sector bodies.</p></speech>

I was not asking about the quantity of schools but rather quality, which is why I raised the issue.  I know there are many new school buildings and that is brilliant, but we have to get them right.  As the Minister of State noted, we will research whatever is viable but we already know what is viable.  The research has been going on for 20 years.  We are retrofitting schools at the moment with air-to-water and air-to-air systems, yet we are designing new builds with gas heating.  That makes no sense.</p> <p>Current building regulations are of no interest.  We want schools to be A3 energy rated, carbon neutral, fossil-fuel free and healthy.  We want full school ventilation, not just in some parts of the school.  The Department has been researching this for 20 years and it should have figured it out by now.</p> <p>We have for years been fighting on behalf of schools for the signing of a statutory instrument.  It was promised that it would be in place by the first quarter of 2021 but it has not happened.  It would stop schools having to apply for planning permission to put photovoltaic and solar panels on their roofs.  It is a disgrace that they have to do so.  In this day and age, schools should be paid to do this.  Not only that, they should be allowed to sell the energy back to the grid during the summer months.  Given all the research and so on that has been done, it is not good enough.   The Department needs to catch up.  With 20 years of research, it should be doing better by now.  The new designs are akin to 1990 designs.  We are retrofitting some schools while repeating old patterns with new schools.</p></speech>

There is merit in much of what the Senator said.  I have noted her comments on school ventilation, although it is just one of a number of prevention and control measures that are in place to ensure that schools are safe.  I accept what she said earlier about having the heating turned on and the windows open.  There has to be a better way to do that.</p> <p>There are practical steps in the Department&rsquo;s guide for schools for the deployment of good ventilation practices, which was updated in November 2020, and that may be of assistance to the Senator.  Moreover, the design guidelines for all new schools provide for the provision of outdoor multi-use game areas.  I note what the Senator said about tarmacadam being different from grass.  There is not sufficient time for me to delineate all the other points but I will convey her comments to the Minister and ensure that she addresses her concerns.</p></speech>

I raise two of my favourite topics, County Louth's Cooley Peninsula and the connecting of the two sides of Carlingford Lough.  The Narrow Water Bridge, to me, as a local, is a project that has been talked about for so long.  It is a symbol of the future and of what can be.  It is aspirational, but with the shared island fund, that aspiration has become a possibility.  One might say it is infrastructure with various merits, but it is so much more than infrastructure.  It is about moving forward through peace and reconciliation, going back to the time when the Vikings travelled up Carlingford Lough and settled in Newry and Carlingford.  There is so much positivity around the project.  We have been discussing it for about 20 years.  There have been delays upon delays and now is the time for action.  I hope we can get a positive answer on the matter from the Minister for Transport.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is shovel-ready.  Louth County Council has done incredible work over recent years on this.  We need action.  It is supported and spoken about by An Taoiseach at every opportunity.  Nichola Mallon, Minister for Infrastructure in the North, is also an incredible sponsor of the project.  It is important for reasons of morale, tourism and sustainable and active living.  I could freewheel from the Cooley Mountains to the Mournes.  What better way to live one's life than being able to cross that bridge?  One could throw a stone or have a conversation.  It is important to start connecting these two.</p></speech>

It is a hugely symbolic and important project for the communities of Omeath, Carlingford and north Louth, and for communities on the other side of the Border, like Warrenpoint, Rostrevor and Newry.  It is a symbolic thing to connect those communities which have been apart for so long because of issues in the Troubles and everything else.  Carlingford Lough is already quite connected through the Carlingford ferry at the mouth of the lough, which goes from Greenore to Greencastle.  This is a good way to connect it further down.</p> <p>It has had many false hopes and false dawns over the years.  When I was first elected to the council in 2014, it was very close to getting over the line but, because of mistakes in prices and tenders, it fell short.  The project is now shovel-ready and could start tomorrow if the funded was approved.  We need Government to approve that funding.  The funding is there through the shared island unit, which is looking around to fund projects that are ready to start.  This is the perfect example of something we can do with it.  That is why Senator McGreehan and I bring this to the Seanad today.  We need the final approval and the rubber stamp from Government to go ahead with it.</p> <p>It would be remiss of me not to mention the late councillor, Tommy Elmore, who put this project on the map 40 years ago.  He was the first person to advocate this.  The Elmore family are synonymous with the Omeath community.  Tommy passed away nearly two and a half decades ago but this was his project.  He was the first one to talk about this.  He put it on the map 40 years ago when the concept of cross-Border infrastructure was null and void because people were blowing stuff like that up.  I would like to remember him today in this debate about the Narrow Water bridge.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, are not available, so I am taking this topic on their behalf.</p> <p>It is important to note there is a Government commitment jointly with the Northern Ireland Executive to progress consideration of options for the development of the Narrow Water bridge project at the North-South Ministerial Council included in New Decade, New Approach.  This followed on from a similar commitment in A Fresh Start - The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan. </p> <p>A progress report regarding consideration of options for a Narrow Water bridge was considered by the North-South Ministerial Council in July 2016 and the council decided then that work should continue on the development of options.  Senior officials have been continuing a review of the options, which has included meetings with relevant stakeholders.  In engaging with stakeholders, officials have highlighted the need to assess all potential options objectively to ensure the best possible outcome for the area and the best use of public funds.  Following on from that, the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland started work on the preparation of an outline business case regarding a Narrow Water bridge scheme.  The purpose of the business case is to consider the need to construct a bridge over the Newry River and appraise options to ensure any proposal put forward is likely to represent value for money.  The Department's strategic research and analysis division provided input into this work.</p> <p>The proposal for the Narrow Water bridge has to be considered in light of welcome developments with respect to the Newry southern relief road since 2016.  That road would provide an alternative route for strategic traffic that avoids Newry city centre and links to the eastern seaboard key transport corridor, the A1-N1 from Belfast to Dublin.  The Department for Infrastructure has conducted a community consultation on the Newry southern relief road regarding the preferred route.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The current proposal for the Newry southern relief road is likely to include pedestrian and cycling provision, as well as connectivity, to the B79-R173 Fathom Lane leading to Omeath, Carlingford.  I understand that the intention is to have a complete stage 3 scheme assessment of the Newry southern relief road published in quarter 3 of this year by the Department for Infrastructure.  As part of the project optioneering, four options are being considered for the Narrow Water bridge, that is, do nothing, a pedestrian cycle bridge only, a bridge that also caters for cars, and a bridge that also caters for buses, coaches and heavy goods vehicles.  The overall assessment of the case for the Narrow Water bridge, including in the context of the development of a wider tourism initiative for the region, is not at a stage where it is a clearly defined and a costed scheme.  Further consideration of any impact on the R173 of any vehicular bridge would also need to be considered.  </p><p>On 5 May 2021, the North-South Ministerial Council noted the commitments in New Decade, New Approach in regard to the Narrow Water bridge and agreed that Departments will consider next steps to progress the scheme.  I understand that at that meeting the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, committed to meeting with the Minister for Infrastructure, Nichola Mallon, and stakeholders in the area once Covid restrictions permitting such a visit are lifted.  The options for the Narrow Water bridge remain under consideration.</p></speech>

He mentioned the business case.  It might never be achieved if the conversation is around bare economic facts.  The Narrow Water bridge project is about a lot more than a bridge; it is about dreaming and looking to the future.  There is so much tourism potential in terms of the creation of this product.  There is already a bridge and planning for widening it.  The Minister of State's remarks are disingenuous because there is a bridge and a plan that is shovel-ready.</p></speech>

There is no reason we cannot have both.  There are many reasons the Newry southern relief road makes sense in terms of vehicular traffic, access and so on, but it should not be a case of one or the other.  As Senator McGreehan rightly pointed out, it is the symbolic nature of this project that we should be talking about.  It is for that reason this project is being progressed by the shared island unit as opposed to a Department of Transport or Department for Infrastructure.</p></speech>

It is of great importance on both sides of the Border, as has been stated.  There are many moving parts in achieving progress on this issue.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the development of the Newry southern relief road is proceeding well.  This would have a major impact on the robustness of any business case that would subsequently be developed for a vehicular Narrow Water bridge.  It is likely that many of the benefits in the business case that would originally have accrued to a vehicular bridge at Narrow Water will instead flow to the Newry southern relief road.  To that end, a cycling and walking bridge of real architectural merit is worthy of consideration.  This could tie in with the natural beauty of Carlingford Lough and it would link the Newry to Greenore greenway and create the impetus for a greenway on the northern side of the lough from Warrenpoint to Greencastle where greenway users could access the ferry to journey across to Greenore.  This would, perhaps, be worthy of consideration and provide a world-class piece of tourism infrastructure in the region that would bring huge benefits to people on both sides of the Border.</p> <p>We have seen the transformation of towns such as Newport in Mayo and Kilmacthomas and Dungarvan in Waterford following the development of greenways.  Greenways bring hundreds of thousands of users to areas of the country in much need of tourism.  They also provide the means of connecting our towns and villages with a sustainable means of transport for every day journeys by foot or bicycle.  However, this is just one option.  All options are on the table for consideration.  I understand that officials continue to work on devising costs for all the options, as well as the wider impact of other developments in the area.  I am due to visit the region in the coming weeks and I look forward to meeting the Senators there to discuss the matter further.</p></speech>

I am seeking a statement from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine on the legislation that enforces the removal of abandoned vessels from Irish waters and what plans, if any, there are to strengthen that legislation to deal with the extensive occurrence of vessels being abandoned.</p> <p>This is an important issue and a legacy issue in many rural communities.  There is a blight in our territorial waters.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In many areas, vessels have been abandoned for decades.  Unfortunately, legislation has not been strong enough and local authorities have not been empowered with financing and a legislative mandate to ensure that the issue can be addressed.</p><p>This matter came to a head a year ago when a major vessel of nearly 2,500 tonnes ran aground at Ballycotton, County Cork.  It still lies there.  It is a serious issue for the local authority and local community, and how we deal with it will be an important question for Ireland.  What happened in Ballycotton is an extreme example, but vessels are constantly being abandoned at piers and in the waters of coastal communities.  There seems to be very little progress, if any, on ensuring that they are moved.</p><p>We need a genuine debate with the Department about how it will deal with this matter, which is a blight and littering of a different nature.  If there were cars abandoned all over our roads, we would not leave them there.  We are not empowering anyone or putting financial measures in place to ensure that we can clean up our seas.  We have debated removing sea litter from our coasts, but we have had a poor debate about how to deal with this legacy issue of abandoned vessels.  I need to see movement from the Government accordingly.  That would involve legislation, budgets and a different mentality about how we will deal with the issue.  In this Commencement matter, I am primarily trying to ensure that the Government is aware that this legacy issue is affecting coastal communities the length and breadth of our country and that nothing has been done about it for decades.  We need to see movement.  I hope that we can start a conversation this morning and put appropriate legislation and moneys in place to ensure that last year's extreme event in Ballycotton is not repeated and, more importantly, the legacy issues of recent decades can be cleaned up.</p></speech>

Section 40 of the Act provides that the Minister for Transport, "shall have the general superintendence ... of all matters relating to every wrecked or stranded vessel or other wreck."  The Act also sets out the responsibilities of other bodies from an operational perspective.  Sections 51 and 52 are of particular note in terms of the duty of the owner and appropriate authorities.  Section 51 places the initial responsibility for removing a wreck on the owner of the vessel, stating that, "the owner of the wreck at the time of its sinking, wrecking, stranding, grounding or abandonment shall as soon as possible raise and remove it or otherwise render it harmless."  The Act also provides for a number of appropriate authorities - a harbour authority, a local authority or the Commissioners of Irish Lights - to raise and remove the wreck or otherwise render it harmless if they consider it is likely to become an obstruction or danger to navigation or a threat of harm to the marine environment or related interests, including the health of the public.</p> <p>Separate provisions apply regarding the sale of wrecks and the appointed receivers of wrecks.  The Act allows for the receiver of a wreck to sell the vessel where its owner cannot be located.  However, the Senator will appreciate that a scenario may arise wherein a vessel in such a condition cannot be sold and holds no significant monetary value and, therefore, its sale is not a viable option.  While the Act allows for the removal of the wreck, it does not contain provisions regarding the costs associated with that removal where the sale of the wreck is not possible and the owners of the vessel cannot be located.</p> <p>The Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks 2007 provides a legal basis for the State to remove, or have removed at a ship owner's expense, a wreck that has the potential to affect adversely the safety of lives, goods and property at sea, as well as the marine environment.  Ship owners are obliged to maintain insurance or provide other financial security to cover the costs of wreck removal.  As the Senator stated, primary legislation is required to ratify the convention.  It is intended to progress that legislation as part of the future marine shipping Bill.  However, it must be noted that the convention does not cover all wreck removal scenarios.  For example, when the owner of a vessel cannot be located and insurance details cannot be found, pursuing the owner for costs is very difficult.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The Senator may be interested to hear that on foot of a recommendation in a recent report published by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board on the grounding of a wreck on the Irish coast in 2020, the Department of Transport has established a working group to explore the risks and potential costs to the State presented by derelict ships entering Irish territorial waters and coming ashore in Ireland and make proposals for means to identify, monitor, track and interdict derelict ships before they endanger other ships and seafarers in the vicinity.  </p><p>Incidence of wreaks coming ashore on the Irish coast are rare.  The Department of Transport will continue to be available to support relevant appropriate authorities in the exercise of its functions as out in the legislation in question.</p></speech>

It is probably in line with what we have been receiving.  The clarity in his response is very limited.  In particular, we cannot even find the owner of a ship wreck.  That is probably the position currently in County Cork.  This is a legacy issue.  We have had ship wrecks onshore for decades with no movement to remove them.  That is the primary issue.  Legislation, debate and a change in ethos on this issue in Government Buildings are needed.  The Government view on this is that the vessel is doing no harm and to leave it there.  We have moved away from that.  If there were abandoned cars in every estate in Ireland we would do something about it.  The issue I raised is a feature in our harbours and there does not seem to be any drive from national Government to do something about it.  We need to empower local authorities financially and to change the legislation.  We need to take on board the 2007 convention that has not been enacted and that needs to be brought forward.  A body of work needs to be done.  Otherwise, this blight on our marine wildlife and environment will continue due to a lack of clarity and action on this issue on the part of the Government.</p></speech>

Particularly as we move towards legislating for marine protected areas, there is an opportunity not only to introduce legislation but to make sure it is aligned on the protection of our marine environment.</p><p>In particular regarding the <i>MV Alta</i>, it was washed up on 16 February 2020 and Cork County Council took the lead in dealing with the wreck under the 1993 Act, as appropriate.  The ministerial powers under the 1993 Act are indirect and refer to the appointment of authorised officers.  It is the role of the appropriate authority, in this case Cork County Council, which has taken a number of steps to discharge its responsibilities under the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act 1993 by removing stores, including fuels and lubricants, from the vessel and engaging consultants to carry out a number of reports on the vessel.These included reports on the wreck compiled by a marine surveyor, an environmental and ecological impact study and an assessment of hazardous material, but I take on board the points made regarding the Nairobi convention, which will require a specific item of legislation for its enactment.  It is timely and useful the Senator raised this issue here this morning.</p></speech>

I am sure he is aware of the serious blow inflicted by Aer Lingus on Shannon Airport last week with the announcement it was going to close its base there permanently.  Like others, I fully understand Aer Lingus is in a perilous situation financially, having lost &euro;360 million last year and &euro;100 million to date this year.  However, this undermining of its commitment to Shannon is a further deterioration in the status of Shannon Airport.</p> <p>I would point to the decision on the Shannon stopover in the early 1990s, the sale of Aer Lingus and the controversy over the Heathrow slots.  Shannon, which is and has the status of an international airport with a fantastic terminal building has been continuously completely undermined.  As an island national, connectivity is extremely important.  In light of Brexit and that we will be in a post-pandemic era, we will have to battle for our economic survival and development.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need proper, effective connectivity in order for the mid-west to flourish.  There are many foreign direct investment companies based in the mid-west, particularly in the Shannon Free Zone and the surrounding area, that very much rely on an Aer Lingus presence, and particularly on connectivity between and Heathrow daily.</p><p>The announcement by Aer Lingus last week that it was going to close its base certainly does not augur well for the airline's commitment to Shannon.  Without a base, one has to assume that we will not have early-morning flights to Heathrow whereby people who wish to do business in the City of London can fly there, do a day's business and come back that night.  People who wish to fly to London and take connecting flights to other parts of Europe, to Asia and to the rest of the world will not have the option of early-morning flights.</p><p>Through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, Aer Lingus has already received a loan of &euro;75 million.  I understand it is in the process of drawing down a further &euro;75 million.  This will amount to a loan of &euro;150 million from the fund.  I also understand that Aer Lingus is in negotiations with the Government regarding a &euro;150 million bailout in order for it to survive.  The company must survive.  It is critical from an Irish perspective and to secure connectivity.  If, however, we are to write the cheque, it cannot be a blank cheque.  We need commitments.  First, we need a long-term commitment from Aer Lingus that it will keep the Heathrow slots to create and maintain connectivity between Shannon and Heathrow.  Second, we need a commitment from the airline that it will continue the flights to Heathrow and continue its transatlantic services to connect the mid-west region to North America.  This connectivity has been critical to the foreign direct investors based in the mid-west and doing business in Shannon.  It is also important from a tourism perspective.  The whole mid-west benefits enormously from American visitors, particularly those from North America but also those from the rest of America.  They spend billions of euros in the mid-west every year.  This is critical.  Aer Lingus will have to guarantee it in the long term if it gets the bailout.  Third, and equally important, the airline will have to be persuaded to reverse its decision to close its base in Shannon.  These are three requests I am making of the Minister of State in return for the Government giving Aer Lingus the &euro;150 million plus it needs to continue operating.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-24a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021052400002#M00200"><p>I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.  I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address the ongoing crisis in the aviation sector, particularly the recent announcement made by Aer Lingus concerning certain cost-cutting measures in light of the cumulative impact of Covid-19 over the past 15 months.  First, I acknowledge the unprecedented challenges faced by Aer Lingus and its staff during this difficult time.  The entire aviation sector is experiencing its most challenging crisis in its history.  Analysis undertaken last week by EUROCONTROL, the European organisation for the safety of air navigation, suggests air traffic across Europe is not expected to return to 2019 levels before 2025.  Here in Ireland, the sector has been particularly impacted by Covid-19 and Irish airlines continue to face major financial challenges.  As a consequence, all airlines have previously issued capital, raised further borrowings, drawn on Government supports and undertaken measures to reduce their cost base.</p> <p>In that context and in light of the continuing pandemic, it is acknowledged that Aer Lingus has little option but to take unpalatable measures to reduce its cost base.   It has also noted that many other European airlines are also implementing significant cost-saving measures in light of the circumstances currently facing the industry.  Nevertheless, it is regrettable that Aer Lingus has decided to close its cabin crew base at Shannon Airport and to temporarily close its base at Cork Airport, as well as embark on a review of grounding-handling arrangements at those airports.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, met the CEO of Aer Lingus to discuss details of the announcement made by the company last week.   They reiterated the Government's commitment to supporting the industry and acknowledged the importance of providing clarity on the extent and duration of employment supports beyond the end of June.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister and the Minister of State also reassured the airline that there will be no cliff edge in supports for the airline or for the wider aviation sector.  Their meeting with the CEO also focused on future operations of the company in Ireland and they outlined their hopes for a resumption of travel from Cork and Shannon when the situation allows.  In that regard, the Minister welcomed confirmation by the CEO that there is no strategic attempt to reduce connectivity at either Cork or Shannon, while acknowledging that restoration of services depends on market circumstances.</p><p>The Minister and Minister of State also met with the CEO of Shannon Group and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, met with the CEO of Cork Airport last week to discuss the situation.  The Minister and Minister of State reiterated their support for the airports and their important role in regional development.  Similar engagements took place last week when the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, met with unions and employer representative groups in her capacity as chair of the aviation subgroup of the Labour Employer Economic Forum.  This subgroup has been investigating the option of a specially extended wage subsidy scheme for the aviation sector and this work will continue.</p><p>I assure the House that Government is committed to supporting the aviation sector.  We recognise the importance of providing clarity on the extent and duration of supports beyond the end of June.  Throughout this pandemic, Government has provided a significant level of general support to the economy, with at least &euro;300 million provided to the aviation sector alone.  The bulk of this support is in the form of wage subsidies which were designed to maintain the link between employers and their workers.</p><p>Approximately &euro;32 million is also being provided in supports to Cork and Shannon Airports this year.  Additionally, the Department of Transport is assessing applications for funding to State Airports under the &euro;20 million Covid-19 supplementary support scheme and expects to be able to provide funding to Cork and Shannon Airports under this scheme soon.  This support will allow the airports flexibility to provide route incentives and airport charge rebates to stimulate recovery of lost connectivity this year.</p><p>While acknowledging the primacy of the protection of public health, there is clearly an increasing need for a strategy for international travel that can serve as a basis to both protect existing jobs insofar as is possible and to plan for recommencement of operations as soon as is practically possible.  I confirm the Government will set out a pathway for the reopening of international travel following its meeting next Friday.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact there will be a significant announcement on aviation in the coming days.  The survival of Aer Lingus is critical to Ireland and to the mid-west, in particular, but any bailout it gets must be a return journey.  If it gets &euro;150 million, which I understand it is seeking, we need three commitments from it.  First, it must maintain the Heathrow slots in and out of Shannon.  Second, it must commit to long-term to strategic routes, transatlantic and in and out of Heathrow, because that is what is required from a foreign direct investment and tourism perspective, particularly with North America.  Third, it must reverse the decision it made last week to permanently close its base in Shannon.  </p> <p>Aer Lingus should get the money it is looking for, but it cannot come without conditions.  We cannot give a blank cheque.  We must get those commitments in return.  I call on the Minister and the Government to ensure that happens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-24a.49" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021052400002#N00300"><p>Again, it is important to note that the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, chairs the aviation subgroup of the Labour Employer Economic Forum and that subgroup is continuing its work in investigating a specially extended wage subsidy scheme for the aviation sector.  That work is ongoing.</p><p>Specifically, in relation to the Heathrow slots, Aer Lingus still holds its portfolio slots at London Heathrow Airport, LHR.  The slots are protected and are unaffected by the recent announcement by Aer Lingus of cuts at its Shannon and Cork bases.  Certain connectivity commitments are agreed with International Airlines Group, IAG, when the State sold its residual shareholding in 2015.  These are currently suspended under the <i>force majeure </i>provisions under the agreement.  The connectivity commitments expire in September 2022 and Aer Lingus cannot dispose of those slots without prior consent from the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Getting international travel back up and running is vital for the continued economic well-being of this country and remains a Government priority.  However, this can only be accomplished through consideration of the progression of our Covid-19 national vaccination programme, developments at EU and international levels, and public health advice.  As stated earlier, the Government will set out its position very shortly.</p></speech>

In 2013, the constitutional convention recommended that we reduce the voting age to 16.  The programme for Government negotiated among our three parties had a very clear commitment around ways in which we can look at enhancing the role of young people in society and how we can support youth participation.  One of the specific commitments was that we would look at learning from the Scottish experience where the voting age has been reduced.  It was reduced in 2014 for the Scottish independence referendum but we have seen it maintained for local and Scottish parliamentary elections, including the recent elections.  It was also extended for the Senedd elections in Wales, which took place earlier this month.  The Isle of Man, which was the first territory in the world to extend the right to vote to women in 1881, has allowed those aged 16 to vote since 2006.  The case of Austria is often cited.  It was introduced there for local elections from 2000 and extended to general and other elections from 2007.  Malta has reduced the voting age to 16 and the age is the same in Estonia and a number of German L&auml;nder.  The voting age in Greece is 17.  The Belgian Government has now said that it is going to extend the right to vote to 16 and 17-year-olds for its local and European elections from 2024.  The European Parliament and the Council of Europe have recommended that we look at voting at 16.</p> <p>Over the course of the pandemic, we have seen the contribution young people have made to Irish society in so many ways.  In particular, I am thinking of the role of the Irish Second&ndash;Level Students' Union but it also relates to so many other young people.  We had a very good debate in this House last week about the role that young people have played.  </p> <p>It is not the silver bullet.  Other things need to happen as well.  We need a very strong programme of political education right through our education system and beyond.  We need to look at ways in which we can resource Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, youth organisations and volunteers who are engaging with young people, but we must be serious about looking at ways of allowing young people to participate in that most important right, which is the right to vote.  </p> <p>There are fears that if we extend the right to vote to those aged 16 and 17, they will vote in a particular direction and for all sorts of crazy candidates.  The evidence is that this is not the case.  The evidence from Austria, where it has been in place for over a decade and a half, is that the younger generations tend to follow the broad patterns of other generations except that the issues are different.  There is often a lot more focus on issues that are of direct concern to young people and the political system and political parties adapt in due course.  </p> <p>I have a Bill before this House calling for the change to be introduced for the local and European elections in 2024.  It provides enough time for a lead in to deal with all of the issues and engage in that programme of political education.  The Government is committed to the introduction of a much-needed electoral commission, which is being championed by the Minister of State, but as part of that, I would love to hear him give a commitment in this House that we would move towards a situation where those aged 16 and 17 would have the right to vote in the local and European elections in 2024 because it only requires legislative change.</p></speech>

The times they are indeed a-changing.  From a political perspective, I very much welcome the Senator bringing this issue to the House because it is really important.  At the outset, it should be noted that the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future contains a broad range of electoral reforms, including a commitment to establish an independent statutory electoral commission by the end of this year.  The programme also contains an explicit commitment to examine the Scottish experience in reducing the voting age in order to draw conclusions.</p> <p>Against this background, in December 2020, the Government approved the drafting of an electoral reform Bill.  The Bill's general scheme has been circulated to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The general scheme, which was circulated to the committee on 8 January 2021, addresses a number of Government commitments, including proposals relating to the establishment of an electoral commission.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> As I have stated previously in the House, one of the electoral commission's initial functions will be to conduct research on electoral policies, procedures and administrative practices, with a view to providing advice to the Oireachtas on request, as my Department may be required to do from time to time.  Examining the issues in respect of reducing the voting age is a good example of the type of research that could be carried out by the commission, when it is established, and is something I would very much welcome.</p><p>The House may recall that the Convention on the Constitution examined this issue extensively over the course of its debates.  Three ballots took place to inform its proposals on this issue.  In the first ballot, there was a small majority in favour of the proposal that the voting age should be reduced.  In the second ballot, the members were asked to consider whether to reduce the voting age to 17 or to 16 years, with the stronger support for the latter reduction.  A third ballot was also held on whether the voting age should be reduced for some types of elections only, for example, local elections.  The overwhelming view of the convention did not support a reduction in the voting age for specific types of elections only, with 68% of convention members voting against this proposal and just 28% voting in favour of it.  In line with the majority opinion of its members, the convention recommended that a referendum should be held to amend the Constitution to reduce the voting age to 16 years of age for all elections.</p><p>Separately, and complementary to this work of the convention, the Citizens' Assembly, in its 2018 report, The Manner in Which Referenda are Held &amp;amp; Fixed Term Parliaments, also recommended, among other things, that the voting age should be lowered to 16 years as a means to increase voter turnout at elections, something we all want to see.  While the assembly voted by 80% in favour of a reduction in the voting age, it did not specify the election or elections to which reduced voting age would apply, although it did refer briefly to the deliberations of the Convention on the Constitution on this matter.</p><p>The Senator can rest assured that my Department is committed to having this important issue examined.  The establishment of an electoral commission is currently a multifaceted project in my Department's key electoral reform priorities.  Following its establishment, the electoral commission will be well-placed, if requested, to examine, among other matters, the prospect of reducing the age at which a person should be entitled to vote, having particular regard to the experience in Scotland, as well as in other countries that the Senator has referenced, where a reduction in the voting age has taken place.  I again welcome the tabling of this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-24a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021052400002#P00200"><p>I would certainly favour the extension of voting at 16 to all elections but, as the Minister of State is aware, that will require a constitutional amendment whereas the scope is there, on a legislative basis, to change it in time for the local and European elections.  The evidence again suggests that, along with political education, if we encourage young people at 16 and 17 to vote, they become habitual voters and they do engage.</p> <p>The Minister of State referred to Bob Dylan and to his song, "The Times They Are A-Changin'".  He will be aware, of course, that one of the verses opens with the line, "Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call".  I ask that the Minister of State heed the call of young people and of an increasing number of people in this House and the Lower House to the effect that we look at allowing those aged 16 and 17 to vote.  The time is there to allow us to plan for it properly for the local and European elections in 2024.  I welcome the Minister of State's commitment but I would love to hear him say that he envisages those aged 16 and 17 going to the ballot box in 2024.</p></speech>

I am conscious the Senator rightly highlighted the role of young people in recent years, particularly as the climate Bill is now being brought forward.  It was the climate strikes, it was the Fridays For Future, it was those young people who brought about this transformational change and demanded change from us, as politicians.  It is only right that we give due regard to that.</p> <p>I met with the Irish Second-Level Students Union and I gave a commitment to its representatives that we would examine the matter, given that it is only a legislative requirement, as we move towards the 2024 local elections.  We are also committing to a citizens' assembly on biodiversity, at which, hopefully, Comhairle na n-&Oacute;g will have a specific role in the context of a youth assembly on that.  Young people are becoming front and centre and, as in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, they should be consulted and should be part of the process.  It is vital that we give due consideration to that.</p> <p>I welcome that this issue had been brought forward.  I give my full commitment that we will explore every avenue to try to make it happen.</p></speech>

The day commemorates when the first multi-party parliament was constituted in 1990, an event that paved the way for democratic change, freedom and independence in Croatia.  As small nations that struggled for so long for independence, Ireland and Croatia share a common bond.  Next year we mark the 30th anniversary of Ireland's recognition of Croatia as an independent state but our links go back further.  Count Laval Nugent, born in Westmeath in 1777, was a field marshal in the Austrian Army.  He was a strong advocate for Croatian nationhood and served as a member of the Croatian Parliament.  We share a love of language and culture.  The Croatian language is an examination subject in our schools.  A statute of one of Ireland's greatest writers, James Joyce, stands in the city of Pula, commemorating his time there.  Eight Croatian cities took part in the global greening initiative to mark St. Patrick's Day, reflecting the growing friendship between our two countries.</p><p>We wish the Ambassador, H.E.

This week, starting today, is National Epilepsy Week.  I am acutely aware of the extraordinary health difficulties that face this country, the HSE and the Department of Health with regard to the cyber ransom event, which is appalling and frightening.  I have a duty, as a public representative, to proclaim that I have been diagnosed with this condition.  On 25 October 2019, when I was the Cathaoirleach, I collapsed and had a near death experience.  Thankfully, my wife saw me collapse and go unconscious so I was rushed to St. James's Hospital and survived.</p> <p>There are 40,000 people in this country who are known sufferers of epilepsy.  That number is grossly underestimated because many people say the figure is double if truth were known.  There are many myths associated with epilepsy.  Some people say that one is born with it but that is not correct.  Some people say the condition is inherited.  I am the youngest of a long tailed family of 11 and there has been no evidence of any epilepsy in my family.</p> <p>I have been in touch with the epilepsy association of Ireland, Epilepsy Ireland, which does wonderful advocacy work.  Sometimes there is a myth and stigma attached to what I call a medical condition that should be unravelled.  On the law of averages, one in 80 people suffers from the condition.  As there are 220 members of the Oireachtas, then at least three other Members, apart from myself, should have the condition.</p> <p>Unfortunately for me, I walked around with the condition for many years before being diagnosed.  One consultant said that I had sleep apnea, another consultant said that I had transient ischaemic attacks, TIAs, which are mini strokes, and somebody else said that I had global amnesia.  Thankfully, in the end the matter was sorted.  On 21 July 2020, and nine months after my collapse and ending up in St. James's Hospital, I had seven or eighth absence seizures, which are mini episodes.  I did not go unconscious and knew what was happening but I was in a frozen state for 20 seconds.  As a result, neurologist immediately confirmed that I had epilepsy.  Thankfully, since then I am on medication, which is normal enough.  I live a normal life and hope to resume driving on 1 August.  Not being able to drive is a big setback for me as I live in the remote area of Schull, so I must get buses and trains to Dublin and elsewhere.  I was used to the freedom of driving.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Denis O'Donovan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1988"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1988&amp;amp;pid=DenisODonovan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Given the week that is in it, I hope my speaking out publicly will create a focus on and an awareness of this condition.  One can live a normal life once one knows one has it, but the problem is that if the condition is not diagnosed, one is walking on thin ice or walking a tightrope.  I was very fortunate to survive.  Had I died that day, they would have said it was a heart attack.  Nobody would have known the difference.  However, I am here to tell the tale.  Given the week that is in it, I ask the Leader for a debate on this very important medical condition, if possible before the summer recess.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-24a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021052400002#V00300"><p>I am delighted Senator O'Donovan is here to tell his tale and I concur with him on the importance of the condition of epilepsy.</p> <p>I call for a debate on the issue of planning.  Every element of our infrastructure is dependent on our planning process.  In the main it is open and transparent and allows for objections and submissions to the supreme authority for appeals, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The duration of some cases and in particular the open-ended nature of the legal challenges to decisions frustrate the process, making infrastructure expensive.  NIMBYism is alive and well.  All this adds to the cost of delivery of many projects, a cost borne by our local authorities and the State and, in the case of housing, a cost that is added to house prices by the eventual developer or a cost that causes a developer to give up and not try on that site again or indeed anywhere else.  Housing, roads, greenways and wastewater schemes can all be subject to the lengthy legal challenges that delay projects which are much needed for development, sustainability, job creation and environmental protection.</p> <p>Former Supreme Court judge, Susan Denham, proposes a separate jurisdiction of the High Court for planning and environmental law similar to family law.  This is due to it being a technical issue in nature.  I understand that the programme for Government proposes such a court.  As we continue to grow our economy through capital expenditure, timely decisions and decision-making are necessary and in all our interests.  A legal impasse lasting years benefits nobody except those earning money from it, the legal profession and environmental experts.  Meanwhile, communities are frustrated by delays lasting in some cases years in the provision of key infrastructure for homes.  The south Kerry greenway is a project in point and a test case for greenways across the country.  The old Galway city bypass went through the Irish courts before ending up in the European Court of Justice, which is fine, but the process was inordinately long, with huge delays.  The Apple case in Athenry is another example.  The project did not proceed because Apple said it had had enough due to the delays.  Objectors using the system to frustrate and delay, delay and delay a project is not right or proper.  A yes-no decision in a timely manner is what is needed in this country for all types of projects.</p> <p>I therefore call for a debate on the matter of planning delays at an early juncture in the context of the progress on the proposals in the programme for Government on the numerous examples we have around the country of projects being delayed, predominantly because of the open-ended nature of the appeals process through our courts and the European courts as well.  Planning is hugely important.  As I said, it allows all projects to proceed.  Thankfully, we have a robust planning system but we need a timely and efficient one as well for the reasons I outlined earlier.</p></speech>

So many people do not speak out.  I have personal experience within my family of somebody with epilepsy and it is a tough station.</p><p>I thank Senator Kyne for raising the planning issue.  We have seen what it did in Galway and Athenry, particularly, and it would be good to have that debate.</p><p>I am very proud to stand here this morning and to advise anybody who does not know that Ireland's first female Defence Forces general has smashed through the glass ceiling in defence.  Major General Maureen O'Brien has been promoted and will serve her time, for now anyway, as military adviser to the United Nations Secretary General.  This is a very proud moment for Ireland.  However, such good news has been soured slightly by the story that ran in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>at the weekend of Chief Petty Officer Tadhg McCarthy, who after 24 years as an engine room artificer, has left the Naval Service.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In leaving the service, he speaks of a vicious cycle.  The less the manpower available, the more the Naval Service is asking of the people who are left and the increased pressure is, in turn, leading more people to leave.  I note that Commodore Malone was obliged to take two ships out of service last year and it looks very much as though more will be taken out of service in the not-too-distant future.  </p><p>Mr. McCarthy addressed the Government initiative, the sea service commitment scheme, and pointed out that it has led to a two-tier Naval Service.  Someone who has served longer than three years has an entitlement to the &euro;10,000 pay-out but those with less than three years' service do not qualify for that payment.  PDFORRA and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, have both maintained that increasing special allowances across all boards would be vitally important and it was part of the high-level implementation plan.  As the Deputy Leader has worn the uniform with pride herself, she will understand where I am coming from here today.</p><p>The Government does not have time for the Commission on the Defence Forces to report.  Too many people are leaving right now.  We have seen in the case of the Air Corps that once brought in, an initiative can have a dramatic effect on retention if it is implemented quickly.  We need to start an implementation process right across the Defence Forces or there will be nobody left.  PDFORRA has constantly asked for membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  The Minister has said "No" and that he favours a commission on pay instead.  Unless that commission can go outside the terms of national pay agreements agreed with ICTU, we are simply going nowhere.</p><p>Finally, those of us in politics, in uniform and in the Civil Service who have overseen the decline and destruction of the Defence Forces need to hang our heads in shame.  What has gone on is outrageous.  The first and most loyal to respond every time are being treated appallingly.</p></speech>

I have a very close family member who had a late life experience, just as Senator O&rsquo;Donovan had, and I can assure the House that it is a very scary experience to see a loved one going off in the back of an ambulance without knowing what has happened.</p><p>I raise two issues with the Deputy Leader today.  The first one is the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the problem that some local authority members are having in going about their day-to-day business in trying to help as many of their own constituents as they can.  I am aware that this issue has also been affecting the work that many of us are trying to carry out in this House on a daily basis, which is the need for compliance with section 40 of the Data Protection Act 2018.  In my local authority, a form must now be signed by the person on whose behalf one is making the representation and countersigned by the local authority member.  Simply put, the local authority will not deal with the member unless this form is signed.  The problem, of course, is that we are in the middle of a pandemic and getting such forms signed is difficult, to say the least, for so many public representatives.  </p><p>A bigger issue is that the need for such forms differs all over the country, even though all of our public representatives, including Members of this House, are trying to achieve the very best for the persons we are representing.  It was always my understanding that we, as public representatives, must ensure that we keep the data that is provided to us safely and only use them for the purposes of making the representation.  We must standardise this requirement to ensure that all of our public representatives can do their jobs on a daily basis.  We all know that in dealing with various Departments, one must have a level of personal information in order to make a representation but calling to houses to have forms filled in is putting an additional step into a process that is not needed.  I ask the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to the House to discuss this matter.</p><p>I thank the Deputy Leader and the Leader of the House for facilitating the important debate this House had on the terrible and totally unacceptable events in Palestine with the Minister for Foreign Affairs last week.  However, to facilitate that much-needed debate, we had to postpone our statements on the Defence Forces.  I join with my colleagues in asking a number of questions on the Defence Forces, given, as my colleague has said, what we have learned over the weekend about the Naval Service and Tadhg McCarthy in the report in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, where senior naval officers are quoted as stating &quot;the concerning and continuing fall in [personnel] numbers&quot; in the service is &quot;hampering best efforts to provide the expected level of service to key stakeholders, and indeed the State&quot;.  I ask the Deputy Leader to convene the debate with the Minister for Defence as urgently as she can.  Numbers are falling in all parts of the Defence Forces and this cannot continue.  We have seen the key role that the Defence Forces are playing and can play in the recent cyberattack on this country but if the recruitment and retention crisis continues, then there is a growing fear that the Defence Forces will no longer be able to carry out many of the vital and underestimated tasks they undertake.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a pay and condition crisis in the Defence Forces.  Waiting on the outcome of the Commission on the Defence Forces or the setting up of an independent pay commission may be too late.  Time is running out.  Many Senators will appreciate the Leader's support, as always, in facilitating such a debate.</p></speech>

Some 22,000 Croatians have moved to Ireland since Croatia joined the EU, and they have family beyond it.  It is a good day for Ireland to celebrate with Croatians and to speak about the importance of the EU.</p> <p>On a related matter, I was stunned and shocked at the assault on our Union when a flight was diverted.  It is piracy in our skies.  The statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs was very strong but I look forward to seeing what steps will be taken when the European Council meets today.  That is essential.  We joined the EU in order to have security and a common economic purpose.  Part of that means protecting our airlines because people need to feel secure when they step onto an aircraft.  We also need to feel safe in our homes and our home is the EU.  I look forward to hearing what action will be taken beyond words today.  </p> <p>An issue I have raised many times here is maternity services.  Protests continue in Galway.  I join those protesting to say that it is outrageous that we continue week after week to have no assurances that women and their partners can have full access to the kinds of supports they need from their families.  Women's healthcare is a postcode lottery in this country.  People in the west deserve the very same as those in the east of the country.  </p> <p>Finally, I raise school bus services.  I have seen many letters coming back from Bus &Eacute;ireann saying that people are not entitled to a school bus where they are going to the closest school that serves them and their ethos and that of their families.  More and more children have to get into cars when buses are available because they choose a school that fits with the family's background, whether religious or non-religious.  This must be dealt with urgently and for this September.  We cannot wait another year. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-24a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021052400002#X00300"><p>I thank the Minister for Justice for finally signing the regulation to facilitate the progression of the Stardust inquest.  I have spoken many times in this House on how the financial eligibility test was causing huge distress to families and how they were being asked personal information down to the type of car they drove.  The signing of the regulation has lifted that distress and the families can now focus on getting justice for their loved ones.  However, it was deeply disappointing to see that the regulation is so narrowly defined that it precludes any other families who might find themselves in similar circumstances.  It is clear that when the Civil Legal Aid Act was drafted in 1995, the Minister at the time accepted that there may be incidences where a case is in the broader public interest and there should be scope for waiving the financial criteria.  For more than 25 years this intention in the Act has never been given effect and on news of the regulation being signed last week, I was contacted by a number of families who have been denied civil legal aid at inquests.  They wanted to know if the regulation would apply to them.  Imagine their disappointment when I had to inform them that it would not, that the income threshold for accessing civil legal aid remains so low, combined with the fact that the housing assistance payment is counted as income, it effectively excludes most people from qualifying for civil legal aid.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I believe the State is in contravention of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as the failure to enact a financial waiver for civil legal aid is, effectively, denying people the right of access to the courts.  It is unfortunate, therefore, that the Minister for Justice had an opportunity to fix this last week but instead opted to keep access to civil legal aid as restrictive as possible.<br/><br/>Despite commitments given by the Minister with responsibility for equality, Deputy O'Gorman, that period products would be provided for free at direct provision centres, an article in today's edition of the<i>Irish Examiner</i>highlights that a recent survey conducted by Homeless Period Ireland found that more than 50% of respondents still have to pay for products.  Also of concern in the survey is that even when the products are provided for free, women and girls in many cases have to ask an employee for them.  Surely it is not too much to ask that products just be available as needed.  I hope we can get a statement from the Minister on how he intends to ensure that direct provision centres follow up on the instructions he gave to direct provision centres, which we all welcomed.  He might also outline how he intends to safeguard against direct provision centres that invoice the Department for products but are potentially still charging residents through the points system.</p></speech>

I have a family member in his position, so I understand the devastating impact of the condition.</p> <p>On Wednesday last, I attended a powerful Oireachtas briefing with Relatives for Justice on the tragic killing of two schoolboys, Gavin McShane and Shane McArdle, in 1994.  They were murdered by an unmasked gunman while they played a video game in an arcade.  The young boys were targeted because they were in an area of Armagh city frequented mainly by Catholics.  I was really moved by the contributions made by the members of the McShane family, Alana and Caionn, who bravely and courageously spoke of the nightmarish 27 years since their beloved brother's death.  They said they remain focused on getting justice for Gavin.  I highlight the campaign the McShane family have been carrying out and I seek the solidarity and support of Senators to get the meeting with An Taoiseach that has been requested by Relatives for Justice.</p> <p>At the briefing on Wednesday, we also heard from John Finucane MP, who experienced the murder of his father, Pat.  He spoke of the legal knock-on effect of the failure to carry out any meaningful investigation after the deaths of the two boys.  It was shocking.  He stated that the criminal investigation opportunities were limited from the outset due to a failure to collect necessary evidence.  He went on to state that in the case of Gavin's death, it was one family and their supporters against the system, and that the legal arrangements are now in the civil area and are exploring the opportunity for an inquest.  My heart breaks for the McShane family.  Gavin's death is one of many needless tragic murders and we need to do all we can to bring justice to the brave families who seek it.  John spoke of the detailed report on Gavin's and Shane's deaths published by Relatives for Justice in 2019, which highlighted multiple deficiencies in the subsequent Royal Ulster Constabulary murder investigation.  Relatives for Justice would be a very important and viable witness for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice.  It should be given an opportunity to present the findings of its 2019 report.  It is important that Relatives for Justice secures the solidarity and support of Senators in order to get a meeting with An Taoiseach.</p> <p>On the diverting of the aeroplane in Belarus, I fully agree that action must be taken against Belarus.  I agree also with the sanctions taken against Russia over Crimea.  Nevertheless, when sanctions are suggested against apartheid Israel over the massacre of women and children in Gaza, with war crimes being committed daily, the silence is deafening.  There is considerable injustice in that regard.</p></speech>

It is believed that last year, one quarter of participating dentists left the medical card scheme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As a result of that, there are many towns throughout the country that have very few if any dentists participating in the adult medical card scheme for patients. </p><p>The dental treatment services scheme covers basic dental care like examinations, extractions and two free fillings per year.  Other forms of treatment are possible, provided there is prior approval given by the Department of Health.  In recent years, we have been made aware of the importance of good dental and oral health to other aspects of health so it is vital one's oral and dental care is looked after to the best standard.  Dentists say they have left the scheme because it does not pay them anymore and is actually costing them money.  Unfortunately, the net result is that the most vulnerable, those adults with medical cards, are losing out in relation to dental care and maybe even in relation to general healthcare.  I ask the Deputy Leader to write to the Minister for Health and ask that the Department engage substantially with the dentists to find a resolution.  Many of them are leaving the scheme, resulting in vulnerable adults losing out in relation to dental healthcare.</p></speech>

I engaged, as many in this House did, with people outside the gates of Leinster House.  Last week, along with my Fine Gael colleagues, we had a meeting with the Performing Arts Educators of Ireland, Comhaltas and the Irish dance sector.  Unfortunately, they have been left frustrated and disappointed at the lack of clarity for their industry, which employs so many people across the country.</p> <p>As we approach the reopening of society, with hospitality, sport, gyms and wider sectors reopening next month, they as a sector need to have clarity and they have not had it to date.  They need clarity to perform their lessons and to have summer camps, which are a really important outlet for young people.</p> <p>We have to be mindful as a Government that not everybody wants to play sport, and I say that as a former PE teacher.  Whether one plays a musical instrument, engages in hockey, is involved in arts such as dance, acting or singing, plays athletics or is involved in hurling or football, everybody deserves the opportunity to practice his or her given talent.</p> <p>I ask the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, to the Seanad next week to have a debate on that.  It cannot be left in the ether any longer.  People have to rely on interpretation of guidance that is now out of date in relation to levels of reopening.  They need clarity and they need it quickly.</p></speech>

The first is mental health and the care plan for those over 18 year of age.  Anyone who watched the "Prime Time" interview last week or heard Andrew McGinley this morning on Newstalk will have heard his plea for support of an advocate to those suffering.  I have come across this many times as a foster parent.  One week I could play a vital role in supporting a person under 18 years of age and, as soon as that person turns 18, I cannot gain access to any information.  This is so wrong and we, as legislators, must look again at the vital supportive role that can be provided by an advocate to someone suffering.  We owe it to Conor, Darragh, Carla and all the children who have been murdered due to mental health issues in this country.</p> <p>The next issue is the aviation sector in this country and the butchering of 4,000 jobs by the Government's failure to act and support this industry.  I highlighted in the House in July 2020 the issue of testing at airports.  Travel restrictions in Ireland have been the most stringent of any European country.  The loss of Aer Lingus jobs in Shannon and Cork will be the tip of the iceberg if the Minister for Transport does not deal with this sector urgently.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I call on the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, to come to this House to outline his plans for this sector.  </p><p>I also wish to raise the closure of the Sudocrem plant in Baldoyle, with the loss of 100 jobs.  According to the manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited, the Baldoyle factory will close in 2023 and production will move to Bulgaria.  The plant has been operational since 1940.  Sudocrem, which has been a household staple in Ireland for 90 years is now available in more than 40 countries, with an estimated 34.5 million pots sold each year.  To date, nobody from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has been in touch with the management and staff about this closure.  I find it astonishing that we could allow the manufacturer of an iconic product like Sudocrem, which was developed and manufactured here in Ireland, to close up and waltz off to have the product manufactured in Bulgaria with no intervention by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar.  I call on the Deputy Leader to ask the T&aacute;naiste to engage with the management and staff on what supports are needed to enable the company and jobs to be retained in Ireland.</p></speech>

I want to take this opportunity to thank a number of people.  First, I thank the Deputy Leader who, in consultation with the Leader, made contact on the matter with the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, OPW, Deputy O'Donovan.  I also contacted the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue on it.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for facilitating a Commencement matter when he learned of the seriousness of the issue.  </p> <p>Last week, the Government announced funding of &euro;1.5 million to allow work to commence to alleviate the flooding that was threatening 45 homes and family farms.  One house has been already lost.  I was brought to the area by a local councillor, Laurence Fallon, who showed me the devastation caused by the flooding.  Outdoor sheds and houses were under threat from flood waters.  It is an issue that has arisen at this turlough.  In light of the Government's provision of &euro;1.5 million, which will allow work to commence quickly, it is only right that I would thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue and the CEO of Roscommon County Council, Eugene Cummins, who did huge work on this issue, and local councillors.  It is good news and it shows what can be done through co-operation.</p> <p>I want to also raise the issue of flooding in south Roscommon, particularly around the Callows.  I have been contacted by a number of local farmers who told me that birds' nests have been destroyed because of rising waters.  We are told the weather is to improve but owing to the weather of recent weeks, water levels have risen.  I ask the Deputy Leader to use her good offices to make contact on the issue with the ESB, which controls the water levels  The concern is that owing to water being held up and not released downstream, farmland and bird wildlife in the area is being destroyed.  </p></speech>

I understand it is worth more than the conferences industry.  We all know the impact of weddings on our local economies in terms of the business for venues, caterers, bakeries, florists and hair and beauty salons, all of which services attract VAT at 23%, not 9%. There is a wedding ecosystem.  Ireland is a top international destination for weddings.  It competes with other markets in that regard and had been doing really well in the past few years.  </p> <p>Weddings are not properly classed under the Covid restrictions.  They should be classed as events.  This will be important going forward as part of the recovery.  Weddings are not appropriately catered for under tourism or hospitality.  Not every wedding takes place in a hotel.  They also do not fall under the arts even though live entertainment is part of it.  They are also not accommodated under the business sector, although they have been able to avail of some grants.  As part of the reopening, weddings need dedicated information and guidelines available at one location.  It is important for recovery and planning to avoid the loss of business to other markets and to market Ireland as a destination.  The UK is doing this in respect of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland.  They all provide this information.  It affects the backlog of 30,000 weddings from last year and thus far this year and all of the couples involved.  Wedding planners and the industry are being left to field all of the questions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is an organisation called Wedding International Professionals Association, WIPA, which has started operating in Ireland, that helps in this regard.  The House can imagine the kinds of questions those in the industry have.  Clarity around numbers indoors and outdoors as part of our guidelines is not enough.  They are asking questions about marquees, whether the numbers include vendors and the couple, and whether they can carry out risk assessments based on size like those being conducted in the North.</p><p>I mentioned a figure of 30,000 weddings.  The average wedding costs &euro;32,000.  A destination wedding can cost &euro;500,000 to &euro;1 million.  The cost for a leisure tourist is estimated at &euro;90 per bed night and &euro;300 for a conference, but we do not even measure how much wedding tourists give back to the economy.</p></speech>

We have been told this year - we should have been told at Christmas - that socialising outdoors is the thing to do.  Unfortunately, our capital city is not equipped for that and Dublin City Council seems to be slowing down compared with other local authorities, for example, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, in making provision for an outdoor summer.  Until recently, only six public toilets were available in the city.  Some public buildings have been opened so that their toilets can be used, but there is also inadequate access to public bins.  When the Portobello area was closed down, people simply moved down the street.</p> <p>It is important to have a proper strategy in place for an outdoor summer and to facilitate local authorities and people in socialising safely.  To do this, we must provide access to public toilets and bins, security guards to clear up anti-social behaviour, and seating for people.  There are reports of people sitting on the side of footpaths in pedestrianised areas because there is no adequate public seating.</p> <p>We need to make Dublin a world leader like other European cities, one where people can socialise safely and comfortably outdoors.  This situation has highlighted the stark difference between Dublin, which is a European capital city, and other cities where there are public facilities.  We seem to want to punish people for wanting to socialise, but we must realise that people want to socialise and be with their friends.  We need to provide them with safe facilities in order to do so.</p></speech>

It is National Epilepsy Week and 40,000 people in this country suffer from epilepsy.  As such, I support his request for a debate on this important matter and I hope the Deputy Leader takes it on board.</p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of antigen testing, which I also raised last week.  On Thursday, the European Parliament came closer to opening up our skies by agreeing a digital green certificate, central to which is the use of rapid antigen testing.  However, we know that the Department of Health has a major reluctance to introducing antigen testing.  We learned over the weekend that, since September, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had been trying to encourage the Department of Health to introduce rapid antigen testing in meat factories, but that has still not been done properly.  The Department's reluctance was on public display at a recent HSE press conference.  Will the Government subscribe fully to the digital green certificate or will we opt in partially?</p> <p>The Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, is meeting today to encourage the Government to roll out rapid antigen testing.  I support the pilots in that endeavour.  IALPA will bring a plan to Government Buildings, and I hope it is supported.</p> <p>Is the Department of Foreign Affairs speaking to the Department of Health?  Will we be able to subscribe to the digital green certificate or will we be curtailed because the Government and officials in the HSE have taken a dislike to antigen testing?  We know that it is not a silver bullet and that it has a 50% effectiveness rate, but the European Commission has said that it has a major role to play, as has the Ferguson report, which was commissioned by the Department of Health.  What is the reason for the reluctance?  It could be rolled out in maternity units to let in partners.  It could be rolled out across hospitals.  Rapid antigen testing has a major role to play and it would be remiss of us not to follow through on that.</p></speech>

I seek a commitment from the ESB to provide funding of &euro;500,000 to develop a community facility in Lanesborough, County Longford, following the closure of the Lough Ree power plant.  I recently met Kieran Mulvey, the just transition commissioner, who has put proposals to the ESB to provide that funding for both Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.  Yet, the ESB has not made a commitment to do so.  I ask the Deputy Leader to write to the ESB encouraging it to support the measure that has been put forward by the just transition commissioner.</p> <p>I support the comments by my colleague, Senator Cummins, regarding the arts and dance sectors.  It is important for the Minister to come into the House to discuss the arts and dance sectors, as well as other sectors covered under her wide portfolio, including the broader tourism and hospitality sectors.  There are a number of issues in that respect, including the representation of members of the hospitality industry on many of the tourism boards.  That needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>Under the current Covid-19 resilience and recovery plan, the guidance for the dance sector is identical to sport, yet all outdoor sport, camps etc. are going ahead.  In response to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister stated that indoor team group sports, including dance and exercise, would be considered in late June.  It is far too late for the summer season to consider that in late June.  Many of these organisations are dependent on summer camps etc. to fund their organisations and keep themselves viable.  I echo Senator Cummins in asking that the Minister would come into the House and give an earlier decision as to when indoor camps can go ahead.  The issue also arises with respect to swimming.  The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, could perhaps address both areas.  Swimming is another major issue and no commitments have been given with respect to swimming camps or lessons.</p></speech>

Having experience of epilepsy in my family, it is important that we talk about it, share information and make sure people have such information. I say fair play to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis.</p> <p>I note a significant lifting of restrictions across the Six Countries this morning and wish people there a safe return to work and to a wide variety of activities and amenities.  I encourage them to enjoy it but to do so safely and in line with the continued guidance and advice.  In that spirit, and I certainly do not want to get into any mud-slinging because it does not warrant it, but I am concerned about remarks from the Minister of Health in the North about the failure to get a response from the Minister here, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, regarding a meeting he sought more than two weeks ago in terms of strategising, all-island engagement and joined-up messaging.  We are at a point where we are moving ahead, thankfully, but we are at different junctures, North and South, in terms of vaccine roll-out and the lifting of restrictions.  It is crucial now, more than ever, that Ministers, North and South, are effectively joined at the hip to ensure the steady, navigating out of the current restrictions and difficulties we face.  It is not good enough to hear about this via the airwaves or that our Ministers are communicating via the airwaves.  While official level engagement is welcome and important, we are at a point where both Ministers need to engage regularly and crucially on this important issue as we move forward.</p></speech>

When the Government announcement is made this week on the arts, we need to have clarity.  We also need it for dance and drama classes.  It is not acceptable that there is a scramble after every announcement by those in the arts sector to find out the details of what has been announced.  I ask the Leader to communicate with the Government directly to ensure clarity in the announcement later this week.</p><p>The Cathaoirleach will be aware that I have regularly raised the question of Belarus in this House.  Currently, as a result of the actions of the tyrant Lukashenko, over 30,000 people have been detained unlawfully in that country.  This is the equivalent of the population of a town the size of Navan.  Dissent has been crushed.  This weekend, we have seen the hijacking of an EU airline flying between two EU capitals.  A journalist, Mr. Roman Protasevich, has been detained unlawfully.  In addition, his girlfriend, Ms Sofia Sapega, has also been detained, purely for the crime of being his girlfriend.  This is state-sponsored piracy.  I welcome the strong response by the Taoiseach, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs but this is a defining moment for the European Council.  If it does not take strong action, any journalist or anyone who wishes to dissent could be victim to this sort of state-sponsored piracy.  What is going on in Belarus is no longer acceptable.  I ask that some of our MEPs, who have been cowardly enough in the European Parliament to oppose or abstain from agreeing to sanctions against Belarus, be called out because this is about European values.  The actions we now take are at a defining moment for Europe.  I ask that a very strong message be sent from these Houses.</p></speech>

There are human rights issues on several levels in the news today.  We have heard about the human rights violations in Cork, where a young girl has talked about living in an abandoned place that people forgot about.  A member of the Traveller community has spoken about the absolutely unacceptable circumstances in which Travellers are being asked to live in Ireland.  When I hear about Gaza, I worry that it might again become a place that people forget about.  While there is a ceasefire, the death is continuing.  The coronavirus testing laboratory was bombed and the head of medicine was killed so we will see the consequences rolling on.  We have seen the effects of the policies of eviction and annexation, which still must be challenged.</p> <p>I add my voice to the condemnation of the appalling state-sponsored hijacking and piracy involving an attack on a journalist.  Sadly, across the world journalists are increasingly becoming front-line defenders.  It is unacceptable.  Sanctions should be issued.  I note that we have a record of issuing sanctions in some cases.  Regarding Russia, sanctions related to occupied Crimea and goods from there were found last year by the European Court of Justice to be legal within our trade law, under the Rosneft ruling, because it was found that it is a matter of public policy when human rights are being violated.  I still have not heard an explanation as to why the occupied territories in Palestine are different from occupied Crimea and why the same principle of public policy and human rights does not apply.  I need to hear that rationale because we have not heard it.  I ask that action be taken.</p> <p>Let me refer to an area where there is no ambiguity on trade policy.  We can choose to suspend intellectual property profits for a period to allow global access to vaccines.  I welcome the European Parliament's vote for a waiver of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS.  Some 62 countries have now signed up for a waiver but Ireland and the EU Commission still stand in the way of something very meaningful that they could do for human rights and global public good and health.</p></speech>

At the heart of that awful lot more must be accountability.  People must be held to account this time because if they are not, as sure as night follows day, it will happen again and again.  This will take the international community.  I welcome President Biden&rsquo;s recent remarks, however belated, but America was silent at a time when we expected more from them less than a week ago.</p><p>Many people are waking up today terrified and petrified that their highly sensitive medical information might be publicly disclosed and published, or that they might get a phone call from someone representing the Dark Web trying to engage them in the black market.  Stress levels are heightened by the fact that some people may not want their employer to be aware of the sensitive nature of their information.  No one should be disadvantaged from illegally obtained information.  There should be a mechanism put in place to protect citizens.  This would deter those in the black market and the vulnerable people from deliberately succumbing to the black market for fear that their employer may hear something about them that was utterly sensitive, private and confidential heretofore.  I will bring this matter up with the justice committee but one way of stamping out the black market is if we can put protections in place for affected citizens.  If it is proven that an employer found out information solely and exclusively through illegal means, they ought not be able to use it to move against a vulnerable employee.</p></speech>

This is national epilepsy week and there are a few things that can change the lives of people with epilepsy.  The epilepsy association is calling for free travel for people with epilepsy and for reasonable accommodation during examinations.  They appear to be very practical requests.  We should be lobbying for the provision of free travel and reasonable accommodation, as well as a few others.  I am sure we all got the briefing from the epilepsy council.</p> <p>I also want to highlight, as Senator Higgins has, the issue of Traveller accommodation and the awful findings of the report this morning.  There is something incredibly wrong with the fact that children are living like that in this country.  There are children, adults and families - our citizens - living like that.  No matter what their background or whoever they are, these are our citizens and they are living like that.  There is something innately wrong with how we provide accommodation to people from the Traveller community.  It is not working.  We must have a different approach to how we accommodate the Traveller community.  Travellers have been identified as an individual race.  We must change things.  We must look outside and talk to the people who live the Traveller life and see how we can best facilitate their backgrounds.</p></speech>

If one looks at the sale of those slots in 2016, one can see that Oman Air bought one early slot from Kenya Airlines for $75 million.  That is one slot.  We have 23.  This is hugely valuable and we must make sure they are secured if we are going to support the industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-24a.97" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1642" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021052400002#FF00200"><p>I thank all of the Members who contributed to the Order of Business.  Senator O'Donovan kicked off with a very personal story of his diagnosis of epilepsy and his journey to reach the point he is at today.  I congratulate him for speaking so eloquently about a really important issue.  I have no doubt that his words will help many others.  He raised additional awareness of the condition today at the beginning of National Epilepsy Week.</p> <p>I note that Senator McGreehan raised a similar issue.  Certainly consideration should be given to the issues raised by that particular organisation, that is, free travel.  Given what Senator O'Donovan said this morning, the impact of losing one's licence, particularly somebody living in a remote rural area, is very significant.  </p> <p>Senator Kyne raised the issue of planning delays.  Deputy Cowen has brought a piece of legislation before the D&aacute;il on that issue.  It is a problem affecting many communities.  Senator Kyne outlined many of the planning issues across the country.  He touched on Athenry as well.  We all agree that people have a right to engage in the planning process and raise concerns and objections.  However, where this stymies development and impacts a huge community because one person has an issue with it, it is a problem that needs to be rectified.  A debate on this issue would be worthwhile.  </p> <p>Senator Craughwell congratulated Major General Maureen O'Brien on her appointment as military adviser to the Secretary General of the UN.  On behalf of the House, I extend my congratulations to her for reaching such a high-level position and representing her country and the Defence Forces with distinction.  I wish her well in that role.  Seeing her reach those heights is fantastic in terms of being a role model for women across the country.  It is no mean feat to get to that position.  </p> <p>Senator Craughwell also raised the issue of the ongoing difficulties in the Defence Forces, as did Senator Wall.  It has been accepted that our Naval Service has gone beyond being fully operational.  The smoke and daggers exercise that has been going on for the past number of years to try to pretend that it is fully operational has passed.  It is fully on show for all to see.  Our maritime interests are significant.  We are an island nation.  The need to protect our seas is really important in respect of so many aspects of the country but we do not put the resources into our Defence Forces that we need to.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of retention of personnel.  We are at a stage where the brain drain is so significant.  We have lost immensely qualified and experienced personnel and it will take years to build up that level of expertise in the Defence Forces.  We cannot simply hire people with these skills from the private sector.  We must grow that experience and expertise within the organisation organically, which are then passed down through the ranks and generations as they come through.  We have lost some of our best people and it will take us years to come back from that.</p> <p>The work of rebuilding our organisation needs to start now.  With the recent cyberattacks, we have seen that the Defence Forces is the first place we go to so we expect it to perform to the best of its abilities as if it is being fully resourced and supported when it is not.  Far from having a lean organisation, which is what was attempted, we have starved the Defence Forces of resources and it is now a skeleton organisation.  We cannot expect it to do what the country needs it to do without it being properly resourced.  I hope the Department will take note of the challenges that have arisen, particularly from the cyberattack on the HSE, and how much our country relies on our Defence Forces at a time of need.  </p> <p>Senator Wall raised the issue of the GDPR and the impact on elected members at local authority level.  I had a quick look at section 40 of the Data Protection Act.  It does not specifically require written consent from the constituent.  It does require consent so I suggest that it might be a good Commencement matter in respect of which the line Minister could provide clarity because as elected Members of the Oireachtas, we do not require written consent from constituents to act on their behalf.  I see no reason counsellors should be treated any differently.  Uniformity of approach across all local authorities is something we should be demanding rather than merely asking for.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Pauline O'Reilly raised the issue of Belarus, as did Senators Black and Malcolm Byrne.  I join with all of my colleagues in utterly condemning that act of aggression towards the European Union.  It is remarkable and almost unbelievable that an EU airline - an Irish airline - would have a demand that its aeroplane land while going between two European countries, with over 170 passengers from 12 different member states on board.  A journalist was kidnapped from that plane and is now in detention.  We do not know his current status or his state of well-being.  I hope that he is okay, and his girlfriend Sofia as well.<br/><br/>I echo the calls from everybody in this House that the EU Council needs to act decisively this evening and needs to show its teeth, because it will be a toothless organisation if it allows this type of behaviour.  It must not go unpunished.  The comments of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs have been extremely strong in this regard and in demanding EU solidarity.  I know a number of our MEPs, although not all, as Senator Malcolm Byrne pointed out, have been very strong in calling for decisive action from the European Union and calling for solidarity from all member states to support significant sanctions against the Lukashenko regime.  It is long overdue.<br/><br/>Senator Pauline O'Reilly also raised the issue of maternity services.  As she knows, it is an issue close to my heart and I am in ongoing consultation with women across the country.  Even as recently as yesterday, a woman contacted me who is attending at Mayo University Hospital in Castlebar and she has been told she will not have her partner with her until the very late stages of labour.  There is the ongoing issue around what constitutes labour and at what point the partner is permitted.  It is something we are going to have to continuously raise in this House until the matter is resolved.  We have to let the women of Ireland know they are being listened to, that their representatives are working on their behalf to get this issue resolved and that we care about the distress and trauma that it is bringing on them, their families and their babies as well.<br/><br/>Senator Pauline O'Reilly also raised the issue of the school bus scheme.  I am not fully <i>au fait </i>with that issue but I gather from what she says that if, for example, people choose to go to an Educate Together school and it is further than the closest primary school, they are not being facilitated.  That is wrong.  It is a matter that must be raised with the Minister for Education.  I will bring that to her attention and to the attention of the Minister for Transport.<br/><br/>Senator Boylan raised the issue of the Stardust inquest and of the Minister for Justice signing the regulations.  The Senator has been strong on this issue and she has raised it many times.  It is only right and proper that the regulations have been signed.  I take on board the comments she made in regard to civil legal aid.  The income threshold is very low and in this circumstance, which is quite exceptional, something should be done for the families of victims so they can access justice and participate in the process.  Otherwise, what is the point?<br/><br/>Senator Black brought to the floor of the House the murder of Gavin McShane and Shane McArdle, and I thank her for that.  To be told that the evidence gathering at the time was not sufficient to allow a proper investigation is very difficult for the families.  There are questions to be answered.  My condolences to the families on what has been a very long and difficult journey for them.<br/><br/>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of adult medical cards in regard to dental treatment.  If dentists are leaving the scheme because it is not financially viable, that needs to be addressed.  We have come a long way in this country in regard to oral health.  We now realise it is part of physical health whereas, heretofore, we perhaps had not placed as much value on that.  Everyone should have access to basic dental care and that is something we would all agree with.<br/><br/>Senator Cummins raised the issue of the performing arts sector.  He made the very important point that while we have placed a far greater emphasis on getting children back to sport, not every child plays sport, but they may do arts, drama or music and that is equally as valuable to a young person as sport.  Perhaps our priorities have not been quite balanced in that regard.  I will bring those remarks back to the Minister.  Senator Carrigy raised a similar issue.  It was also pointed out that those sectors have been in an extremely challenging position.  I commend Senator Malcolm Byrne for consistently, almost on a weekly basis, raising the issue of the arts sector, which has often been left at the back of the queue when it comes to getting clarity as to when the sector will reopen.  I know the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is working hard on that issue.  We will seek a debate with her, given several Members have requested that she come before the House to discuss the reopening of the arts sector.<br/><br/>Senator Keogan raised the issue of mental health and brought to the floor of the House the really tragic case of the McGinley family, in particular Conor, Darragh and Carla.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Their father has rightly raised the issue around mental health services.  There seems to have been a gap in care for his wife and the tragic consequences of that are evident to all of us.  Senator Keogan is right to bring that issue to the floor of the House.</p><p>The Senator also raised the issue of aviation and 4,000 jobs.  The Senator used the expression that the Government was butchering 4,000 jobs.  I remind the Senator that in March of this year, only two months ago, she stood on the floor of the House in a health debate and questioned why the United Kingdom was not on the mandatory hotel quarantine list.  The Senator went on to say that all non-essential travel should be subject to mandatory hotel quarantine.  The Senator seems to have changed position somewhat on that particular issue in a short space of time, and not for the first time either.</p><p>Senator Murphy raised the issue of the Office of Public Works works taking place in Roscommon.  I commend the Senator on his work on this issue.  I know flooding is a significant issue in his community and the Senator has legislation coming forward on the issue.  I know personally how hard the Senator has being working on the issue not only during this term but during the previous term as well.  It is great to see some movement on that.  I note the issue raised by Senator Murphy around water levels and the loss of bird life and farming land.  That is a significant issue and it should be raised directly with the ESB.  The water levels must be addressed in that regard.</p><p>Senator Currie raised the issue of the wedding industry.  It has come up on many fronts as it is an industry that employs many people across multiple sectors.  The Senator was right to point out that it does not really come under any particular heading, whether tourism, hospitality or business.  It touches somewhat on all those sectors.</p><p>There is also a real human impact on the many couples who are waiting to tie the knot and who have planned a certain day but may not get the day they have planned.  That is not to be under-estimated.  There is a call to give greater clarity and support to people working in the industry and those couples who want to make those important plans within their families.</p><p>Senator Moynihan raised the issue of an outdoor summer in Dublin and how we should have been told to be outdoors at Christmas.  I am unsure whether that might have been as feasible as suggested in Ireland.  Certainly, the Government is working hard to provide assistance to businesses that are reopening.  There are multiple grants in place, including grants for outdoor seating.  When we come through Dublin city centre we can see the significant works ongoing to put in place additional space for outdoor seating for the hospitality sector.  This has been welcomed by many restaurants in the city.  Work is under way.  We look forward to having a busy summer socialising together outdoors, if it has to be that way.  That is fine and we will do our best on that front.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the lifting of the restrictions on Northern Ireland.  I wish everyone who is reopening in the North the best.  It is a great day for them and we are not too far behind them.</p></speech>

It is great to see it happening.  We are not too far behind.  I wish all the businesses well and I hope it goes well.  I imagine it will.</p> <p>The Senator raised the issue about the Northern Ireland Minister of Health awaiting confirmation from the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, about a meeting.  I do not know the ins and outs of that particular correspondence.  I have no doubt the Minister is probably up to his eyes with the cyberattack but that the meeting will happen at the earliest opportunity.  The Senator is right to bring it to the floor of the House.</p> <p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of Belarus as well as the theatre, arts and hospitality sectors.  The comments of Senator Byrne relating to Belarus were strong and we all share the sentiments raised.  The question of 30,000 people being detained needs to be addressed.  We cannot simply brush it under the carpet or express outrage every few weeks and then move on to the next topic.  I hope that the events of yesterday and the meeting this evening will mark the start of real change in tackling this issue and standing with the people of Belarus to deal with it.</p> <p>Senator Higgins raised the issue of human rights on many levels.  Senators Higgins and McGreehan raised the issue of the report from the Children's Ombudsman relating to Traveller accommodation.  It should be a cause for concern for every citizen that any child in this State is living in those conditions.  I listened to the reports this morning about rodent infestation, lack of sanitation and children having increased respiratory and skin difficulties.  We should be ashamed that any child in this State is living in those conditions.  There is an onus on the local authority in the area to do something about it urgently.  I have no doubt those conditions are not isolated and indeed are replicated in many parts of the country.  I hope the local authorities throughout the country are taking note and assessing the services and accommodation they are providing to citizens in their local authority areas.  Moreover, I hope that we can make real and meaningful change on this.</p> <p>Senator Martin raised the issue of accountability in Gaza.  I too was unimpressed, if I can put it that way, with the weak response of the United States at the UN Security Council in respect of Gaza.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Rumblings would suggest that President Biden did have a word behind the scenes and that ultimately the ceasefire did come about.  Certainly, it took far too long, too many lives were lost and almost 70 children lost their lives in those 11 days.  Let us not forget that and that the situation is far from over.</p><p>Senator McGreehan raised the issue of epilepsy and Traveller accommodation.  She spoke very well about the need to address the ongoing lack of decent treatment of the people in the Traveller community.  I hope that the report will start some changes on that front.</p><p>Senator Ahearn raised the issue of rapid antigen testing.  Earlier Senator Ardagh raised the issue, which she has done for quite a number of weeks, of rapid antigen testing not as the only means but one of the ways to open up the aviation sector.  I believe that has merit and cannot see why we are not using antigen tests.  I know that if one gets a negative test it does not mean that one does not have Covid but the test is an extra layer of security and would assist in getting things up and running.  I was unaware of the value of the Heathrow slots, which was an important point to make.  That is the history that our country has in terms of its links to the United Kingdom.  The loss of those routes would cause significant damage to the Irish aviation sector.  There is no doubt that the sector has had a difficult time and many jobs rely on the industry.</p><p>Senator Ardagh also made an important point about the EU digital certificate that we have signed up to.  It is my understanding that the Government is fully committed to signing up to the certificate and its implementation.  We have a six-week period to implement the scheme.  We are eager to implement it as fast as possible and, hopefully, before six weeks in order to get things up and moving as quick as we can.</p></speech>

We are making decisions in respect of a &euro;50 million fund, with potentially &euro;29 million of State liability in a 30-minute debate which is inadequate.  It would be appropriate and I hope that the Minister of State will indicate that he does intend to produce a report to deal with how these various environmental and social criteria have been integrated.</p> <p>I am looking for transparency and information on this because it is one instrument in a suite of stimulus measures as part of recovery and resilience strategies across Europe.  The Parliamentary Budget Office, which I note is not a left-wing think tank but a neutral office, issued a report which points out that Ireland has some of the lowest levels of parliamentary engagement in respect of the financial instruments on recovery and resilience strategies.  In fact, of the four ways that there might be for parliamentary engagement on recovery and resilience strategies, Ireland was one of only seven countries in the 24 which said "No" to all four.  We are, therefore, one of only seven countries that have failed to have parliamentary oversight on one of the largest and most important sea changes and moves towards stimulus, investment and recovery.  According to the Parliamentary Budget Office, we may still barely have the option, although the time is tight, to have parliamentary and committee debates on our recovery and resilience funds.  These are all options that other countries have taken up.  That is why I am concerned and it is not sufficient that we simply have 30-minute debates on financial instruments going through with everybody hoping, as I do, that there is a good fallout and that good things happen for SMEs on the back of it but without thought and discussion about how it can be most effectively done and without the insight that parliamentary colleagues on all sides might be able to offer in respect of these issues.</p> <p>This loan guarantee scheme is one part of a suite of measures.  I am putting forward this idea to make the point on transparency partly because I am calling for greater transparency and discussion on all of the measures and how they join together with all our other collective goals, for example, those goals identified at European level such as biodiversity, climate, environmental risks, cultural heritage and labour standards.  We are allowed to incorporate these issues.  I understand that they may come in indirectly via the European eligibility certificates and criteria but I feel we can do more here in Ireland and there is an insight that we can give here.  Can the Minister of State address and accept amendment No. 1 and perhaps indicate if he plans to bring forward reports and further information on these issues?  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</p></speech>

It is important that people know about it and what it means to them.  It will mean we can extend the loan scheme to small businesses, farmers and fishers.  It extends the loan guarantee period to at least 2022.  It is being rushed through because of the advice from the Attorney General that we need to complete this before the end of June in order that businesses can access it.  It is focused on helping who have been dealing with Brexit in particular.  I always favour anything that helps the small to medium enterprise sector and of particular interest to me are primary producers, of which there are many in my county and many other rural counties, as well as anything to help farming and fishing communities, which are struggling.</p> <p>There will be need for clarity on the maximum interest rate, which might encourage people to take on the loans.  It is important that the Government supports credit unions in this too.  I have spoken here on that before.  They know communities and small businesses best.  Their service is probably better than that given by most big banks, unfortunately, now that more and more banks are closing down and switching to services by machines instead of personal service.  I welcome the Bill but seek clarity on interest rates and a commitment that the credit unions be part of the roll-out.</p></speech>

I want to flag an issue that I have encountered.  I will not name it, but I refer to a business involved in the hospitality sector across several counties which has made applications through similar schemes, namely, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, future growth loan and the Covid credit guarantee scheme.  The business was refused by two banks for the schemes.  It appealed it to the Credit Review Office, which found in favour of the business and instructed the banks to provide the loans, yet the banks have still not done so.  That seems to defeat the purpose of our schemes and what we are trying to do here as a Government, which is to provide finance to small and medium enterprises.  It also defeats the purpose of the Credit Review Office.  If it is there, it must be able to make recommendations that are actually implemented.  I seek reassurance from the Minister of State that we can actually tackle this.  It is very important, particularly as we come out the other side of this Covid crisis, that we ensure the businesses that are viable and are determined to be such are supported and that we as a Government get what we want implemented by the banks.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could touch on this matter in his reply.</p></speech>

It is a key point.  This is one measure in a whole range that have been brought forward in the last year to support businesses.  This one in particular has been changed to include the farming and food processing sectors, which is very welcome but the key thing is to be able to get access to it.   The banks need to be held accountable for that.  I encourage the Minister of State to keep engaging with the Minister for Finance on that in order that we ensure it gets down to people.  From an agricultural perspective, farmers are never slow to borrow money to invest in their land and put money back in.  After the challenges of Brexit in recent years, they are still willing to take risks and invest locally.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Minister of State to engage on that.</p><p>As for the shortness of the debate, I can understand the frustration.  We had a good debate on Second Stage of the Bill last week.  The key is to get the scheme to businesses and the people who need it as quickly as possible.  We have sought a motion in the regard for the Bill's earlier signature by the President.  I understand Senator Higgins's concern but the key is to get the money to people quickly.</p></speech>

In many cases, businesses are dying because they cannot get access to funds, and it is critical that they get that finance.  We had a good debate on Second Stage of the Bill.</p> <p>In regard to Senator Higgins's amendment, which seeks to include social and environmental criteria, I had presumed from listening to the Second Stage debate that the Bill was sufficiently broad such that these types of issues would be included in any event.  I thought there would be no need to include a provision specifically for social and environmental criteria because they would be covered in the broad thrust of the Bill.  I hope the Minister of State will outline that to us.</p> <p>There is no doubt about the way farming has gone and many types of business are moving in that direction.  They want to do their best under the new environmental regulations and so on and to be environmentally friendly.  I had hoped that would be included in any event in the broad sense of the Bill, and that the types of project that Senator Higgins has in mind, which she did not specify but we all know what they would be in some cases, would be included and the financial institutions would treat them favourably.  One would have thought that if they did not do so, there would be a place where businesses could appeal their application.  I hope the Minister of State will confirm that to us.</p></speech>

She tables a similar amendment to most of the finance-related Bills that come before the House.  I can understand, to a certain extent, where she is coming from in arguing that we need this type of reporting.  As someone who works in the SME sector, I have some understanding of how difficult and restrictive it is at the moment to access credit.  Having tried to deal with the mainstream banks for the past 14 months in negotiation terms, I know it is very difficult to go through this process.</p> <p>The greatest impact that we in the SME sector have is social.  It is about the jobs we create in communities.  The types of business at which the Bill is targeted have a very significant impact on society.  As we deal mostly with agricultural primary food producers, I do not dispute that the environmental issue is of importance, but surely the funding will be used on environmental schemes, so one would think a combination of issues will be at play.  While I accept the thrust of Senator Higgins's amendment, as I do every time she tables such an amendment, I am not in a position to support it.  As someone who comes from that sector, I know about the frustration of trying to access credit at the moment.  Credit is critical now from an agricultural point of view because of Brexit, not to mention Covid.</p></speech>

Many SMEs have shown incredible adaptability and have been making very significant changes.  They are transitioning and we need to support and fund that.  One of the problems is that people often get loans only for what they are doing already rather than what they can and want to do, and that is something we need to examine.</p> <p>We also need to examine our procurement policies and how we reward SMEs that enter new areas.  That will be part of the just transition funding that we need to consider.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In response to colleagues, I point out that my concern is SMEs.  I include social enterprises in that.  I believe the Government does as well, though I do not know to what extent social enterprises have benefitted from these schemes.</p><p>Another concern is that, without the proper scrutiny, too many of these schemes go to the bigger, surer thing rather than the SME or the company that is trying to do something new.  We saw that in Home Building Finance Ireland.  That is why the public wants more scrutiny of these areas.  That was meant to go to small developers, yet &euro;200 million of it went to developers who advanced purchase agreements with investment funds.  We saw the visa dividend scheme, the funding that comes from cash for visas, which is questionable in itself.  More than 20% of the money from that scheme is going to investment funds.  There is a concern about SMEs getting squashed out.</p><p>Another concern I have and speak about in my amendments to this Bill is the inclusion of mid-caps.  Why not have this relatively small scheme with &euro;29 million liability and &euro;50 million in total just for SMEs?  Mid-caps, according to the definition on the Department's website, have &euro;1 billion to &euro;2 billion in assets.  Let us go after the SMEs and maybe even have a scheme specifically for the "S" in "SMEs", the small businesses and enterprises which have done incredible work at local level and been key to the community.  I agree they have a social and community development role and I worry that we have had numerous schemes which we have underwritten and we have heard from people across the House that, when it comes to the crunch, SMEs are still being denied funding and loans.  These schemes are framed too widely and are not delivering for the core businesses that make up the fabric of the communities and that are on the main streets of towns across Ireland.</p><p>I am looking for more thought and engagement, including engagement on all of these schemes with everyone across the Parliament and the Oireachtas.  Will the Department please stop keeping all of this in-house and simply presenting it to us for rubber-stamping?  Can we have more scrutiny of all of these schemes as they come through so insights can be given and we can have more debate?  Specifically, the recovery and resilience strategy certainly needs to come before these Houses.</p></speech>

My understanding was we had spare slots.  There was plenty of time left.  I certainly did not cut the debate short and I spent all the time here answering everyone's questions, including about credit unions.  There was nobody ducking and diving.  This is very much being scrutinised and I am happy to do it.</p> <p>This is similar to debates we had last July and September for very good reason.  We are trying to support SMEs.  As Senator Casey said, SMEs are under an awful lot of pressure and this will get finance to them.  The criteria around size relates to an EU definition of small and medium businesses.  We went through the statistics last week of the companies drawing this or funding like this down.  More than 6,500 have been approved for the credit guarantee at the moment and 4,500 have drawn it down.  They are the companies we are trying to reach. </p> <p>My reading of the proposed amendment is to put in stricter criteria which will not, in my view, assist companies who need help today because of Brexit drawdown funding.  I understand the necessity for us to work with all our SME community around the social and environmental agenda, the labour agenda and many others but this relates to borrowings.  They are borrowing and paying it back, with added costs.  This is not the State investing in a company or giving away a grant.  All that has strong criteria.  The criteria used here for our part of the guarantee, the 24%, is the exact same as the European Investment Bank, EIB.  Our national bank criteria are the same as the EIB portion.  It is 56%, 24% and 20% here.  We are facilitating companies with their borrowings to invest in businesses that are active and open today.  Social enterprises are allowed once they show they are impacted by Brexit.  If Senators have concerns about any particular one, I ask them to give us a shout and I am happy to tease it through with them.</p> <p>Senator Cummins asked about a company I am not familiar with.  If the Credit Review Office reviews it and says it should be lent to, that normally happens.  I would be happy to look at that case because that is what the Credit Review Office is.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I made the point last week in the House that we did not have the credit guarantees or credit review offices in place quick enough after the last crash.  They came into force in 2013 and they were very beneficial.  I am glad they are in place.  I thank the Houses for their support over the last year in getting these schemes put in place quickly.  They will be monitored.  We will keep an eye on where the funding is going, as currently happens.</p><p>Reference was made to Housing Building Finance Ireland, HBFI.  I dealt with a number of small builders who would not have been able to build houses without that funding.  It did what it was meant to do, in most cases.  It is probably at a later stage that companies go off and enter into agreements, leases and so on, not generally when they are drawing down funding.  I am happy to debate the house funding issue, but it is not part of this Bill.  This Bill does not deal with investment properties or houses.  There is a miscommunication around what is needed in housing to make it happen.  We need to have a really long conversation about that, because there is a lot more to the story than some people in this House are trying to make out.</p><p>On the point raised by Senator Garvey, the maximum interest rate is 3.75%, but the majority are under 3%.  As I discussed with Senator Ahearn in this House last week, 94% are under 3%.  Credit unions are open to this as well.  I did address the issue last week, but I think the Senator had left the House.</p></speech>

My concern is around the SME focus.  I understand from engaging around this issue, that it relates to agri-businesses on the Border and so on, but I am concerned still about where the loans will go.  It relates to the point I made earlier about whether our SMEs are getting the loans.  In other words, will small businesses get access to these loans?  I am also concerned that the mid-caps which can access this funding are companies which are based in Ireland or have a branch in Ireland.  My concern - this relates to an area where we have not seen risk analysis - is in regard to the creation of reasonable expectations.  The Minister of State will be aware that in parallel with this debate is the constant conversation about the introduction, potentially, of investor protection mechanisms under which companies may seek compensation in regard to changes in policies, one of the grounds for which is that they have been invited, offered an inducement, given a support or been encouraged to engage in an area of investment.  I sought to have the following addressed, but I do not think it has been included.  How do we ensure that those for whom we are underwriting loans are clear that that should not be considered as constituting a reasonable expectation if, for example, the policy in the area of agri-business or industry in which they are involved changes over the next two, three, five or ten years?  That is my concern and it is part of the general piece which is the lack of risk analysis in regard to the schemes.  I want us to have stimulus schemes and for us to be able to support businesses.  I agree with, and called for, a stimulus support in 2008 when we went for the austerity model of engagement.  We need stimulus, but the risk that we create if we bring in potential investor protection mechanisms, which could allow for suits in regard to compensation where an expectation was created or seen to be created by the State having offered support, is an unnecessary risk.</p> <p>Again, one of the problems with the investor protection mechanism and the investor court system, ICS, that is potentially being brought in under the Comprehensive and Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, is that they make something good - our support to business - a potential liability for the future.  That is not something that I want to see happen.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->With colleagues on the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, I have had correspondence with the Department.

The purpose of the Bill is to extend the period of application of certain emergency provisions that have been critical to the Government's response to the pandemic.  The emergency provisions that are to be extended are in the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 and the Health (Amendment) Act 2020.  As the House knows, certain emergency provisions in all these Acts expire on 9 June next.  The Bill I am presenting to the House today provides that the operation of the emergency provisions concerned in these Acts be extended for an initial period of five months to 9 November next.  Any further extensions are limited to a maximum of three months at a time thereafter and must be approved by a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>These legislative provisions are very important for breaking the chains of transmission of Covid-19, protecting public health and life, and protecting critical services, including our health service, education and other priorities.  The Members of this House will know the trajectory of the Covid-19 disease continues to be precarious, and there are still considerable uncertainties regarding what measures may be needed over the course of the rest of this year.  Our response is premised on the need to preserve and protect public health by slowing the spread of the disease, reducing its impact on us and limiting its impact on our society and economy.  The public interest is best served by having the provisions in these Acts available for times when they are required for the protection of public health.</p> <p>Vaccinations offer significant protection at an individual and population level but it will be some time yet before there is a sufficient level of the entire population fully vaccinated.  Moreover, while there is emerging evidence regarding the efficacy of available vaccines, information is incomplete regarding the impact these vaccines will have on transmission, the length of vaccine induced immunity and the potential impact variants may have on vaccine effectiveness.  In general, international agencies are continuing to advise a range of non-pharmaceutical measures are used until there is a greater understanding of the role of vaccination on the course of the pandemic.  We have made significant progress in suppressing the spread of this virus but we are not out of the woods yet.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I will now outline some key provisions of the Bill in more detail.  The Bill is divided into five sections.  Section 1 amends section 2 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 to allow for an extension of operation of Part 3 of the Act from 10 June 2021 to the later date of 9 November 2021, or a date specified in a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas under new a subsection (6), to be inserted into section 2.  Subsection (6) provides that each House of the Oireachtas may pass a resolution from time to time to extend the date of operation of Part 3 for a period that does not exceed three months at a time.  The Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 inserted sections 31A, 31B and 38A into the Health Act 1947.  Section 31B allows the Minister for Health to make an affected area notice.  The State as a whole has been deemed to be an affected area since 7 April 2020.  Section 31A provides for the making of regulations for preventing, limiting, minimising or slowing the spread of Covid-19 to a region where an affected areas order applies.</p><p>Section 2 of the Bill amends section 1 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 to allow for an extension of operation of Part 5 of the Act along the same terms, with the effect that Part 5 of the Act is extended from 10 June 2021 to 9 November 2021 or the date specified in a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas, with the Houses being able to pass a resolution from time to time extending its operation for a period that does not exceed three months at a time.  The emergency measures in the public interest Act amends the Mental Health Act 2001 to adopt a cascading approach to the role of the independent consultant psychiatrist and the role of mental health tribunals, which review orders involuntarily detaining patients, whereby pre-Covid measures are retained in the Act but, where it is not possible to operate these measures safely, there are provisions in place to ensure the review of detention can continue remotely in the current public health emergency.</p><p>Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill provide for the same amendments and terms of extension for the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 and the Health (Amendment) Act 2020, respectively.</p><p>The Health (Amendment) Act 2020 provides for the making of regulations to prescribe penal provisions in the regulations made under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 to be fixed-penalty provisions and dwelling-event provisions.</p><p>The Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with statutory enforcement powers in regard to licensed premises and registered clubs to ensure adherence with public health measures on premises where alcohol is sold for consumption on the premises.</p><p>In considering whether this Act should continue in operation, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys, consulted the Garda Commissioner.  Commissioner Harris advised that if the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 were not extended beyond 9 June 2021, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not have a clear lawful basis for entering a licensed premises to address breaches of the Covid-19 regulations.  Liquor licensing legislation would not provide a power of entry for the specific purpose of addressing breaches of Covid-19 public health regulations.  </p><p>I compliment the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on its work during this national effort.  It has continued to take a measured approach at all times.  It continues to engage, educate and encourage, and to enforce only as a last resort.</p><p>Section 5 of the Bill provides for the Title of the Act as the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill 2021 and provides that the legislation shall come into operation on 10 June 2021.</p><p>As I have said before in the Oireachtas and elsewhere, these powers do not sit easily with me.  However, I believe they have been required up to now to support public health measures and advice and guidance.  The Government wants to lead our return to normality as quickly as possible, but also safely.  We want our society and economy to return to normal functioning as soon as possible but we do not want to have to go backwards.</p><p>I welcome this opportunity to provide an overview of the key provisions in the Bill and I look forward to discussing the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage and to listening to colleagues' contributions during this Second Stage debate.  The Government believes ensuring the continuation of these measures is the responsible thing to do.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

Some colleagues will recall passing the Bill in March 2020.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some of us were also Members of the previous Seanad and I remember passing that Bill with a very heavy heart.  It was outlined that the powers contained in it were vital to protect the population of this country.  They were vital and we have seen their necessity.  They are serious powers and that is why we are back here.  It is right and proper that we are debating their necessity.  When we passed that Bill originally, I remember there was a great sense of foreboding in the air and people were fearful, distressed and upset.  The mood has changed completely since that day.  I was in Malahide this morning to grab some coffee.  People were out and about, talking to one another.  There was a great sense of joy in the air because things are opening again.  While we look forward to further announcements this Friday, it is necessary that we pass this Bill because, as the Minister has outlined, we are not out of the woods yet; far from it.  We must continue to protect public health, life and our critical services.  I believe the powers contained in this Bill are proportionate.  The Minister has outlined that some will last for five months and others for three months and that we will be back in the House debating whether they are necessary at that point.</p><p>I hope we can have a respectful and positive debate today.  I hope colleagues across the House will engage in positive discussion on this Bill.  When we discussed other health measures in the Minister's presence previously, sound bites and hysteria were generated in this Chamber.  Members were trying to get national or local headlines and that was not appropriate, given the seriousness of the situation.  We are all working hard here and must respect one another&rsquo;s motivations.  We must be positive and be leaders, not only in this House, but within our communities.  People have sacrificed an awful lot and will continue to do so but we must not give in to the latest fad, be that to shut down the country, open up the country, let people come in, not let people come in or whatever is floating in a given week.</p><p>I know the pressures people are under.  I am talking to them every day.  The aviation industry is hugely important to people in the constituency in which I live.  I have friends, neighbours and colleagues who work in the airport or who work for airlines and they have been devastated by this.  I have every faith that the Minister is doing the best for public health.  We are vaccinating an enormous number of people.  Almost 300,000 people were vaccinated last week, which is incredible.  We all know of friends, family members, neighbours and colleagues who have been vaccinated.  I have not been lucky enough yet to get the call, but I look forward to the day that happens.  The older and more vulnerable people in our communities have received their first and even their second dose.  We are getting there; we are not there yet and these powers are necessary.</p><p>I appeal to Senators not to take potshots today or to drum up empty sound bites just to get on to their local radio.  This is too serious and too essential.  We should be leaders who show an example to people how we can all co-operate and speak positively on this matter.  I know Senators have specific issues with this Bill.  Let us engage in a positive manner and not launch personal attacks on anybody.  Let us come out of here with a positive message and provide leadership for the country.  It is what people are calling out for.  I thank the Minister for the leadership he has shown and the tireless work he and the Ministers of State have contributed.</p><p>I commend everyone involved in the vaccination schedule, as well as the swabbers at the testing centres.  I had to bring my six-year-old daughter for a test a number of months ago as she was a close contact.  The compassion and good humour shown by those who dealt with her there is something that will always stick with me.  Anyone who has had the experience of going for a vaccination or having a test will commend all those involved in the system.  I thank them and all the healthcare workers.</p></speech>

The purpose of this Bill is to extend the emergency provision contained in a number of pieces of emergency legislation enacted at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Without this extension, the emergency provisions would expire on 9 June 2021 and along with them the emergency powers to circumscribe the rights of individuals and impose penal sanctions on them.  This legislation was enacted under the aegis of expedience given the nature of the Covid emergency.  Since then, there have been consistent calls for an in-depth examination of the human rights implications these measures carry.  Has the Government conducted any human rights-proofing analysis?  If not, there must be some extraordinary excusing circumstances to render this analysis impracticable.  The simple fact of the matter is that no such circumstance exists to preclude such an analysis.  The truth is that the Government simply did not bother with human rights proofing as if it was some unnecessary, insignificant or inconvenient matter.  The result is that this Bill is being hastily passed through the Oireachtas with mere lip service paid to the human rights implications it will have - <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  How often must we be corralled into the same flawed parliamentary process that has distinct and troubling overtones of executive over-reach?  Those on the other side of the House can deny it but their actions speak louder than their empty rhetoric.</p><p>The Bill essentially has the effect of allowing for an extension of five months to 9 November 2021 of all emergency provisions and will provide that they may be extended by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas for up to three months at a time.  The open-endedness of this Bill that permits a further three-month extension means that these measures may be permitted by law on a continual and potentially perpetual basis.  This can no longer be said to be a necessary or proportionate response.  To impose such measures where they are not necessary will result in a loss of trust in Government, which is of great importance during a pandemic when such public trust in Government is vital to ensure compliance with the public health advice.</p><p>Therefore, I propose that the Bill be amended to extend the emergency powers only until 30 September 2021.  I propose to amend the following sections.  Section 1 should instead provide that Part 3 continue in operation for a period beginning on 10 June 2021 to the end of 30 September 2021.  While I recognise that the enactment of legislation to allow for these emergency powers was in the past arguably necessary, I can no longer accept an extension beyond 30 September.  The extension of these powers in the absence of a robust analysis and compelling evidence to the contrary is not demonstrably necessary and by virtue of that, disproportionate.  Therefore, I philosophically object to the continuation of the harshest and longest Covid-19 measures across Europe and the curtailing of the fundamental rights of the citizen.  Article 28 of the Constitution of Ireland only permits limitation on individual rights in times of war and armed rebellion.  There is no express provision for limitations to be placed in times of public health emergency such as the Covid-19 pandemic.  In the absence of any express constitutional permission, legislation restricting the rights of the individual is subject to a requirement of necessity and proportionality, as laid down by the courts in Heaney <i>v.</i>Ireland.  Under Article 15 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the measures limiting human rights must come within a permitted timeframe of human rights law.  Under this framework, the Government is required to take measures only when they are necessary.  Each measure that restricts or limits a right must then satisfy a test of proportionality.  In a democratic society, the restriction must be necessary to meet a pressing need and must be proportionate to a legitimate aim to be achieved.  The aim here is the prevention of the spread of Covid-19 within the community thereby preserving public health.  As it is required by such obligations under international law and the decisions of the Irish courts, a further restriction on individual rights through this proposed extension is subject to a requirement of proportionality.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I submit that this proposed extension can no longer be satisfied.</p><p>I also want to raise the issue of the rollout of the vaccines in pharmacies.

Time will tell.  It has been challenging and difficult, and nobody has got everything right, but, by and large, everything that could be done has been done.  In the fullness of time, we will have a review of all of the measures.  There will be a set of learnings and that set of learnings will influence how we do things in future pandemics.</p> <p>I want to make clear that this country has performed very well when we look at other countries.  Sadly, too many people have lost their lives, but many more would have lost their lives had we not taken the measures we took.  It is with a heavy heart, and I am sure the Minister shares my view, that we come before this House having to renew these emergency measures.  It is not something that any Government wants to do, not something any Minister wants to propose and not something any Oireachtas wants to pass.  Unfortunately, however, in order to protect human life, to protect our citizens and to ensure the most vulnerable are protected as much as possible, it is necessary. </p> <p>Nobody foresaw that this pandemic was going to last as long as it has lasted but that is the reality.  There have been very many variants, including the UK variant that caused the deadly third wave in January, and we now have the Indian variant, which was very well described by Tony Holohan as being a black cloud on the horizon of a blue sky.  We need to acknowledge when things have been got right, and things have been got right.</p> <p>I am delighted that I will be going back to County Clare on Wednesday to get the vaccine.  I registered on the portal on Friday of last week, when the turn for my age arrived, and I got a text yesterday.  A turnaround of two or three days is pretty remarkable.  Some 300,000 vaccines were administered last week, so the commitment of 250,000 a week for the month of May has certainly been achieved and surpassed.</p> <p>I commend all GP practices throughout the country.  They administered the vaccines with huge efficiency and with great empathy, and put hope and joy into people's arms.  It was great to get the feedback and to hear the stories of people going to their GP to get their vaccinations.  The GPs played a very important role in the administration of the Covid-19 vaccine, as have the amazing men and women who work in the vaccine centres throughout the country, who have done phenomenal work as well.</p> <p>It has been said and it is the case that the vaccine is the only way out of this pandemic.  However, it is important to reiterate also the public health advice on the simple things like, where possible, working from home, keeping one's distance and staying 2 m apart, and observing hand washing and the various hygiene measures.  I suggest that some of those measures, in particular in regard to sanitising stations and so on, are here to stay because it is good public health practice.  I would like to see public buildings, supermarkets, hotels and so on continuing to provide sanitation stations for people to sanitise their hands when we return to normal.  Certainly, one of the learnings from this pandemic is that sanitising hands reduces the spread of infection.</p> <p>We have all seen the benefits of working from home.  Having people work remotely has played an important part in suburban areas of the cities but particularly in rural towns.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a man I meet in Lahinch every morning as he gets a newspaper and a scone.

That means an extra &euro;5 per day is being spent in the local shop.  It is helping with the carbon footprint and quality of life.</p><p>I support the Bill before the House today but only with a heavy heart because it is necessary.

I will begin by saying something about the vaccine roll-out.  I am starting to hear of more and more friends and family getting their calls to get a first jab.  Some are getting a second jab.  There is certainly a sense of buoyancy about the place.  People have more pep in their step.  My vaccine seems a million miles away but I am sure it will come.  When I was hobbling through town today, I saw more light in the air literally and metaphorically.  It has to be commended that people are feeling a little more optimistic.</p> <p>I will outline some concerns with the process of the Bill.  The measures have been extended to 9 November.  There has been a question as to why it could not have been extended until September.  There are proposals for 80% of the adult population to be vaccinated by June.  International travel may resume in August.  In the context of talking about proportionality, it seems to be something of a jump to extend these powers until November.  I can certainly see why September might have seemed more proportionate.  I imagine there will be amendments on that point tomorrow.</p> <p>The Minister has said these powers do not sit easily with him.  That is probably an apt description and I do not imagine they sit easily with many people.  The principles of the right to protest, freedom of religion and private and family life are all fundamental.  They are important issues and I would have preferred more rigorous analysis of the proportionality of these regulations and the impact on these three areas.  That certainly would have given the public more confidence that we were not simply steamrolling things through.  It is important to have meaningful debate around these things.  We only have one hour and 45 minutes today.  There will be one hour available tomorrow to try to get through amendments.  As we have been in this state for 15 months, I am unsure whether it is as much of an emergency as it was in March.  Consequently, more time could have been given to this.</p> <p>There probably will be an amendment coming on one point.  There should be a hard date set in stone for review before any extension.  A human rights analysis of these restrictions is important.  If we have to go to November, then so be it but what if we are genuinely looking at an extension three months after that?  We do not know how this virus will go.  I hope to goodness that it is on the way out the door.  However, this should not be renewed without vigorous debate and scrutiny.  We need to ensure our rights are respected and that the most basic tenets of our democracy are protected.  I would like to hear a commitment from the Minister for a review of how these laws are being implemented and how often they have had to be implemented in a report or whatever form it may be in order that we have a clear understanding if it appears, heaven forbid, in October that we have to extend the measures for a further three months.  It will be important to get a commitment.  If we are going into October and looking at extending the measures for a further three months, then we will be in a dire state.  There will be provision to extend the measures from time to time without the appropriate clause.  As has been said in the House, I do not believe we will be extending these until the end of time.  I hope we will not be extending them until the end of time but it would be great if we could provide for some sort of implementation or review should we have to go beyond November.  That is important.</p> <p>I am somewhat concerned about the time period given for this.  Pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, was waived.  It is disappointing that the pre-legislative scrutiny was waived for such extraordinary legislation.  The Joint Committee on Health has people from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and mental health advocates appearing before it tomorrow.  We could have worked out the timing better to have heard from these representatives, had more time been given to this.  I believe we are doing this backwards to some extent.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> We only got the briefing on Friday evening.  To be fair, it was a great briefing and the officials were very helpful to us but we only got it after the deadline for amendments had passed so I feel like we are chasing our tail a little bit on this.  Everyone recognises the real seriousness of the situation.  We are not out of the woods yet by any means.  Even though there is lot of optimism in the air people really want to know that we, as legislators, are giving this Bill the full legislative once-over scrutiny and robust debate that it deserves and it feels like we are doing things in a slightly awkward order.  As we said, we recognise the need for very serious measures and hope that we do not ever have to stand up here again extending them at any point.</p></speech>

May I extend my heartiest congratulations to him, on the heroic work of the HSE, and the Irish Government, on the incredibly efficient way the vaccination programme is being rolled out.  I got my jab the other day in the Punchestown centre.  The centre had a wonderful atmosphere and there was a stunningly efficient roll out.  I am told that Kildare efficiency is replicated or near replicated throughout the Republic of Ireland and are we not so fortunate?</p><p>I must disagree with the Minister in respect of extending the draconian emergency powers all the way to November.  We have been through one of the most challenging times in all our lifetimes and this pandemic has tested everyone.  Initially, it was fear that engulfed us and many feared death as a dangerous virus circulated within communities.  We tuned into a media that was dominated by death and case number statistics.  At the beginning we knew that science struggled to understand and overcome the threat.  We retreated into our homes.  We stayed apart even though it went against the grain of who we are as social creatures.  We kept a stony distance from the people we love.  A series of immensely mentally draining lockdowns sucked the heart out of our nation.  A control culture evolved and we lost basic freedoms to move and socialise.  We have lost people, families have been shattered, businesses have been destroyed and the health service has been stretched like never before.  We must never forget the heroes of the hour: all those on the front line.</p><p>Optimism, fellow Senators, has returned and hope has been harnessed by the wonders of scientific genius.  The vaccination programme is instilling even more hope.  Hope is breathing again.  We may soon have much of our old lives back but now we need to renew, reinvigorate and reenergise.  We need to renew our spirit as a people and look forward.  We need to rebuild.  We need to move away from a sense of being controlled to finding our feet again.  We will need to assess what we have been through and learn from it.  We need to move away from draconian restrictions and reclaim our sense of freedom and autonomy.  We must harness hope and let optimism triumph over pessimism.</p><p>Optimism and optimists are never afraid of failure.  They keep trying.  Pessimists are governed by a fear of failure.  They prefer to be in control and are always prepared for the worst case scenario.  We have to live again and the last thing that we need is a plan for a future, theoretical curtailing of our basic freedoms.  Let us move on and bask in the glory of success.  Let us plan for doomsday scenarios when we feel them approaching but not in anticipation of them possibly happening.  With an approach like that we allow the possibility of hope to die.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties said about this legislation, particularly about extending the most draconian measures all the way to November:</p> <blockquote> 	This is one of the most draconian pieces of legislation our State has ever seen.  And while most of us accept it was necessary to rush it through in March 2020, June 2021 is a different time.  We have learned lessons and we must apply those lessons in law.  We cannot set a precedent where government can continue to grant itself powers like these without first meaningfully bringing them before the people - via our elected representatives in the Oireachtas. </blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P.

He has taken a few hits.  He has probably switched out of the media but he is a resilient man and a listening person.  It would be churlish of people who have criticised him in the past not to have the gumption and good grace to accept that, as things go, fingers crossed, he is presiding over a most efficient vaccine roll-out.  It is important to give credit where credit is due.  This extension to November, however, will dampen hope.  I ask the Minister to look at it.  The Bill is only on Second Stage.  Is it really necessary to kick these draconian powers all the way to November?  I think that could damage our hope, and I say this in the context of the most successful vaccine roll-out and where we expect to be with the high percentages come November.  I would not mind coming in here in a few months' time, but a <i>carte blanche</i>until November?  I know it is only a theoretical button but it is such a frightening button of draconian power to press.  It does not sit well with me, and we should do this as reluctantly as possible.</p></speech>

Since we last had this debate, an extreme wave of Covid-19 in January caught people by surprise.  Thanks to the sacrifices made by the public and the valiant efforts of our front-line healthcare workers, we have brought this virus under control.  The vaccine roll-out is, after a rocky start, as people have said, under way.  The cases, though not as low as we would like, are stable.  With the vast majority of older and vulnerable people vaccinated, many ask why we still need these regulations in place.  The third wave taught us that we must be prepared to act quickly and decisively when the virus is resurgent.  There are no guarantees that a fourth wave could not happen.  The recent surge in India reminds us that we must all remain vigilant to mutant variants.  The continued global pandemic - and it remains a pandemic - presents ample opportunity for further mutations.  While there is an epidemic anywhere, especially in large nations such as India which are heavily integrated into the global economy, we all remain at risk.  Despite progress on vaccination programmes the world over, the risk of vaccine-resistant strains grows.  Much of the global south will not be vaccinated until well into 2023.  The State must stand prepared to act decisively to keep mutant strains out and, if they slip through, to clamp down and eliminate them.</p><p>This underscores the importance of maintaining and enhancing our mandatory hotel quarantine system.  It is the most important defence in the fight to keep variants of concern at bay.  It is integral to maintaining the very welcome easing of restrictions into the summer months.  We all want this to happen and we all want this relaxation to stay.  We all support the public health measures and interventions which allow us to keep the virus under control but we cannot support this Bill in its current form.  We support the provisions for further extensions, where necessary, of emergency legislation.  The Government must retain the authority to act swiftly in the face of threat, but we cannot support a <i>carte blanche</i>for a Minister.  We especially cannot support an unquestionable extension of emergency powers without parliamentary oversight into November of this year.  We will propose a Committee Stage amendment to limit the current extension to 9 July.  As we near that date, the provisions of this Bill would allow the Minister once again to seek the Houses' approval for an extension.  If that is the public health advice, no doubt the House will oblige, but the Minister cannot continue to issue decrees with far-reaching consequences for society, workers and businesses and for the rights of the individual without parliamentary scrutiny and debate.</p><p>The last time we had this debate we told the Minister that when he deems it necessary to implement harsh restrictions, it is his and the Government's obligation to seek the approval of the Oireachtas.  It is the sole right of the Oireachtas to legislate and to enforce restrictions on constitutional rights in the interest of the common good.  It is not for the Government, a select and unrepresentative group of these Houses, to make that determination alone.  The level of co-operation with the Opposition seen during the very early stages of the pandemic does not exist today.  The Minister was given extraordinary powers in good faith by Members of this House.  To push the sunset clause out until 9 November is to push it too far.  It would be appropriate for the Minister to return to the House in late June or July to extend the emergency powers once again if necessary and to explain the context in which they are needed.  This has to be part of an overall strategy which people can see and which shows how far we are from exiting from these types of restrictions and the sort of yo-yo situation about which people talk.  We do not see such a clear plan coming from the Government yet.  In the absence of this plan, we have a Government which seeks these powers for a further six months.  That is a step too far for us, not because we do not want restrictions or do not believe public health measures should be implemented but because we believe in scrutiny and accountability.  To that end we will also introduce an amendment which would require a statutory instrument issued under the emergency legislation to be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas within two weeks of its issuing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This would give the Minister and Government scope to act swiftly and decisively, where necessary, and to require, as is right, that they explain these actions to the Houses.  We need notice from the Minister when he publishes statutory instruments and member of the public deserve explanations and answers in circumstances where they have questions.  We find out that statutory instruments have been introduced when they go up on the website.  Not even the health spokespersons for Opposition parties are given a heads-up.  We get no emails from the Department to say that the Minister is going to publish a statutory instrument which will be available online or to offer us a briefing or clarification on it.</p><p>None of that to which I refer happens.  This is not the first time we have said this to the Minister.  I say all of this in good faith to him.  I want this to change.  Transparency is, after all, the Minister's friend.  The more information that we have, the better equipped we will be to respond to queries from people outside this Chamber and to reassure them that the measures he is taking are proportionate and appropriate.  As part of our way out of the pandemic, we have to ensure that our defences and capacity in a number of areas are built up.</p><p>When the very tragic wave of infection in India began, it took from weeks to almost a month for it to be added to the mandatory hotel quarantine list.  The variant emerged and then, eventually, quarantine was put in place.</p><p>We need to act on an all-Ireland basis.  While the Minister seeks emergency powers in these areas, he needs to co-operate more with his counterpart in the North.  We heard just this morning from the North's Minister, Robin Swann, MLA, that he has been seeking a meeting with our Minister for two weeks.  I am not satisfied that we have got cross-Border testing and tracing right.  There is a significant amount of work to do in that regard.  I thank the Acting Chairperson for her indulgence.  I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity this afternoon to address in public the remarks made by the North's Minister, Robin Swann, this morning.  It is a cause of genuine concern and upset that Ministers have not been engaging as closely as they need to be at such an important time.</p></speech>

I will take two minutes and she will have three.</p> <p>The Minister is very welcome.  I commend him on all the phenomenal work that he has done on the vaccine.  I was in and out myself in half an hour, which was brilliant.  I thank the Minister for that.</p> <p>I co-signed some of the amendments tabled to this Bill by Senator Higgins with my colleague from the Civil Engagement Group, Senator Ruane.  These amendments are vital if we are to extend the emergency provisions from 9 June to 9 November.  The rationale for extension is understood because we are still in a position of uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 crisis.  Although the situation looks to be improving, it is volatile and could deteriorate quickly.  Due to that potential outcome we need protections.</p> <p>As a result of the extensive powers given to the Government under the Act, it is appropriate that the Oireachtas should engage in regular and detailed scrutiny of the legislation because, up to this point, the degree of scrutiny afforded has been neither detailed nor regular.  I am concerned about this matter.  I do not think it is reasonable for the Government to propose that only one hour be given to the debate on Committee and Remaining Stages.  Parliamentarians from both sides, Government and Opposition, have engaged in good faith with proposals which aimed to mitigate the spread of Covid-19.  The majority of Deputies and Senators recognised the necessity of the laws which have been passed in the past year.  The Department must recognise the gravity of the laws which the Oireachtas is being asked to renew.  It is quite clear that one hour is not enough time to deal with the amendments to the Bill, which renews drastic public health measures across six items of legislation.</p> <p>Before I finish and hand over to my colleague, I thank the Seanad Office for accommodating my request to have the submission of amendments deadline postponed until I and the other members of the Joint Committee on Health had an opportunity to be briefed and to ask questions about the Bill.  Senator Higgins will now provide the details of our response to the Bill.</p></speech>

It was not, in fact, this Seanad but the previous one, the 25th, that passed the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act.  This is the first time that this Seanad has had the opportunity to scrutinise that legislation but that opportunity is being deeply curtailed by an inadequate period for debate and in the absence of proper pre-legislative scrutiny.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There were lengthy debates of previous Bills as they came through in the last Government.  There is a reason this Bill is being debated now, rather than a resolution.  It was anticipated as it was important that there would be a hard sunset point, not simply one where things could be renewed by resolution.  We are skipping the normal scrutiny of legislation, not having the usual kind of oversight and transferring from the Oireachtas substantial powers to the Minister, powers that a Minister would not normally exercise by statutory instrument.  We have given the Minister the power to do more than he normally would by statutory instrument.  Anyone looking back on the debates will see the then Ministers, Deputies Harris and Coveney, speaking on the sunset clause and how there would be chances for future debates, and that they wanted to allow one extension in order to deal with an emergency scenario but that the extensions would not be infinite.  People have talked about November.  My main concern is that as this Bill is currently worded, these powers could be extended until 2027 because it allows three-monthly renewals by resolution.  Yes, that is the House deciding as a resolution, but it is not the same as pre-legislative scrutiny.  It puts us in the position of all or nothing.  It is as though we cannot talk about the bath water or change it without throwing out the baby.  It is literally saying to us that each time one is for or against emergency powers rather than seeking insight from Members of the Oireachtas as to how the legislation might be improved.  Senators McDowell and Ward, among others, have already pointed out ways in which the legislative drafting could have been improved in these powers.  It is vitally important if the Minister asks us again to skip through the process and hand powers over - this is about trust, the public's trust-----</p></speech>

Not in our wildest nightmares did we think that we would still be here still discussing it and extending sunset clauses.  I am on the record as saying that the legislation was draconian at the time, and it is still.  No one is happy that our lives are being micromanaged at a very personal level and so many of us are being effected but no one is happy that the coronavirus is taking over all our lives, all over the world and we do not know where it will go.  At one stage last summer we thought it was under control but we never thought we would be in a fourth wave.  With the emergence of new variants and a serious surge in Limerick, we do not know where we will be in a few months.  It is with reluctance that Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting the legislation and the extension of the sunset clause.  The Minister should take on board Members' remarks about returning to the House and letting us have some sort of input into ways the legislation might be improved.  We have such great talent in the House, it would be remiss not to take the contributions on board.</p> <p>I congratulate the Minister on his vaccination programme.  It hit the 300,000 mark last week.  I do not think we ever thought we would get to that.  My mother, the person for whom I had most concern, has been vaccinated and I am glad she has received her second vaccination.  We hear of more and more people getting vaccinated.  It is wonderful and the programme seems to be working.  Saying that, there is more the Minister can do in his position.  Earlier, I said that we need to look more seriously at rolling out antigen testing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On Thursday, the European Parliament passed a proposal on the use of the digital green certificate.  Antigen testing is central to the roll-out of that.  As the Minister will be aware, however, some officials in the Department and the HSE are reluctant to go with antigen testing.  We all know it is not a silver bullet and that it is only 50% effective, but when the rest of Europe is happy to get on board with antigen testing and use it as an efficient too, it is not good enough that we are not doing likewise.</p><p>We read in the newspapers at the weekend about the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine contacting the HSE with regard to rolling out antigen testing at meat factories.  Over the course of four months, the Department has tried to persuade the HSE to facilitate antigen testing but it has never happened.  The HSE has never given a proper response as to why it is so reluctant in this regard.  Pilots are outside the gates of Leinster House today seeking the rapid roll-out of antigen testing, which is something I support.</p><p>I am curious to hear the Minister's take on antigen testing.  Is he, along with his colleagues in Cabinet, committed to the digital green certificate initiative?  What dialogue has he had with his counterpart in the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure this issue will be meaningfully examined?  We are all aware of the draconian powers before the House but, as my colleague stated, we want to be ambitious and to hope for the future.  Part of that hope is about foreign holidays and having a few days in the sun.  People want to be cautious, however, and antigen testing plays an important role in that.</p><p>So many of our elderly, including my mother, were so rigid in following the guidelines and stayed at home for the entire period.  Many are still reluctant to leave the house despite having been vaccinated.  As a State, we need to do something to thank our elderly for looking after themselves.  Perhaps there could be an initiative within the Minister's Department to let them know it is safe to be out and about.  I have spoken to people who are so down and do not see a future.  It is really upsetting to hear.  We need to thank our elderly and give them something back, although I do not know how that could be done.  Perhaps a survey could be done on how we could give back to those who looked after us in the past.</p></speech>

From the word go, he has been in a very difficult position and we now see the fruits of the labour in which he has been involved over recent years.  Many Senators mentioned the vaccination programme and there is no doubt it is tremendously important, as I have seen with my parents.  My mother got her second dose on Saturday and the vaccine has transformed their lives.  Vaccination is beginning to reopen society and is working.</p> <p>It was in that light that many of us earlier met members of Recover Irish Aviation, the group of pilots who attended outside Leinster House in what was a very impactful and reasonable demonstration and request.  Many of the restrictions that are in place here are no longer in existence in many other countries throughout the European Union or the wider developed world.  Obviously, there are other countries that have severe problems and simply do not have access to vaccines, and that is another day's work.  In countries such as those in the European Union and the United States, however, progress has been made.  Some of the pilots who spoke to me earlier had this morning arrived from New York, which is now behaving normally.</p> <p>In the context of the progress we are making here and the different place in which we find ourselves from where we were when these Acts were originally passed, is there space to take a more pragmatic approach to the restrictions that are in place, examining measures such as rapid antigen testing?  One of my sisters had a baby two weeks ago in Switzerland, and my other sister, who lives in London, was able to travel to see her having passed just an antigen test, and no problem has arisen as a result.  That facility, however, is not available to Irish residents who wish to travel outside Ireland, and there is something we can do in that regard.  There is an economic pressure on the aviation sector in particular.   It is the gateway into and out of this country.  As a small island off the coast of Europe, we must continue to engage with aviation and allow it to reopen in the best and safest way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This legislation is technical in essence.  I respect the reason it has been brought to push further out the sunset of 9 June.  However, that date did not come as a surprise.  We knew it was coming.  It was a hard stop in respect of the legislation.  It is somewhat frustrating for us in this House to find ourselves once again in a situation where this legislation comes with very little opportunity for it to be properly scrutinised.</p><p>I know the Bill does not do very much except to extend those dates and I accept it is not a great feat of drafting to be able to do that.  However, I have a problem with the fact that when the other Bills were going through this House last year, we identified reasonable problems and genuine issues with the legislation that has put in place many of the restrictions and the powers for garda&iacute;.  I spoke to the Minister afterwards and was under the impression that when we got another Bill on the subject, those issues would be addressed.  In this Bill, they are not addressed and that is a real missed opportunity.  This is not a complex Bill.  There was room in it to fix sections of the amended Health Act 1947 which simply do not work.</p><p>I remember standing in this Chamber late on a Friday night last year, pushing through legislation so it would be signed by the President the next morning and be in effect for the weekend.  I understand why the Government wanted to do that.  It is entirely reasonable to have the legislation in place.  However, the legislation was largely dysfunctional, and that view was expressed by many Members of this House.  There was an iron-clad, easy opportunity to fix that in this Bill and it has not been done.  That is the most frustrating thing.  I recognise how much the Minister has done to safeguard us all and that his Department has done to roll out the protections and the solutions in terms of the vaccine programme.  That is progress but with that we also had an opportunity to fix the problems we knew were there.  That is a real missed opportunity.</p><p>I do not want to be negative about this.  I think it is necessary.  A Senator referred to the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, saying that this is the most draconian legislation in the history of the State and that is probably true.  It is draconian but this is also the greatest health crisis we have faced as a State.  I understand the need for this legislation.  I may not be happy with it, any more than any other citizen who is restricted by it.  While I will support this legislation, I think there is a real missed opportunity to fix some of the lacunae in the Acts that have already become law.</p></speech>

He has not, as Senator Ward said, been there for years.  He has been there for less than a year and during that year he has had a torrid time.  Cowardly keyboard warriors have used anonymity in the most vile campaign of abuse against him and I totally dissociate myself from that.  I compliment those, including our Oireachtas colleague, Deputy Berry, who are doing the jabbing most efficiently and courteously.</p><p>I fully endorse what has been said by virtually every speaker in this House.  This should not be coming before the House in these circumstances.  This day has been clear for a long time.  It is not a mystery that the sunset clause was coming today.  This amendment is not just to bring things out to next November.  As Senator Higgins said, it is to put in place the power to indefinitely keep re-extending these powers <i>ad nauseam</i>.  It is not a time-limited measure.  When the Houses of the Oireachtas are confronted with the motion to extend, it is a binary &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; with no inquiry as to whether it was good, bad or indifferent, whether the regulations did or did not work well or whether right or wrong things were done.  There is none of that, just vote &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; and the party whips will see it through.  That is what we are voting for today.</p><p>These Houses of the Oireachtas have failed miserably over the last year.  The Oireachtas Commission should not be proud of what it has done.  The fact we are apportioning a couple of hours today and an hour tomorrow to this legislation is a scandal and should be called out for what it is.  There was, before this Government was formed, an all-party D&aacute;il committee chaired by Deputy McNamara.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Its function was to keep the Covid scrutiny issue under control.  It was disbanded and a complete untruth was propagated as to why it was being disbanded, which was that the sectoral committees would deal with the Covid crisis quite adequately and that that was the way to go.  That suits Ministers and, perhaps, the establishment in this House, but it did not happen.  NPHET was never made accountable to that committee; it appeared before it on one occasion or, maybe, two and it was not a pretty sight.  </p><p>We now have to understand that it is our duty to insist on accountability and that we cannot just give a licence or a broad blank cheque to the Government to continue as if nothing has happened.  As a Parliament, we have to get our act together too.  It may be politically unpopular, but that involves acknowledging that every Member of this House and his or her staff are vital workers in the democratic process and should get the jab as quickly as possible so that we can resume normal business and have normal scrutiny of parliamentary activity as the Constitution requires.  It requires a little bit of courage to say that that should be done.  I know there are people who will say that that is jumping the queue, but it is not.  Today, the queue has brought us to the point where we are rubber-stamping legislation and giving an open-ended licence to continue to keep these emergency measures in place.  </p><p>There are many issues that I would like to address today if I had more time.  I would like to address the announcement by the British Home Secretary, Priti Patel, regarding the new immigration and card entry system into the UK and how that is going to integrate with the Irish common travel area.  I would like to talk about how our relationship with the Schengen travel arrangement is going to function.  There are many issues that we are allowing to go undebated and undiscussed in this House.  I would like to know if this legislation is really necessary and, if there is a third or fourth wave, or a new variant, it is ever sensible to say that intercounty travel should be banned.  Is it ever sensible to do that?  I want Professor Philip Nolan to come before a committee and demonstrate to me that banning intercounty travel and imposing a 5 km route is the way to deal with this issue.  </p><p>We should not be doing what we are doing today.  It is wrong and it is weak.  There are no longer leaders and Whips meetings to decide on the business of this House.  That is scandalous.  In the last session, when I and others supported this emergency legislation as first tabled, it was on the basis of a prior discussion as to how much time would be available.  Now, that has disappeared.  I appeal to the Members of this House to make it very clear to the Oireachtas Commission in particular that we want to get back to business.  We do not want this House to be in suspension.  The amendments we tabled on  30 September were to allow this House to come back and function normally and to allow the Government time, if there was a case for an extension, to make it to a fully functioning Oireachtas of both Houses.</p></speech>

The vaccination performance over the last number of weeks in particular is welcome.  For a long time, one would have had a hard time trying to find someone who had received a vaccine, but now we are meeting plenty of people who have had it, including family members and, thankfully, parents.  It is, dare I say it, a shot in the arm for society in terms of providing hope for the future and that is welcome.</p> <p>On the Bill, it is regrettable that it has to be brought forward.  It is a contingency in case it is required.  I hope that over the coming months the necessity for measures like this will lessen.  The vast majority of people have abided by and supported the health measures that have been in place, but, of course, as always, there are people who have not.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Those who have abided by the health measures are looking at those who have not.  It is difficult for the former, because they are seeing people not complying while they are.  That is why regulations such as these are necessary.</p><p>Similar to Senator Ward, I met members of Recover Irish Aviation.  I have received communication previously from the Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, regarding its industry, which is on its knees across the world.  We understand why that is the case, but it needs a roadmap and the early resumption of travel.  The digital green certificate will be an important game changer in that respect but the industry needs to be able to plan and ensure that its pilots have the required hours of training in advance of that date.  It needs to know when that reopening will take place.</p><p>The US is important to us in terms of the economy, our mutual relationship, emigration, and the many visitors from there who come to Ireland annually.  As quickly as possible, we need to consider countries like the US when allowing vaccinated people to enter Ireland.</p><p>Together with the pathway towards resuming aviation that the Minister is planning, the digital green certificate will be important.  I hope he will announce the pathway, or its date, after this week's Cabinet meeting.  The industry needs hope and certainty.  Technical issues also arise, for example, pilots requiring a certain amount of training before they can get back into the skies.  We know the importance of the aviation sector to an island nation.  We know the relationships within the European Union, as well as the competition in the EU's aviation sector.  We also know of our particular relationship with the United States - our historic ties, the number of US tourists that visit Ireland annually and the importance of the US to our economy, including Shannon and the regions.  We need to consider the United States in particular in terms of measures that could be put in place to support the resumption of unfettered travel between both jurisdictions.</p><p>I have great sympathy for the aviation sector.  We have seen decisions being made somewhat opportunistically, for example, the decision regarding cabin crew services in Shannon.  Why waste a good crisis and all of that?  If we lose services, getting them back will be more difficult.  There would be opportunities for other airlines to come to Ireland, provide routes and see the weaknesses in Aer Lingus or whatever else, but the damage that could be done to our airline industry into the future would be significant.</p><p>The pathway will be very important.  Ireland should participate fully in the digital green certificate at the earliest opportunity, be that 1 July, which would be preferable, or the end of July.  I thank the Minister for his work to date.</p></speech>

He has had a difficult time in his first year as Minister for Health and I congratulate him on the great work he is doing under difficult circumstances.</p> <p>Many people have had a tough time.  We in the public service, including the Civil Service, have been well looked after and all of us on the public purse have much to be thankful for, but many small businesses and people in the hospitality and services industries are at their wits' end.  As Senator McDowell asked, when we look back, will we see that something could have been done differently?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have had several debates on Covid-19 during the past 12 months but they have all been in the format of statements.  Perhaps such debates could be structured differently.  When one makes a statement during such a debate at times one wonders if anybody is listening and perhaps nobody is listening.  Perhaps such debates could be structured in a different way to ensure we get something constructive from them.  Senator McDowell has put his finger on it.  We are here at a crunch time to extend the time limit and we have not said whether we learned anything from the past six or eight months.  We should have learned much from the last few lockdowns.  The Government came to the conclusion people are safer outdoors but it was nearly pushing everybody indoors given that people could not travel beyond 5 km.</p><p>I come from a large county which has some of the finest walks in the world but they are miles away from everybody, even within the county.  People could not travel to those areas and one would wonder why.  They would be much healthier in those areas than inside a house.  That is an aspect we should have considered.  Perhaps Senator McDowell was right in what he said about a county lockdown or perhaps a regional lockdown.  Some of the problem arose from what happened in the Minister's county when people from Dublin travelled to the Wicklow Mountains in large numbers and perhaps the small degree of bad press at that stage was part of the problem.</p></speech>

That is an aspect to be considered.</p> <p>I support what Senator Kyne said.  We met pilots and people from the travel industry today.  They are going through a very difficult period.  On one hand that is an issue but, on the other hand, our tourism industry could suffer greatly.  As has been said on numerous occasions, as an island nation we need air transport and connectivity.  Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and all those countries are opening up but we are not opening up to the same degree.  We must have a plan in the short term, as we need to open up by 1 July, certainly for travel.  We can see most of the hotels in Dublin are closed.  The pilots are adamant that antigen testing could be of great benefit to them and to that industry.  It is being used all over the world but the National Public Health Emergency Team does not seem to have any great confidence in it and one would wonder why.  Many Members of this and the other House have put forward that antigen testing should be used more.  I certainly agree with it, even if it catches only one person.  We have the farcical situation where those in the Department of Health are going to the airport to get antigen testing done.  That is what we have been told but antigen testing cannot be used at the airport.  Those are matters we should discuss in greater detail and at more length because, as Senator McDowell said, this House has failed.  It is not only this Bill but several Bills we have debated in detail.  The debate on the previous Bill was guillotined.  I am not in favour of guillotining debate but in some cases it must be used, for example, when there is an emergency but there is no great emergency here at times.  We should consider that aspect.  We should debate such matters in great detail.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and thank him for the work he has been doing for the past year, particularly in recent weeks.  The number of people being vaccinated is phenomenal.  If truth be told, six months ago no one would have thought that would be possible.  If Members from all parties were to be honest, I do not think we would have ever fully believed the HSE could get 3,000 people vaccinated a week.  What is being done is phenomenal.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In my community, Tipperary, I note how excited people are after getting fully vaccinated and the freedom they feel on the back of it.  I commend the Minister on that.</p><p>As most Members said, no one welcomes this Bill.  It is necessary.  Many referred to the extension of the date but no one envisages that the measures will have to be used in the period in question.  They will be used only if necessary.  With this virus, we do not know where we will be any time soon.  We should bear that in mind.  The virus tears up all our plans every time so having some sort of certainty in this Bill is probably the right thing to do, even though it is impossible to welcome it.</p><p>As others said, there are so many sectors under major pressure.  I encourage the Minister to examine the aviation sector as a whole.  The antigen testing route is a genuine game changer for the industry.  It needs to be taken to give people options to open up the industry and travel.  It would make a big difference if we could achieve this, including in respect of Aer Lingus, its routes and challenges.  We heard last week what happened regarding routes from Shannon and Cork.  The routes are exceedingly important and we do not want to lose them.  It is not Aer Lingus which controls the routes; it is International Airlines Group, IAG.  We have 23 routes that are very valuable and we do not want to lose them.</p><p>I wish to raise a local, but important, issue concerning the maternity ward in my local hospital, Tipperary University Hospital, Clonmel.  It is still one of a small number of hospitals that are not adhering to the recommendations and guidance of the Minister on partners.  The hospital's view is based on a very short timeframe for labour.  If my wife were asked about this, she would say labour lasted from the minute she walked into the hospital, or lasted for 36 or 37 hours.  It is devastating for partners that they cannot go in.  When other hospitals are allowing it, it is really frustrating that the hospital in Clonmel is not.  I call on the hospital to relax its measures in line with what other hospitals are doing.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could comment on that.</p></speech>

I respect the need for the Bill and the extension of the dates.  The remarks of Senators McDowell and Burke are to be noted by all of us.</p> <p>The vaccination programme is working.  Today, we heard that 300,000 Covid-19 vaccines were administered last week, and that is to be the case again this week.  It is proof that the vaccination programme is working.</p> <p>The Minister, in his speech, praised members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I still contend that, even at this late stage, they should be prioritised in the vaccination programme.  They are on the front line dealing with people.  I urge the Minister to re-evaluate the position on this.  </p> <p>I, too, commend the Minister on his work.  I join Senator McDowell in condemning the faceless, anonymous trolls on social media.  They have no courage; they are nothing but cowards.  At least the Minister has the courage to put his name on a ballot paper, take an oath of office and work.  I commend him on his work.</p> <p>Healthcare staff at all levels should be commended.  We praise them for their work.  This morning, many of us spoke to and met members of the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association and other representatives of the aviation sector.  Some of us involved in the transport committee have been very much engaged on addressing the need for antigen testing as part of a suite of measures to combat Covid-19.  Equally, with the EU digital Covid certificate, there should now be no excuse for Ireland not to participate, although I know it will, and not to get involved early.  There should be no procrastination over that.  The time for conservatism is over in this regard because if we believe in the science, we should agree that a fully vaccinated person should be able to travel with a negative Covid test and a full vaccine without mandatory hotel quarantine.  If we agree we are European and part of the European community and believe in the EU digital Covid certificate, we should agree that a fully vaccinated person with a negative test should be able to travel and have, to echo the Minister, unimpeded travel access across the EU.  Late July and August are far too late.  It is way too slow, notwithstanding the health concerns over the Indian variant and so on.  The efficacy of the vaccine has been proven.</p> <p>I am now of the age to have had the privilege of going to P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh last Thursday night to get the first dose of the vaccine.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I commend the men and women who worked there last Thursday night.  To those who go on local radio, "Liveline", or elsewhere, and criticise the vaccination programme, I can tell them that be it in City Hall, Cork, or P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh, Cork, the level of activity and positivity present is to be commended.  It was absolutely superb, and I commend and thank the people for that.</p></speech>

It has brought a great sense of relief as people are vaccinated, and within my own family.  We stood outside, where there was a powerful demonstration with pilots.  I think we need to open up our aviation sector.  I support antigen testing.  Obviously, we must tell people how to do it properly.  I believe the Minister has experienced the frustration across the House due to the draconian measures and in the administration of legislation.  We are frustrated and it is regrettable that these measures are so draconian.  I stand in support of the Minister.  The anonymous trolls are quite appalling and cowardly.  Well done on your job.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-24a.211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021052400002#MMM00300"><p>I thank the Acting Chairperson for that.  I thank colleagues very sincerely for their contributions, ideas and challenges which are essential.  It is fair to say that none of us want this Bill.  This is a deeply unwelcome Bill.  I remember sitting almost exactly where Senator McDowell is right now, when I was debating this Bill with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I described the powers as draconian.  I still think they are draconian.  I think this Bill is draconian.  There is no question about it.  Legislation and powers like this should never sit easily with anyone in a democracy and they should certainly never sit easily in our Republic.  We must handle them with the utmost care and caution.  They do not sit easily with me in my Department.  I doubt they sit easily with any Member of this House or the D&aacute;il, nor should they.</p> <p>They are necessary for what will hopefully be a very short period of time, which is why I stand here proposing them and ask the House to support them.  They must be used very carefully.  I have taken notes from, I hope, all speakers.  I may have missed some pieces and I apologise if I have.  There were a number of broad questions, one of which was on the timing and whether 9 November is right.  I think there was a suggestion for the end of June, the start of July, September, November.  I do not think there is a right answer.  There is no correct date.  The date of 9 November is no more correct than a week or two before or after it.  We did check with public health advice in terms of the broad timing of this measure.  How much time do we believe we need given where we are at with the epidemic, the variants, international travel and, critically, the vaccine programme?</p> <p>The view from public health advice was that we need to be able to exercise public health measures of the type that are covered here into late autumn-early winter.  Hence the start of November is the time being proposed.  As I have said, it is because of a variety of different factors.  One is to do with what stage we will be at with the vaccines.  Another is the variants.  This week, as Senators will understand, we are looking closely at the Indian variant, what it is doing in the UK and its potential transmission here.  Public health advice pointed out that around that time there will be a mass movement back indoors.  I have no doubt, unless something unforeseen happens, people will be indoors anyway by that stage.  People will be back in restaurants, in pubs and each other&rsquo;s houses.  Indoor life will continue but as we move into early winter, we all move back indoors, and we close the doors.  It is the public health view that late autumn-early winter was around the time when one still might want to be able to exercise these sorts of public health measures.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My hope is that we do not have to exercise any of them but if we do, they are lighter touch measures like having to wear masks in particular higher-risk environments or if there are local outbreaks or local outbreaks of variants.  There may be more variants coming or variants the vaccines do not work as well on.  That is the big question.  We are always asking in terms of these variants.  </p><p>The second set of comments, questions and challenges was around impact and proportionality, which is a critical question.  The measures we are using are harsh and have caused huge hardship for people.  There has been significant isolation, loneliness and mental health challenges for people.  People have lost their loved ones, friends and family.  Not only have they lost them but we have not been able to grieve properly those whom we have lost.  It has been very difficult for so many people.  I say that as somebody who buried my 102-year-old granny very recently.  It has been brutal for people so why have these?  It is because the other side of the human rights argument is that people have a right to health.  People have a right to be protected from the pandemic.  If we look back to the first roll-out of measures like quarantine and the kind of public health measures that were deployed many years ago to prevent the damage these pandemics or epidemics do, we can see that a human rights argument was used by public health doctors to say that people have a right to be protected and kept safe as well so what we are always trying to do is balance those rights and obligations.  There are no easy answers and I do not think anyone has any monopoly of wisdom on this.  Obviously we have never dealt with anything like this and, please God, we will never have to deal with anything like it again but who knows?  </p><p>Have we got everything right?  Of course, not - there is no country or government that has got all of this right but the measures are working.  If we look back from January to March or April, we can see that because of the extraordinary solidarity of the Irish people, Ireland went from having the highest rate to the lowest or one of the lowest in a very short period of time.  We were one of the earliest European countries to open up primary and secondary education to in-school education for everybody.  In spite of our healthcare system and incredible healthcare workers coming under enormous pressure, unlike a lot of other countries, our healthcare system was never overrun.  We never ran out of beds or ventilators.  We treated everybody and our survival rates in ICUs compared with a lot of other highly developed countries are very good.  The measures have worked.  In time, there will be look backs and analysis of how Ireland and other countries did.  Our excess mortality rate is one of the lowest in Europe.  The people who deserve credit for that are certainly not the Government.  It is the Irish people who deserve credit for sticking with the measures but the measures work so while they are hard, at least we do know they have worked and Ireland has fared well relative to a lot of other countries.  That is not to minimise the awful pain and suffering that has occurred but relative to a lot of the rest of the world, Ireland has done relatively well and it is partly because we can deploy these measures and deploy them very quickly when they are needed.  </p><p>The Cabinet is meeting on Friday morning to discuss June and whether we can further relax as per what was signalled a month ago and what to do about July and August.  We are entering that conversation in the most positive conceivable setting.  Just a few months ago, when we were talking about the first easing of restrictions, we had analysis and projections that were very sobering indeed.  It seemed very reasonable at the time.  It was a case of "here's what happens if we have a R number of 1.2, 1.4 or 1.6.  Here's what happens when you open the schools.  The R number will go up.  Here's what happens when you relax travel."<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What people have done is they have really backed the measures, taken care of each other and kept each other safe.  We are ahead of the best-case scenario that we were shown at that time.  Again, the credit for that lies with the Irish people but at least we know the measures work.</p><p>In terms of parliamentary scrutiny and safeguards, the Bill before the House has a very important provision, which is that the powers can only be extended by agreement of both Houses of the Oireachtas due to the sunset clause.  In terms of the sequencing of Seanad time, I had nothing to do with that.  I hope I turn up here regularly enough and if colleagues would like to debate the various issues raised, I am always happy to come in and debate those, listen to the ideas and the challenges and bring them back to Government and try to implement them.</p><p>Various measures were mentioned but as I am conscious of time, I will focus on the one that was mentioned most, which was the aviation sector and the digital green certificate.  There will be an announcement, presumably after Cabinet on Friday as it is scheduled to be discussed at Cabinet on Friday.  We are in a good position.  The Government backs the digital green certificate.  Essentially, what that will mean is that people who are fully vaccinated can travel, not only in the EU, but with partner countries outside the EU as well.  That would include no home quarantine.  That is really what people are looking for, namely, unimpeded travel.</p><p>The impact analysis of the vaccines is profoundly positive.  I remember talking to very esteemed, very well experienced epidemiologists last August or September, who were telling me they doubted we would have any vaccines of any impact within two or three years, but that maybe within five years we might get a vaccine that would be useful against this, but we might never get one.  They referenced HIV-AIDS and all sorts of other viruses and pandemics that have occurred.  To be in the position we are in now is extraordinary.  One of the things we can do with that is fully support and join up to the digital green certificate and my hope is that will happen as quickly as possible.  That will have a very powerful and positive effect on the aviation sector.  I know the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is engaging directly with the sector and that the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Paschal Donohoe, are also looking at economic supports because it has been a brutal time for the sector.</p></speech>

I want to share my colleagues&rsquo; support for the vaccine programme.  The credit for the vaccine programme goes to the thousands and thousands of women and men all over our country, in every one of our counties and every constituency, who have gone in, seven days a week, and worked very long shifts.  In record time, they have put together a national vaccination programme, built an entire IT infrastructure and dealt with some very difficult logistics in terms of the temperatures these things have to be stored at.</p> <p>As to our target, people talk about where we will get to by the end of June, July or August.  The Government&rsquo;s target, the bit that we could control, was getting the vaccines into people's arms as soon as they arrived in.  We are data-bereft over the last week because of this heinous attack on the HSE&rsquo;s IT systems but the last data I had showed that in excess of 96% of vaccines were getting out within seven days of them arriving here.  Because of that, we can all feel it as we are talking to people, and I registered for my own vaccine over the weekend.  I want to thank colleagues.  The real credit for that is due to the people who have done enormous work over the last few months to get this programme up and running and to make sure we got this vaccine out and into people's arms as quickly as possible.  It really is thanks to our incredible healthcare workers, the help of the Defence Forces and many other partners right across the system, including general practice, volunteers and people coming back from retirement.  It really has been an amazing thing to be part of, seeing Ireland in all its facets come together to achieve this very important thing.</p></speech>
