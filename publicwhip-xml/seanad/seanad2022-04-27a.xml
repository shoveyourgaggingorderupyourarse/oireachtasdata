She will be happy to hear that her name was used a lot during the Order of Business yesterday and in praise of her and her work in her Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-04-27a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1663" speakername="Annie Hoey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022042700002#A00400"><p>I am here to talk about Bank of Ireland's announcement that it is withdrawing the graduate entry medicine, GEM, loan, the only loan available that is specific to graduate entry medicine students.  It came with conditions such as a moratorium on paying back the loan before four years.  I am not asking any Minister of State or Government to interfere in the commercial or operational decisions of any bank, even if we have a shareholding in that bank.  I recognise that banks need to be able to do whatever they want so they are free to withdraw their loan product but on behalf of the students I have spoken to we are seeking engagement from Government on alternative financing options or funding supports.</p><p>A survey was done by a number of students who will be affected by this and about 10% of all the Irish GEM students responded to it over a couple of days, which is statistically significant.  Some 92% of them said they require external financial support to pay the university fees and we all know how much those university fees are; they are &euro;16,000 per year to study GEM.  That is colossal money.  It is &euro;64,000 that they have to take out as a loan.  Some 74% of those who responded have or would have eventually sought to avail of the Bank of Ireland loan and that is a significant number.  A number of them worry they will not be able to apply for it due to the lack of a suitable guarantor.  Some 71 of the 141 respondents said the fees caused them to delay studying medicine, which is significant when we have a crisis in the healthcare system.  On top of that, an additional 100 out of the 140 respondents pay accommodation costs and we all know how expensive that is.  A number of them felt compelled to add in additional comments and all of them are extremely concerned, including about their capacity to continue the course.  Bank of Ireland has said it will allow them to finish it out so hopefully that has been dealt with.  A number of respondents feel they will not be able to undertake graduate medicine because they do not have the option of this loan.</p><p>The biggest issue people have raised is that anyone who has spoken to Bank of Ireland, including myself, has not been able to get clarity on the alternative options which have been touted.  A Bank of Ireland statement on this matter mentions that it has other loans available but as far as I can tell none of the other loans seems to offer the four-year moratorium.  This would be unreasonable, when it is already an accelerated course, for GEM students who are already compressing medicine into four years.  It is an intense course and their final year is extremely intense, as any medical studies are.  To then have to start paying back the loan in that final year is not feasible or reasonable and that is something that has come back to me from the many students I have spoken to.</p><p>The fees were already exorbitant and we have had conversations before about how it is unrealistic to expect people to pay them.  We will never have any sort of diversity in medicine if we have the likes of &euro;16,000 per year fees and if we are locking people out of loans for that money because they cannot get guarantors or take out a personal loan.  One of the responses I got from Bank of Ireland was that students could take out a personal loan but that has different requirements with it.  A student who said she was planning on studying GEM in August 2023 said her only feasible option right now is to study in the North and even this is a risk as:</p> <blockquote> 	I want to live and work in the Republic and as of yet, the government has not fixed the issue of British trained doctors being allowed to apply for an Irish Intern year post-brexit.  This means if I do move my partner and family for four years to save on fees I may never be able to come back and work on a training scheme here.  It does seem like a neverending maze of dead ends when all I want to is to train as a doctor in my own country. </blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Has the Minister of State any light to shine at the end of this tunnel?</p></speech>

These speaking notes are his.  However, I will, as a former banker, answer some of the Senator's questions at the end.</p><p>I thank Senator Hoey for raising this important issue, which has recently been brought to the Minister of State's attention.  The loans available to GEM students are private arrangements between the relevant lenders and the students applying for such loans.  Notwithstanding this, the Department has been made aware of reports regarding the specific loan scheme for GEM and is currently seeking further information on the issue.  That the Department is doing this so reassuring.</p><p>The fee payable by a student can vary depending on a variety factors, including the type of course and the student's access route, for example, previous education.  Entry to medicine in Irish higher education institutions is provided through undergraduate and graduate entry routes.  GEM is one of the pathways to studying medicine.  Students pursuing GEM programmes pursue them as second degree courses and, consequently, are not eligible for free fees funding or student grants.</p><p>One of the recommendations of the 2006 Fottrell report was the introduction of a new GEM programme.  In order to widen access to GEM programmes and give assistance towards the financial burden, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  In the 2020-21 academic year, the State contribution was &euro;11,524 per student, with the balance of fees payable by the student.</p><p>The programme for Government committed to conducting a comprehensive review of the student grant scheme in 2021 to ensure that adequate student supports were in place.  The report was conducted by Indecon and will be brought to the Government shortly.  In terms of other available supports, students on GEM courses may also be eligible to apply to the student assistance fund for financial support.  This fund is administered on a confidential and discretionary basis by the access office in the third level institution attended.  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate may be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.  Further information is available from a student's local tax office or the website of the Revenue Commissioners, <i>www.revenue.ie.</i></p><p>Work is ongoing on the development of the new strategic action plan for equity of access, participation and success in higher education.  This plan will seek to reflect and implement the vision that the higher education &quot;student body entering, participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland's population&quot; and that our higher education institutions are inclusive environments that support and foster student success and outcomes, equity and diversity and are responsive to the needs of students and wider communities.</p><p>This response, which the Minister of State has provided to me, is comprehensive and tells me that a great deal of work is ongoing.  In light of the situation in which the students now find themselves, it is welcome that Bank of Ireland will facilitate them and follow through on the terms and conditions, thereby letting them finish out their four years.  The loans were so helpful because they acknowledged the level of professionalism required in such courses, that they were intensive and that there would be an opportunity at the end to work and earn enough income to repay them.  Removing the loans from the market makes it difficult for students to consider pursuing such careers.  Parents may not have the funding or correct credit status to be successful guarantors.</p></speech>

The solution seems to be that the Department is looking into the matter, which is not much for me to go back to the students with.  While it is welcome that the Department is looking into the matter, students need to know what they are going to do and what will be available for them.  I have read the statement from Bank of Ireland &ndash; we have had some back-and-forth discussions &ndash; that other options are available, but no examples were provided.  The other options just seem to be what are available to everyone else, and as the Minister of State mentioned, those do not take into account the high level of intensity involved in these courses.</p> <p>As far as I am aware, this is not happening because there has been a default.  This is a stable loan facility and these are people who are repaying their loans.  I am not a banker like the Minister of State was, but it does not seem to me to be a high-risk loan.</p> <p>This situation is frustrating.  The GEM scheme is unequal and continues the elitism of medicine.  As far as I can tell, I have not been provided with an answer today that I can take back to those students.</p></speech>

The loan's withdrawal was not of the Government's doing; it was sprung upon the Government, and now the Government is dealing with the matter as quickly as it can.  The Minister of State has made it clear that he is in talks with the bank.</p> <p>The Senator is right, in that the risk attached to this loan is minimal.  That is why the bank is prepared to delay for four years, with no repayments.  It will suspend interest for those four years as well.  There is a market to recruit into the loan facility and the level of earnings at the end is enough to meet the repayments.</p> <p>This is a priority for the Government.  We do not want to be in such a situation where we cannot recruit young people into these courses because they cannot afford them.</p></speech>

If I look through my files from the long number of years I have been in the Houses, one of the issues that has arisen most often is that of the state of play at University Hospital Limerick, or Limerick Regional Hospital as it was previously known.  Notwithstanding significant investment over the years, the situation has deteriorated and continues to deteriorate.  Those of us who believed in the reorganisation of the hospital structure in the region took a fair amount of political heat at the time for doing what we believed was the right thing &ndash; focusing attention and developing a hospital that was best in class and best in practice and reached a high standard.  Unfortunately, that has not happened.</p> <p>There has been significant investment in the hospital's new accident and emergency unit and a new ward block, but demand continues to outstrip the services the hospital provides.  I do not know whether this is due to bad planning or the poor use of its facilities, but something is amiss.  The population in the mid-west region has not exploded or done anything other than what was expected over a prolonged period.  Last Thursday, the number of people on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick's accident and emergency unit was 126.  That was the highest ever in a hospital in the history of the State.  Today, that number is 111.  Yesterday, it was 113.  Cork University Hospital had the next highest number yesterday at 63.  That is a huge number and should not be that high.  I suspect if we did not have the situation in Limerick, the people from Cork would be crying blue murder.</p> <p>This is not just about numbers, which the Minister of State knows as a hard-working, on-the-ground politician.  She knows that, behind every number and statistic, there is an individual or family and there is heartache.  As the trolley numbers continued to increase in recent weeks, the level of heartache and pain brought to my door by people who were looking out for a loved one was at an all-time high.  Hand on heart, there is nothing that I can say to them that I believe would solve their problems.</p> <p>I have reached a point where I think that the only appropriate response is to bring in an external and independent review team.  I do not mind where they come from, but I will say where they cannot come from, namely, the hospital, the HSE or the Department of Health.  I want a thorough investigation, audit, analysis or whatever you want to call it, and it needs to be done by someone who is entirely independent of the various vested interests.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I am not casting aspersions on any individual or group, but I will not have confidence in repeating anything I hear from the Minister of State, the Department or the Minister, with the greatest of respect to them, unless and until it is supported by a document prepared by a group of management consultants without any connection to the hospital, the HSE or the Department.  If that requires going outside the State, it is the least we can do.  Last Thursday, the figure was 126.  Yesterday, it was 113 and today it is 111.  I do not know what the figure will be tomorrow but I am sure it will peak again.  We owe it to the families and the people who are affected.  With the best will in the world, we like to say that if people are on death's door, they will be treated in the accident and emergency department and if people are only a little sick, they have to wait a little longer.  That does not wash anymore because the truth is that when I talk to nurses and doctors on the ground, they tell me privately that it cannot be guaranteed that they are able to deliver care that will save the lives of individuals.  That is a serious situation to be in.  We need to get to the bottom of this.  I keep being reassured there is no shortage of money or planning.  There is, however, a shortage of solutions to a problem that has been around for a very long time and which predates the time in office of the Minister of State and, indeed, that of her predecessor.</p></speech>

I fully understand how important University Hospital of Limerick, UHL, is to the people of the mid-west and, indeed, that it is adequately resourced and staffed.  In that regard, this Government, along with the Department of Health, is fully committed to improving patient services and having patient-centred care in Limerick.  That commitment is reflected in the unprecedented level of funding that is being targeted right across the health service in budget 2022.</p> <p>The UL Hospitals Group has reported that it is continuing to deal with record volumes of patients attending the UHL emergency department.  In addition, waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures remain significantly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.  While ongoing work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, our acute hospitals, including UHL, continue to be impacted by operational challenges arising from Covid-19.</p> <p>The Minister for Health fully acknowledges the distress overcrowded emergency departments and delays to elective treatment causes to patients, their families and front-line staff working in very challenging conditions, not just in Limerick but in hospitals throughout the country.</p> <p>Despite the difficulties of the past two years, work is being done by the UL Hospitals Group to address these issues.  Elective activity is reviewed daily in line with the hospital&rsquo;s escalation plan, based on capacity and on the clinical need of patients.  This includes elective patients coming in for time-critical investigations and procedures.  UHL has also advised that it is undertaking additional ward rounds, accelerating discharges and identifying patients for transfer to model 2 hospitals.  In addition, all patients who present to the emergency department with minor injuries at this time, such as suspected broken bones, cuts, bruises and sprains, are being redirected to the injury units in Ennis, Nenagh and St. John&rsquo;s for treatment whenever clinically appropriate.</p> <p>In recent years, there has been significant investment in UHL to address capacity issues, including a new emergency department that opened in 2017 and a new 60-bed modular ward block which provides modern, single-room inpatient accommodation with improved infection prevention and control capabilities as well as patient flow throughout the hospital.  This follows the completion of two separate rapid-build projects which provided an additional 38 inpatient beds on site at UHL.</p> <p>Further to that investment, Project Ireland 2040 includes provision for a 96-bed ward block at UHL.  The evaluation of tenders is complete and the award of a works contract to the successful tenderer has been approved by the HSE board.  The HSE will now be engaging with the successful bidder in the coming weeks with a view to the award of contract being finalised during the second quarter of 2022.</p> <p>While acknowledging the difficulties faced by patients attending UHL, it is important to note that significant work is being done and every effort is being made to improve the situation at UHL.  The Department will continue to closely monitor the situation in conjunction with the HSE.</p> <p>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the front-line workers in the emergency department.  They see the queues and acknowledge the issues.  There were 121 trolleys occupied last Thursday, 60 of which were in the emergency department, and the other 61 were dispersed throughout the hospital to accommodate patients awaiting admission.  That is no way that anybody with expertise wants to manage an emergency department.  It must also be acknowledged that while there is substantial ongoing investment, there was chronic underinvestment for many years.  This is not about numbers; it is about getting it right now.</p></speech>

I accept that the 2040 project is there and 96 beds have been promised.  I know the hospital will move quickly and I hope those beds can be provided even more quickly.  However, something needs to happen in the interim.  It is not enough to say that every effort is being made.  I am not having a pop at the Minister of State but it is not acceptable to say every effort is being made and we will do our best because that does not cut it with the people who see the numbers rising every day as the situation develops.</p> <p>The 2040 project and the moneys included in it will take two to three years to take effect.  A staffing cohort will have to be put in place.  That is a futuristic solution for people who are suffering today and will be for the next 12, 18 or 24 months.  We need an urgent intervention.  We need to sweat the asset at it stands and, unfortunately, I do not see that happening.  It has not happened to date and that is why I want an independent expert review.  We can all learn from experts and get a better understanding of a situation and learn to better manage the problem.  The Minister of State and I know full well what the problem is, as do the people on the trolleys and their families.  Quite frankly, the solution to resolve the problem right now is not there.  The solution is designed for the future.  As is always the way with the Department, it suggests there is a solution for the future, population will grow, etc.  What we want is decisive intervention now that gives some chance of a dignified medical response to people from the region who have no choice but to attend the accident and emergency unit.</p></speech>

I am all for a decisive and independent external review.  I am all for leaving the vested interests of the HSE, management, the Department of Health and the hospital group outside the door.  That is absolutely my position.  However, that does not solve the issue for the 111 people on trolleys today.  I believe there must be triaging of the issue.  I compliment the management within the hospital group for what it has done with the facilities at Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's hospitals.  I also compliment the hospital group for what it has done on elective procedures.  However, there is a substantial problem with the emergency department in UHL.  One consideration we must address is whether we have the consultants who can triage the patients who are coming through the doors of the hospital.  We need to do that work now.  We must examine whether we have the people on the ground who can make the decisions to move the trolleys along.  I agree with the Senator.  I will bring what he said to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

This is not the first time I have raised the issue in the House.  The previous Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, former Deputy Jim Daly, recognised more than two years ago that there was a mental health crisis among the members of the Traveller community.  The programme for Government promised a national Traveller mental health strategy.  We are now two years into this Government's term.  Without meaning any disrespect to the Minister of State, she is the wrong person for me to be talking to about this.  I would have loved to have the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, here today.  However, I will approach the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, with a question.  Where is that strategy?  Where are we now in that regard?  This is a matter of life and death.  The signs of a mental health crisis are all around us.  It is devastating and heartbreaking.  The suicide rate is six times higher for Traveller women and seven times higher for Traveller men compared with the general population.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These studies were done in 2008.  We need updated research on the rate of suicide within our community.  Some 82% of Travellers have been affected by suicide.  We all know someone who has died by suicide.  More than half of Travellers reported that poor physical and mental health restricts their normal daily activities.  These are not just statistics; these are people.  As the Minister of State knows, the Traveller community experiences a great level of racism and exclusion.  This has a dramatic impact on people's mental health, self-esteem, etc.</p><p>I stood with our community outside Leinster House on UN Human Rights Day in December.  Once again we were making the one call - for action around Traveller mental health.  The report of the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community called for the establishment of a national Traveller mental health strategy.  That recommendation came from the National Traveller Mental Health Network, a collective of Traveller individuals and organisations across the island.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has met with the network and attended the launch of the national Traveller mental health submission.  The recommendation is rooted in the Traveller experience and puts Traveller voices at the heart of the conversation around Traveller mental health.  This is what we need.  This is about our access.  It is already included in the recommendations.  We need a national Traveller mental health strategy; a ring-fenced budget for this critical work; and a national Traveller mental health steering group.  We need the vital experienced voices of the Traveller community from the National Traveller Mental Health Network and we need a timeframe for the actions to make sure the work gets done.</p><p>In 2006, A Vision for Change called for culturally inclusive mental health services.  Years later, Traveller mental health has gotten worse.  I fear that including Traveller mental health in 2020's Sharing the Vision did not give the crisis the focus it needs to turn the tide.  This is a national crisis within the Traveller community.  The solution to the crisis cannot be an add-on.  The Traveller community needs a tailored, stand-alone mental health strategy to support and resource its needs and we need to make sure it is implemented.  We cannot keep waiting for action.  We genuinely cannot.  Lives are on hold here.</p></speech>

The Government has long recognised the particular disadvantages the Traveller community faces, and the importance of implementing specific strategies and policies to address these disadvantages.  The Government&rsquo;s approach to improving the lives of the Traveller community is outlined in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  This is a cross-departmental initiative that contains a set of specific actions aimed at improving the lives of Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  A key health action in the strategy is to develop and implement a detailed action plan to address the specific health needs of Travellers, using a social determinants approach.  The lead role in developing the action plan rests with the HSE social inclusion office, in conjunction with Traveller organisations.  The strategy acknowledges that mental health difficulties and the increased risk of suicide are significant issues caused by many social determinants.  It includes ten actions specifically relating to mental health and suicide among Travellers.  These are being addressed as part of the comprehensive health action plan.  It is envisaged that the mental health actions in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy will be incorporated in the Traveller health action plan and will be aligned with the overall approach in our national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision.  This will allow for an integrated and co-ordinated response to the specific health needs of Travellers.  That is exactly what the Senator has outlined.  I could be wrong but she said the Traveller community needs its own particular strategy.  While the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, agrees with that, she says it needs to be part of and aligned with the national strategy.</p> <p>Sharing the Vision and Connecting for Life also recognise Travellers as a priority group.  Both recognise the vulnerability to, and increased risk, of mental health issues and suicidal behaviour for Travellers and that these should be considered in the way mental health services are delivered to Travellers.  Sharing the Vision contains a series of recommendations to improve the mental health outcomes for the whole community.  The policy places the individual at the heart of service delivery and contains recommendations for services to address and accommodate the specific needs and unique socioeconomic and cultural background of individual service users.  The policy seeks to provide mental health services that recognise and respond to diversity, and advocates maximising the delivery of diverse and culturally competent mental health supports throughout all services, to respond to the needs of specific groups.</p> <p>Importantly, individuals representing the Traveller community and other ethnic minority communities were appointed to the specialist group panel to support the national implementation and monitoring committee and will provide specialist input at various points in the implementation of the policy.  Members of the Traveller community feature across many objectives and actions in Ireland&rsquo;s national strategy to reduce suicide, Connecting for Life.  They are strongly represented in 17 localised versions of the strategy, which are now in place across the country.  Many of these have local Traveller groups and representatives on their implementation or oversight groups.  With support from the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention, Exchange House provides a range of Traveller-specific mental health and suicide prevention services to the Traveller community.  In addition, the HSE has Traveller co-ordinators in each CHO area to assist members of the Traveller community in their interactions with the HSE.</p> <p>As the Senator acknowledged, last December, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, launched the ethnic minorities and mental health revised guidelines for mental health services and staff on working with people from ethnic minority communities.  The guidelines aim to ensure equitable access to appropriate services and supports for everyone in Ireland.  They are designed to assist mental health services and staff who work with people from ethnic minority communities in the delivery of culturally competent mental health services.  I hope that answered some of the Senator's questions.</p></speech>

She is here on behalf of Deputy Butler.  She said individuals have sat on that advisory group but it is not even a permanent structure.  In the programme for Government we were promised a stand-alone mental health strategy.  Unfortunately, we have not gotten the answers we needed today.  I am not doing this for Eileen Flynn; I am doing this on behalf of the National Traveller Mental Health Network.  When are the Government and the Minister going to honour what they committed to in the programme for Government?  There is no end in sight for the mental health crisis within our community.  Surely there needs to be accountability for the lack of action while members of our community die by suicide on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, there is no satisfaction to be had from the Minister of State's reply to our community here today.  It is really sad.  There is no accountability for the actions promised in the programme for Government.  It is not the Minister of State's fault; it is the lack of political will within the Department.</p></speech>

I appreciate that she is not doing this on her own behalf but on behalf of the Traveller community.  When I leave here today I will ask Deputy Butler to meet with the Senator to discuss this matter.

I  raise the cost of renewing driver licences for people with disabilities.  When I renew my licence, as a person without a disability, it costs &euro;55 for ten years.  Those with a disability must renew their licence every three years at a cost of &euro;35 each time.  That means that over the ten-year period they have to pay out three fees of &euro;35 and must also get a medical certificate from their doctor.  That can cost between &euro;50 and &euro;60 per visit.  Let us say that at three times &euro;50 that costs &euro;150 in addition to &euro;105.  It is an exorbitant cost to someone with a disability.  We must admit that sometimes people find it stressful when they are going to get their driver licence.  They might be afraid that they do not have their documentation.  However, the costs are very high.</p> <p>There is another issue around the primary medical certificate.  I know of someone with a disability who applied for the primary medical certificate last November.  The person received a letter in mid-November to say that they were not eligible but that they could appeal it.  It is now April yet no one has been appointed by the Department to the appeals board to assess these applications.  Therefore, the person who is looking to get the primary medical certificate and the licence has the added cost and has to get taxis everywhere.  That is a huge additional cost which such people might not have if there was a decision on the certificate.  It is not fair that we put this added burden on people with a disability.  There is a list of 23 conditions which a person who has any of them must apply for the three-year licence.  It is a huge cost on hundreds of thousands of people.  It is not fair and needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

Driving licences are usually issued for a ten-year period at a cost of &euro;55.  An applicant may be issued with a one-year or a three-year licence for medical reasons.  The fee for a three-year licence is &euro;35.  There is no fee for a one-year licence.</p> <p>To drive a vehicle, a driver must meet strict medical standards.  Driver fitness standards are developed on foot of EU law and international best practice.  The relevant Irish legislation is the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 2006, as amended.</p> <p>On application or renewal of a driving licence, applicants are asked a range of questions about medical conditions or disabilities that may affect their ability to drive.  The response to those questions will dictate whether there is a need for medical certification by a GP to grant, refuse or impose restrictions on a licence. </p> <p>A clinical guidance document, Sl&aacute;inte agus Tiom&aacute;int Medical Fitness to Drive Guidelines, is compiled by the Road Safety Authority, in conjunction with the National Office for Traffic Medicine.  It provides guidelines for medical professionals to assist in their assessment of an individual applicant's fitness to drive a motor vehicle.  The guidelines are reviewed and updated annually, with the 2022 edition launching this Thursday, 28 April.  The information in these guidelines is intended to assist doctors and other healthcare professionals in advising their patients on fitness to drive, on the requirements for reporting to the National Driver Licence Service, and guidance on reviews of stability, progression or improvement in these conditions.</p> <p>The fee charged by a general practitioner to complete a medical report for the purposes of applying for a driving licence is not a matter for the Department of Transport.  The cost of the medical report is not covered under the medical card or GP visit card schemes.  People can approach their local community welfare officer for assistance if they are struggling with the cost of obtaining their medical report.</p></speech>

It is the cost of the licence and the cost involved in getting it.  I understand the cost to the doctor is not covered by the Department of Transport but the fact that a person having to get three licences over the nine-year period is a matter covered by the Department of Transport and is something that should be addressed by the Minister.  I would like the Minister of State to take that back to the Minister for Transport.  It is costing people &euro;105 and that is within the control of the Minister for Transport.  That needs to be addressed.  It is not fair that someone with a disability has to pay &euro;105 when I pay &euro;55 to have the same licence over the same period.</p></speech>

The fee for the three-year licence is &euro;35.  The community welfare system is available to anyone struggling with specific costs including those related to their transport needs.  I very much take the Senator's point.  The effective costs relate to the medical certificate.  Perhaps it is one of the issues, of which there are many, that falls between the stools of two Departments.  There may be a role for the Department of Health and the Department of Social Protection on this too.  I will take the Senator's point back to the Minster, Deputy Ryan.</p></speech>

Today is Koningsdag, or King&rsquo;s Day, which is the national holiday in the Netherlands celebrating the birth of King Willem-Alexander.  On Koningsdag, the Dutch turn their country orange in the same way as we turn the world green on our national day.  Of course, the Irish flag of green, white and orange - which is behind us here - is a symbol of our links, with the orange of our national flag representing the unionist or Protestant tradition, being inspired, of course, by King William of Orange from the Netherlands.</p> <p>The link and friendship between the Irish and the Dutch is long-standing and deep.  Diplomatic relations between Ireland and the Netherlands were established in 1945 and the Irish embassy in the Hague was opened in 1950, with the first ever Irish ambassador, Josephine McNeill, being one of the few women envoys in the world at that time.  </p> <p>The Brexit vote in 2016 is deeply regretted then and now by both ourselves and the Netherlands.  Even before Brexit, Ireland and the Netherlands were working closely on issues in the European Union.  Of course, those connections go much further back between our two countries.  As seafaring nations that have a long tradition with interaction in the world, it is wonderful to know that the oldest lighthouse in the Netherlands is called Brandaris.  I think I got that pronunciation just about right.  Of course, it was inspired by a Kerry man, St. Brendan.  Our maritime traditions and relations have developed throughout the centuries.  Due to Brexit, there are now 25 direct sailings between Ireland and Dutch ports every week.  </p> <p>The state visit by King Willem-Alexander and Queen M&aacute;xima in 2019 further strengthened and deepened the relationships between our two countries.  King Willem-Alexander's relationships go back much further.  As a young boy, he used to visit Kenmare and the village of Sneem in County Kerry.  We look forward to welcoming him back to my home town soon.  I wish the Dutch ambassador to Ireland, H.E. Adriaan Palm, all the Dutch people living in the Kenmare and Sneem areas and the Dutch people living in Ireland, at home and around the world a very happy Koningsdag.  I thank the ambassador for being with us here today.</p> <p>I will call on the Deputy Leader to propose the Order of Business but before doing so, people will remember that during the recess, we lost a former Member of the Seanad.  Jimmy Leonard, who was a Member of the Fifteenth Seanad, died on Wednesday, 13 April.  Jimmy had a long and distinguished career in public service at a national and local level.  He was elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1981 on the Administrative Panel.  He served seven terms in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as a Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan.  He was also a councillor for many years.  He had a deep understanding of rural Ireland and worked tirelessly for his constituents.  He was from a farming background and worked in the Monaghan co-operative.  He also championed the needs of the disadvantaged and was a loyal worker for his community.  He believed in peace and was a powerful advocate for cross-Border co-operation during the darkest days of the Troubles.  This is evident in his membership in the New Ireland Forum and the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body.</p> <p>At this sad time, my thoughts are with his family.  On behalf of the House, I wish to convey my sincere sympathies to his wife, Tess; children, Raymond, Joe, Colette, Ann and Ciar&aacute;n; and his extended family and friends.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p></speech>

I did not know Jimmy Leonard well, but he served in the Chamber for a long time.  Michael O'Kennedy had a distinguished career as a Minister, Senator, Deputy and a European Commissioner for a period.  I pay tribute to both those gentlemen.  I offer my deepest sympathies and condolences to their families and friends.</p> <p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for wearing the flower symbolising Organ Donor Awareness Week.  I am wearing mine and I am sure other Members are wearing theirs too and will be over the next few days.  It runs from 23 April to 30 April.  It is staggering to see how many lives have been saved and improved by the unfortunate and tragic death, in many cases, of those people.  Sometimes it is very sudden, such as a car crash, while other times it is anticipated, but it is still very sad when somebody dies.  In many cases, multiple lives have been saved with the gift of life when one person's life has been lost.  A system is being looked at where those who want to opt out can opt out, but almost everybody else is included.  I know there is sensitivity around that.  I think more than 1 million people have already said on their drivers' licences that they are happy for organs to be taken once they are no longer in a position to use them themselves.  I encourage as many people as possible to opt in and to let their family and colleagues know.</p> <p>I raise the issue of delays in the processing of various forms by the public service.  We are all inundated by passport forms.  The online passport applications and renewals are fantastic.  Anything that does not involve any human interaction and is automated seems to work in a streamlined way, but it should not take eight weeks for a new child's passport to be processed.  I presume that much of that is due to backlogs.  We need to clear those.  It also applies to work permits and visitor visas.  Every Member of the Oireachtas is hounded daily by frustrated people.  They put in their applications, which come back after five or six weeks to say something is wrong, then people go to the back of the queue again.</p> <p>I congratulate the garda&iacute; on the detention of five prominent gang members who were recently involved in a prolific amount of crime.  There is a problem with our justice system where we seem to allow people who have committed many crimes back out to commit more crimes.  We need to have a debate on public service delays and on crime.</p></speech>

Approximately 30,000 Ukrainian refugees live among us now.  I salute the community response throughout the country, which has been good at welcoming the Ukrainian people to Ireland.  Some local authorities have been better than others.  I know it is a work in progress and an evolving situation, but this needs to be a top priority.  Some Departments are better than others.  It needs to be a top priority and there needs to be a whole-of-government response.  I single out the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, who set up a one-stop shop in his Department to deal with queries from people from Ukraine who wish to study in Ireland.  Before the recess, I asked for a one-stop shop in each Department.  I hope that other Departments will respond accordingly and open a one-stop shop to deal with queries from Ukrainians.  It is important to acknowledge that the situation with drivers' licences has been resolved.  It was resolved with a signature, which could have been done weeks ago, but it is better late than having further delays.</p> <p>We are approaching the last term for thousands of leaving certificate students, including those who have disabilities or who are blind or visually impaired.  In this day and age, not having digital leaving certificate papers is something of the Dark Ages.  If the Department of Education provided digital leaving certificate papers, they would be fully accessible not just to people who are blind or visually impaired, but people who have print disabilities.  Other countries are doing it.  Why is the Department of Education always so conservative in the way it does business?  A young man was on "Liveline" last week, expressing his shock that he is blind, doing an oral examination in Irish, and is expected to interpret pictures.  In this day and age, do we not have the cop on to realise that somebody who is blind or visually impaired cannot interpret a picture, either in English or in Irish?  We need to cop on and the Department of Education needs to cop on.</p></speech>

If we want to see an equal society, we have to start with the education system.  If young people are not able to achieve their potential through education, they will not be able to achieve their potential in employment and they will not be able to be equal citizens in this country.  I want a debate with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, as early as possible about what is being done to create an accessible, equal leaving certificate that respects everybody, respects people's disabilities and does not really make a mockery of it by asking somebody who is blind to interpret a picture.</p></speech>

It was fitting and I thank the Cathaoirleach for his remarks to the ambassador, which I clearly enjoyed.  It is a wonderful country.  As I was listening, I remembered being in the Netherlands picking bulbs at the age of 16 or 17.  Many of us went there to pick bulbs.  It was a good opportunity for students from Ireland.  It is a wonderful country and I am delighted that the Cathaoirleach invited the ambassador and said a few words to him.</p><p>I would like to inform the House that Senator Tom Clonan has joined the Seanad Independent Group.  We look forward to working with him, as I know everyone in this House does.  I want to share that with the House.  I also flag that the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) (Amendment) Bill 2021 is scheduled for this afternoon.  There are only two amendments, in my name and that of Senator David Norris.  I thought there might have been more, but that is the nature of this business, and I hope we will have some engagement.  It is a huge issue.  We are an island and we are surrounded by marine casualties.  I will not rehearse all that I will say later, but hopefully some people will be in the House.  There are two amendments and we will see how they go.</p><p>My main focus today is the Irish Prison Officers Association's annual meeting in Sligo, which the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is due to address.  I understand she will outline the Government's vision and plan for the Irish Prison Service to become an independent State agency.  I have major concerns about that.  I saw some of the detail yesterday.  The Irish prison system is unique.  Today, we will hear prison officers tell the conference of overcrowding, violence and major problems in prisons.  We know from today's <i>Irish Times</i>that 35 inmates slept on floors in Cloverhill Prison this week.  The training unit in Mountjoy is closed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am sure there are circumstances around that.  I do not want to pre-empt them or the reasons to which the closure is attributed.  We have a closed training and education unit in Mountjoy.  That begs the question about prison reform and penal reform.   We are going to hear many issues between today and tomorrow in regard to this conference but it is really important that we work with people.  We heard the Minister last week talking about the Horses for Hope project in Castlerea.  We have seen the horticultural programmes and other arts and cultural programmes that are introduced in the prison.  </p><p>I was on the visiting committee of both Mountjoy Prison and Saint Patrick's Institution.  I always like to think about prisons that everyone in there is someone's son or daughter, brother, sister, mother, father, aunt, nephew, niece.  They are all humans, individuals and through sets of circumstances - not always within their own control - they ended up there.  Penal reform is really important.  I acknowledge the enormous work of Deputies Ivana Bacik and Jennifer Carroll MacNeill and indeed the Deputy Leader, Senator Lisa Chambers, may have been involved in the all-party Oireachtas group on penal reform.  Penal reform is a really important area and I would like a debate on it in this House as soon as possible. </p></speech>

After the Laois launch in summer 2021, Midlands LGBT+ Project identified the huge need for similar support for people in Offaly, Kildare and beyond.  In response to this the group has expanded its services to Offaly and at the weekend arrived with a splash of colour at its launch event in Tullamore.  I was lucky enough to attend.  Its mission is to reduce isolation for adult LGBT+ persons living in the midlands.  It runs a number of virtual and in-person peer support groups such as its Laois social group, Trans Midlands and Queer Book Club, as well as many LGBT+ events throughout the year.  It also provides training to businesses and community groups and delivers school workshops.  While we are lucky to have organisations such as Midlands LGBT+ in Laois and Offaly, nobody should experience isolation because of how they identify.  Yet tragic and violent events in Dublin and Sligo recently tell us that we still have a lot left to do.</p></speech>

Research by the Hate and Hostility Research Group, HHRG, at University of Limerick, identified that one in five of those surveyed had been punched, hit or physically attacked in public for being LGBT+ and one in three had been threatened with physical violence.  We must change this now.  It is for all of society to deal with.  I am grateful that Councillor Mark Hackett is pursuing the issue of gender-based violence at council level in Offaly and is doing this through the joint policing committee.  I wish that sub-group all the best with its important work.  It is 2022 and Ireland still does not have hate crime legislation.  The law on incitement to hatred dates back to 33 years ago.  Thankfully legislation is on its way to change this.  Hate crimes are message crimes intended to target entire communities.  Victims are targeted because of what they represent and the impact of hate crimes goes beyond the single person.  Their whole community is affected as well as our wider society.  We as policymakers, as communities, as families and as individuals can play our part in solutions too.  So if we see homophobia and transphobia in society, we must call it out.  Never sit idly by.  Never be silent.  If you know someone who is experiencing homophobia or transphobia encourage and support them to report hate incidents to LGBT Ireland and to the Garda.  This behaviour cannot be tolerated or normalised.  We must stand in power together, we must stand in pride.</p></speech>

This ensemble production was directed by one of my longest and oldest friends, Christina Matthews, the creative director of Droichead Youth Theatre.  I was struck by the content of the play.  Droichead Youth Theatre always lead on brave brave productions.  It always challenges us.  This play was no different.  It was about teenage cancer and the experience of a young person with cancer.  It did not just address that issue.  It addressed the complicated and related struggles of teenagers, family dynamics, bullying and romantic relationships or lack thereof as the case was when we moved along in the play.  I commend the Droichead Youth Theatre.  The topic of young people having cancer is just not a topic that gets a huge amount of air-time.</p><p>At the end of the production they wrote an incredible piece about the number of people who have cancer; the Irish Cancer Society funds more than 100 cancer researchers, laboratory researchers and research nurses.  All of the things that the Irish Cancer Society does are incredibly important in tackling cancer.  Droichead highlighted in 1994 that four out of ten people survived a cancer diagnosis.  In 2019 it was six out of ten.  Now, eight out of ten young people will be completely cured.  I did not know that piece of information until I went to this play and these young people told me.  I sit on the Joint Committee on Health and I consider myself quite informed.  The young people talked about CanTeen, an Irish organisation that supports people aged between 12 and 25 who have been diagnosed with cancer &ndash; again an organisation that I had never heard of.  It supports and empowers young people who are facing illness and bridges the gap between childhood and adulthood which is a complicated area.  It would be on the front line of battling cancer.  I was really shocked when the young people doing this incredible production talked about CanTeen only receiving 3% of its funding from Government.  Last year it had to raise &euro;21 million through donations, fund-raising campaigns and charity shops throughout the country, which allowed 1.6 million people throughout Ireland access to free information, advice and support.  </p><p>I want today to highlight CanTeen.  Young people facing cancer is an important issue and we should be concerned about the fact that it only gets 3% of its funding from Government and &euro;21 million comes, as with all sorts of cancer research and funding, through the goodwill of people who have been affected or know someone who has been affected.  I just want to put that on the record today and commend Droichead Youth Theatre on raising an issue that was very delicate but dealt with very sensitively. </p></speech>

Notwithstanding that some sectors of our economy are going well and flourishing, they are unfortunately unable to find staff to meet the demands and needs of the industry.  I ask the Leader to try to arrange a debate at the earliest possible opportunity to look at labour movements and the deficits within our labour market.  There are certainly problems right across the hospitality sector, among others.  </p> <p>One sector in particular with a really acute crisis is long-distance truck drivers.  I talked to the haulage companies in County Clare and those that do international haulage are unable to get staff either in Ireland, the UK or across Europe.  Often they look to South Africa for the obvious reason that they drive on the same side of the road.  Unfortunately there is a backlog is processing the work permits.  I have been told that it can take up to two years from a point where the driver is identified to have them on the road.  That is not acceptable.  It is not good enough and it is damaging to our economy.  We need to be lean and mean and fit to respond to every issue that arises in the challenging environment that we have come from with Covid-19 and now through a war experience.  Our supply lines are very important.  We export so much of our produce.  Part of that relies on the hard work of long-distance truck drivers.  If we do not have that piece boxed off we will not be competitive and other markets will take the contracts that we have.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is, therefore, really important that we address this.  If possible, we should have a wider debate on labour shortages in certain sectors with a particular emphasis on processing work permits for those who really need them.  The area of greatest concern at the moment is that of long-distance truck drivers.</p></speech>

Democracy and politics are very important in every aspect of their lives.  I wish them well in being here today.</p> <p>I seek a debate on vaccines beyond Covid.  This is World Immunisation Week.  Ireland spends 0.2% of its health budget on immunisation.  That figure would alarm and amaze all of us.  If it does not, it should because, during the Covid pandemic, we have seen the importance of vaccine take-up.  We have seen our success of our vaccine programme in the numbers who took up vaccination, in the way in which the immunisation programme worked and in the positive outcomes of the programme.  Interestingly, the level of take-up of the flu vaccine in this country is lower than the European recommended level of 75%.  The rate among healthcare workers is also lower than that recommended by the European Union.  I ask for a debate on the issues of immunisation and vaccine hesitancy.  The World Health Organization tells us that, in the context of global health, vaccine hesitancy is one of the top ten reasons for health issues in the world.  During this very important week, we should reflect on the importance of vaccination and immunisation.  We have seen the success of vaccines for HPV, measles, mumps and a list of other conditions for which vaccines have worked.  I ask for a debate on the issue of vaccines and immunisation as a matter of urgency.  It is an important debate to have.  I commend Deputy Colm Burke on holding a briefing earlier in the audiovisual room.</p></speech>

I also welcome the students who are here.  It is very important that they hear about democracy and see democracy in action.  I again raise the question of the voting age.  As the Leader will know, I have raised on a number of occasions the issue of lowering the voting age to 16.  I have a Bill before the House for this purpose.  Those in Scotland and Wales are going to the polls in their local elections quite soon and 16-year-olds will have the right to vote.  This is a very active campaign in many countries all over the world.  The Children's Rights Alliance recently announced that it is pushing even harder to ensure that we see the voting age reduced to 16.  We can do it for the local and European election simply by legislation.  The Convention on the Constitution considered the matter in detail and was in favour of it.  I hope that this will be provided for as part of the legislation on the electoral commission.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, came before this House to deal with a Commencement matter, he indicated his support for the proposal.  It is important that we have that debate and that we engage as many young people as possible in it.</p> <p>The other issue I wish to raise relates to the sports capital grants scheme and the concerns now being raised regarding inflation in construction costs.  The Government recently announced the largest ever sports capital grants scheme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, did a wonderful job in getting the scheme over the line and in making the announcements but many of the clubs and organisations to get grants are now being hit by inflation in construction costs.  The costs of their projects are much higher than the quotes they had received when putting in their original submissions.  I ask that the Leader raise this matter with the Minister of State with responsibility for sport and that she ask whether any allowances can be made for clubs impacted in this way.</p></speech>

An Oireachtas committee met with this organisation.  The then CEO of Sport Ireland, Mr. John Treacy, indicated to us that a governance review of the organisation was taking place following our queries.  No report has been forthcoming to date despite it having been due at Christmas.  As a committee, we looked for specific answers to a number of questions and the organisation committed to providing them but, to date, we have not received replies.  We have not even received replies to letters we have sent to the organisation.  An election for officers and an AGM was organised.  In the middle of the election, a significant number of the officers who were running were suspended.  The AGM did not take place and we still do not have the result of the election that took place.  I have read in the<i>Irish Independent</i>that the appeals these officers took to Sport Dispute Solutions Ireland through the Federation of Irish Sport were successful.  The board of directors of this organisation has not met in nearly 12 months.  In comments the Garda Commissioner made in respect of MTK Global, which made international news, he asked individuals involved in sport to cut all ties with that organisation.  Does that extend to amateur boxing?  Should the IABA make a statement on the matter?  It is an issue the Minister of State with responsibility for sport needs to deal with.  It has been going on for a number of years and, to be quite honest, it is a sham.</p></speech>

Jimmy was a Member of this House for a period and a Member of the Lower House for many years.  He served the people of Monaghan and the Cavan-Monaghan constituency and was totally dedicated to their cause.  He entered politics as a member of Monaghan County Council, a position he held for many years.  He worked in the local co-operative, which was where he had his roots and from where he set out building a career for himself in both local and national politics.  The phrase that best describes Jimmy Leonard is "a true gentleman".  He was a real man of the people who served all of the people regardless of who they were, what they were or their political backgrounds.  The legacy he leaves behind him is one of years of dedicated service to the people of Monaghan and, indeed, County Cavan as well.  It was with great sadness that we learned of his passing.  His beloved wife, Tess, was by his side throughout their long years of marriage and was a great aid to him politically.  He had three sons and two daughters, one of whom, Ann, was also a Member of this House for a time.  I would like to extend a vote of sympathy to the entire Leonard family and to the O'Kennedy family as well.</p></speech>

One is 12-year-old P&aacute;draig O'Callaghan from Limerick and it is his birthday today.  Recently he was appointed Limerick Person of the Year 2021.  Every Monday he does a podcast and people should listen to this very inspirational young man because he motivates people.  He talks about his disability but does not allow it to drag him down.  The second inspirational young man is called James Casserly.  He is travelling around Ireland on buses and trains, including Luas, to assess public transport for wheelchair users.  He was on the BBC this morning.  I wish both of them all the best.</p> <p>In terms of a primary care certificate for someone with a disability, I have been contacted by a person who applied for a primary care certificate last November, was told in mid-November that he or she did not qualify and then lodged an appeal.  It is now the end of April yet nobody has been appointed by the Department of Transport to adjudicate on primary care certificates.  Perhaps the Deputy Leader and her office would write to the Minister to highlight this matter because delays are not fair to people who await a certificate.  The person to whom I refer is in their 80s, must use taxis because they have no driving licence and cannot drive because they await a decision on their appeal.  It is inappropriate that six months have elapsed and no qualified person has been appointed to adjudicate on whether this person qualifies.  There are many people in the same position and I would like the Deputy Leader to support this matter.</p></speech>

Next week, Assembly elections will take place in Northern Ireland and we are all too well aware of how long the parliament in Stormont has not been working.  I know from being in Northern Ireland canvassing that people are sick of politics not working there.  I believe that it is important that Stormont does work for the coming term.  In the context of a shared island, what happens there is very much in the interests of the people in southern Ireland because if we really are to have a shared future then it is important that we work collectively on the basis of democracy that works and on the basis of respect.  With that in mind it is timely that we ask the Taoiseach to come in here for this debate.  Let us hope that next week's election results in politics starting to work for the people of Northern Ireland, thus ensuring that their economy works, health services work and the cost-of-living difficulties that they all face can be tackled by parties that wish to do so.</p></speech>

The submission deadline was last December and people ran campaigns in local areas.  The Department made very good proposals on ways to connect different towns so people could reach hospitals, third level institutions or services.  Bus networks are even more crucial now as an increasing number of families have come from the Ukraine and live in different centres and, especially as some centres are located outside of the main urban areas.  These people need access.  I would like to know what type of mobility plans will be put in place for these centres and would appreciate it if the Deputy Leader arranged for the Minister for Transport to speak to us about these matters.</p></speech>

The Senator also mentioned that 23 April to 27 April is Organ Donor Awareness Week.  He stressed the importance of raising the issue of organ donation because it saves and improves numerous lives despite the tragedy that it flows from.  Finally, he requested a debate on crime and we will seek that debate at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

He welcomed the fact that the driver's licence issue has been resolved.  He also said that there is a need to establish a one-stop shop that will provide information and assistance to Ukrainian refugees as they arrive.</p> <p>The Senator spoke passionately about the leaving certificate.  I think all Members will concur with his remarks on the digital leaving certificate papers but also the particular story around a young person with a disability who is blind but was asked to read a picture in an oral examination.  The Senator was correct to suggest that there was a lack of cop-on in that situation.  The Department of Education needs to be updated on how it deals and assist people with disabilities.  I see no reason that digital leaving certificate papers could not be provided to assist anyone who has an impairment.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan informed the House that Senator Tom Clonan will join the Independent Group and, therefore, will join him and his and his colleagues.  I wish Senator Clonan and the group well.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan mentioned the forthcoming annual general meeting of the Prison Officers' Association, which will be attended by the Minister for Justice.  He expressed concerns about the plan to make the organisation an independent State agency.  He also asked for a debate on penal reform.  We will have that debate, at the earliest opportunity, with the Minister so he and others can raise issues then. </p> <p>Senator Hackett, who is a Minister of State, spoke about LGBTQ+ projects in her area that try to deal with rural isolation in the midlands.  Isolation is an issue in many rural areas and particularly for the LGBTQ+ community.  She spoke about shocking statistics revealed by a recent survey whereby one in five of those surveyed had been punched, hit or physically attacked in public for being LGBTQ+ and one in three had been threatened with physical violence.  Those statistics are a shocking reminder that we have come a long way but not far enough.  The Senator also referenced the tragic murders in Sligo and the assault in Dublin visited on that community.</p> <p>Senator Hoey mentioned a production by the Droichead Youth Theatre that deals with the difficult topic of cancer in young people.  I am sure that the topic was dealt with sensitively.  I, too, was unaware of the fantastic organisation called CanTeen Ireland that assists young people who are going through this ordeal and are on this journey.  I also was unaware of the statistics the Senator pointed out that in 1994 four out of ten people survived a cancer diagnosis and it was six out of ten in 2019.  That is incredible work and is a credit to the health service.  We do not get everything right.  We are doing well with cancer care but we can always do better.  The Senator was correct to point out that the level of Government funding for these supports is quite low.  I was not aware that only 3% went to youth cancer and that is an important statistic to put on the floor of the House.  I also thank her for alerting us to the theatre production and the CanTeen organisation.</p> <p>Senator Dooley spoke about staff shortages, labour shortages and labour movement.  He also asked for a debate on these issues.  He spoke about the shortages in the hospitality sector and how difficult it is to attract staff to the sector.  He spoke about the difficulty in getting long-distance truck drivers.  He spoke to hauliers in his area of County Clare and highlighted that it takes up to two years for work permits to be granted for these workers.  There is no justification for such a delay.  If we have a labour shortage then we must do everything that we can to secure permits and assist businesses to remain open and operational.  The Senator also requested a debate on labour movement and shortages.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer spoke about health issues, in particular about immunisation and vaccines and highlighted that we have only spent 0.2% of the health budget on immunisation.  He has asked for a debate on the issue and on vaccine hesitancy.  He put on the record the statistic that we are lower in terms of the uptake of vaccines like the flu vaccine than what is recommended by the European Union.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne expressed the view that the voting age should be lowered to 16 and said that he hoped the electoral commission would deal with the issue.  He also mentioned the sports capital grants scheme.  He acknowledged that the scheme had provided a record level of funding but that sports clubs are now having to deal with the impacts that the price of inflation is having on materials and labour, which, in turn, makes it difficult to deliver these projects.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is something we will have to keep an eye on to make sure that money can be spent and those vital sports projects in our communities can be delivered.</p><p>Senator Carrigy raised an issue around the IABA.  I do not have a response for him specifically on what should happen in that regard.  I suggest he raises the matter directly, perhaps through a Commencement matter, with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  That might be the appropriate avenue to yield the response he is looking for.</p><p>Senator Gallagher expressed his sympathies to the O'Kennedy family on the passing of Michael and to the Leonard family on the passing of Jimmy.  I concur with the Senator's remarks and extend our sympathies to both families on the passing of their loved ones.</p><p>Senator Maria Byrne raised the issue of the primary care certificate, which is a particular difficulty.  We have all had cases where people have applied for those certificates because they need them to assist them in their mobility and getting around.  She raised the particular issue of no adjudicator having been appointed from the Department of Transport to assess applications for certificates.  I suggest to the Senator, at the outset, to try a Commencement matter because it is quite a specific question.  If that does not yield a result, we will try to follow up with the Department of Transport, through the Leader's office, on that.  It would be a good Commencement matter.</p><p>Senator Blaney asked for a debate on the shared island unit, which we can request through the Department of An Taoiseach.  He spoke about the upcoming Assembly elections in Northern Ireland and the need to ensure that politics works there for its citizens.  We can all agree with those remarks.</p><p>Senator Dolan spoke about the connected Ireland rural mobility plan.  An update on that plan would be welcome to see where it is at.  There were many good proposals in my area of Mayo.  There is a lot of excitement around new bus routes and connecting towns because populations have moved and changed and people are living in different areas now.  We might request a debate on transport with a particular focus on getting an update on that plan.  We will try to get that at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

The<b></b>Government has been unequivocal in its welcome and I am proud to see that this approach is widely reflected throughout our society and in our sector.  However, facilitating the significant number of people arriving is challenging, not least for the education sector.  I record my appreciation for all throughout the further and higher education sector who have responded generously and openly, and supported my Department as it delivers its policy responses.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Niall Collins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2205"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2205&amp;amp;pid=NiallCollins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In line with the European Council decision of 4 March, the Government is applying the rights afforded under the International Protection Act 2015, which includes the right to access the labour market and education to qualified persons on the same basis as citizens of Ireland.  It follows that they will be treated on the same basis as Irish students where fees are concerned and my officials are currently examining how these students may be further supported, including financially, in order to facilitate their continuing education in Ireland.  We will be bringing a memorandum to Government to agree additional supports for qualified persons.</p><p>I have also tasked a panel of experts with creating a central help desk hub for Ukrainian students who want to continue their studies in Ireland.  This group, which is made up of key stakeholders from multiple agencies across the higher education system, is working towards establishing the national student and researcher help desk.  The help desk will be able to direct students to a local college equipped to meet their educational needs.  In agreeing to fund this help desk, I know that it will be established by admissions and research advisers who will be very well placed to give the best advice to students and researchers arriving from Ukraine.  I expect the help desk will be operational towards the end of this month.  The situation in Ukraine is having profound effects across Europe in all areas of life.  Most significantly, it is disrupting the lives and education of thousands of Ukrainian children and students.  In Ireland and across all European countries, Members are well aware we are already welcoming students and pupils into our universities, colleges and schools.  Our priorities in our education systems have to be to welcome, support and meet the needs of the students, teachers and researchers who are displaced.</p><p>I move to the cost of education.  As Members are all very much aware the difficulties students face, like those faced by so many others in society, have increased as a result of the increased costs of living.  For students and their families, this includes not just costs such as accommodation and food but also education-specific costs such as the student contribution.  I have regular meetings with the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and ongoing engagement with students across the country and hear stories of how these costs affect people.  The Government as a whole is committed to addressing issues related to the cost of living.  I have already taken significant steps to support learners and their families.  Effective from the start of the next academic year, the rate of all maintenance grants will be increased by &euro;200 for all Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, recipients.  I have widened the thresholds by &euro;1,000 to allow more people to apply for student grants and I have reduced the non-adjacent qualifying distance from 45 km to 30 km in order that more students can qualify for the higher rate of grant.  This reflects the increased costs for those who live further away from their colleges.  I have also put significant additional resources into the student assistance fund, including an additional &euro;1.3 million, which brings the fund to &euro;18.5 million for the current academic year.  It is also important to note that approximately 65,000 students either pay no tuition fees or a significantly reduced rate of fee.  These costs are covered by my Department through the SUSI scheme and last year, &euro;190 million was allocated for this purpose.  However, the SUSI scheme clearly does not cover everybody and there are many families who must pay out significant amounts of money each year to continue in third level education.  There are different options to address the costs of education, including lowering student contributions, but fundamentally these are decisions which must be made in the context of the annual Estimates process.</p><p>As I look towards the next budgetary cycle I will be examining all the levers we have to address the issue in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly across society.  Let us be clear today that this package must and should include commitments to reduce the cost of education for families.  Education is a fundamental right.  I believe in access for all and that we must remove all barriers to access.  I am also excited to speak to Members about developments in how we reform the funding of the higher education sector.  I will be bringing forward a proposal on a funding model to Government in the coming days.  It will be implemented as part of forthcoming budgets.  Implementation of this model will entail the sector delivering strengthened performance and enhanced outcomes based on a robust reform agenda.  This approach will be informed by the comprehensive economic evaluation of funding options that has been carried out under the auspices of the European Commission's structural reform support programme.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, brought this matter to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment shortly before Christmas.  This allowed the key issues to be explored.  It was agreed that the Minister and the Department would engage further with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and his Department to inform the Government's consideration and in particular to undertake technical work to update costings reflecting relevant funding decisions in budget 2022 and other issues.  This is nearing finalisation.  The work has sought to robustly assess the assumptions underpinning the economic evaluation and to take account of the significant levels of State funding that have been invested in higher education and student support in recent years.  It is our intention to bring final proposals for funding and reform of higher education arising from this work to Government very shortly.</p><p>We are also clear that from a policy perspective, addressing the sustainability of the higher education system must proceed in tandem with measures which address the costs of education as a barrier to accessing higher education.  We need to focus on both if we want a system that can be accessed by everyone and that can deliver the talent and skills our country needs.  With that in mind, I will also be bringing the review of the student grant scheme to Government at the same time.  The new funding and reform framework will be provided to the Oireachtas Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, following Cabinet consideration and will be published along with the economic assessment report sponsored by the Directorate General for Structural Reform Support, DG REFORM, on the sustainability of higher education and the SUSI review.</p><p>There have been many reports on higher education funding over the last number of years and our goal is not simply to publish the economic assessment but for the Government to make big decisions that will allow for a multi-annual, inclusive process implementation to commence.  The implementation process will allow for important input from stakeholders and provide much-needed momentum on the overdue implementation of key decisions that will guide funding and reform of the higher education sector in the years ahead.  I look forward to hearing from Senators on what will be a clear and hopefully progressive way forward.</p></speech>

There is a little bit of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>given we were discussing the question of higher education funding here yesterday.  I will come to that presently.</p><p>I begin with the situation in Ukraine and will raise a number of issues.  It is important we put on record the strong support that has been made available by the universities, the technological universities, some of the institutes of technology and the other colleges.  These have been places of sanctuary for many Ukrainian students and are doing everything they can to facilitate them.  It is important to welcome the efforts by the staff, students and leadership of those institutions.  It is important to ensure supports for students who do not have a strong command of English are made available not just to students but to others.  I am aware much work has been done on this by the education and training boards, ETBs, especially.</p><p>There is urgent clarity required with regard to the SUSI grants scheme.  At the moment, applications are being made under SUSI.  Normally, the students would be caught because of the residency requirement as they have not resided here for a sufficient number of years.  There needs to be clarity provided pretty quickly on whether Ukrainian students will be able to qualify for student grant support.  If that is the case, there are obviously going to be implications for other students who may not satisfy the residency requirement and urgency is required in respect of the policy having been fully thought through.  Recognition of qualifications is going to be especially important.  I ask of the Minister of State's office that regarding Ukrainian arrivals who have teaching qualifications, pressure be applied to the Teaching Council to make decisions quickly.  We have some highly qualified people here and the council must move quickly, particularly in areas where we have a teaching skills shortage and these teachers could be of enormous benefit.  It is important we get clarity in those spaces.</p><p>Many Ukrainian students are continuing to pursue their course with their home university but are doing it in an online environment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is essential that wherever the displaced people from Ukraine end up, and some are in hotels and so on, they have access to the necessary laptops and other equipment and adequate broadband to ensure that they are able access the courses being delivered online from their home universities.  Certainly, I know there are moves with regard to the provision of student accommodation over the summer but we need to look beyond that because, obviously, that is only going to be a summer provision for those students.  There will have to be clarity as to what will happen when the academic year resumes in the autumn.</p><p>One thing I also think is very important is that there are obviously a number of Russian and Belarusian students in our higher education institutions who, in most cases, want no hand, act or part in Putin's war.  It is important that there is an awareness of those students and that any attempt to discriminate against them is not allowed to manifest itself.  It is important that we continue to have a very open and tolerant higher education environment.</p><p>One thing I ask the Minister of State's Department to consider is its role and that of the sector on helping to rebuild Ukraine.  When Ukraine wins this war, which it has to do, there will have to be a huge requirement for rebuilding its education system right from the start.  In many cases, schools, colleges and universities have been damaged or destroyed but there are also going to be policy areas in which Ukraine will need help.  I ask that the Minister of State's Department start to put in place a strategy to look at how Ireland can contribute toward the rebuilding of Ukraine whenever this dreadful and terrible war finally ends.</p><p>I will turn to the issue of core funding.  I welcome the Minister of State's statement today, following on from his statement in this House yesterday, around finally addressing the issue of higher education funding.  It is absolutely critical that we cannot let it go on any further.  Those in the sector are tired of hearing this will be the year it will be addressed.  I am even conscious of the paragraph where the Minister of State talked about how "the new funding and reform framework will be provided to the Oireachtas Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science ... and will be published along with the DG Reform sponsored economic assessment ... and the SUSI review". The question I have is when?  We have been told these things are coming.  The sector can no longer wait.  I expressed that view to the Minister of State previously.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, said we should look at cutting student fees.  I have real worries about that.  If we just see a cut to student fees without guarantees that a commensurate amount of funding is made available to the higher education system, our system, which is under pressure now, will only end up in a much worse situation.</p><p>It is my view that in terms of priority funding, we need to address core funding and SUSI grant reform.  As the Minister of State pointed out very clearly in his contribution, a significant number of students would not benefit in any case from a cut to student fees.  Those are the students who would be best supported.  They mostly tend to be those experiencing socio-economic disadvantage.  They would be best supported by SUSI grant reform.  I wish the Minister of State well in his work.  I know it is a big agenda.  I need to stress to him again, however, the urgency of addressing the higher education funding crisis.</p></speech>

I am glad we have the opportunity today to talk about this and hopefully make some headway.  I welcome the Cabinet's decision yesterday to create a new sub-committee to oversee assistance being given to people fleeing Ukraine.  I trust this will provide a level of oversight which has so far been lacking.</p> <p>A committee is for discussion and debate, however, and what we truly need here and now is a leader in this regard.  I have called for it before and do so now again.  We need one woman or man in the Government to be appointed to call the shots and be the figurehead who will co-ordinate a whole-of-government approach to providing for the refugees we have taken in.  That might be a Minister for refugees or Ukraine crisis co-ordinator.  It does not matter what we call him or her, but we need one person at the highest level to take responsibility and have a master plan to establish co-ordination between all Departments and efficient communication down the lines through Government agencies and services to the Ukrainian people here.</p> <p>At the moment, it is not there and people are falling through the cracks.  Ireland held out its hands and opened its arms to these people.  Now, we must follow through.  It is not good enough to pat ourselves on the back for taking X number of refugees into the country if once they get here, they are put away into hotels and student accommodation.  We rely on local authorities, volunteers and businesses to take it from there.  There cannot be any passing the buck on this one.  We are talking about people's lives here and it is simply too important.</p> <p>When it comes to the continuation of studies for Ukrainian students, this surely must be a priority.  Many of Ukraine's universities operate or teach their courses through English.  English language proficient students must be allowed places in our third-level institutes and be allowed to continue their studies as soon as possible.  Those who are not currently proficient in English surely cannot be discriminated against.  Do we need Ukrainian course translators or personal translators?  Should our third-level institutions be offering regular high-intensity free lessons in English as a foreign language to get students up to scratch in order that they may continue their studies?  There are ways of doing this.  The only way we cannot go about it is to leave it up to the people on the ground and to the Ukrainian students themselves to investigate what options are available, or leave it to retired language teachers to offer their spare time to come into hotels and hold classes.  The people on the ground are doing Trojan work.  This is too big for that to be our response.  We need a synchronised Government response.  We need a Minister.</p> <p>Of course, when it comes to our higher and further education systems, they were not without issue even prior to the war in Ukraine.  Universities, technological institutes and colleges have long raised the issue of lack of funding as a major stumbling block when it comes to the carrying out of their functions.  I understand that the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has been examining the future funding of higher and further education over the past few months.  We all look forward to the report that will be prepared on foot of that.  It seems that the wishes of most of the witnesses thus far can be summed up by the phrase "more capital funding".  It would seem that we are lagging behind other member states in this regard, particularly in research and development funding.  I would like to think we can examine more specific solutions, however, rather than simply raiding the Exchequer.</p> <p>One such method of funding, which is detailed in the Cassells report, relates to what are known as "income-contingent student loans".  Before the term conjures up the bogeyman of American-style crippling student debt in Senators' minds, allow me to go into the system.  Income-contingent loans are automatically deducted from the graduate's paycheck on the basis of his or her monthly earnings.  This makes them low to zero for low earners, and payments only increase as earnings increase.  They are, therefore, designed to be affordable.  The income-contingent deal is, therefore, unlike other forms of debt.  Implementing a system of this kind could funnel millions of euro into the education sector from the business sector via graduates in a low-impact and sustainable manner.  So far, however, the desire seems to be for a fully taxpayer-funded system.  While this may seem attractive because it provides access to education at no upfront cost to the student, it is ultimately the most regressive approach as it entails the biggest transfer of resources from those who have not benefitted from a higher education, the lower-paid and those who have the better pay.  After all, there is no such thing as public money - only taxpayers' money.</p> <p>While we are still in need of a Minister with responsibility for refugees, we do have a Minister with responsibility for further and higher education.  As the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State approach the two-year anniversary of their posts, the future funding of third-level education still looms large as the enigma they must crack.  We eagerly anticipate what will come.  I thank both the Minister of State and the Minister.  Both of them have probably been the most progressive Ministers I have seen in a portfolio for a long number of years.  I really want to put that on the record of the House.</p></speech>

It is great to be talking about the measures that have been put in place to support students from Ukraine who are coming to Ireland.  We are not just saying it; we are doing it.  We can see this in every town and village in Ireland.  The supports are in place and volunteers are helping out in all the centres.</p> <p>There has been real accelerated change under the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  New technological universities are being rolled out into each region.  That means education is accessible in most towns in every county across Ireland.  That was commenced under the former Minister of State, Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor.  There is also reform of the CAO.  Students applying this year see further and higher education options along with apprenticeships.  It is incredible that this is happening this year and it all follows the establishment of the brand new Department.</p> <p>There also has been support for students and researchers through the Health Research Board, the Irish Research Council and Science Foundation Ireland.  That has led to a trust in science, which ensured that we had such a high level of take-up of the vaccine.  I cannot overestimate the work that has been done, particularly through schools over the past 20 years, with Science Foundation Ireland, SFI.  That trust has passed through.  Professors like Luke O&rsquo;Neill and Kingston Mills, who speak to us regularly, have become household names.  That is trust in our experts and in science that comes from the investment at primary, secondary and third levels. </p> <p>Now we face the devastating war in Ukraine and the millions fleeing conflict.  Last week, Roscommon was fortunate when the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee paid a visit.  We were able to visit the Donamon F&aacute;ilte Centre outside of Roscommon town.  The Divine Word Missionaries have provided the premises for use as a centre for people coming from Ukraine.  They are working with Roscommon County Council and with Shannette Budhai from the Roscommon Volunteer Centre.  Moreover, the Roscommon Lions Club has donated over &euro;10,000 to the families based there.  It is down to the volunteers and local authorities who have to fund these centres and support the people there. </p> <p>I met young men and women, some of whom were medical students, and doctors, paediatricians, software engineers.  I met young mothers with their babies who travelled thousands of miles to find sanctuary in County Roscommon and who left fathers behind.  It is the incredible resilience and strength of these people that I so admire.  We spoke through translators because access to language is a huge challenge.  We must be able to understand one another.</p> <p>A young man told us he would never forget what Ireland has done for them but I believe that it is we in Ireland who will be enriched by the people coming to our country for shelter.  These people wish to contribute to our community, to work as soon as they are able, and to be able to say thank you by their actions, as well as their words. </p> <p>We must also support students at primary, secondary and third level.  We need English language supports in schools and at third level.  This is something the Minister, Deputy Foley, has spoken about.  I welcome the one-stop-shop for all third level universities which the Minister of State mentioned, which will be hosted by Maynooth University that is co-ordinated through the Irish Universities Association, IUA, and the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA.  People will be funded there to support students.  It will be sort of like a help desk.  It is not admissions &ndash; I understand that &ndash; but hopefully there will be admissions personnel within the universities who will also work with us.   </p> <p>There is great demand in healthcare and there are many challenges in recruitment and retention.  The deans of the medical schools are currently undertaking an assessment of the programmes in the medical schools in Ukraine.  It is about how can they align Irish students&rsquo; programme with that which obtains in Ukraine, as well as a recognition of the medical and dentistry qualifications.  That will enable and encourage us to facilitate students to continue their studies here.</p> <p>Through the Government's recognition of people from Ukraine as citizens of Ireland under the EU International Protection Act, we recognise that they have the same access to work and education.  This requires a whole-of-government response.  We have already discussed recognising students from Ukraine and SUSI supports, which are increased by &euro;200 this year.  This means these students coming from Ukraine also will be able to access these supports.  The eligible thresholds increased by &euro;1,000 and the qualifying distance from universities and colleges has been reduced from 45 km to 30 km, which means more students and their families will benefit.  It is crucial that these things will make a difference to the lives of people who will be here with us in Ireland.  Then there is the cost of living fund and I note provision for the student assistance fund is more than &euro;18.5 million for this year alone.  There are student assistance desks for student welfare.  When we were able to visit universities, we were able to talk to the student unions on the importance of this fund.</p> <p>I have some questions for the Minister of State.  There are colleges of education in many towns and villages.  The ETBs support forums in each local authority.  How are these county liaison committees and the education and training boards working with local authorities?  Is the Department getting regular updates?  I also have heard that English-language assistance measures are being put in place, perhaps with adult literacy tutors.  Can the Minister of State speak about how that might be rolled out within the ETBs and the challenges that the tutors and trainers there might face?</p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned how there are more than 25,000 people here with us now, of whom two thirds are female and one third are young people under 18 years of age.  This is a whole-of-government approach.  Will the Department work with other Departments, including the Department of Social Protection, to perhaps look at a version of the rural social scheme, RSS, a one-year scheme to encourage young women to get involved with flexible hours in the local community?  They might also be able to work towards a qualification.  We have discussed the recognition of qualifications, which Senator Malcolm Byrne also raised, and that is crucial.</p> <p>Is the Department working with the Department of Transport on rural transport?  How are these people going to get to school or college?  I spoke earlier about the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan.  Will we have updates on that?  How will we connect people who might be in centres outside urban areas to link in with our colleges?</p> <p>Finally, I thank the Minister of State for his time.  I have heard the requests around a national liaison person who would co-ordinate between all the different Departments.  Can the Minister enlighten us on how the Department is receiving updates?  I am aware that the Cabinet receives regular updates from Ukraine as well.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-04-27a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1663" speakername="Annie Hoey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022042700002#R00200"><p>When I read the subject of this debate, I wondered whether it was statements on third level funding and the costs of going to college for Ukrainian students.  I wondered where the commas were.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to discuss this wide range of topics, each of which could have taken up an entire debate on its own.</p> <p>The situation around Ukraine is complex and ever-evolving.  No one knows how or when it will end or what it will look like.  I commend the Department on all the work that is being done on that in trying to support and facilitate Ukrainian students coming here.  The helpline is incredibly useful and very worthwhile.  Are there projections available on how many Ukrainian students will join Irish universities?  What are the plans for Ukrainian academic staff and how will they be facilitated?  </p> <p>Under the European Higher Education Area, EHEA, statement which the Minister signed on behalf of Ireland, we will be bound to make provision to allow Ukrainian students complete studies here once they have commenced.  It is really welcome and I commend the Department on signing that.  Has the Department done work with the Department of Finance on the cost of this and how that will be provided for?  We talk a lot about the cost of living and of going to third level.  There are additional costs around travel, accommodation, laptops, books and materials.  Are there plans for a separate funding stream or something through SUSI, for example, that would help Ukrainian students with those additional costs?  I have no doubt that the community will step in to support those students, as we have seen throughout the country, but will there be a specific funding stream apart from the waiving of fees and so on?  </p> <p>There may also be Russian students coming here to look for education, fleeing to Ireland as the conflict continues.  Has there been any conversation around support for Russian students who might come here?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On third level funding, I note the Minister's recent contribution at the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, conference covered the issue of funding for the technological university sector.  Does the Minister of State have more information on how that funding model will be structured and maintained?  There are a lot of plans afoot for funding models and what it will all look like.  That was the first time I heard the Minister talk about it so I wonder if the Minister of State has any further details.</p><p>I will move on to the costs of going to college.  In the first two years of the lifetime of this Government the mood music was that fees were too high - post Brexit, we have the highest fees in Europe - and that that was going to change.  That was the impression many people in the sector were under and it was certainly the impression the Minister gave.  Over the past few weeks that has become a lot more restricted.  There has been less talk of it and we seem to be dancing around whether fees will be reduced in any way, manner or form.  I have said this many times and I will say it here: either you believe further and higher education is a public good benefitting all of society or you do not.  There are no ifs, buts or education cuts about it.  It is a basic principle.  We cannot on the one hand talk about skills shortages and the fact we do not have enough doctors or people in the pipeline for various things while also having the highest fees in Europe, which are a barrier to people studying.  I was in the Chamber earlier when Deputy Rabbitte took a question on the Minister of State's behalf about funding and costs for graduate entry medicine.  That sum of &euro;16,000 a year is a colossal amount of money.  It is &euro;64,000 overall for doctors, which we do not have enough of.  That is crazy.</p><p>Reference was made to income-contingent loans.  When I was in the student movement, we did lots of reports on this based on international evidence.  I am sure the Minister of State's own reports will reflect this as well.  These loans result in crippling debt.  Young people are already faced with not being able to reach many of the milestones we would have previously considered perfectly normal, things like being able to buy a home, to start a family at a certain age and so on.  An enormous amount of evidence, from New Zealand all the way over to America, shows that crippling student debt hinders that even further.  We already have a cost-of-living crisis.  It would be unconscionable and incomprehensible for this Government to even contemplate income-contingent loans and burdening students further with that debt.</p><p>The Minister of State says there is a very clear way forward but it has been six years since we got the Cassells report.  I suppose we can all wait another couple of weeks but it has been six years now.  This report has gone around Europe and has been sitting there for quite some time.  I know we are talking about a huge amount of money but what is the way forward?  We keep coming in here and discussing this, saying we have to go forward and there has to be a funding solution and so on.  The whole thing is creaking at the seams.  We keep being told something is going to be done but what is it?  When are we going to find out?  When is the sector going to know what the funding model is and how it will be sustainably managed?  Without a further and higher education sector, this country will not be able to function.  I hope the Minister of State can take that back to Cabinet.  We could really do with an answer at some point as to what the actual funding solution is going to be.</p></speech>

We have taken note of everything they contributed to the statements here today and will follow up on some of the queries raised.  As we move forwards towards the Estimates process, we will be working with colleagues to advance the priorities of our Departments with regard to funding reform and support for Ukrainian students, as well as all other students.  The challenges faced by us are being faced by other European countries as well.  They are not unique to us and we have to learn from one another's experiences.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne has raised the Cassells report issue on a number of occasions, as have other Senators.  We aired this issue here yesterday and everybody mentioned it again today.  It is a priority for the Government.  That might ring a little hollow but it is being actively worked on and it is something we discuss regularly, weekly, within our Department.  It is not the case that nothing is being done about it.  It will be a significant improvement and a significant amount of money so there has to be a process.  I understand that it has taken a long time. </p> <p>Regarding English-language provision, Senator Dolan mentioned the 16 education and training boards.  We have tasked them with that provision and the Senator is looking for feedback and an update on it.  We will get that information for her and circulate it to all four Senators who are here.</p> <p>Some 59 Irish students were studying in Ukraine at the time of the invasion.  I understand 52 were studying medicine or were involved in medical studies and the remaining seven were involved in dentistry.  Mention was made of Russian students.  There are 154 full-time Russian students in Ireland.  There are 64 full-time Ukrainian students already in Ireland.  However, we do not have the full picture yet.  About 25,000 people have come into the country but we do not have the full picture as to what the demand will be from people presenting to our further and higher education institutes.  That is why the help desk is being set up.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has consulted with all the colleges and institutions of further education, as well as their representative bodies, to make sure everybody is on the same page.  It is fair to say everybody has stepped up to the plate in their willingness and readiness to accommodate these students.  Last year and the year before, by virtue of the pandemic and grade inflation, we had to find the wherewithal to provide additional college places in the high-demand courses.  At a time of crisis, that is, the pandemic, the system was able to respond positively.  I am quite confident the system and all our institutions and stakeholders will be able to react positively in this regard as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-04-27a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1653" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022042700002#FF00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p> <p>I am sharing time with my joint sponsors, Senators Chambers and Pauline O'Reilly.</p> <p>In far too many ways our criminal justice system is a cold place for the victims of violent crimes but none more so than women.  It is a very harsh system for women to navigate, especially when it comes to sexual and gender-based violence.  We know the victims here are mostly women and children.  Globally, one in three women experience physical or sexual violence.  At home, there were 855 disclosures of sexual abuse made to Women's Aid services in 2020.  That included 340 disclosures of rape.  Those were right here in Ireland.  The numbers are staggering.  The reason they are really staggering is they are probably only a fraction of the actual figure for sexual violence and rape in the country.</p> <p>Tragically, only half of the women who get to make these complaints feel they can get the help when they seek it.  In short, we have a system that effectively puts our victims on trial.  We have a system where a woman is expected to relive her experience of sexual assault as it is recounted in the courtroom.  We have a system where the victim is required to defend her own sexual life and sexual activities prior to, and presumably since, the assault.  This is all while testimonies and references in support of the accused are read out for everybody to hear.  Some of those references include stories about how the abuser, acknowledged at that stage in the trial as a rapist, is a great chap altogether.  The court might hear how he played for the winning team in the county finals or how he is a super team player and comes from a good local family or how he studied hard in school or volunteered for local charities, etc.  Absolutely none of that matters.  It is irrelevant.  It does not matter how much of a diligent worker a rapist is, or if he is a gifted sportsman or cherished volunteer.  It only matters that he has committed one of the most heinous crimes against women and that he is now guilty.  He has been found guilty of the rape at this stage of the court proceedings and therefore he is a rapist, end of, and that is all that matters.  It is high time we stopped pretending otherwise.</p> <p>In drafting this Bill, my colleagues and I worked very closely with Ms Noeline Blackwell, CEO of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  I genuinely thank her for her wisdom and expertise but most of all for the support she has given this Bill and the tireless work she and her colleagues give to the women and girls of Ireland.  We agree character references make the process of going through a trial even more difficult and strenuous for victims of sexual crime.  They are provided before sentencing as if in some way to mitigate the crime and make it easier for the offender to get a lesser sentence.  I have spoken to a number of members of the legal profession, namely, barristers and solicitors, who have seen time and time again how these cases play out.  They say despite the intentions of those who give character references in the courtroom, judges tend not to give them much weight, and for that I am genuinely thankful.  However, under our criminal justice system character references have almost become customary in the trials of those accused of sexual and violent crimes.  It is a pointless ritual that has no real effect other than to retraumatise the victim as she sits there in the courtroom listening to what a wonderful chap her rapist is and how he simply made a mistake.</p> <p>We have a justice system where the accused is innocent until proven guilty and for that I am grateful.  Above all, we afford certain rights should any of us find ourselves defending our good name and I grateful for that also.  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2022 does not seek to take away those rights.  It is simply trying to even the playing field in respect of cases where a woman feels she is up against not just the man who has abused her and his defence team but a whole congregation of other people who may sing the praises of somebody they think they know.  There have been too many instances where character references have distracted from the trials of people who have been accused of some of the most horrific crimes in Ireland.  In some cases, to distract even further from the crimes, high-profile people have put in character references in an attempt to somehow embellish the character of the defendant.  I am ashamed to say politicians have done it.  Community leaders like GAA coaches have done it and on occasion, even our bishops have done it.</p> <p>It is true we cannot stop these influential figures from providing character references in court but what we can do, and what this Bill seeks to do, is consider the victim who must sit in the courtroom and listen to these stories about the person who has caused them so much harm and emotionally scarred them.  That is why the first aim of this Bill is to ensure any character references made before the court are made under oath.  I hope this extra safeguard will make people take extra care and consideration when they are writing their character reference.  It might even make them think twice about submitting it at all.  Second, the Bill aims to make it possible for the prosecution to cross-examine any character references given in court.  One cannot just say what one wants and allow it stand as being truthful.  If a person is going to provide a character reference in a rape trial then it must be accurate and, more importantly, relevant to the sentencing.  The evidence must be related to maybe counselling taken by the accused since the rape took place to go towards mitigation but glowing personal references going unchallenged cannot be allowed.</p> <p>The aim of this Bill is to make a small but I hope meaningful dent in the enormity of the work we must do to support victims in their journey through the criminal justice system by making it less traumatic and less retriggering.  What we are trying to do here is much larger than just legislative change.  We are trying to change a culture in Ireland that puts victims on trial and has for far too long given our offenders an easy way out.  This Bill is only part of that change but it is long overdue.  I point out we have a female Minister for Justice and she has gone a long way in the last number of years to try to highlight this issue and address some of the changes.  We have three Government parties that are led by women in this House.  That is why it is an instructive and important sign to send out to the women of Ireland that we take this issue seriously and I hope it gives a sign of intent.  I commend Senator Chambers in particular for her successful result with the stand-alone stalking and strangulation offences that were acknowledged by the Cabinet last week.  For the person defending his or her name against accusations of sexual or violent crimes, having friends in high places should mean nothing in court.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Only the factual evidence should mean anything.

I commend Senator Regina Doherty on bringing this legislation before the House and I thank her for asking Senator Pauline O'Reilly and I to work with her.  It has been a privilege to work on the legislation.  It is needed.  It is amazing that the position has not been changed before now and this that trial process has been allowed to stand.  The Minister has heard from Senator Doherty why this has needed, and that she has full support for this Bill from Noeline Blackwell from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, who we all agree is exceptionally experienced in this area and has significant credibility.</p> <p>Sexual violence and rape are all too prevalent in society.  The victims are predominantly women and girls.  No matter how well we try to conduct it, the trial process traumatises and retraumatises victims.  Many do not come forward to report sexual assault or rape because they do not want to go through the justice system.  They have been put off engaging with it because of all the negative reporting over the years.  There was a recent high profile case, which we could call the Belfast rape case.   I will not go into its details.  Needless to say, we could all agree that any victims looking at that process would have been frightened to come forward to put themselves through a similar process, regardless of what one's view was on that case.  We need to work to increase the reporting of rape.  We know it happens more often than is reported, as Senator Doherty said.  We need to increase prosecutions so that victims can get justice.</p> <p>As Senator Doherty also stated, this Bill tries to level the playing field.  It is hard to comprehend that when a trial is concluded and somebody is a convicted rapist, there is a period before sentencing where people can trot into court to say how great that person is.  It is remarkable.  That cannot really be called evidence or testimony.  It is untested and unverified.  The victim has to sit and listen to it and has no opportunity to ask any questions or counter any of what is put on the record.  That is grossly unfair and unbalanced.  All we are doing is empowering the victim and the prosecution team to at least be able to test and validate what has been put on the record of the court.  I take on board what the legal profession has said.  As a barrister, I have witnessed some of these trials.  I know judges use discretion and do not put huge weight on these statements.  One then has to ask what it is all for, if judges do not listen to it.  Judges are human beings like the rest of us.  It is hard to say with absolute certainty that this has no impact on their decision afterwards.  Nobody could give that assurance with complete certainty.  It is important that there is an opportunity for the victim and the prosecution to test the veracity of what has been put on the court's record and not allow a complete free-for-all.  As Senator Doherty said, someone can get the local bishop or GAA chairman to come in and say what a great guy he is.</p> <p>We need to deal with the fact that so many women do not come forward to report these crimes.  The only way to absolutely assure an increase in both reporting and the number of prosecutions is to make the courts a safer space for women.  Unfortunately, we know that in a rape trial the defence will often - though not always - seek to discredit the victim by bringing her through the trial process, make her out not to be a credible witness and completely humiliate her, thereby making it really difficult for her to get justice.  We have to tackle that.  It is difficult, because one is balancing it with the right of the accused to have a fair trial and clear their name if they have been wrongly accused.  For the most part, it is very rare for somebody to make an accusation of rape where it is not true.  Nobody in their right mind would put themselves through that process without very good reason.</p> <p>Much is to be taken from the fact that three of the party leaders in the Oireachtas are women.  We have a female Minister for Justice.  Just this week, when speaking about the legislation on stalking and strangulation, the Minister reiterated the Government's position that we have a zero-tolerance approach to sexual crimes, sexual violence and rape.  If that is the case, then we need to do everything we can to increase reporting and prosecutions.  Until we redress the imbalance and address the traumatising trial process that is currently in place for victims, many women will continue to stay silent, to suffer in silence and to not get the justice they deserve.</p> <p>I commend the Bill to the House.  I thank Senator Doherty for asking me to be part of it and to put my name to it.  I commend her on the significant work that has gone into getting this Bill to where it is.  I have no doubt that it will get cross-party and Independent support from across the House.</p></speech>

I thank her office for the tireless work it has done.  I also thank Noeline Blackwell.</p><p>Character references come from a time when the legal system had strong views on who was respectable, and therefore worth believing, and who was not.  They come from a time when the opinions of other respectable people or so-called respectable people in one's community mattered and often translated into a view of who could be believed or not.  That time has passed.  We must ensure our legal process reflects that.  It is hard to pursue a conviction for sexual abuse.  The number of prosecutions is very low.  We need to ensure that we take away all of the barriers, both perceived and real, because it is difficult for a woman to come forward with these cases.</p><p>I will give a few examples of cases.  Putting what we are talking about in real terms is important.  Remember that these are all people who have been convicted of rape or sexual assault.  They are not cross-examined, unlike the victims, who usually have to go through an ordeal where their sexual practice, the clothing they wear and so on all seem to be up for debate and public scrutiny.  In Dublin in February of this year, 23 character references from across a community painted a picture of a good, respectable, hard-working man.  They described him as a dedicated, honest and trustworthy person after he was convicted of sexually abusing three teenage girls who were friends of his children.  In April 2021, in Dingle in Kerry, character references came from across the community, including from the GAA, in support of the character of a man who was convicted of raping a woman in her own home, which he was permitted into as he was a friend of the family of the victim.  In 2017, in north Dublin, a sports journalist who had worked for <i>The Irish Times</i>pleaded guilty and was convicted of the sexual exploitation and defilement of a child.  The offender groomed that child from when she was 14.  He sent her thousands of messages and picked her up from sports matches in order to abuse her.  Character references were provided by other high-profile journalists at the time.  These are just a few examples of what we are talking about.  These matters are in the public domain.</p></speech>

It is important to put that on the record.  We are all honoured by Senator Doherty's dedication in introducing the Bill.  Hopefully, everyone across the House will support it.  It is an honour to have a Leader and Deputy Leader of the Seanad who are women.  These are changing times.  The Seanad can be the face of and give voice to the change that we require in our society to move forward and truly protect women.  The three of us are also members of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality.  We will work tirelessly on all of the issues related to violence against women.</p></speech>
