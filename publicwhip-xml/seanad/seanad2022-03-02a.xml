I tabled this Commencement matter this morning to ask for an update on the funding for show societies.  We have 120 show societies in Ireland and they are a very important part of our rural fabric.  The show societies are, in fact, a great celebration of what we do really well in rural Ireland.  They are a real boost to the local economy.  They attract visitors from both urban and rural settings to visit these shows.  They give a flavour of what happens on the farm.</p> <p>In my own constituency we have a plethora of wonderful shows.  We have the Cork Summer Show, the Belgooly, Ballygarvan, Bandon, Barryroe, Bantry, Dunmanway, Carbery and Clonakilty shows, the Leap horse show, the Schull show and the west Cork breeders show.  This amazing line-up of 12 shows in west Cork shows us the rich heritage we have when it comes to agriculture itself.  Funding these shows is obviously a big issue.  Organisations and voluntary groups come together and work very hard to raise the funds to run these shows.  Insurance, as we are all aware, is also an issue.  The economic environment we have been in, particularly for the past two years, has been a significant issue for the show societies in raising money to run these shows.  </p> <p>I am here to look for clarity on how we can put funding together for the show societies for 2022 so they will have the opportunity to show what they can do.  These shows illustrate to society what agriculture is about, show the very best in animal husbandry and show different kinds of animals.  For a family man, it is a wonderful opportunity to go around and see what can be done at local level with regard to food, agriculture, machinery and livestock.  The plethora of things that one can get at a show is wonderful.  The 12 shows in our part of west Cork are very significant driver in our economy.  That is something we need to protect and work on.  We need to put a framework in place to support these show committees.  They are made up of lay individuals doing their best for the community.  I ask if the Government could possibly find funding for these committees.  I acknowledge that the Government did so previously when a line of funding was made available for show societies.  I am looking for clarity about where that funding is for 2022 and where we are going to go in regard to supporting these very important entities for Ireland and, in particular, rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Agricultural shows are a great celebration of all that is good about rural Ireland. They provide a welcome boost for local economies and attract visitors to support our rural communities.  Aside from the contribution they make to the rural economy, agricultural shows also provide a great outlet for local communities, both urban and rural, with local clubs and schools getting involved.  Agricultural shows provide entertainment for all the family.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=JoeOBrien&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Unfortunately, in the past two years, we have not been able to have these celebrations.  The reason being, of course, that agricultural shows had fallen silent, with activities in most instances having ceased altogether in the wake of the all-consuming pandemic.  This in turn had a negative impact on local communities and businesses.  Agricultural shows had, for example, become an important showcase for our agrifood industry and a great shop window for many of the wonderful artisan food producers and small craft businesses this country has to offer.</p><p>The Irish Shows Association is the official body representing Irish agricultural shows on an all-island basis.  Given the huge contribution these shows make to rural lives, the Department of Rural and Community Development provided an allocation of &euro;600,000 in 2019 to the Irish Shows Association to support the costs of running the shows that were due to take place the following year.  This followed on from similar funding provided in the preceding two years.  In light of Covid-19 and the unfortunate cancellation of nearly all these shows in 2020 and 2021, it was agreed that the funding of &euro;600,000 would be held in trust by the Irish Shows Association and carried forward to be used by the shows when they were once again operational.</p><p>Even though the shows were not operational over the past two years, they continued to incur operational costs.  Following a request from the Irish Shows Association, the Minister agreed last year that &euro;200,000 of the funding held in trust could be used to cover the costs incurred by more than 120 shows.  These costs were fixed and were required to be met at a time when the shows had little or no access to fundraising sources.  Such costs included web hosting, domain name, storage of equipment, renting of land and office space, and bank costs.  The funding to help cover these costs was a welcome boost for the shows at that time.</p><p>I am glad to be in a position to reaffirm support to agricultural shows this year as we emerge from the grip of Covid-19.  I understand from the Irish Shows Association that there is significant excitement and enthusiasm among the show committees in anticipation of the year ahead.  The remaining funds - some &euro;400,000 - held in trust by the Irish Shows Association will be available for the coming season.  The Minister also committed to reviewing the funding in place for the 2022 season and I expect that process will be completed shortly.</p><p>I would also like to take the opportunity to encourage people to attend agricultural shows this year.  They are not just a source of great celebration and fun, but they can be very educational too.  I believe there is a job of work to be done to increase the understanding of life in rural Ireland, not just in these Houses but across public life.  Those of us who grow up on farms or in rural Ireland and later move to the city have an understanding of both rural and urban Ireland.  However, I often think that people who have always been urban dwellers are missing out on so much.  Therefore, I speak to urban dwellers in particular and suggest that a worthwhile and enjoyable outing this spring or summer would be to attend a nearby agricultural show.  If people go on to the Irish Shows Association website, they will see that there will be a show taking place much nearer to them than they may realise.</p></speech>

The review that is in place for the 2022 session is very much welcomed.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on when that review will be finalised, taking into consideration that many of these shows will start in May?</p> <p>If the Minister of State comes to my part of the world, we have 12 wonderful shows.  If he gets the opportunity to call to west Cork over the summer, I am sure we could find a show very close to where he stays.  He would have a great opportunity to see what is wonderful about west Cork and the show societies we have.</p></speech>

I will be speaking directly with the Minister tonight on the Senator's question in terms of the review and the issues raised today, as well as the value the shows bring, particularly in their community value and their value in maintaining a key piece of our national identity.</p> <p>Numerous events are undertaken every summer.  They include the judging of cattle, horses, sheep, horticulture, dogs, arts and crafts, cookery, and numerous children's competitions.  It is recognised that the costs have increased to host these events.  The costs reflect the large range of activities that go on at the shows that make them so attractive.  It is a family day out and a showcase for local communities and requires local effort.  I urge people to go to at least one agricultural show this year, especially our urban dwellers.  In reflecting on my experience as a child, the Cork summer show was a very big deal and I have many memories of parking at the marina, the long walk down to the show, the flow of people going there and the various interesting smells, maybe coming from the chipper but from other things as well, when we got there.  It is certainly an experience I will also bring my kids to.  I will take the Senator up on his offer.</p></speech>

I also thank him for taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister.  We are requesting an update from the Department of Rural and Community Development on how we can support open access to school buildings after hours for communities and youth organisations through the CL&Aacute;R programme or other measures.</p> <p>It is very important to note that we have a ready-made network of school buildings and we have infrastructure that is not being used after the school day finishes.  How do we prioritise and ensure the CL&Aacute;R programme can be used to make sure that there is more access after school hours?  The facilities include community spaces within the schools such as halls, playgrounds, Astroturf, basketball courts.  There has been significant investment in recent years in school buildings across the country, and more is needed.</p> <p>We need to consider how we can ensure maximum usage, particularly in our smaller towns and villages, where there is not a large amount of choice when it comes to community or public spaces.  Our colleague, Deputy Stanton, is championing the use of school building and facilities outside of school hours.  As Fine Gael's education spokesperson, I support increased accessibility to these facilities, especially after the period of lockdown.  I would like to see how all age groups could use it, not just young people.  We need to think about rolling out evening courses through our educational training boards, ETBs, for digital or literacy training.  </p> <p>I understand there can be insurance, staff or other financial concerns for principals and school boards of management.  Under the CL&Aacute;R programme, in the context of the Minister of State's and the Minister's portfolios, how can we support schools to increase access?  Will the Minister of State provide an update?   Can this be made a prerequisite of the CL&Aacute;R programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-02a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1637" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022030200002#B01100"><p>I commend Senator Dolan and Deputy Stanton who have been championing the after-hours use of school buildings.  In addition, could we give further consideration to the use of higher education facilities, for example, universities or institutes of technologies?  The reality is that the usage of our school buildings and associated facilities, outside of school hours, would benefit and empower and enhance all our communities.  As a former director of adult education and having been involved with my community association, I understand the importance of community, as the Minister of State does.  The State is spending billions of euro in a multiplicity of Departments.  I would also include the RAPID programme in addition to the CL&Aacute;R programme, which Senator Dolan referred to.</p> <p>The Minister of State referred to "community value" in his reply to Senator Lombard.  It could bring added value to communities.  I would love if the State had an inventory of the money we are spending on schemes and, in tandem with that, if we looked at the number of community buildings lying idle such as schools, as in this case and in the summer time.  We could enhance and enrich the lives of many young people, in particular, across all communities.</p> <p>This is an important debate that we need to have.  It is a measure that could add value to our communities.  Having spoken to many organisations, the issue of insurance is a concern.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and before him the former Minister, Michael D'Arcy, made changes to insurance.  There comes a point when we have to take on the insurance companies, and we cannot use that as the reason not to.  There are patrons and bodies in schools, ETBs and so on, that are willing to come on a journey with us in that regard.  I hope the response of the Minister of State will be a positive one.  I thank Senator Dolan and Deputy Stanton for their work on this to date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-02a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022030200002#B01200"><p>I thank Senators Aisling Dolan and Buttimer for raising this important matter.  Schools are valued in their communities and not just from an education perspective.  They sustain rural populations and are often viewed as an indicator of how an area is faring.  They also provide a vital link for sports and social activity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=JoeOBrien&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Schools play a wide role in their communities and many schools make their facilities available outside of school hours for a variety of different uses and users.  Schools are often the centre of sustainable communities and there can be mutual benefits in building links with the local community.  Many schools recognise this and make their facilities available outside of school hours for a variety of community and other activities.</p><p>As the Senators may be aware, the policy of the Department of Education is that school premises and facilities should be used for community and recreational purposes, where possible.  In October 2017, following consultation with the relevant school authorities, the Department published the document, Guidelines on the use of School Buildings outside of School Hours.  The purpose of these guidelines is to provide information for schools on the use of school buildings outside of school hours and for those schools that are considering putting such arrangements in place.  Any decision to make school facilities available lies with the relevant trustees or property owners, having regard to the requirements of the school, staff and students.  </p><p>I very much encourage schools to seriously consider making their facilities or premises available to the wider community if they are not already doing so.  I recommend that schools study the guidance provided by the Department of Education as it provides a good framework and list of topics to be aware of when a school opens to the wider community.</p><p>As regards the CL&Aacute;R programme, it funds a range of measures to be delivered by schools and communities, including for the enhancement or development of play areas and multi-use games areas.  The CL&Aacute;R programme provides funding under a number of different measures for small-scale infrastructural projects in designated rural areas.  Under measure 2 of CL&Aacute;R 2021, &euro;2.3 million in funding was provided to support outdoor community recreation facilities, including playgrounds.  Many of these were located on school grounds.  This year's programme was launched on 24 February last with a total budget of &euro;7 million, an increase of &euro;1.5 million on 2021.  It provides for an updated measure which will support a variety of capital interventions that contribute to community recreation facilities.  It again covers playgrounds and multi-use games areas that might be located on school grounds, although it does not fund works to school buildings that are still in use as schools.  The conditions attached to the CL&Aacute;R programme require that such facilities be available for wider community use.  Many schools in CL&Aacute;R areas are willing to make their playground facilities available for community use and have received support under the programme on that basis.  The objective is that these facilities would be available to local families and visitors to the area.</p><p>I discussed this topic in the D&aacute;il last week and have also written to the Minister, Deputy Foley, on the issue.  I will continue to work with colleagues to see how we can support schools to become accessible where required.</p></speech>

The Minister of State mentioned in his response that schools are encouraged to make their facilities available for wider community use but we need something stronger to provide that where boards of management face challenges in that respect, we will engage with them to find out why school facilities are not being made available in certain areas.  The Minister of State will note from the CL&Aacute;R funding area maps that the CL&Aacute;R areas are dependent on district electoral divisions, which are based on the Pobal deprivation index.  It is mainly in the west and north west, with certain other pockets around the country, as the Minister will note when he looks at the map.  These areas do not have access to a wide variety of public facilities or much choice.  If there are areas where this initiative has not been successful and we are funding it through the CL&Aacute;R programme, particularly for community facilities, I ask that the Department provide an update on the reasons they are not being used.</p> <p>In respect of the report that came back from the Department on funding, is it clear that the school facilities are being opened for after-hours access.  I apologise to Senator Buttimer as I am not sure if he will have a minute or only a few seconds to contribute further.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Dolan for her work.  I also thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I commend him on his commitment to community development, not only in his brief as the Minister of State but prior to that.  Sometimes Ministers who come into office have no feel for the Department for which they are responsible but in the case of the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, he definitely does.</p> <p>The clue to the answer to our request in this Commencement matter is in the Minister of State's reply.  We are creating sustainable communities.  This ongoing development will hopefully lead to sustainable community development.  The Minister of State mentioned that guidelines have been in place since 2017.  The advent of public private partnership involvement with schools adds a challenge.  I hope we can develop this initiative and move it forward because it is one that makes sense.  I thank Senator Dolan again for her work.</p></speech>

It is important to thank schools that are opening up their facilities and to acknowledge they are doing this.  There is bit of work and an element of risk involved in doing that and we should thank them for it.  I reiterate my request for other schools to seriously consider doing this.  As I said, I have written to the Minister for Education and suggested we open up an engagement.  We could consider the guidance document and perhaps it could be reviewed and reissued.  I am also open to other ways of supporting schools that are not opening up their facilities to do so.  There may be potential particularly in the education and training board, ETB, area.  Other schools are privately owned so the ETB schools may give us more options.  This is certainly an area I am committed to working on and I look forward to receiving a response on it from the Minister, Deputy Foley.</p></speech>

It is one of the many jewels in the crown of the Office of Public Works, which I must salute.  Responsibility for the running of this wonderful heritage site moved from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine back to the OPW and that is the proper place for it.</p> <p>Before I go into the detail of my Commencement Matter, having taken some time yesterday to do a little research on the National Botanic Gardens in Dublin, it is worth pointing out the connection between it and Leinster House.  In 1790, the Irish Parliament, with the active support of the Speaker of the House, John Foster, of whom we have two major portraits in this building, granted funds to the then Dublin Society, now the Royal Dublin Society, or RDS, to establish botanic gardens.  In 1795, the gardens were founded on lands at Glasnevin.  A portrait of John Foster, which was commissioned by William Beechey in 1813, is hung below us in this building, although its ownership is another issue.  When these gardens were originally established the emphasis was placed on the role of horticulture in promoting scientific research, with a heavy emphasis on the study of agriculture.  The focus has now moved to ornamental horticulture and ornamental gardening.  It is particularly important to remember the origins of the National Botanic Gardens were in agriculture.</p> <p>As I said, the Office of Public Works is a wonderful organisation.  One of the best jobs in Government is to be the Minister with responsibility for the OPW, among other things.  One need only visit the botanic gardens to see major construction work is taking place on the Victoria House, which houses the very famous Amazonian aquatic plants.  It was built in 1854.  The Cactus House was built in 1890.  More recently, the Fern House was built in 1966 to replace an older fern house.  We have the great Palm Houses and Curvilinear Houses that are famous throughout the world because they were designed by Richard Turner.</p> <p>An amazing amount of work is being done on this unique place and it requires a lot of money.  From my recent visit, I understand there are three phases to the works and that phase 3 has not been finalised.  It is important we secure these unique buildings.  I ask the Minister of State for an update on how the work is progressing, the phases involved and the resources available for the works.  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister of State, his Department, the OPW and the staff of the National Botanic Gardens in Dublin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-02a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022030200002#D00100"><p>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about the National Botanic Gardens.  More often than not when I am in the Seanad to speak about the role of the OPW, it concerns another element of its work with which I deal; namely, coastal erosion and flooding.  This debate gives me a chance to speak on a lighter note about another element of the OPW.  The Senator is right when he suggests it is one of the best jobs in government.  I do not have to go outside this Chamber when looking for a testament to the role of the OPW, which did a magnificent job in restoring it.</p> <p>The Senator gave a good overview of the history of the National Botanic Gardens as an historic institution dating back to 1795.  He probably knows it better than some of the people working in the OPW.  It serves a scientific role as well as being the historic setting of some of the most significant cast-iron and wrought-iron glasshouses in the country and in the world.  In 1992, the OPW, in consultation with the gardens, produced a management plan which considered all the structures and facilities at the National Botanic Gardens and provided a blueprint for the phased restoration and refurbishment of the institution.  Over the past 27 years, the OPW has invested considerable attention and funding towards restoring and refurbishing buildings at the National Botanic Gardens.  This has included two major glasshouses, including Richard Turner's internationally important glasshouse, the Curvilinear Range, which was fully restored in 1995.  I recall there was some criticism of this project from people who walked these corridors at particular stages.  They referred to it at the time as a waste of money.  I am proud to say that the quality and attention devoted to this building earned the OPW a Europa Nostra award.  Since that time, the 1992 management plan has continued to deliver on many significant projects at the gardens.  These have included new buildings for the National Herbarium and its research library in 1997, a new propagation glasshouse range in 1998, the visitor centre in 2001 and the Glasnevin Cemetery linking gate in 2013.  The development of a series of lecture rooms for the Teagasc horticultural college in 1999 and 2014 has continued the role relating to horticulture outlined by the Senator.  The restoration and refurbishment of buildings at the gardens included a faithful restoration of the Great Palm House in 2004, the Teak House in 2009 and last year, an historic gardener's cottage.</p> <p>All these projects were part of the 1992 management plan and very few works remain outstanding, which I am sure the Senator will be glad to hear.  Chief among these is the Aquatic House complex, about which Senator Boyhan enquired.  The complex comprises a Succulent House, a Fern House and the Aquatic House.  This last building was designed and constructed in 1854 specifically for growing the giant Amazon water lily, which was the botanical sensation of its day.  The reopening of a fully restored and refurbished Aquatic House complex as a new visitor attraction, which is a hugely important part of what the OPW does, will provide a restoration fit for the 21st century to enhance research and display at the National Botanic Gardens.  A really important part of what we are doing is for the local community in that part of Glasnevin as well, bringing tourists to that part of the north side of the city.  </p> <p>As well as strengthening the ability of the National Botanic Gardens to carry out plant research and propagation, a priority for this range will be its long-term energy efficiency and sustainable construction.  I am happy to report that a design brief is well advanced.  As with previous projects, the OPW is taking a phased approach to secure these historic structures, which will ensure their appropriate and sustainable development into the future.  Phase 1, which began in July 2020, is now complete and involved the removal of all dangerous structures.  In phase 2, the OPW plans to faithfully restore the Cactus House and the Water Lily House and provide a new redeveloped Fern House.  The OPW's project oversight group approved the business case for phase 2 in April 2021 . In the next few months, we intend to appoint a design team and to seek planning approval for the works.  We hope to have the detailed design signed off and will then proceed to seeking tenders in the last quarter of 2022.  Construction will take approximately 18 months.  The quantitative estimates at present are of the order of &euro;13.8 million.  The OPW will submit a planning application in the fourth quarter of 2022 and go to tender in 2023.  It is estimated that site works will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p></speech>

I will go from here to spread the Minister of State's good news to all the horticultural magazines and publications in the country.  It is a wonderful organisation and something of which we can be extremely proud.  I am delighted to see that this phased programme is continuing and that money is in place.  Clearly, tenders and planning issues must be addressed.  I also want to flag the fact that this is a free facility.  There is no charge to go into the National Botanic Gardens.  The politician I meet most there is Bertie Ahern.  To be fair, I acknowledge that it was his constituency.  As the Minister of State rightly noted, it feeds into the community.  If you are doing nothing on a Sunday afternoon, you are guaranteed to meet Bertie Ahern there.  He is hugely proud of it as a former Deputy for the locality.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State.  This is exceptional.  Let us be mindful of how we can promote these gardens.  I visit botanic gardens all over the world.  It is one of my great interests.  The gardens in Kew, Edinburgh and Dublin are three of the best botanic gardens in the world and we should be proud of them.  There is a huge garden and horticultural industry in this country.  International tourists come to this country to look at these gardens.  It is a gem, one of the many gems in the OPW portfolio.  I wish the Minister of State well and thank him for his very comprehensive and positive answer.  This is really good news and I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.</p></speech>

The OPW's investment programme for our heritage portfolio, along with its partners in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, requires a lot of money but we are investing heavily in it.  I pay tribute to the OPW staff who operate that facility, the architects, the design team and everybody else behind the scenes of the management plan.  During the summer, the Senator will have seen that the National Botanic Gardens played a very important part in the series of programmes on Ireland's historic gardens.  We hope that series runs into the future because the Senator is right that it is about more than providing research opportunities.  It is also presents a very important opportunity for tourism promotion in that part of Dublin.  The OPW is very proud of its investment in heritage in that part of Dublin and looks forward to making sure this project is finished in the very near future.</p></speech>

I tabled this Commencement matter to get some clarity on the record regarding what is happening with Sruth&aacute;n House.  The Minister of State and I know so many families affected by closures of adult day services and adult respite services over the course of the pandemic.  As we all know, it was a really difficult time for so many people.  I wanted to ensure accurate information was made available and to find out why respite services at Sruth&aacute;n House were and remain closed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and her officials have done great work over the past number of months.  Like all respite services, Sruth&aacute;n House was a lifeline for so many people.  I have been in contact with families with regard to Sruth&aacute;n House going back to my days as a member of Louth County Council and have worked with Department officials since I entered this House in order to make sure we have adult respite services in Dundalk and north Louth.</p> <p>When the pandemic hit, like all respite services, the service at Sruth&aacute;n House was closed.  It did not reopen because the building was not suitable due to social distancing requirements.  We have really positive news this week.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response and hope she can give the House details of the new adult respite service in Dundalk, the facilities, the timelines for connecting with individuals who wish to use the services, when they will get to see the building and, more importantly, when will they get to use it.</p></speech>

Given her absence on official duties, I will provide an update on the matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  The HSE has advised that due to public health advice issued at the onset of the Covid pandemic, an environmental risk assessment was carried out at Sruth&aacute;n House to establish the suitability of the facility.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That assessment established that the facility presented an unacceptably high level of risk for respite care.  These risks included insufficient space in the premises to implement required infection control measures insufficient space in specific areas to comply with social distancing guidelines between service users due to layout, and non-compliance with national public health emergency team guidelines if service users were to attend for respite.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed the provision of outreach and alternative respite has continued while Sruth&aacute;n House is closed to respite.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities fully appreciates the concerns of service users and their families in respect of this closure, and it is an issue the HSE has been working to resolve.  The Minister acknowledges the advocacy of Senator McGreehan, who has advocated for this premises for many years, including when she was a councillor, as she stated.  I know it is very dear to her heart and it is great we have positive news today.  I thank her for all the work she has done, along with the other local representatives, in calling for a solution to be found to this matter.  Indeed, the issue of Sruth&aacute;n House was raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, during her visit to Dundalk and the Cooley Peninsula on Monday.</p><p>In this context, I can inform the House that the HSE, through its Louth disability service, is in discussions with a provider to develop alternative suitable accommodation to deliver this service.  I am pleased to report the HSE has advised that a location has been sourced and is currently undergoing renovation works to ensure HIQA compliance.  It is anticipated the works will be completed shortly, allowing the service to be recommenced by the end of the first quarter of 2022, that is, by the end of this month.  That is really positive for the service users.  The HSE has confirmed it has plans to issue communications with relevant details to service users and their families this week.  I trust this clarifies the issue for the Senator and the House.</p></speech>

It is very positive news.  I congratulate and thank the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, Deputy Rabbitte, and the officials for pulling out all the stops to ensure we have an adult respite service in County Louth.  However, it would be remiss of me not to ask for more while I have the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in front of me.  We have this facility in north Louth.  I ask the Minister of State to bring back to her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the need to look into opening a second respite service in County Louth.  It may be the smallest county - the wee county - but it has the two largest towns in the country and a population of more than 130,000 people.  All present know there is a significant need for adult and child respite services throughout the country.  I hope that ask will go to disability services in CHO 8 to review and consider possibilities for a respite service in south Louth, given its catchment area close to County Meath and north Dublin.  There is large geographic scope for another respite service in the south of the county.</p></speech>

The priority is always to ensure the health and well-being of people with disabilities.</p> <p>The HSE has assured the Minister that the provision of outreach and alternative respite has continued while Sruth&aacute;n House is closed to respite.  The Minister has also received assurance that the HSE midlands-Louth disability service is engaging with a service provider to develop an alternative suitable accommodation to deliver this service.  While recognising that people have had to wait a considerable time and this has caused stress and concern, the Minister is pleased the HSE is now in a position to provide positive news in respect of the necessary measures to ensure an appropriate service is delivered to the local community.  It is anticipated the service will be delivered by the end of quarter 1 of 2022.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has committed to returning to County Louth at that stage and joining the Senator to open the service officially.</p> <p>I note the Senator referred to north Louth and the need for a second respite centre.   I probably do not even have to bring that request back to the Minister of State because I am sure the Senator has already addressed that issue with her, but I will do so.  I assure the House that the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities remains ambitious in her vision for the provision of disability services for people of all ages in the coming years.</p></speech>

Yesterday, we had moving debates about the crisis in Ukraine.  It is wonderful to see the effort around the island of Ireland to support the Ukrainians, including those who are trying to help family members to come here, and those who are supporting the Ukrainians who are staying in or fleeing from Ukraine.  It was heart-warming to see a photograph last night of a young girl holding up her train ticket and saying that Poland was not charging those on the trains.  That was a fantastic, altruistic effort.</p> <p>As a corollary, it is disappointing that Ryanair has doubled its air fares for those who have fled and are coming from Poland to Ireland.  I have heard this from a number of people and seen the evidence.  Flights that would normally cost less than &euro;200 now cost more than &euro;400.  It is difficult for those who are fleeing their homeland.  Many have little or no money.  Families here are trying to pay for them.  I know we cannot do anything about it here, but I felt it was important to raise the issue.</p> <p>Yesterday was food waste day, to make everybody aware of the issues relating to food waste.  Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Green Generation in Nurney with my colleague, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan.  What they have done there is incredible.  They are taking waste food from supermarkets and turning it into a gas.  It fuels its own fleet with that and generates electricity that goes back into the grid at Cush.  It has a sister factory in Clara in Offaly, which is able to make cladding, bollards and railway sleepers from wrapping.  It is incredible to see what they are doing.  It is important work.</p> <p>This country needs to follow France's lead in banning plastic wrapping.  We have been warned repeatedly that our seas will have more plastic than fish by 2050 if we do not change our ways.  Only 14% of plastic waste is recyclable, so we need to look at what we can do to change our consumption of plastic and decrease food waste.  A UK charity, WRAP, or the Waste and Resources Action Programme, spent 18 months researching the difference between people buying loose products and people buying wrapped products.  It concluded that selling produce loose, without wrapping, led to 14 million baskets of food not being wasted.  We need to go that way.</p> <p>The last matter I will raise is Caragh Bridge, which I mentioned here before.  I thought works were going to start, but unfortunately they are not, because of other work that needs to be done.  I asked that a survey be done of bridges in Kildare at that time, because both canals, numerous rivers and train tracks run through Kildare.  We need thorough research and a survey of all our bridges in consultation with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Waterways Ireland to do what we can to shore them up so that we do not have similar situations.</p></speech>

The Galway city to Oughterard greenway has taken a turn.  It has been reset.  It is a step backwards to go forwards.  The greenway has been funded twice, as early as 2014, and there were issues with acquisition of land and engagement with landowners.  The county council, in conjunction with Galway City Council, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and AECOM, which is a consultancy firm, have re-established the process and gone out to consultation.  I urge people to engage with the consultation questionnaire, which is on galwaytooughterardgreenway.ie.  That will be open until 22 March 2022.</p> <p>I urge people with an interest in this area to make a submission about their preferred choice of route.  This is part of a constraint study, which will cover an area from Galway to Barna and along the N59 towards Oughterard.  There is a starting point in Fisheries Field and a finishing point in Oughterard town.  After that, it is open to the engagement and constraint studies on this important area.</p> <p>I fully support the greenway development.  I believe it will be a game changer for tourism and for local people engaging in exercise and recreation.  Even more importantly, I think it will be a game changer with regard to commuting.  There are many people in my area, especially Moycullen and Rosscahill, who might work in the university or the hospital, and indeed students who attend National University of Ireland, Galway, or Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.  It would be a game changer for them to be able to cycle to work or university along the greenway, in through Galway city and Fisheries Field.  I urge people to get involved.</p> <p>We saw the south Kerry case in the Supreme Court two weeks ago.  It was a game changer in ensuring that greenways are viewed as critical infrastructure and can be treated in the same way as road projects with regard to allowing access to complete a project.  Two other developments have happened in the last years too.  The greenway strategy, initiated by the former Minister, Shane Ross, has been completed and published.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There has also been engagement with landowners, which has been a pivotal part of the project, and compensation for landowners has been signed up to by farm bodies.  That will give comfort to farmers and landowners when they are engaging with the local authority that there is a base price in delivering this public good, as it were.  I firmly support the greenway.  I hope that the reset of the project can be progressed as quickly as possible.  I urge people to engage with the public consultation and with the Galway to Oughterard greenway website, <i>connemaragreenway.ie</i>.</p></speech>

Today, I do not want to ask anything of the Deputy Leader; I just want to share some thoughts.  Earlier at 10 a.m., people of different traditions and faiths gathered in the heart of Leinster House to join in communion in the celebration of a Catholic mass.  It also happens to be Ash Wednesday today.  It was a great honour and a privilege to be invited and to participate in the mass.  It was important to me on a personal level to attend.  I know it was very important to the participants.  There were Senators, Deputies and members of the parliamentary family and community at the mass.   It was a very strong and powerful act of solidarity.  It showed very much our own communion with each other.  The mass was led by a Dominican priest, who spoke very movingly and with a great sense of humour.  We said prayers for the people of Ukraine and Russia, and indeed, for the leadership of these countries.  There are many innocent people in Russia, as there are in Ukraine.  The mass was an important show of solidarity here.  It represented to me our diversity and our respect for that diversity.  Long may that continue.  Long may that respect and inclusivity remain at the very heart of this Parliament.  I wish to share that thought with the Members.</p> <p>Over the past few days, I attended Westminster as part of the delegation to attend the meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I connected with an Anglican community at the church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields at the heart of Trafalgar Square.  A special ecumenical service was held there for the Ukrainian people.  Indeed, it was broadcast on the BBC.  It was so full that you could not get into the building or out onto the square.  At the end of the service, the vicar asked that people would leave the church and go onto the square to show solidarity.  So much of people's faith, tradition and heritage can sometimes be locked behind doors.  I wondered how many people would come out of the church.  The entire congregation came out onto Trafalgar Square.  During the three-minute silence, no words were spoken.  There was a sense of empathy and being in communion with each other.  I thought that was important.  As I left, I visited the Irish community in the crypt of the church.  I came across a sign that read: "No matter who, no matter what, we are here to provide opportunity, sanctuary and support for everyone."  I will finish by highlighting the enormous work that community did for the Irish people who went there in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, and for the many Irish people who are homeless in London.  They are a displaced people.  Of course, we will empathise with, and be supportive of, the displaced people in the heart of Europe.  We have had our own experience of people being displaced from the island of Ireland.  I want us to be mindful of our own history and of displaced people in Europe and Ireland.  Let us not forget that there are Irish people displaced in many parts of the world.  Let us use our political contacts to highlight and support their needs.</p></speech>

She is always welcome to visit us at any time.  I thank her for her presence today.  I call Senator Pauline O'Reilly.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the issue of the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, IPAT.  It is welcome that we have waived visas for those coming from Ukraine.  The regularisation of long-term undocumented migrants scheme is also welcome and is part of the programme for Government.  However, we must be careful that as we open back up, all the cases that were heard online go back to being heard in person.  People should at least be offered the option of in-person hearings.  Most courts are doing that, but I have been told that the IPAT is not, and cases are being heard online.  One has to wonder if this is an attempt to deal with a backlog by pushing through cases.  That is incredibly unfair to applicants who are seeking an appeal through that mechanism.  Many of the clients who go before the court come from direct provision centres, where they do not have privacy.  Hearings are conducted over Webex, which is quite flaky.  I have heard from those in the legal profession that it is a difficulty.  I am not entirely clear on why this is happening.  Perhaps the Deputy Leader can ask the Minister for Justice why the IPAT is continuing to hear cases online when there is no longer a necessity for it, now that we are out of lockdown.</p> <p>I would also like to raise the issue of the proposed citizens' assembly on education.   There has been a lot of discussion over the past few weeks on citizens' assemblies.  There are four included the programme for Government, one of which is a citizen's assembly on education.  Now is the time to discuss with the people what they want from their education system in an open way.  Many issues relating to our education system came to light through the pandemic.  I think the people would welcome the opportunity to discuss them.</p> <p>I met with representatives of Wicklow Democratic School earlier today.  It is a small school that does not follow the curriculum, but instead engages with students to find what it is that they want in their curriculum, and mentors young people.  The school would very much like to be recognised.  It is recognised and supported to an extent, but it would like to be in the State system.  Unfortunately, schools do not get State support unless they follow the Irish curriculum that is long overdue reform.  I would like to bring the issue to the attention of other Oireachtas Members.  I encourage them to look up democratic schooling.  It is something that I feel very passionate about.  If we look at all of the different models and what is working across the State, we will find, in pockets around the country, people who are taking a step forward before the Department of Education.  That could be a model to work from when we are looking at how we reform this country.</p></speech>

Brian Teeling and Emma Roche have both instructed the National Gallery of Ireland to remove their works from the walls of the gallery.  By doing so, they have put their practices at considerable risk to protest the fact that the National Gallery of Ireland has contracted the US company Aramark to take over the caf&eacute; on Merrion Square.  I was absolutely dismayed at the decision by a leading cultural institution to offer its caf&eacute; to a company that profits from the inhumane system of direct provision, and even more so, because it completely undermines the work of the National Gallery of Ireland in its diversity, access and inclusion programme that is led by the very good education team and that included a recent exhibition created with people currently and formerly living in direct provision.  The sheer hypocrisy is staggering.  I commend the staff of the gallery who have spoken out internally in their workplace and the 84 artists who have put their names to an open letter to the board of the National Gallery.  As the letter points out, and as we all know, 7,000 people remain in direct provision, 1,761 of whom have permission to remain in Ireland.  For them, direct provision has become a system of emergency accommodation.  The National Gallery of Ireland needs to show leadership.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The procurement process required all contractors to ensure they did not damage the institution's reputation.

It is dominating everyone's thoughts and the news agenda.  It is horrific and it is worth reiterating that point.</p> <p>I want to talk about the calls from my party colleague, Deputy Bacik, on behalf of those people who are fleeing Ukraine and travelling to its borders.  The Irish Government must put pressure on our EU counterparts to accept various forms of ID at borders.  Some of the people who are fleeing do not necessarily have passports but many have national ID cards.  That goes for people who might not be Ukrainian citizens but who do have Ukrainian national ID cards.  That would be an important yet simple step in allowing people to claim refugee status and flee from the conflict in Ukraine.</p> <p>The second important step is to try to shore up the Ukrainian currency.  People who are crossing the country and fleeing are finding themselves at borders with neighbouring countries but their money is worthless and does not get them very far.  That is another practical step that we can take.</p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of land value sharing which is referenced in Housing for All and which was promised at the end of last year.  It has now been delayed until next year.  Effectively, it is a mechanism for the State to be able to realise the benefit of an increase in land value as a result of changes in zoning or infrastructural development.  The aim is to ensure that landowners do not enjoy a windfall from such changes or developments and simply flip sites.  This became a pressing issue when we saw a developer promising to deliver housing and getting local authority to rezone land, as happened on the Chivers site in north Dublin.  The developer then put that land on the market again, without actually developing housing, for ten times what was originally paid.</p> <p>In Dublin in particular, a lot of submissions are being made to the local authorities for land to be rezoned for housing and the local authorities will have to do so because of timelines in their development plans.  I urge the Government to put an emergency windfall tax in place this year if it cannot get the land value sharing mechanism up and running.  This will ensure that we do not see sites being flipped and land speculation continuing, which is increasing the cost of housing without housing actually being delivered.</p></speech>

There is space within procurement law.  It is not the case that EU procurement law requires us to give contracts to all.  We can, in fact, include human rights and other criteria and that should have been done in respect of the National Gallery of Ireland.</p> <p>I also join Senator Moynihan in highlighting the issue of refugees.  I call for a debate with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, or the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, on the need to ensure that refugees, and human rights defenders in particular, who may not be Ukrainian nationals but who are resident in Ukraine are able to access safety.  Today we will be debating a motion on Ukraine and I was very happy to add the names of the Civil Engagement group to the list of supporters of that motion.  The motion condemns the military aggression and invasion of Ukraine by Russia and calls for proper action in line with the UN Charter.  It was easy to support it because the language in the motion from the Government, and I commend the Minister for this, is very careful and thoughtful.  Unfortunately, the motion debated in the European Parliament muddied the line between the EU and NATO and had some opportunistic inclusions of LNG and so on.  That was unfortunate.  I understand that most people voted with the motion anyway but it was unfortunate that those elements were included in a motion that needed to strongly focus on international human rights law and actions.</p> <p>When the debate finished yesterday I had started talking about peace.  What we need to put on the record is that peace activists are some of the bravest people on this planet.  The children we saw in Russia who have been arrested for marching for peace, with flowers, are incredibly brave and need to marked.  Those who have come out and pressed for peace in other countries around the world must be lauded.  I lived in New York and I think of those I saw, a week after their city was bombed, marching against war.  I think of those in the cluster munitions coalition who came here when negotiations were taking place in Dublin.  These people lost limbs to cluster munitions but helped to negotiate a global ban on cluster bombs with the countries that had bombed them.  That is incredible and important work.</p> <p>Somebody who must be commended in this regard is former Senator and now MEP Grace O&rsquo;Sullivan.  She is probably one of the only people who has passed through this House who has not only boarded a hostile warship but done so unarmed and with a message of peace.  That work, that drive towards disarmament and the push for peace, is incredibly important.  That is why I am supporting the aforementioned motion and why I supported sanctions.</p> <p>I would like to see stronger measures with regard to Russian assets in the IFSC.  We support every diplomatic measure that can be taken but it is really important to recognise that the voice for peace, on an ongoing basis, is a vital contribution to humanity and to our ultimate future.  That is what the UN Charter commits to, trying to move away from the scourge of war.  We should remember that and cherish it in every way, as we act in solidarity with Ukraine and condemn Russia.</p></speech>

This was announced 18 months ago by the Department of Education and a temporary site was secured, with assurances that a permanent site would be identified.  This was after a long campaign locally, with many arguing that the school was needed years ago, but we still do not have a permanent site.  Despite several attempts to get confirmation from the Department, including through a Commencement matter in this House when I received assurances that we would get indications on a permanent site, that still has not happened.  It is completely unfair to the staff and students within the school, and also to parents and students who are considering taking a place in the school who do not know where that school will be located.  I ask the Leader to write to the Minister for Education expressing our concern.</p> <p>We are aware, in the coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, of the bravery of many journalists, including Mr. Tony Connelly of RT&Eacute;, Mr. Bram Verbeke, the cameraman, and Mr. Paul Cunningham who is on the Ukrainian border with Poland.  People who were listening to "Morning Ireland" would have heard Mr. John Sweeney of the BBC who had to interrupt an interview because there was a man waving a gun at him.</p> <p>While it is right for us to recognise the bravery of those journalists, we must also remember that journalists and those working in the media continue to be under threat all over the world.  I want to draw attention again to what has been happening in Hong Kong.  Last night, Mr. Tam Tak-chi, who is a pro-democracy activist and radio presenter, was convicted under the sedition laws in Hong Kong for the crime of criticising the Chinese Communist Party on radio.  This is part of a long-running clampdown by the Chinese Communist Party on democracy activists, including Mr. Jimmy Lai.  The International Federation of Journalists has now advised that journalists in Hong Kong need support.  More than 20 people working in the media in Hong Kong have been arrested and detained for simply doing their job.  We have often spoken out in this House against the abuse of human rights by the Chinese Communist Party and it is in that context that I once again highlight what has been happening in Hong Kong.</p></speech>

A lot of emotion was shown and a clear message was articulated by this House on the ongoing situation in Ukraine.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We now need to move onto more focused discussions on Ukraine.  We need a specific debate on sanctions.  How will the sanctions impact on us?  What is the role of the IFSC?  We all know if we cut the money supply we will have some chance.  We need to get an understanding of the sanctions, how they work and how we can play a leading role in ensuring sanctions are implemented to the letter of the law.  We also need a focused debate on what happens to the vulnerable people who succeed in getting out of Ukraine.  What will we do?  Is there a national plan in place to facilitate the thousands of Ukrainians who will come to this country?  This is with regard to practical measures such as providing shelter, food and accommodation.  We need to lead the charge in debates on these two issues.</p><p>We also have the situation in our own country as a result of increasing inflation and what is happening internationally.  We are seeing prices rocket.  I want a debate on the role of the energy regulator in regulating utilities and specifically the non-ESB electricity providers.  Recently I engaged with someone in business who signed a contract with Panda for 16 cent per unit.  He ended up being charged 34 cent.  The company pointed out the small print allowed it to do so.  It is appalling that Panda would do this.  What was even more worrying was that the energy regulator maintained it had no role in dealing with disputes on pricing.  What is the point in having a regulator if it has no role in dealing with disputes on pricing?  We need a debate on what exactly is the role of the energy regulator and how we can improve that role.  Clearly this will be an issue.</p></speech>

Murphy.  I look forward to the tributes to him in the full course of time.  He was a man who was unafraid of telling the truth as he saw it, challenging orthodoxies to enlighten minds.  His contributions in these days would have been very valuable.  He was unafraid to speak the truth about things and he kept doing it into advanced old age.</p> <p>With regard to Ukraine I welcome the fact we have had a debate but it needs to be a rolling debate.  This is an emergency situation.  We need to contribute in the House going forward.  Initially it had been scheduled for an hour last night.  I was not slotted to speak.  It needs to continue.  We are all of course united in deploring the dreadful evil of the invasion by Russia of Ukraine and the untold suffering that is being caused.  We all fear greatly the full horrors that may unfold unless people are got to the table.  It is great that European countries are united.  We must all gird ourselves to make sacrifices as citizens of these countries to support all humanitarian activities in support of the Ukrainian people, including those coming here.</p> <p>It is not a time to question Irish neutrality.  It is a time to emphasise Ireland's great tradition in being a voice for peace.  What has to happen here is that we must get to an accommodation with Russia that secures Ukraine's future as a prosperous, democratic and neutral nation.  In the fullness of time, historians may say the West made a great misstep in holding out the prospect of NATO membership to Ukraine.  On one reading it was always on the cards that Russia's response to those kinds of moves would be violent.  There is a lot that could be said about that.  What we can be unequivocal about now is that what has happened is deplorable.  It must be resisted, starting with sanctions, but with a view to getting Russia to the table to get an agreement we can all live with and that will spare Ukrainian people the horrors that may be on the way if we do not get around the table.</p></speech>

This will mean a 9 cent increase at the pumps within 48 hours.  I predict that by St. Patrick's Day we will have passed the &euro;2 mark.  We understand much of this has to do with the very unstable situation in eastern Europe, which seems to be getting worse.  Whatever happens, and we all hope there will be peace as quickly as possible, we are still months away from the stabilisation of fuel prices.  This will hit people throughout the country in urban and rural areas.  In rural areas, where we do not have the transport network, it will really come down very heavily on families in particular.  I know this is difficult for the Government but I suggest we should look at trying to freeze fuel prices for three months because it is a huge crisis.  This will have a knock-on effect on food prices, as we all know.  I understand fully the difficulty for the Government.  I understand it is a massive challenge.  I accept that we will all have to suffer a little if we are to stand with the Ukrainian people, which we all want to do.  At home the time has come to look seriously at freezing fuel prices for a couple of months at least.  I know it is difficult because the revenue is needed for other areas but we need to do something.  We will have a terrible crisis here in a very short time if we do not do something.</p></speech>

We seriously need to look at this.  I have a small station and I got a delivery at 7.30 a.m. this morning.  The price has increased by 5 cent a litre.  It is only on an upward spiral.  As Senator Murphy said we will be looking at a price of &euro;2 by St. Patrick's Day.  This is having a serious knock-on effect on the transport industry.  I have been speaking to people in the bus industry in recent days.  They have been severely hit by it.  They are day-to-day consumers.  We have to address this issue in some way.</p> <p>I have raised the issue of the N4 on a number of occasions.  The Deputy Leader is well aware of the section I am speaking about as she travels on it also.  The lead local authority is Westmeath County Council with regard to the design office.  Instructions have been given to the consultants that the funding is not there to continue with the project.  Funding has not been provided by Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  There are ten identified routes in play at present, particularly in County Longford.  We need funding to be put in place to find a preferred route, to continue the consultation process and put the preferred route back out to consultation so we can have a final identified route.  Let the people know where they stand.  A serious amount of land is frozen.  Family homes and farms cannot be built on.  People do not know where they stand.  This has to be a priority.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and TII must put the funding in place to allow for these projects.  It is not just the N4.  There are other projects in the south of the country.  My priority is the N4.  It is the most important project that should be funded.</p></speech>

I recognise that when people hear this there is little enough sympathy for barristers.  There is a misperception abroad that barristers are all very well paid.  This is true of some of them.  Those who engage in criminal defence work are paid through the legal aid scheme at the very bottom of the scale.  To give people the context of what this means, a young barrister can travel across the country to appear at a sitting of the District Court and the fee is &euro;25.20 plus VAT.  People should be disabused of the notion that criminal barristers are well paid.</p><p>There is a saying at the Bar that crime does not pay.  It applies as equally to barristers as it does to those accused of crimes.  The Deputy Leader and I have been in the courts together in Castlebar.  She understands where I am coming from.  This issue has been raised in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  There is a looming problem with the fact that fees for barristers have not been restored.  Depending on where people are on the scale, the fees were cut by a great deal and certainly over 30% for the vast majority of people.  That fee level has never been restored.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The result is that people are fleeing criminal law.  There may well be people watching this thinking that does not really matter because they are only looking after criminals but they allow the system to function; without them it would not function.  We know the difficulties created by delays and other problems in the criminal justice system.  The barristers working in that system, as well as the solicitors working in the system, require payment for their work because otherwise they will not do it.  They will work in other spheres and the system will cease to function, bringing more delays for victims and witnesses and in matters being finalised.  The time has come now for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to take the step of restoring pay for criminal legal aid for solicitors and barristers so the system can function as it was intended to.</p></speech>

We accept that flights from Ukraine have been suspended but there is a real need for airlines - not just Ryanair and Aer Lingus - but all airlines to look at keeping the price of flights for the Ukrainian people fleeing neighbouring countries as low as possible or even free so as to facilitate ease of travel for those who need it most.</p> <p>Thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing across the border to many neighbouring eastern European countries, including Poland, Moldova, Romania and Hungary.  Many of these people will travel on to Dublin and other parts of Europe for safety reasons to meet family and friends.  Yesterday on "Lunchtime Live" we heard the story of a Ukrainian woman charged &euro;500 for three one-way tickets from Warsaw to Dublin.  That is immoral in the context of what is happening in Ukraine.  This woman spoke about the barrier put in front of her and family when it came to travelling.  I am asking airlines, and particularly Ryanair and Aer Lingus, to ensure their fees and fares are kept at a minimum and are fixed or free for those Ukrainians fleeing the crisis from eastern Europe into Ireland.  I am asking that we make that request as a House today because this is very urgent.</p> <p>My second request is to the Minister for Transport and the Government that Cork Airport be designated as a reception hub for refugees fleeing Ukraine from Poland, Moldova and Hungary.  We need dedicated airlifts in co-operation with carriers so work can commence to construct reception centres with medical, humanitarian, logistical and social welfare services for the people fleeing Ukraine.  I hope we can join together as a House on that today.</p></speech>

The international scene and international relations have changed fundamentally as a result of Russian aggression, so the time will come to have a mature debate about that in this country.  Looking at the refugee trains leaving Ukraine for Poland, those same trains are going straight back to Ukraine full of men.  Approximately 80,000 Ukrainian men have returned to their country to take up arms against a Russian tyrant and Russian aggression.  They have crossed that border.  We should, like all other European countries, be sending weapons to Ukraine.  I fundamentally and wholeheartedly believe that.  When faced with the aggression of a tyrant, we must meet might with might.  It is my very strong personal view on that.</p> <p>We speak about sending solidarity but then an Irish MEP has said that if we send fuel, it should not be used in military vehicles.  Tell that to the Ukrainians flattened by Russian tanks and air strikes.  Tell that to the women and children of Ukraine who are being slaughtered in the streets as a result of Russian aggression.  We should be sending them our Javelin missiles and not our solidarity.  That is my very strong and deeply held belief.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, has said it may not be a good idea to have knee-jerk reactions.  We need to meet the occasion of the moment and send weapons to people who need them drastically in order to stop Putin and his Russian aggression.  After that we must have an open debate.  Neutrality is not sacrosanct or a sacred cow.  We should not be afraid to debate such matters and we have debated some major issues in the past five or six years in this country that people fundamentally agreed or disagreed upon.  The concept of Irish neutrality should not be a debate that is off the table or not discussed.  Let us be mature about this and have the discussion.  If the debate is lost, that is all well and good, but we should not shy away or be afraid of such a debate on Irish neutrality.</p></speech>

We have learned much from the Fridays for the Future movement and the suggestions that young people can bring forward.  She suggested that following her learning experience through Covid-19, there should be a suggestion box for young people to put forward ideas on how to develop a better Limerick.  It is something that should be looked at right across Ireland because we have so much to learn from our young people and their experiences and thoughts.</p> <p>The main reason I rise today is to welcome the amalgamation between the Technological University of the Shannon, TUS, and UPMC, which is a leading medical company, in order to set up sports injury clinics in Limerick and Thurles.  Students will learn about sports injuries and provide a service to both the public and sports clubs, which will be very beneficial.  The two clinics will include the TUS team, and athletes will have access to the most up-to-date functional movement assessments, scientifically-based strength and conditioning programmes, and clinical diagnostics such as MRI scans and equipment, all of which will help with recovery and athletic development.</p> <p>This is most welcome for people who are injured.  I know a young boy who had to go to hospital recently with an injury and was told he would be waiting 12 hours in the accident and emergency department before he could be even put through triage.  These clinics will certainly help the development both of athletes and people in the general public.</p></speech>

Speaking to people at the weekend, it seems this is a major problem we have ignored totally for the past decade.  We have the most beautiful beaches and scenery from Mayo all the way to Cork but the lack of public amenities at these beaches is a real disgrace.  Families going to a beach might have no access to an amenity, which makes no sense whatever.  We have spoken about a State vacation policy and investment in sports capital grants but I do not understand why we do not have a significant programme in place to have beaches and walkways included in public amenities.</p> <p>I can give a really basic example.  Sherkin Island is a wonderful part of west Cork, with a ferry going out in the morning and coming back in the evening, but there are no public amenities on it.  I have spoken to residents there and people operating the ferry, and it seems that for six or seven hours people may be stuck on the island with no place to go.  The lack of joined-up thinking is beyond belief.</p> <p>We need a really significant debate about how we are going to ensure our public amenities are more accessible to society, with access to toilets etc.  We are not doing enough in that regard.  In many ways, the local authorities have failed in this and walked away from the matter.  As a result, action must come from the national Government.  Funding must be put in place nationally to ensure we can provide such opportunities.  Currently there is no such funding stream and although there are plenty of grand plans, there is nothing on the ground.  I am a family man and we were at the beach last weekend.  It is appalling to think that in this age, a person literally has no place to go.  It is not good enough.</p></speech>

I am getting a number of calls from sports clubs in Tipperary eagerly awaiting confirmation of the funding announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Jack Chambers, two weeks ago.  We rang clubs to let them know the good news that Tipperary got &euro;7 million in funding, an incredible increase from the previous figure of &euro;1.5 million.  The sports clubs have been waiting since October or November, expecting an announcement, and we have gone past February.  They are thrilled they are getting the money but everybody wants to start building.  The prices of material and construction are increasing month on month.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Would it be possible for the Deputy Leader to find out from the Minister when the clubs will be formally written to or emailed to let them know that they are getting the money?  They should not be relying on me ringing them to tell them that they are getting a certain amount of money.  When will they get the formal email so that they can get the go-ahead?  This is very significant for clubs right across Tipperary and will make a substantial difference in terms of health, well-being and sport.  They just want to get the go-ahead in order to start.  If the Deputy Leader could do that, I would be very grateful.</p></speech>

Senator Moynihan put it very well when she said it is very difficult to discuss other items of business, given what is happening in Ukraine.  It dominates all of our thoughts and hearts in the work that we are doing.  Senator O'Loughlin made a particular point around Poland not charging people from Ukraine to travel on trains which is a great act of generosity.  In contrast, she also spoke about airlines, in particular Ryanair.  I do not have the exact details on that.  The Senator put details on the floor of the House that fares from Poland through Ryanair have doubled in recent days.  If that is accurate, I would ask the airline to reflect on its position and charge only what it needs to in order to assist people getting out and to safety.  I would say the same thing to all airlines operating flights in and around bordering countries.  They should assist people in getting out and not make profits from people trying to flee their homes.</p><p>Senator O'Loughlin reminded us that yesterday was Stop Food Waste Day and focused on a company, Green Generation, which is doing great work in reusing plastics to provide cladding on homes and in using food waste to generate electricity, which is something to be commended.  She also spoke about France having banned plastic wrapping on food and mentioned that research has shown that this can lead to a reduction in food waste.  Again, this is something to be looked at.</p><p>Senator Kyne requested a debate on greenways, blueways and walkways.  He particularly wanted to draw the House&rsquo;s attention to the public consultation on the proposed greenway between Galway and Oughterard.  That can be found at <i>galwaytooughterardgreenway.ie</i>and is open until 22 March.</p><p>Senator Boyhan spoke about the mass that was held in-house this morning for Members of the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas community, today being Ash Wednesday.  He said it was a very powerful ceremony to bring people together.  He also spoke about the meetings he had on the fringes of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly earlier this week, when he met with community groups that are assisting Irish people living in the UK.</p><p>Senator Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly asked for information on why hearings of the International Protection Appeals Tribunal are still being conducted online through Webex.  I suggest that the Senator might raise the issue as a Commencement matter with the Minister for Justice to get further clarity on what is quite a niche question.  She also spoke about the citizens' assembly on education and rightly pointed out that the pandemic has really thrown open the debate on how we want to conduct our education system, particularly in respect of examinations.  She said that the public would welcome a conversation and national dialogue on the future of education in Ireland and I agree with her.</p><p>Senator Warfield spoke about the decision by two artists, Brian Teeling and Emma Roche, to remove their work from the National Gallery of Ireland and raised concerns around the recent contract awarded to Aramark, a company which also provides services to direct provision centres.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s concerns.  It is disappointing that it has come to this.  Senator Higgins concurred with Senator Warfield&rsquo;s remarks.  If the gallery had looked in more detail at the procurement process and how the contract was advertised, there was probably an alternative.  I am unsure what can be done to reverse that situation but I have no doubt that the actions taken by Brian and Emma will have an impact on it.  I commend them on taking that stand.</p><p>Senator Moynihan and many others spoke about the Ukraine situation.  She raised particular issues around ID cards.  She said that national ID cards should be accepted for exit from Ukraine and for entry into other countries, as opposed to requesting passports, given that some people may not have had their passports on their person when they left home, or may not have had access to their passports.  That is a very reasonable request.  She further requested a debate on the assistance given to refugees, as did Senator Higgins.  I can confirm that there will be a debate in this House on 22 March with the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, who will set out his Department&rsquo;s perspective on what it is doing to assist vulnerable people.</p><p>Senator Moynihan also raised the issue of land value sharing, which has been delayed now until next year.  This relates to developers purchasing land at a particular value, getting it rezoned on the promise of building houses and selling it on for significant profits.  We all share concerns in that regard.  That is not what we want to see happening.  Any local authority which rezones land for the purposes of housing development, and on the basis that there is a promise to develop housing, does so in good faith.  That should be followed through on by the developer or the person who has purchased the land.  It is a loophole we need to close.</p><p>Senator Higgins rose in support of the comments on the National Gallery of Ireland and in particular the comments on Ukraine.  She spoke very passionately on the need to acknowledge peace activists and argued that we should try to focus on peace and not war.  She made particular comments around the UN Charter.  Many Senators would share her views on that.  She spoke about the cross-party motion which just about all Senators have signed, or are likely to sign, condemning what is happening in Ukraine and the Russian invasion.  We are joining with our colleagues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in doing that together.  She said that the wording of that motion was important and, of course, we know that words are important.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned that Gorey Educate Together National School is looking for a permanent site.  It is an issue he has raised many times.  I wish the school well in this regard and I hope it will get a resolution to that issue promptly.</p><p>Senator Byrne also raised the safety of journalists, including the many journalists reporting on the ground from Ukraine.  He mentioned that many journalists in Hong Kong are facing persecution for doing their jobs and said we need to support journalists all across the globe.  We must acknowledge that if we do not have journalistic integrity and protection for journalists, we do not have democracy, as the two go hand in hand.</p><p>Senator Conway called for a debate on Ukraine, specifically in respect of sanctions and how they will work, but also in respect of the impact here on Irish citizens and in respect of how we look after vulnerable people who are fleeing that situation.  There will be a debate on that particular issue in this House on 23 March.  Senator Conway also requested a debate on the role of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities which we will, of course, request.</p><p>Senator Mullen spoke about his former colleague, John A. Murphy.  I am sure that at some point we will have statements in this House on the former Senator&rsquo;s passing.  I join colleagues in extending our sympathies to the Murphy family and to all who knew him.</p><p>Senator Mullen also spoke about Ukraine and the whole issue of Ireland's neutrality.  I note that Senator McGahon took a different view from that of the Senator.  It is fair to say that the debate on neutrality has already begun and it had begun before the Ukrainian situation.  It is something that we should not shy away from.  Let us have that debate and conversation with our people.  Recent events have brought this issue to many homes and kitchen tables across the country.</p><p>Senator Murphy raised a very important issue around fuel prices.  He was joined by Senator Carrigy who has direct experience of the increases that people are seeing at the pumps, which are likely to increase and continue.  We are all going to have to keep track of this important issue.  As someone living in a rural area, I share the Senators' concerns.  Many people across rural parts of the country do not have alternatives to using their cars.  We use cars to get to work, get children to school, do our shopping and carry out general day-to-day activities.  An increase in the cost of fuel is having a very direct impact on many households and people are feeling the pinch.  This is something that the Government is going to have to look at.  I do not know what the solution is, but we are going to have to try to put some sort of a stop in place to try to alleviate the pressures there.</p><p>Senator Carrigy raised the fuel issue but also the issue of the N4, a road that I am very familiar with and which I travel regularly.  It is a tricky question because it crosses so many local authorities and is of differing importance to different parts of the county.  It is of great importance to County Mayo, perhaps a little more so than to County Roscommon, which also has the N6.  It depends on where a person lives in the west of Ireland.  It is an important piece of infrastructure.  This would be a good issue to raise as a Commencement matter to try to get an update on why this funding has not been put in place to do the preparatory works to get the road going.  It is true that it will be an important route for a significant part of the country.</p><p>Senator Ward raised the issue of barristers' fees in criminal defences.  I share his concerns.  I know from talking to many colleagues at the Bar that this is a problem and has not been addressed.  Other reductions in pay were addressed as we unwound the financial emergency measures in the public interest over the years, but this has not been addressed.  Regardless of people's views of the legal profession, including the perceptions referred to by Senator Ward, it is not the case that every barrister is making a great deal of money.  That is particularly so when one is starting out.  The view at the Bar now is that it can take seven to ten years to even make a living.  A barrister receives &euro;25.20 for doing a particular item of work in a criminal defence.  By any standard, that is low pay because of the hours that the barrister puts in preparing, travelling to the court, representing his or her client and then trying to get home.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As the Senator correctly pointed out, it is important because we are losing people from the profession to go into other areas of law or leave criminal practice altogether.  We are getting a reduction in the number of practitioners actually practising and providing services through the legal aid system to represent those who are accused, which is very important to the running of the system.  We are also losing experience.  There is a new intake all of the time of people who are very junior and who are learning the ropes.  We are losing experienced people who may have qualified five or seven years ago, and are crucial for the system.  It is an issue that I will raise directly with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  It is something we must look at.  Even if it is not an issue that exercises every individual, it is an important issue for us to address.</p><p>Senator Buttimer raised the issue of airlines, as I addressed earlier.  I agree with the Senator's comments that we need to encourage airlines to do the right thing and not overcharge.  The Senator requested a debate with the Minister for Transport on the potential use of Cork Airport as a reception hub for those fleeing conflicts.</p><p>Senator McGahon raised the issue of neutrality, which I have addressed, and asked for a discussion or debate in the House on that.</p><p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about a young lady in Limerick city, Olivia Chan, who put forward the idea of a suggestion box where younger members of the local community can make suggestions about how they want their city to develop.  It is a very interesting development and I commend Olivia on that work.  Senator Byrne also spoke this morning about the Technological University of the Shannon and its links with a medical company in the whole area of sports injuries.</p><p>Senator Lombard raised the issue of public amenities at beaches.  I understand this is a particular difficulty in some local authority areas where the provision of services is not happening to the level that communities are requesting.  This is an important issue to have raised.</p><p>Senator Ahearn spoke about the phenomenal level of funding that has been allocated to sports clubs this year through the sports capital programme.  This is very important money to every community, and it goes a long way for sports clubs.  Yes, we will certainly try to get some further clarity.  I am aware that a list has been published.  Clubs can rely on that publication from the Department as a guarantee that they have been successful.  The Senator can direct them towards the list.  The Minister's office is working to get letters out to the clubs whose applications were successful, and maybe also to those who were not successful on how they can improve their applications and come back again.  This work is under way in the Minister's Department.</p></speech>

The issue of the standard of proof to be used by the determination panel and the appeals officer being "on the balance of probabilities" has been raised by industry on a number of occasions, including on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and on previous Stages in the Seanad.  It was also raised during pre-legislative scrutiny.  The legal standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt" is almost entirely confined to criminal trials and is not applicable to proceedings of a civil nature where the standard used is the balance of probabilities.  This is the standard used for the points system and the legal position is that it is also the appropriate legal standard.</p> <p>The standard of proof is ordinarily and overwhelmingly on the balance of probabilities in several cases.  A higher standard of proof is required in criminal cases, which is that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  This higher standard in the exercise of criminal jurisdiction is because so much more is at stake in a criminal case after a conviction, with a possible custodial sentence and the negative reaction of the public that is marked by being found guilty of a crime.  The legal position further indicates that neither of the Crayden or O'Sullivan cases, which challenged a forerunner to this, SI 318/2020, was challenged successfully, and that the Supreme Court did not make any reference to "beyond a reasonable doubt" throughout those two judgments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Supreme Court did not take issue with the balance of probabilities and the standard of proof in any of the statutory instruments it considered.</p></speech>

That is why the balance of probabilities is being used in regard to defining a civil penalty, a civil penalty being the application of a penalty point on a licence.  If after accruing a significant number of penalty points over a period of time you get to certain thresholds, then there are penalties in terms of suspensions.  It is quite similar and akin to the road traffic penalty points system for drivers.  If you drove home today and accrued two penalty points on your licence, that would be a civil offence.  If garda&iacute; stopped you for a more serious offence and it was in the courts, you are obviously in a criminal situation then.</p> <p>We are the last country in Europe within the Common Fisheries Policy to introduce a penalty points system.  There is an obligation on us to have a penalty points system as part of an effective control system for fisheries.  At the moment the only system we have is the criminal system, so the only way to provide any type of sanction at the moment for any infringement that might happen on the water is for criminal proceedings to be taken against the fisherman or fisherwoman, for him or her to be brought to court and for there to be a conviction.  There is nothing other than that.  Obviously, the threshold would be much higher, as it always would be for anything that is criminal.  We have been in a difficult position in recent years because we do not actually have what the European Union regards as an effective control system.  We have a big gap because there are no penalty points.</p> <p>It would be akin to doing away with the penalty points system for road traffic offences and saying that, unless the threshold is met whereby you end up in court, there are no sanctions in between.  Ultimately, that deterrent factor and civil aspect within the control system would be gone.  We are looking to introduce that civil band to control fisheries.  It is an obligation on all member states to do that.  There was an obligation on us to have had that done by 2012, so much so that the EU has taken legal proceedings against us for being non-compliant and for not having followed through on our obligations and responsibilities as a member state.  Other countries within the Common Fisheries Policy have penalty points systems in place.  Ireland is the only one that does not.  Given it is a civil penalty and given this is about putting penalty points on a licence, were you to apply the same threshold that ultimately is used in the courts, then you do not really have an administrative system.</p></speech>

The Minister makes the comparison with the road traffic penalty points system, but my understanding is that if you appeal the penalty points in the court, you are allowed to have those penalty points quashed, whereas when we get to amendment No. 6, the right to allow the innocent to clear his or her name, you are not able to clear your name.  In comparing it to the driver penalty points system, it is a penalty points system in that the threshold is lower than it would be in a court case.  However, when it comes to a person clearing his or her name, it appears that is where the comparison stops.  Therefore I will push amendment No. 1.</p></speech>

It is purely administrative.  There is a requirement on us to have such a system within the European situation.  There are appeals mechanisms but they are not in the courts.  They are through determination panels, so a person can appeal, but he or she does not go to court to appeal it.  That person stays within the administrative situation, so he or she is not in the criminal justice system, and that person appeals the application of penalty points to his or her licence and seeks their removal.  There is that opportunity, outside of the courts and in a different appeals system, to seek leave to appeal and to have that appeal heard.  There is also the opportunity within the legislation for an oral hearing.  Each one of those opportunities is through the determination panel.</p> <p>In parallel with this administrative system, the old criminal system will still stay in place and is still there, so if a misdemeanour or a breach of the control or the obligation to stay within the rules is so serious that the control authorities believe it merits a separate criminal charge, that can happen in parallel and can be done separately.  While the penalty points administrative system will not have a criminal stream in the vast majority of instances, the two could go in parallel.  There is an appeal system within the administrative system for penalty points, and that can be appealed on a point of law to a court in terms of whether the procedure was followed properly.  If that point of law were to be found in favour of the fisher, then it would fall, but it would be only on a point of law that it could be appealed.</p></speech>

It seeks to delete &quot;an Irish&quot; and substitute it with &quot;a European&quot;.  This amendment comes from the same place of concern for the sector that it is being unfairly treated at a time when the Irish fishing industry is under huge pressure.  This legislation has significant issues as it is but it flies in the face of fishermen and fisherwomen who are out fishing beside the other European boats with larger quotas, less scrutiny on landings and a perception they have an easier time of it from their authorities.  If penalty points are to be applied fairly, then surely they should apply to all European citizens and not just Irish citizens as this legislation sets out.</p><p>We have been told by the Attorney General that we cannot discriminate against European citizens in legislation.  One example is the development of the renewal energy supports scheme where there was a proposal for part of a corporate-led development to offer a portion of a renewable energy project for investment to local residents, then to people in the county, and then State-side.  People would be able to buy a small share in their local windmill.  That was dropped on the pretence it would discriminate against EU citizens' right to invest, yet here in this Bill we see a distinction between legislating for Irish citizens and for EU citizens.  Therefore we are seeking clarification.  Does it not discriminate to focus on Irish citizens and single them out in a European framework?  Does it leave the Minister open to a protracted court battle?  Could the French and Dutch fishermen and fisherwomen in Irish waters be subject to the same penalties?  That is the rationale behind the replacing of the word &quot;Irish&quot; with the word &quot;European&quot; throughout the Bill.</p></speech>

The effect of these amendments, if they were taken together, would appear to be to expand the scope of the penalty points system for masters provided for under the Bill currently to encompass masters who are citizens of another member state as distinct from Irish citizens.  The amendments would require in effect that the Minister would have to set up a register to cover all masters from all EU member states and then that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, would have to assign points to masters who are citizens of other member states.</p> <p>In this regard it should be noted that the Bill provides that points assigned to a master who is a national of another member state should be notified to the competent authority of that member state.  The notification to that competent authority in another member state should include the identity of the sea fishing boat to which the infringement concerned relates; the name, address and any other identifying details available relating to the master of the sea fishing boat; the particulars of the serious infringement that has happened; and the number of points applicable for that infringement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The obligation, therefore, is on Ireland's SFPA to notify its corresponding bodies in the other member states of the offence that has taken place under the Common Fisheries Policy.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that, under the Bill, the same determination procedure applies regardless of whether the master concerned is an Irish citizen or a national of another member state.  In each case the independent determination panel and independent appeals officer, where relevant, determine whether a serious infringement has occurred for which points should be applied.  In each case the master concerned may apply to the High Court on a point of law, as I mentioned in my response to the previous amendment, in respect of a decision of any appeals officer.  It is only when this determination procedure has concluded that differing procedural requirements apply in respect of the assignment of points, depending on whether the master concerned is an Irish citizen or a national of another member state.<br/><br/>I should also point out that a similar approach to that which I have just outlined is taken in the context of the separate points system for licenceholders as provided for under the European Union common fisheries regulations.  That licenceholder system has been operational since January of last year.  Senators will recall from the debate on Second Stage that, more generally, the scheme for points for masters now proposed in the Bill follows inasmuch as possible the provisions of that existing and separate licenceholder system in respect of the list of serious infringements, the number of points assigned and the suspension thresholds as provided for under EU regulations.<br/><br/>The relevant procedures in the Bill, as I have just summarised, are the most appropriate means of ensuring the effectiveness of the masters points system.  Were these amendments acceded to, I believe that the result would be seen as contrary to the intent of the EU objective.  Masters who are nationals of other member states could have points assigned to their licences by the Irish authorities but could shortly thereafter potentially have points assigned to their licences by the competent authorities of other member states.  A master could therefore conceivably accumulate points in multiple member states, each operating separately, without ever reaching the relevant thresholds for suspension or disqualification.  The EU points system for masters would not be able to function in an effective, proportionate or dissuasive way if multiple member states were to assign points in respect of masters who are nationals of other member states.  That is the clear implication of these amendments, and such an outcome would undermine, in my view, the effectiveness of the system at both national level here and EU level.<br/><br/>The Bill follows the approach set down in the EU control regulation in respect of licenceholders by providing for each member state to assign points in respect of its licenceholders and for masters who are its citizens.  In that regard the Bill requires the Minister of the day to establish and to maintain a register of masters who are Irish citizens by providing for the necessary notification requirements to competent authorities of other member states, as I have set out and where required.<br/><br/>For those reasons I cannot accede to these amendments.  There is a system in place that is European and common across the EU.  For Ireland to set up our own separate and independent system simply would not be feasible, practical or compliant with our obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy.  Such a system would be separate from the requirements on Ireland and other member states and would not have any coherence or organisation.  Were we to take a different approach from the one into which we are feeding now, for it to work and to have any practical effect, it would have to be introduced at European level and the same system would have to be applied to every member state because everybody has to work from the same system.  If an Irish skipper or master were found to have committed an infringement in other waters, we would be notified and we would keep the points record in that instance, and <i>vice versa</i>.  If, however, there were multiple people keeping multiple records and they did not all join together, it simply would not work or be practical.  A proposal such as Senator Boylan proposes, therefore, would have to involve going back to the drawing board at European level and changing the structure.</p></speech>

It is down to due process.  The amendment seeks to change the Bill such that, even in the event of a successful appeal against a conviction on the balance of probability, the points remain on the licence and, in effect, the conviction remains.  I am still calling, even at this late stage, on the Minister to pause this scheme, revisit it and make it fair and lawful.  I cannot fathom why the Government is standing over a section that provides that even if an individual is found innocent of an alleged breach in court, the penalty points applied under this legislation would not be deleted.  We see this as a matter of due process and urge the Minister to reconsider our concerns about this.</p></speech>

The issue of points being removed where the master is found not guilty in criminal proceedings in respect of the infringement was raised.  This proposal would involve both systems being interlinked.  They would not stand alone from each other.  There would be separate systems involving separate standards of proof between the points and the criminal prosecution.  That would lead to confusion and conflation of evidence and render evidence inadmissible.  In addition, the legal advice is clear that points, under EU regulation, are intended as additional to criminal prosecution.  Accordingly, it could not be argued that Ireland has both criminal and points systems, as required under EU regulation, if we were to operate the system in a manner whereby the criminal proceedings completely eclipsed the points system and therefore made it redundant.</p> <p>For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

There are appeals systems in place within this new penalty points system.  If somebody who has points assigned to them feels that the law has not been properly followed, he or she can appeal that on a point of law to the courts.  If the point of law is found in his or her favour, the case falls in that instance if it was not followed properly.  What Senator Boylan is suggesting, however, is that where there is a criminal process in parallel to the penalty points process, if there is not a criminal conviction in the courts for that same offence, the penalty points should fall too.  That would then mean that the administrative system, the penalty points system, would be completely subject to what would happen in the courts on the criminal side.  Effectively, it would mean that no administrative system would be in place.  While it is possible to appeal on a point of law something that happens on the administrative side, there is a requirement on us to have the two systems running in parallel.  If we were to tie the two together, one would be subjugated by the other.  If we were to take that approach, we would not be meeting our obligations as a controlled authority and a State under the Common Fisheries Policy and we would not be meeting our obligations to put in place a penalty points system.  The European Commission has taken proceedings against us for being the only remaining EU member state that has not done this, and for being ten years late in doing it.  The Commission would have to continue to pursue those proceedings against us in the European courts for being non-compliant.  That is the situation that would face us were we to accept Senator Boylan's amendments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-02a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022030200002#Z00300"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to take part in this debate.  This is my second visit to the Seanad in a week to discuss credit unions.  I am encouraged to see the work of the credit union sector being given such prominence in public debate.  I watched with interest the Seanad debate on the future of banking that took place in May 2021.  I noted at the time that the role credit unions can play in community banking was raised many times during the debate.</p> <p>My aim and the aim of the Government is to assist the credit union movement to become a strong, resilient and collaborative movement in Ireland.  I believe that my appointment as the first Minister of State with responsibility for credit unions, together with the commitments in the programme for Government, demonstrates how strongly this Government supports the sector.  The programme for Government contains commitments to review the policy framework within which credit unions operate; enable and support the credit union movement to grow; support credit unions in the expansion of services to encourage community development; and enable the credit union movement to grow as a key provider of community banking in the country.  Those are direct quotes from the programme for Government.</p> <p>When I consider growth of credit unions, I primarily consider growth of lending in order to increase both their income and their sustainability.  The review of policy framework is a culmination of work officials in the Department and I have done over the course of the last 18 months.  During 2021 submissions were received from all the representative bodies and the Credit Union Advisory Committee.  I have met with all representative bodies; the registrar of credit unions; the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC; the credit union CEO forum; collaborative ventures; and many individual credit unions.  In total, I have held 27 stakeholder meetings with credit unions and over 100 proposals were submitted in writing.  A summary list of proposals has been shared with the credit union representative bodies and a final stakeholder engagement session has been scheduled for early March.  Legislative proposals arising will go to the Cabinet shortly thereafter.</p> <p>I would like to share with Senators some of the detail of the proposals ahead of their submission to the Cabinet.  I would like to give them a flavour of my thought process and the types of proposals likely to emerge.  The first objective of the review is to recognise the role of credit unions.  Credit unions have been part of and at the centre of local and workplace communities for over 60 years, tailoring their products and services to match their members' needs.  We will consider a proposal which recognises the role of the sector in developing volunteers and acknowledges its role as a large co-operative movement in Ireland.</p> <p>The second objective is to support investment in collaboration.  Collaboration is necessary for the sector to grow.  Even the largest credit unions do not have the scale to develop opportunities on their own.  In my engagements over the past year, I have seen evidence of collaborations already under way.  Sixty-six credit unions are now providing current accounts through collaborative vehicles, an increase of 15 in the last year.  Three collaborative vehicles have been approved to support lending of up to &euro;900 million to approved housing bodies.  Every credit union now has the opportunity to invest in funding for approved housing bodies.  That has happened in the last six months.  Nineteen credit unions are approved for the State's revised Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  Five credit unions have been approved for the Brexit loan scheme.  Involvement in these schemes is a great example of co-operation between Government Departments and agencies and the credit union sector.  The Government recently announced &euro;8 billion of increased funding for retrofitting.</p> <p>Credit unions' role as providers of unsecured credit makes them a natural partner of the Government to support our climate change agenda.  Many credit unions provide retrofitting loans supported by collaborative ventures.  Forty credit unions are collaborating with Cultivate to provide agri-lending.  Twenty-four credit unions have partnered with Peopl to provide general insurance products to members and many more provide assurance products.</p> <p>While there are positive developments, my message to the credit union sector today is to keep going and keep building on this good work.  The Government is prepared to do all it can and will act where it is appropriate.  However, it is also incumbent on all of those working in the sector, including representative bodies, directors, executive management and collaborative ventures, to be ambitious and to embrace collaboration and business model change as a matter of urgency.  Credit unions will not be able to take the opportunity provided by the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC without collaboration to grow current accounts and SME enterprise and mortgage lending.</p> <p>The third objective in the review puts forward proposals that will assist boards of directors to focus on strategic development.  The proposals have been greatly assisted by the research conducted by the CUAC on the role of directors.  This is a great example of data-driven research and analysis which greatly informs the policy debate and leads to concrete proposals.</p> <p>The fourth objective is to improve members' services.  The review takes account of the need and desire to keep improving services for members.  Members should have access to the widest range of services available and they should be able to access these services no matter which credit union they are a member of.  Those who have met me over the past 18 months know that I have carefully considered the value of the common bond to the members.  I would not like to see the common bond being a barrier to members accessing badly needed financial services.  The proposals put forward under this objective consist of practical improvements to the common bond.  This will assist credit unions in providing more products to more members, while protecting the essence of the common bond.  These proposals should help credit unions to improve their competitiveness by increasing the flexibility of some of the rules around the common bond.  Given the changing landscape of the retail banking sector in Ireland, now is the time to implement these changes and modernise the way the sector interacts with its members.</p> <p>The fifth objective relates to transparency of regulatory engagement.  There is a need for better co-ordination within the credit union sector in its engagement with the Central Bank and also with other State bodies.  The review will seek to include proposals to support regulatory engagement while respecting the need for regulatory independence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The review will not include any specific proposals to change regulations and-or regulatory limits. </p><p>I thank the Acting Chairperson and my Seanad colleagues for the opportunity to discuss the credit union sector.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-02a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1640" speakername="Pat Casey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022030200002#AA00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  As he has pointed out, we are again discussing a favourite topic of ours, namely, credit unions.  We all have some history with the credit unions.  I might sound a bit nostalgic when I say that my first savings account was with the credit union and the first few bob that I borrowed was from my local credit union.  During my lifetime credit unions have been an integral part of every community in Ireland and it is important that they remain an integral part as we move forward.</p> <p>We must recognise that the credit union movement is one of the most trusted brands among our people and maintain that situation.  Maybe, with the work that we are doing here and the work that the Government has committed to doing on the future of credit unions, we will talk about the credit unions being a trusted brand in another 60 years in this Chamber, and how successful and important that brand is to communities.</p> <p>The programme for Government clearly sets out that it needs to secure the future of the credit union movement.  With that in mind, the Government appointed a Minister of State who would specifically be responsible for credit unions.  I now acknowledge the work that the Minister of State has done in communicating with the credit unions during this transition period as we try to secure the future of credit unions.  I acknowledge the amount of time that he has given to the credit unions and the amount of engagement that has taken place.  I have seen on a one-to-one basis how he has engaged with credit unions.  I think that must be acknowledged because following all of that engagement we will have a comprehensive package and will know how viable the credit unions can be into the future.</p> <p>As somebody who has been in business, served the community and looked for money from credit unions I must say the following.  The one thing that is beginning to leave society is personal contact with lenders.  Our main banks no longer value personal contact and engagement because business is now done using a three-year business plan or a 20-page Excel spreadsheet that displays a load of figures, and one is given an answer at the end of the day.  The credit unions do something different.  They know the people in their communities and know the people they are lending to which is a situation that has value.  That value is missing from the main banking sector or it has been lost over the last number of years.  As anyone can see, there are fewer post offices in communities and fewer banks on the main street.  Therefore, it is vitally important that the presence of the credit union remains at the heart of every community.</p> <p>We have seen some significant changes over the last while.  We have seen that lending has begun in the business market, which is a positive change.  Asking small businesses to engage in the banking sector now, and go through the processes, reels and rigmaroles that they are asked to do, for what is a relatively small amount of money is realistically unacceptable.  Let me give the example of the building of the Brockagh Resource Centre in my community.  When extra funding of &euro;50,000 was needed to finish the community centre it was easier for the people involved to walk to the credit union and knock on its door because they knew who they had to deal with rather than go into a heartless bank, which realistically only wants financial figures and takes no account of the person.</p> <p>Credit unions have played a role in the Covid guarantee scheme for businesses.  Indeed, we have seen a further expansion of the role played by credit unions in terms of Brexit.  We need to build on all of that and extend.  These measures have proved successful because businesses have been able to access credit unions unlike the banking sector.</p> <p>The Minister of State said that the three credit unions have collaborated in order to lend to approved housing bodies.  I shall mention one of the most frustrating things when I was here the last time and when I was a member of the housing committee.  I will refer to the fact that we could not get the credit union sector involved in the delivery of social housing.  That was not the fault of the sector but the fault of the Central Bank and due to numerous other things.</p> <p>Today, I ask that we look beyond approved housing bodies.  We must consider allowing credit unions to engage with local authorities and allow them to help deliver social housing the same as we have done with the approved housing bodies.  I ask that because such collaboration is critical.</p> <p>We have announced the retrofit scheme.  It is another great opportunity because credit unions can provide low-interest funds so people can avail of the retrofit programme.  Again, it comes down to the fact that the credit unions will know the people who apply for loans and it is not just figures at the end of the day.</p> <p>The credit union movement is the one trusted brand in Irish society that we must maintain.  I acknowledge and appreciate the work that the Minister of State has done with credit unions.  We look forward to the credit unions being talked about in here in another 60 years in a very positive light, as we are doing today, because they are one of our most trusted brands and we must keep it that way.</p></speech>

He has been instrumental in bringing the credit unions forward in terms of how we do banking in this country.</p> <p>Now is an important time for credit unions in this country.  As we come out of Covid and the economy picks up again, the reinvigorated movement of money around the country presents great opportunities to examine our financial systems and improve upon them.</p> <p>There seems to be a joint understanding that the role of credit unions can be built up to better meet the needs of communities.  Last month, the Minister spoke about the need for the unions to fill the gap.  The further involvement of the unions in the mortgage industry would provide greater options to borrowers and help offset further consolidation of the banking sector.</p> <p>Last week, Senator Boyhan referred to the call made by the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, to the Minister of State.  He said that the league would like the Minister of State to make the regulatory changes to enable credit unions to increase their footprint in the mortgage market and that the unions be enabled to become key providers of community banking as per the programme for Government.  As the Minister of State then pointed out, last year the credit unions had a mortgage book of approximately &euro;260 million, which is a figure that has grown 26% year on year.  This is to be welcomed but it is a drop in the ocean when one appreciates that mortgage drawdowns hit &euro;10.5 billion last year, and 2021 had the highest volume of mortgages granted since 2009 and the highest mortgage values since 2008.  All of that shows that more work needs to be done.</p> <p>I understand that the Minister of State told Senator Boyhan that he would meet representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions and that legislation would come before the House in due time.  I hope that the legislation will be developed with input from the ILCU as well as the Central Bank.  I also hope that the Department of Finance will engage with all other stakeholders in a timely manner.</p> <p>More broadly, the role of credit unions in community banking can see development outside of the mortgage market.  A credit union can often provide a much more personal touch as it is staffed by locals from the community.  Such a situation can be of great value whether to the people who are marginalised, vulnerable or less comfortable in a formal banking situation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Additionally, credit unions offer an accessible line of credit for people with limited means.  They can use credit unions for small deposits and withdrawals, allowing them to save what they have and get a loan if needs be.  It allows individuals to have control over their finances that they otherwise might not have through a traditional bank.  I would like to see credit unions become hubs for their communities to help people with their finances.  They should be allowed to develop their financial support mechanisms.  An area of research and development which will serve to future-proof credit unions is in digital currency.  The decentralised aspect of digital currencies will allow further autonomy for personal finances and empower each individual to save, borrow and spend as they see fit.</p><p>The role the credit union has with regard to the marginalised is very important.  We do not want to see our credit unions turning into what we now know as our banks.  People who are marginalised, and those who may suffer from domestic abuse or be living in coercive relationships, may not have access to their own funding.  It is very important that we make it as easy as possible for these people to be able to lodge what they can when they can without too much red tape.  Credit unions throughout the country make a wonderful contribution to our economy.  I would like to see more credit unions having access to ATMs in towns where banks have closed down.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-02a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1695" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022030200002#BB00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to discuss this very important topic.  Credit unions are very much at the heart of their communities.  Within half a mile of my house there are two credit unions.  I took a look at their websites and what they have on offer.  One of them was started by the Redemptorists.  It is now an independent entity.  It gives everything but it does not give mortgages.  The other credit union I looked at has amalgamated with others to become a bigger entity than it was originally when it started in a local community.  It has delivered a very worthwhile service and many people have availed of small loans to improve their houses, for education and to start small businesses.  However, it is not large enough to give mortgages.</p> <p>In his contribution Senator Casey referred to the fact credit unions are a lot more personable than banks because there are still staff that people can speak to.  In banks now we are nearly speaking to a machine.  This is the difference between credit unions and the banking sector.  How many mortgages a credit union can offer depends on how much money it has.  If it has given loans to the SME sector it reduces the number of mortgages it can give.  I would like to see this area looked at.  While I understand the credit union sector should not be able to borrow huge amounts of money, people like going in because they can talk to the staff.  It gives certainty to people applying for loans.</p> <p>The Minister of State referred to the retrofitting scheme.  There is also the agricultural sector.  Many farmers and people have taken out small loans.  The fact they can pay them back over five or ten years is commendable.  It makes it affordable for people.  Some people might not be able to carry out the work in one go but they can talk to the local credit union and take out a loan and pay it back over an agreed term.  Credit unions are very good at looking at insurance and advising people.  This is what people need.  People who are not good with figures or managing their money can go into the credit union.  A payment plan can be put in place and the credit union works with them.  This is commendable.</p> <p>The work the credit union sector has done is fantastic but I would love to see it being expanded.  The Minister of State said he would love to see them filling the gap being left by Ulster Bank and KBC, which are pulling out of Ireland.  I would also like to see this.  We have to work with the credit union sector to expand its offering.  Older people in particular want to be able to talk to people about the work they want to carry out.  Credit unions have put many people through their education.  Recently I spoke to a family that had two members who studied medicine.  It is quite a costly course.  If that family had not been able to avail of a loan from the local credit union, those people would not have been able to go to college.  They were very grateful for the support they received from the local credit union.</p> <p>I began by saying credit unions are at the heart of their communities.  Many people who avail of the credit unions' services live nearby.  They are known personally to the staff.  This makes a difference because there is personal engagement.  Most people are in and out of the credit union every day of the week.  Online banking has deterred many people, especially older people, from going near the bank.  We need to expand the offering of the credit union service.  I commend the Minister of State.  He is committed to looking at the 100 observations submitted.  This is commendable.  I wish him all the best in his deliberations.  I look forward to hearing the outcome once he has looked at the observations to see what is being proposed for the future of credit unions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-02a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022030200002#BB00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  Public banking is core to Green Party policy.  The Minister of State has shown a commitment to looking at this.  Credit unions are central to public banking.  The reason public banking is key for us is not just because of the co-operative model.  As others have said, it is also because of what it brings to a community.  People feel that they have a stake in it and that it is their bank.  This is what makes the difference.  People trust it.  We have all had credit union accounts.  It meant something to us and we knew if we saved we could get something in return for it.  We knew we were supporting others at the same time.</p> <p>The reason this is before the Seanad is the call from the Minister of State for credit unions to have a greater role in the mortgage market now that KBC has left.  I acknowledge this.  The Minister of State is stepping up to the plate.  He has already outlined the number of engagements he has had.  We have known for quite some time the difficulties credit unions are facing.  It is important to point out their function, particularly with regard to the SME sector.  Credit unions fulfil a function that banks and other credit institutions do not fulfil and cannot fulfil.  A lack of credit has continually been a barrier to growth in many micro, small and medium enterprises.  According to the 2019 Indecon report about public banking in Ireland, despite the overall levels of new lending there has been a decline in the application rates for bank finance by the SME sector.  It accounted for 35% of applications for bank finance in March 2014.  This had declined to 20% by September 2018.  This is alarming given the reliance in this country on the SME sector.  I was happy to see that since then, the new lending regulations introduced by the Central Bank have increased credit unions' capacity to provide up to &euro;1.1 billion.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This led to an 18% increase year on year in June 2021.  However, it should only be cautiously welcomed, because there was a fall in lending in June 2020.</p><p>Another aspect that the Minister of State mentioned, and one that is very welcome, is the credit unions approved housing body fund, which was approved by the Central Bank and announced in September.  It is really positive.  I hope that it helps to succeed in delivering housing.  I think Senator Casey made an excellent point when he suggested that the Government should look into lending to local authorities.  The ability of credit unions to lend in other cases is still very restricted.  This needs to open up to allow credit unions to prosper.</p><p>Quite apart from the credit unions, SMEs are the backbone not just of the Irish economy, but of Irish society.  They employ over 1 million people in this country, representing over two thirds of the total employed in the enterprise sector.  Credit unions come to the fore regarding the SME sector.  There is still a huge unmet need in lending to SMEs in Ireland.   The credit unions, perhaps as part of a wider public banking model, could form the basis of this.  The difficulty that credit unions have faced around mortgages predominantly relates to the minimum reserve requirements.  We have a huge glut of savings at the moment, with the Central Statistics Office reporting that &euro;31 billion was saved by households in 2020 alone.  Much of this is being saved in credit unions, which is great.  However, a problem arises when the credit unions cannot actually lend this out due to lending restrictions.</p><p>There are new opportunities coming up that credit unions could be part of, particularly regarding the low-cost financing for retrofitting.  Going back to the issue of the minimum reserve requirement, it makes it tough for credit unions to expand their lending.  It is currently 10%, which is much higher than in other similar jurisdictions and much higher than banks in Ireland.  It does not make sense to treat small credit unions the same way as larger credit unions, the largest of which has around &euro;500 million in assets.  A report released by credit unions recently found that the average reserve ratio was higher than 10%.  It is actually closer to 17%.  It is a crude measure to impose this one-size-fits-all approach to credit unions, when the equivalent rules for banks are based on risk.  The principle should extend to credit unions as well.  Perhaps the Government will consider changing that ratio.  </p><p>In some ways, credit unions are not in competition with traditional banks, but in other ways, they are direct competitors.  That is welcome, because we need that level of competition.  The co-operative model does not mean that credit unions are stuck in the past.  We have seen recently that innovation is possible without having to compromise on ethos.  It was announced several months ago that hundreds of thousands of credit union members will have access to current accounts and debit cards after 16 credit unions came together to develop the offering.  They have been able to offer this at a lower monthly fee than banks.  It comes at a time when Irish banks have the highest mortgage interest rates in the eurozone.  More competition from credit unions would bring this down.</p><p>This is coming as credit unions are banding together, which the Minister of State mentioned in his opening statement, through shared service entities, to provide a greater offering for their members.  It needs to be encouraged, not restricted.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has expressed concern at the exclusion by the Central Bank of many community-based credit unions from offering debit card services.  It is really disappointing.  All of those things together, including the kind of services that will attract people to credit unions, will help them grow.  Ultimately, they will create better communities where people can feel welcome.</p></speech>

The credit union sector is one which we associate with local communities across Ireland.  Indeed, it is very important to recognise at the outset what they are.  They are financial co-operatives.  I think there is a bigger conversation to be had regarding how we develop the co-operative sector.  In that regard, I recommend that the Minister of State takes some time to look at the Sinn F&eacute;in policy document, Ownership Matters, that we produced a few years ago.  It provides a blueprint on how to develop the co-operative sector.  I know there are plans for legislation from this Government.  We look forward to seeing them in the coming months.</p><p>Credit unions understand what strengthens a community.  They are known for their great customer service.  In fact, they claimed the top spot last year, and have been in pole position for the past seven years, for the best customer experience in Ireland at the CX Impact awards.  Credit unions have had the highest scores across the six pillars of customer experience, that is, personalisation, integrity, expectations, time and effort, empathy and resolution.That will not come as a surprise to anyone who deals with credit unions, as I have done all my life and continue to through my local credit union in Castleconnell, County Limerick.  One in every two people in Ireland has a credit union account.  People trust credit unions.  It is notable how visible credit unions are in their communities in comparison with commercial banks, especially when we see commercial banks closing down branches in towns and cities across the country, which has such a negative impact on communities and customers.  Communities need their credit unions to thrive.  There is so much unlocked potential there.  </p><p>We need to look at how we can do more to unleash the potential of credit unions.  That begins by addressing the issue of under-lending.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i>quoted the Minister of State as saying credit unions should &quot;fill the gap&quot; left by the departures of Ulster Bank and KBC from the Irish market and start lending more mortgages.  For more than two years, we have been hearing Government Ministers tell us how great the credit union movement is and how they see a real role for the credit union movement.  However, the movement keeps telling us that it is being starved out of existence.  Credit unions have already gone through massive consolidation over the last few years.  They now have the scale to compete, but the Central Bank regulations are putting them to a competitive disadvantage relative to the banks.  Credit unions can only lend 7.5% of their total assets for mortgages.  A credit union with assets of &euro;70 million, taking an average mortgage of &euro;350,000, can only offer 15 mortgages under the current limits.  This means that they are more or less locked out of the largest credit market in the country, the mortgage market.  A special higher limit of 15% can be applied for, but only two credit unions have applied and been successful.  The reason for that is that it is a waste of time, because they still will not be permitted the scale to compete.</p><p>Credit unions have &euro;14 billion that could be used to compete in the mortgage market, but they are only allowed to use &euro;1.5 billion.  The mortgage market is worth &euro;100 billion, meaning that credit unions can only go after a share of 1.5% of the market.  That is peanuts.Moreover, banks only need to have 5% capital reserves for mortgages.  The credit unions have to have 12.5% - more than double.  It was not the credit unions that brought this country to its knees, it was the banks.  However, the credit unions are being placed at a competitive disadvantage.</p><p>Last week, the Minister for Finance stated that work on the review of the policy framework for the credit union sector is &quot;well advanced and we intend to issue proposals emanating from the Review for consultation shortly&quot;.  Will this work?  Unless the Government is willing to rewrite the legislation, then such a policy framework is likely to fail.  One of the commitments in the programme for Government was to enable the credit union movement to become &quot;a key provider of community banking in the country&quot;.  We are getting further and further away from that happening.  </p><p>In conclusion, I have a few questions for the Minister of State.  One of the commitments in the programme for Government was to enable the credit union movement to become &quot;a key provider of community banking in the country&quot;.  Does the Minister of State acknowledge that this Government, which is almost at is halfway mark, has yet to honour that commitment at a time when we have some of the highest mortgage costs, house prices and rents on record?</p><p>I am aware that there is a policy framework review ongoing.  Does the Minister of State accept that unless the Government makes the necessary regulatory changes, credit unions will not be able to significantly increase their footprint in the mortgage market?  Credit unions have &euro;14 billion ready to enter the mortgage market.  The mortgage market is worth around &euro;100 billion.  However, credit unions are only allowed to use &euro;1.5 billion, so they can only go after 1.5% of the market.  What is the Government's plan to change that situation?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Banks only need to have 5% capital reserves for mortgages while credit unions have to have 12.5%, which is more than double.  Does the Minister of State accept this places them at a competitive disadvantage relative to the banks, despite the banks being the ones who got the country into difficulty during the financial crisis?</p><p>The review is welcome, as is the impending legislation, but it strikes me there is likely to be a lack of ambition here.  Without those regulatory changes, the fundamental problems that emasculate the credit union movement will not change, so we need to see more ambition.  I hope in his response the Minister of State will indicate this ambition exists.</p></speech>

I am delighted he has taken time to be here this afternoon.  I listened attentively to his contribution.  I acknowledge the commitment he has shown in tackling this issue and the level of engagement he has undertaken since he came into office.  There is no doubt he has listened.  As Senator Gavan outlined, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, but I hope the lengths to which the Minister of State has gone to in listening to the credit unions will manifest itself in the final documents that will go to Cabinet for approval.</p> <p>As many speakers have outlined, the financial landscape in this country has changed substantially in recent years.  Many players, including Danske Bank and Ulster Bank to name a few, have left the pitch, packed up their financial suitcases and left town.  This has left people with reduced service and, in some instances, with no service at all.</p> <p>Credit unions are the one constant that remains in the financial market.  They have stood by the people who supported them - the ordinary men and women of their local communities.  They do so with one arm tied behind their backs.  In many ways, they are competing with the mainstay banks but, unfortunately, are handcuffed in terms of the number of services they can provide to the public.  The restrictions under which credit unions must operate have been well voiced in this debate and the Minister of State is well aware of them.  Cash reserves, regulation and the levies are all strangling the credit union movement.  We are very fortunate to have the credit union movement.  We have fewer players on the financial pitch than ever before, so it is imperative for the communities they serve that credit unions are put on a level playing field with banks so they can provide as many services as possible.</p> <p>I look forward to the Minister of State's summing up.  I am heartened by the level of engagement he has undertaken.  I sincerely hope the end product satisfies the credit unions in that they will be able to give a full service to the people they serve.</p></speech>

As many speakers have noted, the past ten years or so have been very tough in terms of banking in this country.  There are still many people in this country who have been burned as a result of banks holding fire sales of loans and selling them to vulture funds.  This left many couples across this island in no man's land and they are still there today.  It is an awful tragedy but it is another day's work, so I will not go into it now.</p> <p>Credit unions are community-based initiatives.  Other speakers are certainly correct in saying they were not the cause of the crash.  They are trusted financial organisations that are embedded in communities throughout this country and we need to do everything we can to ensure they are protected and to help them to grow.  They are not banks and do not want to become banks.  They want to use banking technology services to provide not-for-profit co-operative financial services to their members across all communities on the island.</p> <p>We want to enable the credit union movement to grow.  Without a change in the legislation or regulations, there will be little change.  We need to see appropriate balance, consistent regulation and the levelling of the playing field with banks and post offices.  The supervision and relentless restrictive regulation are suffocating.  We want to see the policy framework strengthen credit unions' long-term viability.  Fees are crippling credit unions.  Regarding reducing capital requirements, the 10% minimum reserve is totally inappropriate, unnecessary and unrelated to risk.  This also applies to long-term lending of five to ten years.  We look forward to the Minister of State's proposals and making credit unions much more viable and giving them a safer future.</p></speech>

Very few movements have impacted on this country more positively than the credit union movement.  Its excellent work in communities throughout the country has been phenomenal, and the level of trust placed in it by its members is a testament to how well run the sector has been and how its priority has always been its members and the communities in which credit unions operate.  I acknowledge the driving force that was John Hume, among others, behind the credit union movement across the island of Ireland.  The strength of the credit union movement is a testament to his vision and work.</p> <p>I am obviously most familiar with the credit unions in my county of Galway whose combined assets total just short of &euro;1 billion and that offer a banking alternative to tens of thousands of members across the city and county.  In fact, with the rationalisation and downgrading of the banking sector across county towns and larger urban areas in particular, the local credit union is now the only financial institution with a physical presence in many towns and villages.</p> <p>We would expect our credit unions to finance much of the hundreds of millions required to fund the retrofitting of homes to meet our climate change targets and the ambitious retrofitting programme recently announced by the Government.  At present, credit unions fund small loans that fund many activities such as cars or education.  Many credit unions now offer current accounts and mortgages.  In effect, they offer a full banking service.  I was very pleased to see the Minister of State being given responsibility for credit unions.  I expect it is a sign of the importance the Government places on the sector.  I hope it means the needs of credit unions will be addressed so that they can better support their members and communities.</p> <p>There has been a lot of rationalisation within the sector, with amalgamations of credit unions leading to more robust institutions with greater resources and security available to their members.  The Department of Finance is conducting a policy framework review of the credit union sector.  This review will guide policy for the sector over the coming years.  It is very important we get the best possible outcome for the sector as a major banking force and for its members.</p> <p>Credit unions operate under the 2012 legislation, which was introduced in the aftermath of the financial crisis and probably shows an excess of caution in dealing with the sector.  While I would not advocate a wholesale relaxation of the rules around any financial regulation, there are sensible prudent measures we as legislators need to take to ensure our credit union sector can fulfil its role providing a full range of banking services to its members.  Now we have a Minister of State dedicated to overseeing the sector, we must revisit the legislation to rebalance the relationship between the Minister of State and the Central Bank.  The Minister of State might advise if this is within his plans.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Central Bank will remain the fully independent regulator of the sector but it should be the Minister who sets the key policies and objectives for the sector.  This is crucial to the credit union movement when it comes to setting minimum reserves and capital requirements, which is proving very problematic at present.  The full capital requirement issue is very complicated and too technical to go into in detail in the time allowed; suffice it to say that the limits required by the Central Bank are seriously restricting the ability of credit unions to do what they were set up to do, that is, serve their members at communities.</p><p>On the issue of levies, credit unions are subject to several even though, as financial institutions, the vast majority of them played no part in the financial crisis more than ten years ago.  Some of the levies have been reduced, as has been acknowledged by the ILCU, but the deposit guarantee scheme in particular, which costs credit unions in excess of &euro;13 million per annum although the movement operates its own guarantee scheme, is not taken into account as an area of concern.</p><p>We have an opportunity to build a more vibrant, stronger community banking force if we re-examine the legislation of 2012 and adjust it to reflect the changes in the credit union sector since that time.  A stronger credit union will, in turn, lead to a stronger community.  It is in our hands, as legislators, to take the opportunity to allow the credit sector to expand and strengthen to the benefit of everybody.  I urge all those with responsibility in these Houses, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-02a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022030200002#EE00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I commend him on the steady manner in which he is going about his business and serving the people he is honoured to represent.</p> <p>The manner in which credit unions have succeeded over the years has been phenomenally Irish.  In my home town, Ennistymon, I was born and grew up next door to a credit union.  That credit union has provided incredible support to the entire north Clare community, even branching out into towns such as Miltown Malbay and Lisdoonvarna.  The credit union sector has supported and funded household extensions and car purchases and it has given people a quality of life that they would not be able to achieve through the banks.  I very much welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to bringing the credit union sector into the modern era.  I believe that, through his commitment, a commitment is being made by the Government to modernise the credit union movement.  The movement has felt strangled and ham-fisted in recent years because it has not been in a position to move with the times.  It has not been able to extend its loan book or offer the types of services people now expect from a financial institution.  I realise the credit unions have pushed the limit as far as they can to provide such services to their customers, but, really and truly, the Government now needs to allow them to breathe and get them scope and the opportunity to help the next generation of Irish people in the way they helped previous generations.  They need to be allowed to get involved in social housing to help those who are trying to secure affordable housing.  They have a critical role in this regard.  There are billions of euro on reserve in credit unions, and that needs to be released to play a role in tackling the housing crisis.</p> <p>I agree with the proposal that the credit union movement should be involved in financing the retrofitting of homes.  The Government&rsquo;s recently announced significant advances and improvements in the form of financial supports for those who wish to retrofit their houses could be made even more possible and realistic if the credit union movement were involved.  This is because it has partnered with communities and families for decades and funded the education of many thousands of young professionals who are trying to create their own homes.  I am referring to proposals that would allow the credit movement to get involved in affordable housing and support retrofitting while being allowed to breathe and operate in the modern era, thus providing the financial services that people now expect from whatever institution they partner with.</p> <p>I wish the Minister of State all the best with this measure, which is critical.  I would like to believe that, by the end of the lifetime of the Government, we will see a credit union movement in this country that is somewhat similar to the public banking model in places such as Germany.  The only bank we can rely on is a bank that captures the hearts and minds of the public and essentially becomes a public bank.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel and set up public banking; what we need to do is equip the credit union movement essentially to become a de facto public bank.</p></speech>

I am delighted to make a short contribution to the debate.  I commend him on the excellent work he has done in this area.  His series of meetings and engagements to move this matter forward is recognised by the credit union movement.  I have been asked to pass that on to him.  I acknowledge the work done by the current Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform when in opposition.  He made a major contribution to moving this on.</p><p>It is important that we commit to strengthening the credit union sector.  The institutions, which are not for profit and member-owned, are trusted and relied upon by communities up and down the country.  The heavy regulations and low interest rate environment have put the credit union model under severe pressure, so reform is needed.  It is vital that we review the policy framework concerning how the credit unions operate.</p><p>I am aware that we have pledged to enable and support the credit union movement to grow, expand its services and encourage community development.  Recognition of the importance of credit unions is embedded in government, with dedicated ministerial responsibility for the first time.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s role in this regard has been significant.</p><p>We want credit unions to grow their lending.  They have substantial deposits and investments but it is important that they increase their lending because this is how they will become sustainable.  Legislative or regulatory amendments alone will not solve the financial challenges arising from the low or negative interest rate environment, muted credit demand, strong savings growth and high operating costs.  To address these issues, credit units must develop their models and enhance collaboration.</p><p>We, as members of Government parties, recognise the importance of credit unions.  The programme for Government contains commitments to review the policy framework within which credit unions operate and enable the credit union movement to grow.  That is precisely what we are doing.  We are almost at the final stages of this process, which is very welcome.  The programme for Government gives a clear commitment to supporting the credit unions in the expansion of services to encourage community development.</p><p>In this regard, we have seen what has happened with the pillar banks.  Huge swathes of society have been left without a banking service.  I have referred to north-east Roscommon, where up to 10,000 people no longer have a local bank.  The pillar banks have closed one by one, and there is more to come.  Let us be clear: more pillar banks will close branches up and down the country.  It is imperative that the next step we take politically be the right one for the credit unions, namely the step we have committed to in the programme for Government, which is to enable the credit union movement to grow as a key provider of community banking.  A policy review that manages the <i>status quo </i>but fails to move on and provide another community-based platform for financial services will be a lost opportunity.  I have no doubt that there are good initiatives coming down the road and no doubt about the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment, but it is important not to put this on the long finger.  We need to get this through the system as quickly as possible and to have community banking put in place as quickly as possible.</p><p>I will leave it at that.  I am delighted that the Minister of State is present and about his commitment.  The credit union movement has a network of buildings and staff on the ground; now we need to deal with the legislative situation and ensure we allow the credit unions to become full community banks.</p></speech>

We have all spoken about levels of trust.  We see that in all of our towns and villages.  As Senator Murphy said, there are significant challenges to access banking services in our smaller towns when our traditional banks are closing down.  It is incredible.  People have to travel further to access banking services.</p> <p>I acknowledge our volunteers, particularly in my home town of Ballinasloe where the credit union started back in the 1960s.  Volunteers with amazing expertise, perhaps from financial backgrounds, came together to provide a credit union for families in need.  They recognised that there was a lot of poverty in our area.  The same applied for every credit union that came together.  Credit unions are a phenomenal example of communities coming together to support each other and families in need.  So many families use credit unions for loans and savings.</p> <p>The Minister of State spoke about recognising the role of credit unions, collaboration aspects, approved housing bodies and how every credit union can now invest in that, as well as agri-lending.  He also mentioned supporting governance, member services and transparency of regulatory engagement.  I note that he has had numerous engagements in the past while.  It is testament to the programme for Government that we have a ministerial position with responsibility for the credit union sector.  It is also important that we ensure that trust and reputation are maintained, and that our customers in the credit unions have access to full banking services.  We need to support boards of management and credit union staff across the country.  The Registry of Credit Unions at the Central Bank has issued a number of risk assessments recently.</p> <p>If the Minister of State has time, I would be grateful if he would respond to a couple of questions.  We have seen in the health sector that cybersecurity is a huge issue and the same is true for banking.  Is there a way for us to support credit unions that are attempting to collaborate and also wish to have independence and autonomy?  Could we have advisers in place at national level to support them with risk management during their annual general meetings, AGMs, and to provide full-time expertise to support them as they transition to providing full-time banking and community services?  How are we supporting them in respect of cybersecurity to ensure they have adequate means to protect online banking from further attacks?  This is a serious and shocking issue at a global level right now.  There is going to be a higher level of cyberattacks across all areas, particularly banking.</p> <p>On the statutory reserve, we have discussed in the House the cost to credit unions of lodging deposits with traditional banks.  The Minister of State mentioned that there are other ways for them to invest such as through the affordable housing bodies and retrofitting.  Could he expand on that?  How do we support our credit unions to have the necessary guidance to go down that road?  The savings caps are a serious issue.  There have been a lot of household savings over the past two years in certain parts of our community.</p> <p>In respect of education and apprenticeships, the Minister of State talked about retrofitting.  We have courses now offering apprenticeships in banking and finance.  It would be wonderful to see our community banks engaging with the apprenticeship programmes and supporting people to become qualified in cybersecurity, finance or whatever.  Five new apprenticeship programmes were rolled out just today, one of which is in cybersecurity.  Would it not be phenomenal if every credit union had access to someone who was being trained up in cybersecurity?</p></speech>

It is clear that everybody who has spoken has a deep personal knowledge of, interest in and commitment to the credit union movement.  We are reflecting this in the programme for Government.  For the first time ever, a Minister of State has been given dedicated responsibility for the credit union movement.  I have mentioned the number of engagements I have had with the credit union movement.  The Department was working and receiving submissions through all of the last year or more.  Towards the end of last year, we combined all the submissions received from the League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Managers Association, the Credit Union Development Association, and the credit union advisory committee, CUAC, which is an advisory committee to the Minister.  We tried to get a consensus.  We told them all we would come back to them one last time with the document we had prepared.  We issued that to each of those organisations in the last couple of days.  I have a date set in my diary for collective meeting in the next couple of weeks to see if we can agree the report.  If it is agreed, it can go straight on to Cabinet for approval for legislation.  I expect we will be there.  I do not think there are any major surprises in what went out to the organisations in the past week.</p> <p>The issue of lending to approved housing bodies has been mentioned by a number of Senators.  Three funds have been established in the credit union movement, one through the league and another by a group of credit unions coming together.  They established a fund and got Central Bank approval whereby any credit union in Ireland can invest in the fund.  Every credit union in Ireland can now invest in the funds that lend to approved housing bodies.  That has only happened in the past couple of months.  They have three different funds that they can enter.  It is open to all credit unions to do that.</p> <p>On the issue of lending to local authorities, that is possibly the next step.  Local authorities will be looking at the interest rates they can get from other State institutions when they are borrowing.  That is an issue of commercial activity.  Everybody mentioned the issue of retrofit loans which can have a key role here.  Most of what the credit unions do is unsecured lending.  They are the main provider of unsecured lending.  Their mortgage lending is secured lending but 93% of every credit union loan is unsecured, based on the name or goodwill of the person they are dealing with because they know the people.  The retrofit loans can come into that area.  That is a separate issue.</p> <p>The trusted brands were mentioned by many Senators and the gap in the mortgage market, which I will come back to, and the issue in respect of the forthcoming legislation.  I am pleased that digital currencies and cybersecurity were mentioned.  In my role dealing with international financial services I recently met the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and IBEC, which are running apprenticeships in the area of financial services right up to FETAC level 9.  They are being launched this year and are well under way.  I would like to see many more people going into that area.  </p> <p>Many issues were raised in respect of the limits of the lending which I want to address.  While the regulatory reserve stands at 10%, the credit union movement has 16% in reserve across the movement based on recent figures.  They are saying there is a limit of 10% but they are voluntarily going 60% over the limit the Central Bank provides.  They actually have reserves of 16%.  An awful lot of what they have held in reserve need not be held in reserve.  They are a long way over the 10% the Central Bank requires.  It is important to say that.  They are talking about the 10% but in fact they hold 16% or 17%.  That does need to be held and the Central Bank has not asked for it to be held.  The credit unions can release billions from what they are holding voluntarily in reserve without ever having to go to the Central Bank.  It is very important that we should say that.</p> <p>We all know how strong the credit union movement is and we are here to help it.  The biggest issue I see is that it has assets of about &euro;20 billion and loans issued of just over &euro;5 billion.  It is only lending 26% of its assets.  There is no limit on that.  There was a time the figure was over 50%.  The Central Bank has not changed that.  The credit unions are just not lending enough.  They have all this money that they are not lending and they are having to invest in banks at negative interest rates, so they are not making money.  Lending money at 6% or 7%, which is the average interest rate in a credit union loan, is far better than keeping it somewhere and getting negative interest.  They can do that. </p> <p>Where the issue of regulatory reserves comes in is in respect of mortgage lending.  There are limits imposed by the Central Bank because it is a relatively new area and it wants the credit unions to acquire competence in that area as they go along.  There are regulatory reserves.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They have combined them so that small credit unions can lend up to 7.5% without going back to the Central Bank.  It is very important that I give Members these figures.  The current limit that the Central Bank has set means they can lend up to &euro;1.4 billion today, but they are actually only lending &euro;260 million today.  Without even talking to the Central Bank, the credit union movement today can lend out more than an extra &euro;1 billion without going near the bank.  The bigger credit unions that want to go above that &euro;1.1 billion can apply to the Central Bank and they will be allowed to lend up to &euro;2.24 billion, if they make the application.  A handful have done this.  The larger credit unions that have applied for a higher percentage of their loan book to be in mortgages have been approved.  There is scope for the credit union movement today to lend out an additional &euro;1 billion without talking to anybody.  There is a limit in the regulations, but they are nowhere near the limit.  Those credit unions that want go above the current minimum limit can get sanction, and some of them have done this.  They also can lend up to that figure.  This is what I want to see them doing.</p><p>Some of the credit unions have come together and it was mentioned by a Senator that this is helping them to collaborate. This is what I want them to do.  The strength of the movement is that they are everywhere, but it is also their weakness because they are small and they cannot individually do this.  My proposal for legislation will assist their collaborations.  Some of the credit unions have not, or will never have, the expertise to be mortgage experts looking into the future risk for a 25- or 30-year mortgage.  They need financial expertise that the organisation does not have.  There is a shared services company, the Credit Union Service Organisation for Payments, CUSOP, which is a financial organisation that provides the knowledge to operate current accounts.  No credit union makes up its own current account and its own card; this is done through CUSOP.  That is to help them to collaborate whereby five or six credit unions come together with a brand name for a new current account.  In the legislation I am looking to give those organisations statutory recognition in order that it is not just an informal arrangement. This will put them in a stronger position.  When members go into their credit union to get a loan, while the expertise for a 25-year mortgage might not be in that particular credit union, the credit union service organisation will be called in to do all of the background work for them and approve a loan or otherwise.  Then the credit union will give it out.  They need help to do that back-office work.  This is what we want to provide in those areas also.</p><p>The savings caps have been an issue.  Credit unions did not want to take in extra deposits because if they were to invest money in some of the banks with a negative interest rate it would cost them.  This was a feature for the past couple of years but it may not be a feature this year, next year or into the future.  It was a problem at a particular time.  Different credit unions managed this differently.  Some credit unions had a limit on new accounts and some credit unions forced some people to take money out of their existing account.  The way it happened in individual credit unions was a matter for the local credit union.  Some handled it very subtly and some of them were not as subtle in how they went about it.  It probably was a feature of how individual credit unions did all that.</p><p>The role of volunteers was also mentioned.  It would be remiss of me not to talk about the closures of Ulster Bank, KBC and Bank of Ireland branches and the role of the ATMs around the country as they affect credit unions.  This will be done through one of these service organisations.  The local credit union will not go off to buy an ATM.  It will be done through one of the ATM providers, and some of them have stepped up to the mark in towns when bank branches closed and there was no ATM left on the street.  That is happening in individual cases at local level.</p><p>To conclude, I thank all Members for their contributions.  We are almost at the final stages of getting agreement from the credit union movement on the proposals that I hope to bring to Cabinet in the weeks ahead.  The date has been set for that meeting and I hope to have legislation published and enacted this calendar year.</p></speech>

</blockquote>further notes: <blockquote> 	- the Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in access to housing;<br /><br />- that under Article 27 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, where parents or carers are unable to provide a decent standard of living that is good enough to meet a child&rsquo;s physical and social needs, and their healthy development, the State is compelled to assist by providing &lsquo;material assistance and support&rsquo; with particular regard to &lsquo;nutrition, clothing and housing&rsquo;;<br /><br />- that Ireland, having ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, has obligations under that Convention in respect of access and choice in housing for disabled people and the wider promotion of universal design; </blockquote>recognises: <blockquote> 	- that housing is a basic human need, and when individuals are deprived of this need it has significant implications for their health and wellbeing, and their social and emotional development;<br /><br />- that housing can have the capacity to help shape who we are and where we stand in society, therefore it can exacerbate intergenerational poverty and inequality;<br /><br />- that people have a right to live in a vibrant, accessible urban environment, free from vacancy and dereliction;<br /><br />- the profound harm caused to individuals, families, and communities by the financialisation and commodification of housing in the State, and by enabling vulture funds and other predatory financial actors to gain control over homes;<br /><br />- the traumatic impact of living in emergency accommodation on individuals, particularly in respect of their mental health and wellbeing, and that this impact is especially pronounced in children living in emergency accommodation;<br /><br />- the trauma experienced by those living in Direct Provision, and their profound neglect at the hands of the State and companies who profit from the system;<br /><br />- the violation of human rights and culture which has occurred as a result of the failure to provide culturally appropriate and adequate accommodation for Irish Travellers;<br /><br />- the benefits of pursuing housing policies that promote the development of diverse, sustainable and intergenerational communities made up of people from different walks of life and different family types;<br /><br />- that it is within the capacity and means of the State to solve the housing crisis; </blockquote>and calls on the Government to: <blockquote> 	- commit to the de-financialisation of housing as a core principle of future housing policy, and implement the recommendations of the &lsquo;Report on the financialisation of housing and the right to adequate housing&rsquo; by the UN Special Rapporteur;<br /><br />- end the State&rsquo;s over-reliance on the private market to address the shortcomings in Irish housing in recent decades, by committing to the establishment of a State-owned and operated construction company and investing radically in the development of public homes on public land;<br /><br />- take immediate action to bring the 4,000 vacant council houses owned by local authorities into use;<br /><br />- increase the provision of secure, social and public cost rental tenancies, end current reliance on private rental subsidy assistance payments, and take measures to cap and reduce rents;<br /><br />- take measures to provide greater security for tenants, strengthen protections from evictions, and provide increased resources to agencies responsible for the investigation and enforcement of unlawful evictions;<br /><br />- phase out and ultimately end State reliance on family hubs and private emergency accommodation within the next 12-months, and ensure that emergency accommodation does not form part of the future response to medium and long-term housing needs;<br /><br />- recognise the traumatic impact of homelessness on the individuals and families affected, and commit to providing increased investment in wraparound supports for individuals and families affected by homelessness;<br /><br />- develop gender-responsive policies to the housing crisis which specifically respond to the particular challenges experienced by groups such as lone parents, the majority of whom are women;<br /><br />- take immediate action to deliver on its commitment to end Direct Provision, as set out in the White Paper on Direct Provision, and in particular to commit to the end of institutionalisation and profiteering in the asylum system, with all Phase Two own-door accommodation being operated by non-profit entities;<br /><br />- fully vindicate the housing rights of disabled persons under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and particularly to ensure that universal design is core to any new housing developments in the State;<br /><br />- undertake an urgent audit of living conditions in all Traveller-specific accommodation, to take urgent action to address any deficiencies identified, and to establish a National Traveller Accommodation Authority to oversee the long-term development and implementation of Traveller accommodation; and<br /><br />- broaden the State&rsquo;s definition of homelessness to include those living in insecure or inappropriate institutional accommodation, the &lsquo;hidden homeless&rsquo;, and individuals and families in receipt of housing assistance payments.&quot; </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, for being here.  To give some context to this motion, over many years and in many different ways we have all tried to address the different facets of the housing crisis, taking in everything from the rental market to social housing to homelessness in the context of emergency accommodation.  We have been working on a motion for a while and last week or the week before we were quite struck by the work of Housing Action Now with the artists and in collaboration with people most affected by the policies of governments' past and future policies, I suppose, as well.</p><p>Imagine for a moment all those times we have heard apologies or acknowledgements of what has happened in the past, with people being so negatively impacted by different crises or negative outcomes of policy over the years or decades.  I want people to imagine that if I or anybody else were the Taoiseach and we watched the D&aacute;il proceedings or the 6 o'clock news, what would such an apology would look and feel like.  The Civil Engagement Group has always strived to ensure representation of minority voices or the voices in general of civil society.  They must be put on the record in the Chamber and we try to be the vehicle to bring in those voices.  I could have opened by speaking specifically about policy.  I am sure everybody else will do that.  However, I want to imagine the apology and speak to the people directly:</p> <blockquote> 	Housing is a human right and a basic human need and I, and many in power before me have failed in our roles to ensure every individual living in this country has access to good-quality, secure and affordable homes.  I am sorry to the thousands of people on social housing lists in this country, every adult and child in emergency accommodation in hotels, hostels and shelters.  To every adult and child in direct provision.  To those staying with friends and family, living in each other's back gardens and sleeping on couches.  To those who have relocated miles from where they work, forced to spend hours a day commuting.<br /><br />To those paying extortionate rents and to those who cannot afford to save for a mortgage.  To those in negative equity.  To the older people who remortgage to help someone else secure a home.  To the young people stuck in parents' homes or who have made a decision to emigrate.  To the Traveller community whose nomadic way of life has been criminalised.  To those disabled people, regardless of their impairments, who cannot secure an appropriate home to meet their needs.  To those in abusive relationships who cannot leave because of the fear they will be on the street.  And to those living on our nation's streets and to those who have died on our streets, I stand before you today to give to you the apology that you deserve.<br /><br />To Brendan, who feels like he is living on a trapdoor with a rope around his neck, at the mercy of landlords who ignore complaints about filthy carpets and broken showers, cold water and cold air howling through the cracked windows.  Landlords who hike up the rent when they are challenged about the mould that is growing as fast as his children.  Landlords who finally issue an eviction notice leaving Brendan and his family 48 days to rearrange their lives.  Brendan questions his decision to have come back from his life abroad, to bring his partner and children to the city he grew up in, the city of 100,000 welcomes.<br /><br />To Alya, whose family received an eviction notice months before her Leaving Cert.  Her studying time was replaced by hours on the phone trying to find a room for three children and two adults.  Alya spent every evening in the library making use of the Wi-Fi, but one night she missed her curfew to study for a science exam and was put in a hostel room with eight strangers.  She was scared and shaken and saw someone overdose.  Alya blames herself for getting lost in her studies that evening, and she now talks to her sisters just once a week.<br /><br />To Kevin, who was living in a hub and planning to kill himself, no longer able to cope with the size of the room once a new cot had been set up, the intensity of living with a pregnant partner, the smell of the food from the canteen where they had to eat.  The stress, the worry, wondering will this ever get better, kept alive by the love he has for his baby daughter in her tiny little shoes.  Not wanting to leave her there and never wanting her to know that she was born in a hub.<br /><br />To Mary, who only wants a safe haven, a place to hang the framed picture of her boy on his first day of school, with his blue glasses and his snowy white hair.  She's been on the housing list for her son's whole life.  She checks once a week online, praying that she has moved up on the list, but her number has only moved once in three years.  Mary was given the options: to go homeless, to go into emergency accommodation or take an apartment with a kicked-in door and a gang selling drugs outside.  Lonely and isolated, Mary feels like she has been dumped in hell and forgotten.<br /><br />To David, who is no longer young and who misses his hurley stick, which is in his parents' house here in Ireland while he lives abroad.  He wants to come back but can't afford to live on his own and is depressed at the prospect of a house share at his age.  Feeling trapped outside the high wall that's being built around affordable housing and missing family conversations, puc abouts and the smell of cut grass.<br /><br />To Paddy, who remembers the New Year's Eve party that he and his wife were at when someone explained the term negative equity, and now, in mortgage arrears, every year on his children's birthday, Paddy counts another year in debt, and he wishes that debt a happy birthday.  He is haunted by the memory of the day when he and his wife realised they can't afford to have another child.  And he has gotten used to seeing his wife cry for that child.  Paddy finally told his wife about his idea to kill himself and heard she had a similar idea.  He often finds himself returning to his childhood memories so he can recall what a secure home feels like. </blockquote> <p>It is important to remember that each and every contribution quoted is a real-life story contributed to this project.  We should continue to think about that when we speak about policy because sometimes, when we get lost in the policy, it can be a cold instrument, and it is always better to remember what that policy means in real-life terms.</p></speech>

[values] the winter conversations at the open fire, with people coming from all parts of the halting site for cups of tea and chats by her father's lamp.  Lizzie loves Traveller culture but it's not part of [Traveller] culture to live without basic human needs.  No one should have to take the ice off the inside of [the trailer] windows before sending children to school.  Living with bad lungs and a lower life expectancy.  All Lizzie wants is the best facilities for her community and not see them forced into mainstream houses.  A housing policy that facilitates all walks of life.  But now Lizzie is being asked to move and leave behind years of memories because the people in the nearby apartments don't like the view.<br /><br />To Claire, who has spent so much time scanning ads online for apartments that claim to be accessible but only allow a wheelchair user in the door and don't consider the need to move around inside, or to have a shower or have room for a couch for guests, or have a nearby bus stop to get to work.  Claire was excited to finally secure an apartment in the city that was actually accessible, but now all she feels is stress as she pays her rent but can't move in because there is no personal assistance support available to her.  Claire can't see any light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />To Raphael, who was constantly looking for a place to live and who has slept in overcrowded houses and on friends' couches and floors.  His doctor has told him to find a better place to live for the sake of his health.  But where can he go?  He wonders how you are supposed to get references if you've ... [spent half your life living] in Direct Provision ...  He is tired of potential landlords being more interested in the fact that he is black, rather than the fact that he is a health care worker, a student and a youth mentor.  He is tired of always moving and just wants somewhere to belong.  Wishing that there was a sense of humanity in the housing system, Raphael just wants to be free.<br /><br />To the children who have spent year after year in emergency accommodation, their childhood memories robbed of the many milestones and memories that they should have had.  The children absorbing their parents' anxieties.  The children commuting to school [each day] like worn out adults.  The children who don't have a table to eat their breakfast at or do their homework on.<br /><br />And to Paula, who is talking to all of you now.  She spent 15 years on a council list waiting to be housed.  13 of those years were spent in rundown overpriced accommodation until a small electrical fire caused by a storage heater left her and her children homeless.  I want to acknowledge her pain and suffering.<br /><br />There is a view out there that many people in this country are failing, and the situations that they find themselves in are entirely the result of their own decisions.  But that is not true.  I want to make something very clear to all of you.  And let it be noted for public record, it is not your fault.  Consecutive governments have failed you.  The truth is that the current housing crisis is the result of so many policy decisions at the highest level.  We failed to bring in rent regulations and proper tenants' rights.  We listened to the intensive lobbying of private developers and vulture funds.  We prioritised the ... landlords, developers and builders.  We outsourced our responsibilities to profit-making companies.  And we took away the independence of local authorities and we simply didn't build enough houses.  We saw housing as a commodity and we lost sight of every person's basic need for a safe and secure home.  And for that, I just want to say I am sorry.  I am so sorry. </blockquote> <p>During the year and a half I have been here, the Minister of State and I have spoken about housing many times.  The Civil Engagement Group has also discussed housing.  I am thankful, as is the Civil Engagement Group, that we have cross-party support today.  We are very grateful for that.  However, we and our communities outside this House need action.  We do not need any more talking shops.  Behind us, I formally welcome the Housing Action Now group.  This motion outlines what the Government should do.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is all of our responsibility to put this into action and not just say we support it today because it sounds ever so lovely to say.

I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to listen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-02a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022030200002#OO00200"><p>I too thank Senators Ruane and Flynn and the Civil Engagement Group for bringing this motion.  I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I welcome the group Housing Action Now and I understand there is a group of artists as well.  I apologise for not knowing the latter's title but I have heard about its work and commend it on that.  I am delighted the Minister of State has come to the House to debate this issue with us.  As Senator Flynn said, we have debated housing many times since the new Government was formed.</p><p>The Minister of State knows I come from a very working-class background in the north inner city and Cabra-Glasnevin of Dublin Central.  Since I was first elected to Dublin City Council in 2004, housing has been the issue that has been the biggest pressure on people living in my community.  That includes people who are working, people who are not working, people with disabilities, people who are able, people who are young and people who are old.  It is not an announcement to say this Government is trying to deal with and respond to a housing crisis.  Due to the way Senators Ruane and Flynn brought in the real lived experience and real life experience, so much of it resonated with me.  They are experiences that are so familiar to me and probably to many Members.  Physical and mental exhaustion is created by the insecurity of housing.  There is mental pressure, missed life opportunities and stolen experiences.  It is cruel, inexcusable and unacceptable in a country like ours that is rich, developed, free and part of the EU.  Last June, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I brought a similar motion on housing before the House.  At the time there was almost, though not quite, unanimity.  The majority agreed with the motion that stated: &quot;a secure home is a basic human right&quot;.  It also stated; &quot;Covid-19 highlights the essential protection a secure home provides [an individual]&quot;.  It continued:</p> <blockquote> 	- far too many of our citizens are homeless;<br /><br />- essential middle-income workers are struggling to secure an affordable home;<br /><br />- young people should expect to secure an affordable home;<br /><br />- the State has responsibility to protect citizens right to a home; </blockquote> <p>We acknowledged that at that time there was a new Government and historic changes were being made but we then went further and called on the Government to exercise every available resource to achieve a sustainable housing supply for every Irish citizen so they could all have a safe and secure home.  We also called on the Minster and the Government to ensure every citizen would have an opportunity through a constitutional referendum to insert a right to housing into our Constitution.  It is broadly accepted.  We see the right to housing as a basic human right but our Constitution is silent on that.</p><p>Failures were referenced, and that is what they were.  We do not have a housing crisis because somebody succeeded.  We have a housing crisis because there were failures.  To change that we must change it from the very top.  We must say from the very highest level we as a State believe housing is a basic human right.  That is what we push for and what there was almost unanimity in this House for.  I will return to that but I acknowledge that in the intervening period, that is, June 2021 to date, we have had Housing for All and a historic commitment of &euro;20 billion to deliver 300,000 homes.  That is an enormous commitment from the State and one I am confident the Government is committed to delivering.  Nevertheless, I am going to continue to push for the referendum on housing because as certain as night follows day, there will be another election at some point and there will be another Government, and we must ensure the right to housing is enshrined in our Constitution so it is protected by it and asserted in it such that every Government, regardless of its political persuasion, is mandated to deliver on it.</p><p>There is much in Housing for All that is going to help us move in the right direction.  There is a commitment to use State-owned lands to build social and affordable homes.  There is a commitment to delivering 10,000 new social homes every year.  Housing lists have been spoken about with respect to fact some people have not only not moved up lists but some have had the negative and deflating experience of moving down the lists because of their increasing length.</p><p>The other actions around the tackling of vacancy, the increasing delivery of new-build homes and the protections of renters are all very important in the short term.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could update the House on the referendum on a right to housing, which is a long-term action to ensure failures cannot be repeated in the future.</p></speech>

I welcome our guests to the Chamber.  I am very struck by the entirety of both Senator Ruane and Senator Flynn's contributions but especially by the line in Senator Flynn's contribution that referred to a message that people are failing.  There is an inherent unfairness in that and a perception that somehow it is the fault of the people who are struggling.  There is no question but that it is not.  By a sheer matter of luck that none of us have any say over we are born into a family, a community or a country that has either opportunities and a pathway for a life where things fall nicely into place or a life where every impediment is set in people's way.  It is a Government's duty to unequally distribute our resources and set up our policies in such a way that equality of opportunity is achieved by ensuring that there is a bias to assist.  For education we have the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme.  Throughout different stages in life, opportunities are provided to try to balance the inequality of the sheer luck of where people are born and what opportunities they might have to education and everything that sets them on the path of life.</p> <p>I stand here as a Senator for two years.  However, in my lifetime I have worked on building homeless accommodation for people coming out of care to ensure they have supports, an opportunity to have a roof over their heads, independence and dignity and respect from when they turn 18 years of age.  It was an initiative specifically for 18- to 25-year-olds.  It ensured they had support for their children in cr&egrave;ches and support for education programmes to enable them to use that opportunity in the supported sheltered housing so they could then move forward in their life.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We can see how instrumental having such supports in place can be in changing someone's life.  My home constituency has every type of household from people with three or four grown-up children living under their roof because the latter cannot afford to buy or rent a property to people who are on long housing lists and aspiring to get out of their parents' homes or the completely inadequate accommodation they currently have.</p><p>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, along with Senators Fitzpatrick, Boyhan and Moynihan, some of whom are present.  I am also a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters, which has, as the Minister of State mentioned, examined the issue of inequality of access to housing and the fact the regulations ensure a person in a wheelchair can visit a newly built home but not necessarily that he or she will be able to go upstairs and sleep in it overnight.  We heard very powerful testimonies from people of their experiences and aspirations in this regard.  That information has been heard, fed back and is reflected in the Government's plans.</p><p>I believe 100% in the Housing for All plan, which built very firmly on the foundations that were put there by the previous Minister.  I do not want to focus on what it aspires to do.  Instead, I will reflect on what it has achieved.  When we talk about an aspiration in regard to housing, we know that Housing for All deals with first-time buyers, homelessness and renters.  It provides very concrete actions in those areas.  However, it is beneficial to consider what has been achieved, bearing in mind that we are not yet two full years into our term.  Actions were in place, as I said, and it is useful to consider what has been done since then.  The plan was to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 homes per year over the next decade.  Progress so far includes the delivery of 20,903 homes up to the end of September 2021.  Construction commenced on another 30,724 homes last year and planning permission was granted for a further 39,000 homes.  There was a 2% rent cap in place in rent pressure zones when inflation was at that level.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Act was passed into law, which expedites the building process.  The Land Development Agency is in place, as is the help-to-buy scheme.  A total of &euro;75 million is available to local authorities for housing adaptation.  Concrete actions have been taken.</p><p>I believe Housing for All and the other measures we have discussed are addressing the very real and valid concerns and the real-life experiences colleagues have raised.  I do not have to go beyond my own office to hear about those experiences.  We are working and striving to achieve resolution and bring an end to what has been a lifelong struggle for many people.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that they have continuously done so over the past year and a half to two years.  I welcome their guests, who are here to listen, engage and see what we are talking about and doing.  I also recognise the work of the Minister of State, which is a critical component of all of this.</p> <p>I acknowledge the Housing for All policy, which sets down objectives and targets.  When the previous plan, Rebuilding Ireland, was introduced, I said to the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, when he was in this Chamber brandishing his yellow and orange book, that he was a very brave Minister to set out hundreds of targets and that he would be judged on them.  I have not had an opportunity to judge the Minister of State personally and this is not a personal thing.  This is Government policy and it is a Government document.  We have a coalition Government with a very substantial majority.  It has the wherewithal and power to deliver the plan and it certainly has resourced it, which I acknowledge.  It will ultimately be held to account on the delivery of this document.  To be fair to all the Ministers involved, they are always willing to come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, of which several of us present are members, and tease out the issues.  Housing and health will perhaps be the two big issues on which the Government is judged.  As a previous speaker said, there are two or three years remaining in its term and a lot more work to do.</p> <p>I thank the Senators who spoke about the real lived experiences of people they named and brought to life for us today.  Their experiences resonate with us all and we are all aware of similar stories.  When considering any motion that comes before us, identifying the problem is one thing but what is being asked for is another.  Today, we are asked to consider 12 actions the Senators are calling on the Government to do.  I intend to single out a few of them.  The third ask is that the Government takes immediate action to bring the 4,000 vacant council homes owned by local authorities into use.  It is a shocking indictment of any Administration that there are 4,000 publicly-owned homes not in use.  At a time when the Government is dealing with other lists and assigning resources, this raises a question.  City and county councillors in this country are embarrassed by this.  They constantly ask questions of the officials and housing directorates as to what is happening, only to be told there is no funding from central government, it is a long, protracted process or it has not been agreed whether the properties will be demolished or renovated.  There seem to be all sorts of excuses, some of them legitimate and others questionable.  It is a disgrace that publicly-owned homes are not in use.  This is not about purchasing properties.  These homes across the country are in our ownership and the city and county councillors are totally frustrated by the lack of action.  I want to get that message across loud and clear today.  Our democratically elected local government members are as frustrated as anyone else in this regard.  We need a fast, focused and strategic plan for how we are going to bring into use the 4,000 homes that are boarded up around the country.</p> <p>The seventh action in the motion asks the Government to "recognise the traumatic impact of homelessness on the individuals and families affected, and commit to providing increased investment in wraparound supports".  We all know such action is needed and recognise its importance.</p> <p>The eighth ask is that the Government takes immediate action to deliver an end to direct provision.  If ever we needed to talk about direct provision, it is this week.  I hope we will welcome many people from Ukraine who come to our shores seeking refuge, support and hospitality.  We do all of that well.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, who is responsible for this area, has done a great deal of work on it.  The report we received last week from one of the children's advocacy groups noted that great progress has been made in this regard.  I acknowledge that progress and want it to continue.</p> <p>The ninth action calls for an audit of Traveller accommodation.  That is important.  Dare I say it again; the accommodation for Travellers in parts of Cork is a disgrace and has been singled out as such.  People argue the point and suggest there is a vexatious element in issues being raised with the county executive.  It is unacceptable.</p> <p>I refer to a press release that was issued by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage yesterday welcoming the establishment of a working group on a referendum on housing.  Another committee is being set up to discuss a referendum, which may take some time to complete its work.  I acknowledge that the Housing Commission is doing great work.  We know what its function is.  However, the working group will have four additional members: Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, a former Chief Justice; Professor Gerry Whyte, professor of law at Trinity College; Professor Rosalind Dixon, professor of law; and Madeleine MacKenzie, Parliamentary Counsel for the Scottish Government's parliamentary office.  When I saw the names, I asked myself what these people have in common.  The answer is that they all have a home.  Why are there no people with direct experience of homelessness on this sub-committee or on the commission?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Why are no city or county councillors with vast experience in housing at the coalface of the delivery of housing and partnering with us in the delivery of the Minister of State's policy?  Why are none of them on it?  That begs the question.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that.  I acknowledge the work of the commission, however, which is positive.  It is mandated to look at supply, tenure, quality of housing, sustainability, affordable housing and rural and social housing.</p><p>This is a timely debate.  We have had many of these debates, however.  We now need to start measuring the output, success, targets and delivery lines for Housing for All.  I beg one question of the Minister of State, however.  Why do we not have people who have experienced homelessness, and who tomorrow or next week will be in homeless accommodation, sitting around the table helping and suggesting solutions to tackle this crisis?</p></speech>

I thank the Senators for their motion.  It is very welcome and one I support.  It is important to say that much work has been done by this Government that people probably do not know about.  Housing problems are everywhere and they are multiple.  Each individual person has a different housing need.  That is certainly the experience I have had going from door to door and in the work I have been doing.</p> <p>We have the owner-occupier guarantee whereby local authorities can designate up to 50% of any new housing development for individual owners.  The zoned land tax was designated to penalise speculation.  We will soon have the vacant homes tax and a value sharing mechanism to ensure that institutional investments cannot make undue profits from housing in Ireland anymore.  The Land Development Agency, LDA, is building public houses on public land.  We also have new cost-rental homes being built around the country, alongside the 90,000 social homes, between now and 2030.</p> <p>None of this is enough, however.  I am hopeful that over the coming years, people will see that differences are happening and will actually feel and experience them, and that the housing need of every home we go to or person we come across will be met or they have a hope it will be met soon.</p> <p>I will go in different directions with this motion because there are 12 asks of the Government.  On gender-responsive policies, as stated in the motion, "households headed by lone parents, the majority of whom are women, make up 53% of homeless families in the State".  That is not spoken about enough.  That requires gender-responsive policies.  I will support that and happily work with Senators and the Minister of State to address that.</p> <p>I am delighted to report that work on ending direct provision, which has been spearheaded by my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, is advancing at pace.  He has personally committed to ending direct provision and any profit element therein and introducing own-door accommodation.  We have new challenges at the moment with Ukraine and that will have to come under consideration.  I agree with everyone when they say we must treat every person as an individual.  Everyone needs to feel the fairness of the system.</p> <p>At least a minimum of developments should adhere to universal design principles.  Obviously, the whole idea of universal design is that every development would have universal design principles.  We must be realistic, however, and say that we cannot rebuild everything from scratch.</p> <p>The points on the urgent audit of living conditions in all Traveller-specific accommodation, as well as bypassing Part 8 planning for Traveller-specific accommodation, were agreed in the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community, on which I sit and which is chaired by Senator Flynn.  It was an excellent report but we all said at the time that we need to constantly come back to see what progress is being made.  There has not been much progress in all the halting sites I have visited.  Certainly, in my own county of Galway, we met with the council, having visited all the halting sites as a committee without the council, I might add.  We were given very pretty looking designs for developments, none of which have been executed.  It is constantly promise after promise.  Local authorities have much to answer for.  It is also a national Government issue, however.  I definitely take that on board.</p> <p>Another of the Senators' asks is to recognise the traumatic impact of homelessness.  Budget 2022 has committed to a record &euro;194 million for homeless services.  Of course, this should be increased to provide every homeless person and family with wraparound supports.  It was significant that the Housing First programme was in Housing for All.  That was a really good move.  That is something all the homeless and housing organisations I was in contact with were looking for.  I was in the housing committee part of a public participation network and that was something we sought.</p> <p>There is so much in this motion but I will also address the issue of vacancy.  The motion calls on the Government to "take immediate action to bring the 4,000 vacant council houses owned by local authorities into use".  I am pleased to say that we in the Green Party are passionate about this area.  I recently supported my colleague, Deputy Matthews, on the vacancy, dereliction and regeneration Bill 2022.  If implemented, and I hope the Minister of State will take this on board, this would see a 3% tax on all homes in Ireland that have been vacant for six months, to be collected by Revenue.  All money collected would go back to the relevant local authority to address the housing need in that area.  A revamped derelict sites tax would also be collected by Revenue and go back to building sites in the local authority.  A one-stop-shop system would make it easier for people because two problems exist, the first of which is that homeowners find it quite difficult.  It is really important that we look at Revenue doing the collection rather than local authorities because the collection rates are outrageous with regard to vacancy and dereliction.</p></speech>

The guests in the Public Gallery are also very welcome.  I commend Senators Ruane, Flynn, Black and Higgins for bringing forward this motion, which is a welcome opportunity to discuss housing outside the confines of legislation, which many of us do often.  I thank them for tabling this motion.</p> <p>I wish to address two items in the motion, that is, vacant homes and child and family homelessness.  I also want to pick up on the right to housing issue that was mentioned by Senators Fitzpatrick and Boyhan.  It is time for us to set a date for the referendum on a right to housing.  Inserting that right into the Constitution was supported by 84% of the Constitutional Convention in 2014.  As Senator Fitzpatrick said, we are not saying that inserting that right into the Constitution will in and of itself solve the housing crisis on its own, but it would force this Government, and any Government after it, to ensure that any legislation or policy is proofed and that it reasonably affects that right.</p> <p>As Senator Boyhan said, I do not believe this issue needs to go to another committee.  Home for Good, a civil society campaign, has the wording for the legislation ready to go and has sent it to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann, through Senator Fitzpatrick's motion last June, supports the insertion of a right to housing into the Constitution.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage has also considered the legislation from Home for Good.  I think most of the committee support it.  The Government needs to proceed with the Attorney General and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to prepare a constitutional amendment on the right to housing and set a date for that referendum.</p> <p>I want to talk about the troubling trends in terms of family homelessness and then come to child homelessness, which is mentioned in the motion.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive homelessness report indicates that new family homeless presentations are trending steadily upwards.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In January in Dublin, 19 more families were accessing emergency homes accommodation than there were in December.  When we compare January this year with January last year, 79 more families were accessing emergency accommodation in Dublin.  When people do get to into emergency accommodation, they are also spending longer in it.  In January 2022, 21% of families were in emergency accommodation for more than two years.  Nobody should be in emergency accommodation for more than six months.  Many of the people who have been in emergency accommodation have been homeless for three or, in some cases, four years.  The Government must accept that to deal with this issue, we need to increase the delivery of real social housing and Housing First tenancies.  Two Bills have passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in this term: Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s family homeless prevention Bill and the Simon Communities homeless prevention Bill, and they need to be set up.</p><p>The motion mentions Article 27 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  I want to reference the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance report card from 2022.  It is a wake-up call for these Houses and for the Government in terms of our failure to deal with the rise in homelessness.  We need to prevent children from entering homelessness in the first place.  Again, the Simon Communities homelessness prevention Bill must be progressed.  Legislation has also been put forward by Focus Ireland that seeks to do that.</p><p>The previous Government had a vacant homes strategy that was an abject failure.  Its repair and lease scheme had a target of returning 3,000 homes back into stock by 2022.  It only delivered 273 homes.  That was 8% of the target.  While no targets were set for the buy and renew scheme, 670 homes were delivered in five years.  That is difficult to understand.  We seem to be continuing by poorly resourcing these schemes.  We have the aim of returning 2,500 vacant homes back into use by 2026.  That is only 500 homes per year.  As Senator Boyhan has mentioned, the problem is not primarily at local authority level.  We therefore need to fund those schemes and we need a real sense of urgency in bringing vacancy back into use.  We also need to get proper data.  We see varying figures on the number of homes that are vacant.  We need better data on that.  We need a dedicated vacant homes officer in every local authority.</p><p>I commend the motion.  It has Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s support.  I commend the Civil Engagement Group on bringing it forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-02a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1672" speakername="Rebecca Moynihan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022030200002#RR00200"><p>I welcome the people in the Gallery.  I also commend the Civil Engagement Group which, as always, has put forward a well-thought out, policy-driven motion and a Private Members' Bill.</p><p>I will focus on one specific aspect and type of housing, which is renting.  That is where there is huge insecurity and precariousness.  Just as we came into this Chamber, the Parliamentary Budget Office put out a report on housing.  It states that:</p> <blockquote> 	The reliance of the State on meeting housing needs through current funded supports to private rental tenancies (reaching 38% of all private rental tenancies at end 2020) is only viable, in the long-term, in housing markets with sufficient housing supply.  However, rising rents and limited supply of private rental properties &ndash; from which current funded housing are mostly sourced - can result in long-term needs being met through short-term and comparatively precarious accommodation solutions.  These households&rsquo; social housing needs are increasingly hard to meet from the private market, with the combination of limited supply of new or additional units, and rising rental costs within the sector. </blockquote> <p>I think that gets to the heart of the problem and the issue in the housing sector.  It feeds particularly well into the motion that has been tabled by the Civil Engagement Group, which is essentially advocating for a shift in how housing policy is run in this country.</p><p>We did have shifts in housing policy at the end of the 1980s and, especially, in the 2000s, away from supporting homeownership and State-built social housing to supporting the private rental sector.  Then we had the financial crash, our construction sector dried up and the supply dried up.  Ten years on, the fallacy and danger of, and the risks associated with, the ticking over, so to speak, of social housing supports in the private rented sector are now coming home to the roost.</p><p>Renters in Ireland have always been treated like second-class citizens.  That is the long and the short of it.  Everything this motion seeks to note is fact.  It is a fact that the cost of renting in this country has gone out of the reach of the ordinary person.  In Dublin, rent is more than &euro;2,000.  Every single county in this country has seen rental increases that have broken the consumer price index as well as the old 4% limit in rent pressure zones, RPZs.  Some counties are seeing double digit increases.  Some counties are seeing increases of up to 20% in one year in the cost of renting.</p><p>I am a mortgage holder.  If I had at the very base level, which is 2% of an increase every year on my mortgage, you would soon be hearing about it from mortgage holders.  Yet we take this as something normal that happens to renters.  We are told we cannot possibly have something like a rent freeze because that will take up supply and will stop supply.  However, the reality is that a short-term, well-targeted rent freeze is something we can do from a State perspective.  It is a real intervention we can make, and not just to stop rent increases, because at this stage we need rents to fall.  That is where we are at.  We need rents to fall.  For our renting to be affordable, and I will use the example of Dublin, you have to have a net household income of &euro;6,000 per month, either through one person or two people.  That is out of the reach of many people.</p><p>It is a fact that the increase in the cost of renting has led to an increase in evictions and an increase in homelessness.  Rental precariousness is the single greatest driver of family and childhood homelessness in this country.  The motion recognises that households that are already at the margins of society and those who need proper State supports are those that are most badly affected by the increases in the cost of renting.  It cannot be overstated the effect this will have on exacerbating inequality.  By failing to tackle the cost of renting, we are failing to ensure all people in this country have access to a home and we are only widening these gaps in our society.</p><p>Ireland deserves to have true equality, and central to that is economic and housing equality.  You cannot do well in school if you do not have access to somewhere secure to sleep and somewhere secure to study.  You cannot go to work and get a job if you do not have access to somewhere to wash your clothes and somewhere to be able to sleep and rest.  Housing insecurity and housing inequality has a knock-on effect on all other levels of inequality.</p><p>I thank the Civil Engagement Group for tabling this motion.  The central issue is we need a shift in how we think about housing.  It is about shelter.  It is about a home.  It is not about housing being a commodity.</p></speech>

I also welcome our guests into the Chamber this evening.  I am glad we will not be opposing this motion because housing is something for which we all have a huge responsibility.  I am listening to what everybody is saying.</p><p>Housing is one of the core issues this Government was formed to tackle.  We understand the scale of the problem people are facing with regard to rent and house prices.  While the substantive issue we face will not be resolved overnight, slow progress is being made, and it is slow progress.</p><p>Housing for All gives certainty and stability for those who want to finance and build homes.  To deliver houses at the substantial scale we need across the country, capital from all sources, including private investment, will be required.  Increasing supply will also help to moderate house price increases.  I think we all accept that.  It is the only place we are going to bring down prices and get more supply.</p><p>The Government's Housing for All document outlines a large number of actions along with the &euro;20 billion State investment in housing to the end of 2026.  That is committed money.  The strong pipeline of homebuilding activity is encouraging.  New figures from the past 12 months show commencement notices in respect of 31,000 new homes were received.  This is the highest rolling 12-month total since comparable data was first published.  While I know that is still going to be a very small contribution, we must acknowledge it is a movement in the right way.  I keep going back to the fact that we must have more supply to ensure rent prices, in particular, come down.  We recognise there is an ongoing challenge to the delivery of housing and it will take time before the full benefits of Housing for All are tangible to all our citizens.  We are confident that this plan can and will deliver, however.</p><p>The cost of rent all over the country is a massive issue.  The quarter 3 2021 rent index showed that year-on-year, new rents increased nationally by 8.3%.  This growth was higher than the previous quarter's 7% and the highest since quarter 4 of 2017, which recorded growth of 8.4%.  The standardised average national rent for houses was &euro;1,395 per month; a rise of 3.7% on the previous quarter and 11% year-on-year.  The standardised average rent for apartments was &euro;1,419 for quarter 3 of 2021.  That was an increase of 2.9% on the previous quarter but a rise of 6.6% year-on-year.  No matter where one goes in the country, and I know it is a bigger issue in the bigger urban areas, one finds that rent costs have gone through the roof.  Even in my own county, people who were never in trouble with rent have come to me now in desperate trouble, and that is in a rural area.</p><p>In my view, the most effective way to assist renters in the medium- to long-term is to increase supply, as I said earlier, and accelerate the delivery of housing for the private and social rental sector.  Housing for All: A New Housing Plan for Ireland sets out the Government's plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade.  That must be achieved.  I acknowledge that if we do not do that, we will have failed as Oireachtas people.  We will really have failed if we do not deliver that.  I really hope that will be achievable.</p><p>Cost rental is a long-term rental model in which tenants only pay the cost of providing, managing and maintaining their homes.  It is fair to say there is a commitment through approved housing bodies, local authorities and the LDA under Project Tosaigh to have more houses available.  Some 1,500 cost-rental homes are targeted for completion and tenanting this year alone.  Overall, some 18,000 cost-rental homes are targeted for completion under Housing for All to 2030.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to extend the operation of the RPZs until the end of 2024.  The Act also provides that rent reviews outside RPZs can until 2025 occur no more frequently than biannually.  This will provide rent certainty for tenants outside the RPZs for a minimum two-year period.  The Act also introduced measures to better protect tenants with affordability challenges by prohibiting any necessary rent increase in the RPZ from exceeding general inflation recorded by the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP.  To address the rent affordability challenges that are building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate as recorded by the HICP, since 11 December 2021 the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 provides for a cap of 2% per annum <i>pro rata</i>on rent increases in RPZs where the inflation rate is higher.  In effect, this will mean that rents in the RPZ may only increase by a maximum of 2% per annum <i>pro rata</i>during times of higher inflation.</p><p>We all know there is a huge issue in that regard.  We all know there is a huge issue of homelessness, of which I am not proud in any way, shape or form.  It is dreadful to see the numbers of people who are still homeless.  I honestly believe we are on the right track, however.  The improvement in what we actually get delivered is where it all happens.  I am hopeful that can happen sooner rather than in the longer term.  We need that to happen.  I thank Senators very much again for tabling the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-02a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022030200002#SS00200"><p>The Civil Engagement Group usually brings forward legislation and not motions.  We chose to bring a motion forward because we realised we were coming again and again to the issue of housing through many different pieces of legislation and policy debates.  It has been a core concern for everyone in Ireland and for our group, particularly those who are most marginalised within the discussions on housing.</p> <p>Our very first Private Members' motion in 2016, in the previous Oireachtas, was on housing and disability.  Again, it is unfortunate that we still have not delivered what we need, even though Ireland has now ratified the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  In the years since then, the urgency in that motion, which got cross-party support at the time, has increased and is all the more now.</p> <p>In 2017, we introduced the Derelict and Vacant Sites Bill 2017 with former Senator Grace O'Sullivan.  Again, in that Bill, we were told that strategies were in place and not to worry yet we know and see that derelict and vacant sites have become an ever-hotter and more urgent issue.  I welcome that Government legislation has now been proposed by some of the Government Members but it needs to be moved forward.  We put those ideas on the table back in 2017.  Much has been lost in the interim; time has been lost.</p> <p>When strategic housing developments and fast-tracked planning was proposed in 2017, we looked for use-it-or-lose-it clauses because developers said they would treat this as speculation and not build unless they were required to, and that is what has happened.  At that same time, we looked for better protection from evictions.  We have since seen waves of evictions.  I say that not to say we said all this but to point out that these dots and issues have existed for a while.  They were in the previous Oireachtas and they are in this one .  We need to join them together into a bigger picture of change.</p> <p>Reports on lone parents, which we had in the previous Oireachtas, set shocking alarm bells ringing on deprivation levels for lone-parent families in Ireland.  It is not surprising we see now that is matching on to 53% of homeless families being headed by lone parents.  There is almost a cognitive dissonance between a certain image of what Ireland's incomes are and what the incomes of most people actually are in Ireland.  The fact that we have huge income inequality is really important.  It is unfortunate, and this is a deep debate we have had in this Oireachtas, that affordability has been attached to a market indicator rather than to what people can actually afford.</p> <p>All these issues come together, which is why we wanted this motion.  It is to recognise that we had debates and, indeed, support.  We went back and forth with people on these issues and they called for a bigger picture.  They picture they called for, which is really important and about which Senator Moynihan spoke, is not just about doing a bit more but about doing things differently.  It is not about making progress or starting from where we were.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is because we must acknowledge and recognise that we have not necessarily always been doing things the right way.  One of the key areas, which it was important to address in the motion, relates to the financialisation of housing.  We know that leasing is bad value for the State and creates perverse incentives.  It is disappointing that even in Housing for All we still see a reliance on securing more than 2,600 houses through lease.  People know what the problems are with leasing.  It is disappointing that we see new contracts being signed again this week with hotels in respect of direct provision.  I understand that these are the emergency measures being used, the fig leaves, but they have been used for a long time.  If we are to address this, what we need to understand is that the market's goals and the State's goals are not necessarily aligned.</p><p>The most important line in the motion is an optimistic one, but it is also a challenging one.  It reads: "it is within the capacity and means of the State to solve the housing crisis."  It is within the capacity and the means of the State, because we do have access to finance.  With the fiscal rules currently suspended, we have access in a very different way than we ever had before.  It must not be the State encouraging solutions to solve the housing crisis or incentivising actors within a property market in the hope that secure housing somehow falls out of that.  It must be the State taking the lead and recognising that, in fact, there are times when the interests of property speculation, such as with REITs, vulture funds and the commercial rental sector, are not aligned with, and may be at odds with, the needs of the public and the common good.  We must be willing when it comes to those tension points to choose the common good and to have rent go down, not to be capped, and to accept and even seek a deflation in the property market rather than propping it up indefinitely.</p><p>The motion we heard today, the statement from a future Minister, or from any Minister for housing, was a statement about taking responsibility and putting on the record that we know the picture of what is happening in Ireland and that we take responsibility.  We do not want to be in a position of taking responsibility and making further apologies in the future; we must take responsibility right now as elected decision makers and say that we will use every year, week and month of the time we have in office, and that the Minister of State has in government, to try to progress it.  That is the more positive, optimistic way to take responsibility.  We must place the State centre stage in that.  We cannot abdicate that responsibility in any way.  I hope the Minister of State can take ideas from the motion, accept the recommendations, bring them forward and level up our ambition as a State on these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-02a.165" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022030200002#TT00200"><p>I thank the Civil Engagement Group for its motion, all the Senators who spoke on the motion and those in the Gallery for listening to the debate.</p> <p>In the first instance, I will outline where I am coming from in the debate.  It is as someone who holds a weekly clinic in my home town of Mullingar and hears every week from many vulnerable people who are looking for sustainable housing solutions and are facing huge pressure from ever-increasing rents and the threat of rent increases.  We are trying to combat that.  I hear what is said sometimes about where the State is coming from.  Incendiary language is often used when referring to the private sector, developers and vulture funds.  I come from a working class background.  I am a father of two children and a husband who is trying to better my community in every way I can.</p> <p>When we point out these vulnerable cases, it is also incumbent on us as public representatives to offer hope, point to the metrics that show 31,000 commencements have been issued and reflect to people what that means.  Right now, in 31,000 sites we have bulldozers and labourers with skill sets working to deliver those homes on the ground.  There has been a 42% increase in output since 2020.  Those homes will be a solution for many people.  That is how we must focus on meeting the ESRI requirement to exceed 33,000 houses per annum in the economy.</p> <p>We can all allude to our own version of events.  It is very frustrating that in the past decade, the country was on a very difficult path.  Ten years ago, the State had no capacity to borrow money.  We had 3,000 ghost estates around the country and our 31 local authorities were saturated in debt.  The mortgage-to-rent scheme was piloted in Dublin and in my county, Westmeath, because affordable housing had failed at that juncture as the loans could not be repaid.  Two thirds of the construction workforce had left the country.  Each year subsequent to that, when the State had no capacity to deliver housing for citizens who so badly needed it, demand increased.  Sometimes the narrative is framed in such a way as to suggest the State stood idly by and watched demand increase.  The problem was it did not have the capacity to respond at the point it most needed to respond.</p> <p>For these reasons, the Government has now committed &euro;4 billion in multi-annual funding through Housing for All.  That is reflected on the ground by the metrics I pointed out.  This will mean that right across all arms of the State, there will be a tenfold increase in the output of social housing from 2026.  It will also mean we will have more affordable and cost-rental housing.  Rents in the cost-rental projects that are being delivered this year are, on average, 40% to 50% below market rents.  That is a viable, sustainable housing solution for families who badly need it.</p> <p>We must also ensure the private sector keeps providing more homes.  This is a societal issue rather than an issue for only one part of society.  There are many sections of society that badly need housing.  We need strong, sustainable output to ensure people's aspiration to get the keys to their own home can be realised.  That is the first message I want to get across to everyone in the Seanad this afternoon.  There is hope and there is evidence that housing output is increasing rapidly.</p> <p>Many speakers drew attention to the frustration that has built up in people at how the State did not take action in the past.  The State is now taking a number of actions, including to address land hoarding and vacant and derelict properties.  In the first instance, we have the zoned land tax, and the mapping procedures are now being carried out for that across the State.  It is saying to developers that if they have zoned land and are sitting idly in the hope that the value of their land will continue to increase at the expense of society at large and those who badly need a home, the State will now intervene and tax them unless they apply to de-zone the land.</p> <p>Second, we are looking at capturing land value sharing, which will focus on the ever-increasing number of individuals not turning zoned land into housing units.  They will now have to share the uplift in the value of the land with the State and put in vital public infrastructure that is absent in so many locations around the country.  We have worked so hard as a society to get to a plan-led system whereby we have key infrastructure provided in response to plans setting out where housing should be developed.  A decade ago, we had enough land zoned in this country to accommodate the population growing by an extra 10 million people.  How could the State predict where the houses were going to be built?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Essentially, the State does not have a bottomless pit of money to put into infrastructure such as wastewater infrastructure in all areas where land is zoned.  However, now we are in a position where we have zoned land that is in line with the national planning framework, it is based on population trajectories in line with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the State can now go after this land and put the infrastructure in to ensure that people have a viable chance of delivering housing solutions on that land.  </p><p>In regard to the Constitution, that is a very well made point in terms of the commission on housing, on which a chairperson has now been installed to make a determination and adjudicate on what way property rights should be reflected in our Constitution.  That is important to many people.  That work is continuing at pace.  Across the 31 local authorities vacancy and dereliction are huge issues.  By quarter 2 of this year we aim to have a full-time vacant homes officer in every local authority.  We have increased the funding by 20%.  The problem heretofore had been that across the local authority network there were just three of the 31 local authorities that had a full-time vacant homes officer.  In quarter 2 of this year we will be in a position whereby every local authority will have one.</p><p>Funding streams such as the urban regeneration and development fund, the rural regeneration and development fund, Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns and villages scheme when the regulations are through this year, the repair and leasing scheme, and the buy and renew scheme, will wrap around to deliver key derelict sites back into use.  That is important to us as a State.  On many occasions it has been termed the low hanging fruit that we have to get to grips with.  I believe we have the right suite of measures to do that.  The Towns First initiative which was launched a number of weeks ago has 33 actions and 12 case studies looking at unlocking the potential of derelict property.  </p><p>One issue I wish to speak about which is very close to my heart is Traveller accommodation.  This is an issue I have taken on as best I can to try and resolve.  Some Members alluded to this, such as Senator Boyhan regarding Cork, and Senator Flynn.  I have a situation now whereby bi-weekly meetings are held, managing that issue in Cork.  I was in Cork and visited every family on the site.  We now have what is hopefully a sustainable solution for that area.  I met with the rights commissioner and the children's ombudsman.  I engaged with all the groups trying to implement our expert report whereby we have 32 recommendations.  I sit in on as many of the meetings as I can to ensure that we are continuing at pace to implement those recommendations.  Shortly we will publish them all on our website, in regard to the pathway and at what stage each one of those is.  It is important to have 100% transparency on this issue and that any blockages are there for all to see.  We work very hard.  I have met many Opposition parties in this regard and I know the Oireachtas is united in trying to unlock this problem.  We have to ensure that units are being delivered on the ground.  For the second year running we have spent and committed our full budget.  That is welcome.</p><p>In the first year Covid-19 was one of the key causes of this problem, which is why this year I have been engaging strongly with all the chief executives throughout the country to ensure that the budget was spent.  Delivering on that sends out a very strong signal.  Also in regard to Traveller accommodation I have made it clear to all the areas that my door is always open if there are any issues that specifically relate to sites.  We had about 200 audits throughout the country on sites that we have responded to, and we have put in remedial works in some.  We have increased the caretaker allowance.  We have the caravan loan scheme.  I have met some of the groups.  There are issues relating to insurance that we are trying to work out.  I spoke to the rights commissioner about that in terms of equal access for every individual within the State.  We are working hard through all those schemes to try and alleviate them.</p><p>I also want to point to some progress.  As I pointed out how many commencement notices are issued, we have also seen a 33% reduction in Dublin city's social housing list over the past four years.  That is progress.  Those families now have a sustainable solution.  I feel for so many people.  As a dad at Christmas time it really hits one that people are in emergency accommodation, have such an uncertain future and are so hoping for news that they will have their home, their future and the certainty that they so badly need.  As I pointed out, there are a number of developments throughout the city that are going to unlock that.  It can be frustrating in terms of the timeline, trying to ensure that these units come as quickly as possible but I can absolutely assure people that money is not an issue anymore, the will is not an issue.  We have Housing for All, a document that goes right across the heart of government, across every single area to unlock all those units and get to that key figure of 33,000 units a year and beyond right out to 2030.  That will provide the solution and a pathway.  We will have to change things as we go along.  I have no doubt about that.  That is why I value the contribution from the Members of the Seanad, as I do in the D&aacute;il, in terms of getting advice and trying to improve the way we work and deliver units.  </p><p>We all must work together when we are trying to solve the issue regarding housing, every single one of us.  One thing I am very clear on is that nobody has a patent on compassion.  We all come into this House to do our very best for the people we represent.  When I go next Monday and meet the people in my clinic, some of whom are very vulnerable, sometimes it can be very frustrating on my part when I cannot give the certainty I would love to give.  What I always say is that in my own town, and I say it to the people who are here, there are three sites with more than 100 units being constructed as I talk to people in my clinic.  I know that will provide hope.  Mullingar is not of the same scale as Dublin but still I can see hope for people and see that these units are coming down the tracks.</p><p>I want to finish up the debate on this point.  I will do all I can with the mandate I have to try my very best in the Department to work for people who so badly need their future certainty of the chance of getting the keys to their own home for their families.  I will continue to do that to the best of my ability.  It will be up to the electorate to judge me on that afterwards.</p></speech>

What strikes me is that we all have a common goal but what frightens me is how long we attach ourselves to how we do that.  We talk about working together and then we listen to Senator Higgins talking about those tension points and how things work when so many people have different ideas.  Up until this point, we have not got it right.  When do we admit that we have not got it right and have to change direction?  That is what scares me.</p> <p>What struck me about what Senator Higgins said was that we are just doing more of the same, or tinkering around that idea.  At some point we have to be able to measure when it is working and when it is not working and be willing to deviate from how we are doing things.  Sometimes I worry that as politicians, policymakers and civil servants we marry ourselves so tightly to an idea that we often do not want to believe it will fail.  We must at some point be willing to step into failure, notice it, acknowledge it, take responsibility for it, agree to change direction and be willing to let go of something we have clung on to so tightly as a way forward.  That is what I ask going forward.</p> <p>So many people have confidence in or hopes for the Housing for All policy.  How long do we measure something to ensure it is working?  Is the commitment always there to acknowledge that if those aspirations that are laid before us today by everyone are not working we then say, "Okay we need to step away from this now and maybe we need to look other ways to do housing"?  That has clearly been spoken about in the Chamber today.</p> <p>We are looking forward, but what about when we look back?  Beyond just ensuring that this generation and the ones to come do not experience what has gone on in the past, how do we rectify what has happened?  That is a conversation that needs to be had.  I am sure there are thousands of human rights cases at this stage that could be taken to the European Court of Human Rights in regard to how people are living.  How do we make recompense for that?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I recall when I first came into this Chamber, I was trying to support a girl from Tallaght who was housed in a hotel room in Sandymount, I think, and she did not drive.  She felt she was a failure because she was still feeding bottled milk to her child who should have moved on to solid food because she did not have the capacity within the hotel room or the capacity to travel back to her family who lived in Tallaght.  She needed to take a bus to town and another from town to Tallaght, which takes a lot of time.  Therefore, she had to choose to leave her child on SMA milk or some sort of powdered milk when the child should have been progressing onto solid food.  That is just one tiny issue.  Can the House imagine all the stories and situations where people's health has been impacted for years to come, their mental health, their family situations, family breakdowns or addition that has been a result of homelessness?  When we think of policy for the future to ensure it never happens again, how do we begin to actually address that?  That has to be a massive part of the conversation when we talk about working together and looking to the future.  A right to housing is good but, again, it is about action for the future and responsibility for what has happened.  </p><p>I recall working with Safetynet during the lockdown.  We were not sitting at the time, so I went and volunteered with Safetynet for a while.  I had to visit a halting site to offer hepatitis vaccinations because Travellers were being exposed to hepatitis B in the water because of the conditions.  I think, "God, that was 2021 in Ireland," when that was happening.  Those are the substandard conditions that we are talking about that are a complete violation of people's human rights.  As we look forward about how we do things, we probably need to have a conversation about how that recompense and support happens for people whose lives no housing policy in the future will be able to correct because the damage is so deep and prevalent.  I ask Members to keep that in mind as well as we look forward to that idea of working together in how we can do housing differently.</p></speech>
