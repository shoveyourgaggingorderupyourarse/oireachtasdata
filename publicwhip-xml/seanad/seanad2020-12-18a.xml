This time last year, little did those of us who were in the Chamber think we would have the year that has just gone by.  It has been a strange and tough year for many families, especially those who have lost loved ones along the way in difficult and strenuous circumstances.  It has also been a very tough year for many in the business community, who struggle each day and will continue to do so for some time to come.  Nevertheless, it is a time of year for families.  I extend a happy Christmas to the Cathaoirleach and commend him on the job he has done since he took the Chair.  He has been fair and impartial and I thank him and congratulate him for that.  To the Leader and the rest of my colleagues in the Chamber, I wish for them a happy and healthy Christmas and, hopefully, a brighter new year.  I cannot speak highly enough of Martin, Brigid and all the staff in the various sections of the Houses in the context of the courtesy they extend to us and for how helpful they are to us.  I extend a happy and healthy Christmas to them and, hopefully, a brighter 2021.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#A00600"><p>I take this opportunity to say a few thanks.  What a year it has been.  Little did we think this time last year that we would be facing into a 2020 general election and Seanad election and a huge intake of new Senators - what an honour and achievement for them, personally.  I remember the people who contested an election but did not succeed on that occasion.  I hope we will see many of them here in future.  It is important that we acknowledge the difficulties and challenges of contesting any election but that is the great thing about parliamentary democracy.</p> <p>I thank Martin, the Clerk of the Seanad, Brigid and all the people in the background in the Seanad Office, and in the Leader's office, Orla Murray and how she co-ordinates the work behind the scenes among Departments, Ministers, speakers and the schedules every week.  I thank the Cathaoirleach, Grace Coyle and all the others who work behind the scenes.  This has been a difficult year for all of us.  It has been a challenging year for business, as has been noted.  I acknowledge the people involved in the Community Call.  Local government shone brightest when people stood up and responded to the Community Call and I acknowledge the councils and local government throughout the country.</p> <p>Finally, I pay special thanks to Senator Flynn.  Anyone who saw her last night could not but be moved by this most wonderful Senator and by the journey she has taken through her life and personal experiences to be rightfully here, sitting in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Anyone who watched it could not but be moved by the extraordinary journey that Senator Flynn took.  It shows that anybody can do anything they want if they set their mind to it and they are determined.  I acknowledge her work.  I also acknowledge the Members in this House and the great diversity of our membership.</p><p>I will leave the Leader with one ask.  I hope that early next year we will have the two by-elections for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is too important and it should not become a political issue or be divisive.  There are vacancies for two seats in this House.  I ask the Leader to engage with the Government to see if the early writ could be moved for both of those vacancies to have the election and to have, rightfully, two more new Senators in place in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I thank the Leader personally and wish her well for Christmas, as I do with all the Members in this House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1631" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#B00200"><p>I join others on behalf of the Labour Party group in wishing all colleagues across the House well for the Christmas break and the new year.  In particular, I wish you well, a Chathaoirligh, and Martin, Bridget, Grace and all in the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s office, the Leader and all in her office, Orla Murray and others, who make the Seanad run so smoothly.  I thank them all for their hard work this year.  Undoubtedly, it has been a very tough year.  At this time, we also remember the many who have been bereaved or whose health and livelihoods have been so badly affected by the Covid pandemic.  We look forward to a better year for us all in 2021.</p> <p>Today is International Migrants Day.  I look forward in the new year to making rapid progress on our citizenship law, being brought forward by the Labour Party group in memory of our dear colleague, Cormac &Oacute; Braon&aacute;in.  In keeping with our Born Here, Belong Here campaign, I met this week with the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.  I thank her and her officials for their engagement with me and I look forward to further engagement in the new year and to making progress on that issue.</p> <p>I also thank colleagues for their support for the other Labour Party Private Members' Bill on which we have seen great progress on Coco's Law.  We will be dealing with all Stages of the harassment Bill today.  I know some colleagues have tabled a number of amendments.  This Bill is being brought forward more swiftly than Bills are normally brought forward, with the agreement of all of us, in particular those of us in the Labour Party group and of my colleague, Deputy Howlin.  We ask colleagues to bear with that and to engage constructively with us to ensure that it is passed before Christmas.  There is clearly an urgency to this Bill, as we have seen in dreadful reports of breaches of privacy for people, and with their images being disclosed online.  We heard that from Jackie Fox herself, whose daughter committed suicide after a campaign of online bullying.  That is why we call this Bill Coco's Law.  I look forward to the debate this afternoon.  I thank the Leader for accommodating it on the last day of the term.  It will be a positive note to be legislating on this important new law before we break for Christmas.</p> <p>I thank Chloe Manahan in my office, who has done sterling work with me over the past year.  I again wish everyone a happy Christmas. Nollaig shona d&oacute;ibh go l&eacute;ir.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1688" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#B00300"><p>I echo the words of well wishes for Christmas and the new year.  I did not wish to bring in a sombre tone but while we reflect upon what a year it has been, unfortunately, we are still in this year and it remains a very worrying and unsure period for people, not least heading into the Christmas break.  I wish to use the platform afforded to me here this morning to encourage people to remain steadfast in adhering to the consistent and long-standing public health advice on the Covid-19 pandemic that is familiar to us all.  I am sure the Leader saw in the North last night the introduction of comprehensive new restrictions, which I believe are necessary.  I commend my party vice president and joint First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, for her clear communication of those new restrictions and her public engagement both last night and this morning.  I understand there will be North-South engagement later this afternoon.  I have said consistently that we need to see that clear, comprehensive all-Ireland strategy, planning, engagement and community, which will be key over the Christmas period.</p> <p>That said, people in this State also need clarity.  We are heading into a wind-down for the Christmas break.  Businesses, business leaders, community leaders, healthcare workers, carers, families and private citizens all need to hear what, if any, new restrictions will be put in place.  The Cabinet should meet as a matter of urgency over the weekend to ensure that the message is communicated, updated and co-ordinated in a way that meets the needs of people in the context of the ever-changing and ever-evolving situation.</p> <p>We are just hours away from the Brexit deadline.  It is something that we have worked on comprehensively as a Seanad in this term and in the previous term, not least through the work of the Seanad select committee on Brexit.  I wish continued success and best wishes to the Government in its efforts on this, but in particular to the EU team.  There is no good that can come from Brexit.  There are only varying degrees of harm that will be caused to this island.  At least we have a glimmer of hope with the adherence to the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol, but it is an unsure and uncertain time for people right across the island in the context of Brexit.</p> <p>In closing, I wish everyone a Nollaig shona agus athbhliain faoi mhaise and wish everyone well.  I look forward to seeing everyone in the new term, suitably refreshed and ready to go.  It is a very busy time for us.  It will be laden with expectation given what we are coming through at the moment.  I look forward to working with all colleagues across the House and wish them all every success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#B00400"><p>I wish a Nollaig shona agus athbhliain faoi mhaise to everybody in this House and to the staff.  Since I have come in here, many people have surprised me with how much they are committed to public service, but one thing I have been amazed by is the people who transcribe the words of our debates, and do it so quickly.  They often make us sound a lot better than we are.  Their work should also be acknowledged.</p> <p>Often in this House we complain and give out about certain things in society but sometimes we need to reflect on how much we have achieved.  I welcome the publication this week of the United Nations Human Development Index, which placed Ireland second only to Norway.  I accept that there is much about this Republic that needs improving and there are a lot of changes that we collectively in these Houses need to ensure happen, but let us look at what we have achieved.  We have achieved much greater levels of participation in education and training and longer life expectancy.  It is a safe country in comparison with many other parts of the world.  It is important, in particular at this time, that we reflect on those other parts of the world and those who are not as lucky to live in as a safe democracy as this one.</p> <p>What struck me about the UN Human Development Index and the report itself is that a lot of our success is being attributed to our investment in education.  Over many years, successive governments have taken the decision to invest in education and it is what has led us to where we are today.  Education does not necessarily mean that we get to see the results overnight.  It is a long-term investment.  I hope we learn from that and we appreciate what we have and that we continue to make that long-term investment in education, not just for young people but in lifelong learning.</p></speech>

It took her long enough.  It took Miriam Lord to tell us.  I genuinely wish her, Alan and their daughters every happiness and congratulate them.  I apologise for springing that on her.</p></speech>

The nation holds its breath in the context of Brexit and the relationship between us as a people and Covid-19.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a need for the Government to bring clarity and certainty, and not to allow fear and wonder to continue over the Christmas period.  Shops, pubs and gastropubs have reopened and there is an air of worry again this morning around when they will close.</p><p>I wish the Cathaoirleach and all his family a very happy Christmas.  I thank all Members of the House for their courtesy and good humour during what has been a difficult year.  I appreciate and thank the staff of the Seanad Office, every one of them, and all the men and women who work in Leinster House.  Like Senator Byrne, I would particularly like to thank the unseen heroes of Leinster House: the people who transcribe, the people in the Bills Office, the people who put this place together, our cleaners, the porters and the ushers.  I thank everybody.  May they all have a peaceful Christmas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#C00200"><p>I want to acknowledge that it has been six months since I became a Senator here.  Reflecting back, I am proud of working with all my colleagues here to pass legislation that has had such an impact, particularly this year when dealing with Covid-19.</p> <p>I will mention a few other things around Christmas.  Again, I encourage people who are going home for Christmas and will be meeting their parents and grandparents to think about getting the children's nasal spray.  We have one week.  It will make a big impact and keep people out of hospital so it is a great thing.</p> <p>Today is a chance to wear something sparkly.  I wore my sparkly earrings as part of the Irish Cancer Society's #WearToCare initiative.  We can encourage people and all our colleagues.  Today is the day.  I am sure there are many sparkly things we can wear to promote something today to raise funds.  It has been a hard year for many charities to be raising funds.</p> <p>Lastly, we are opening up counties now and many people will be going home.  We can go back home to the west.  Traffic is heavy, so be safe.  I encourage people to think about shopping local when they get back to the town or village they left many years ago.  Perhaps we can all think about buying and supporting something local.  We should shop and look for local products because all of these things are important.</p> <p>I am biased because Ballinasloe looks absolutely beautiful with its brand-new lights.  I encourage anyone who is going back west to pop into Ballinasloe off the motorway and check out our lovely Christmas tree and reindeer.  It looks absolutely stunning.  People should bring the big and little kids and have a look.  If we can do that, we are really going to have a great Christmas.  I ask everyone to be happy and safe.  There are a few more hard months to go but we have light at the end of the tunnel.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#C00300"><p>I join all my colleagues in particularly thanking those who work in the background in Leinster House and make this House work like a well-oiled machine.  I wish the Cathaoirleach and the Leader a very happy Christmas.  Senator Bacik has blown me away today.  I congratulate her on her marriage.</p> <p>This year will stand out in my mind for the coronavirus and everything that goes with it.  What really stands out in my mind is the impact it has had on children.  It is no secret I was locked down for a fortnight because my three-year-old granddaughter tested positive.  I recall visiting the house after we were all locked down and going up to visit the grandchildren.  The five-year-old, Ellie, stood in front of Isabel and shouted across the corridor to me to stand back as there is a virus here.  That is what 2020 means to five-year-old kids.  When she is with me going into a shop, she will frequently pull me back to say there is no social distancing and we should not go in there.  I do not mean to put a downer on Christmas but if five-year-old children can see that, I must ask why adults cannot see the same.  Last night, I walked into a gastropub not too far from here and it was thronged.  I turned on my heel and walked out the door.  It is not an awful lot to ask.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Dolan, spoke about people travelling west.  Many people travelling west, south or north - it really does not matter - will be coming home to vulnerable grandparents or parents.  I believe the HSE message going out today is the right one.  Before people walk through the door, they should consider whether it is worth putting their lives at risk.  It really is a serious time.</p> <p>I thank everyone in this country who made it continue to work during a most horrendous year.  I am talking about the truck drivers, the packers of shelves in supermarkets, the nurses, doctors, garda&iacute;, and particularly, the love of my life, the Defence Forces, the guys who went out and set up tents and made this country work.  I hope we look after them better in 2021 than we have in 2020.  The Cathaoirleach is generous on the clock today.</p></speech>

It came up in my memory that this day two years ago, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 passed through the Seanad.  It has been two years since that legislation went through, which means it is up for review in the next 12 months.  I know we have had a pandemic and things have been knocked off keel a little bit in terms of scheduling but I ask the Leader to make sure it is on the agenda for next year.  It is an important matter.  As we know, people are still travelling and still affected so we need to make sure we get the legislation right.</p> <p>I also want to talk quickly about Transgender Equality Network Ireland, which is doing a talking census and information evening for journalists and people who will be talking about transgender issues and rights to show them how to do so in a way that is respectful of their lives and their truth.  As we have seen, the discourse online over the last couple of months in Ireland has gotten unpleasant and cruel.  I certainly encourage any journalist, or anyone who is interested, to take the time to engage with that evening session on how to talk about people, if we must talk about them.  I do not know that we necessarily need to talk about transgender people the way we do.  If we must, then we should talk in a way that is respectful for people who are simply trying to live their truth.</p> <p>I join others in thanking, particularly, the Clerk, Mr. Martin Groves, and the Clerk Assistant, Ms Brigid Doody, who were patient with me when I was learning.  I am still learning.  The Cathaoirleach has been very kind.  When I go blitzing through the place like a bit of a lunatic, the ushers and staff here are very patient with me.  When I do not know where I am going, they walk me to rooms and tell me what is happening.  Of course, I thank my Labour Party colleagues who have made me feel welcome.</p> <p>As Senator Dolan said, we have only been in here for six months.  I did not realise it was possible to ask so many questions and be so befuddled by things.  It is great to be in a parliamentary grouping with people who are kind and generous with their time.   Of course, I thank Ellen in my office, who is an eternal beacon of patience and kindness, and Ursula, who was working with me at the beginning.  I wish all Members a very happy Christmas and thank everyone here who has been kind and made me feel welcome.</p></speech>

It might calm me down a bit before I get into the substance of what I want to say today.  It has been a difficult year for everybody.  With regard to the House, I take this opportunity to wish a happy Christmas to the cleaning staff who knock quietly on our doors and clean the handles and all the surfaces we use, the catering staff, the ushers, the administration and, indeed, the Cathaoirleach.</p> <p>This is not a happy Christmas for the hospitality sector.  The news emanating since last night has been annoying, to say the least.  Today, we are opening our doors to residents from outside the county for the first time in months.  We were told last night that, possibly, people will not even get to New Year's Eve before they are locked down again.  I cannot express the words at the moment about the way the hospitality sector has been treated.  These are people's livelihoods and families are being affected.  This yo-yo effect is driving us insane and crazy.  It is all about personal responsibility.  Senator Craughwell might have been in a packed gastropub but he did the right thing; he walked out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pat Casey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is taking personal responsibility.  I was in a shopping centre the other day and while the shop staff were behaving correctly, the open space in that centre was packed with people so I left.  It is about taking personal responsibility but my frustration is that we, as a sector, have not been given that opportunity.  The hospitality sector, whether it is a wet pub, a dry pub or a hotel, cannot be blamed for this pandemic or the exponential factor that has caused the increase in the number of cases but our businesses are going down the Swanee every additional day this action is being taken.  Our survival is in question.  </p><p>Last night's news was the last straw for me as a person in the hospitality sector.  Even before we opened up to allow travel outside one's county we were told we will have to close and we might not even get New Year's Eve out of it.  What are we at?  Proof has not been given by the leader of my party, the Taoiseach.  I have asked him for proof.  I have also asked the Minister for Health.  Where is the evidence that shows the hospitality sector is the cause of this pandemic?  It does not exist.  We are not any different from any other sector but we are being victimised.  We are now going into recess, which means that Ministers will not be answerable to anybody here, and our own elected organisation will be leading the charge.</p><p>With all due respect to the Leader, I am totally frustrated and annoyed.  My family business is being jeopardised again, not because of what we have done.  We did everything we were asked to do.  The sector has done everything it was asked to do yet information was put out last night that we will not even get to New Year's Eve before we are shut down.  As I said, we are only opening today to visitors from outside the county.  I wish everyone a happy Christmas.</p></speech>

I want to come back to the public health situation in the North, which I raised on Wednesday.  I want to express my gratitude to the national ambulance service crews who will travel to Lurgan, Belfast and Craigavon hospitals this weekend to support the front line.  I repeat that whatever help is needed we should give it.</p> <p>The Executive yesterday took on the advice of the public health officials, which was the right and only thing to do given the potentially catastrophic circumstances.  I am glad all the political parties recognised that but to be clear, there is a great deal of disparity North and South when it comes to compliance and following public health guidance, the lack of which is driving up the numbers.  People need to ask themselves the reason for that.  A fully integrated all-Ireland approach would undoubtedly have been the best approach.  It puts the logical in epidemiological but, unfortunately, given where relationships are in the North, that was, and is, unlikely.  </p> <p>How can we expect others to behave differently if we are not willing to behave differently ourselves?  When we face differences and disagreements in the North, the answer always lies in the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.  The essence of the agreement is power-sharing.  Power-sharing has always been about problem-sharing - the idea that communities would come together in partnership as equals and with respect to solve problems that unite them instead of focusing on what divides them.  Covid-19 could have strengthened relationships in the North, and North and South, but that has not been the case and it is an awful pity.</p> <p>The ambulances going North this weekend is uncommon but it is not unheard of because a memorandum of understanding exists through the North-South Ministerial Council on cross-Border co-operation on ambulance services.  That is thanks to the framework of the Good Friday Agreement and the health sectoral work.  Where would we be now in responding to a public health crisis together, with three more years under our belt, if the Executive and the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement had not have lied idle for three years?</p> <p>We have a serious situation now that affects everyone on the island and we have a window of opportunity to react for the benefit of the whole island.  If we are bringing in restrictions in the South, we should align with the North as much as necessary to avoid see-saw, out-of-kilter guidelines around the Border area and address case numbers in places such as Donegal and Louth.  We may not get the official integrated North-South plan we want but we can create the alignment that we need.  I again wish everybody a happy Christmas.</p></speech>

I wish all my colleagues a safe, peaceful and happy Christmas.</p> <p>Senator Casey alluded to the hospitality sector.  Generations of my family have been in the hospitality sector in Galway.  What is happening at the moment is frightening.  Major issues are arising with regard to mental health and the well-being and livelihoods of families.  I want to raise two issues with the Leader.  First, all of this needs to be looked at in a more regional format.  Thankfully, the figures in Galway are very low as they are in other counties.  As alluded to by Senator Currie, there are major challenges in other counties on the Border but a more regional format needs to be considered.</p> <p>Second, next week is Christmas week.  In terms of the way the hospitality sector works, having respect for staff and families, there would be closure on Christmas Eve and possibly part of St. Stephen's Day.  We need to send a clear message to the hospitality sector by Tuesday at the very latest.  I was talking to a man this morning who employs more than 300 people in the sector in Galway.  In terms of his four or five outlets he would have stock the value of which would be in the region of a six-figure sum.  We have to be clear on the issue of orders.  In respect of all orders that would have had to go in yesterday for supply in ten days' time across the food sector, I would ask for notice and certainty to be given.  Every Member is correct that personal responsibility is important.  It is also the responsibility of licence holders and hoteliers.  I believe they are doing all they can do but it is crucial that we get notice and certainty at the earliest opportunity, possibly by Monday of next week or, at the very latest, on Tuesday because this is doing untold damage.</p> <p>I thank the Cathaoirleach also and wish each and every Member a happy and safe Christmas.</p></speech>

I thank Martin, Bridget and all the staff here for making me feel so welcome over the past six months.  I say to all my colleagues in the Seanad that I have enjoyed my time here over the past six months.  The work is certainly challenging.  These have been the most challenging of times for us all.  One can hear the pain felt this morning by Senators Casey and Crowe and all those in business at this time.  We have to be a little kinder in how we deal with people in business.  We are talking about businesses but also livelihoods and families.</p> <p>I pay tribute to the thousands of volunteers we have in the country.  They are the unsung heroes who volunteer week in, week out, whether it be Meals on Wheels, Tidy Towns associations or whatever they are doing to make life better in their own communities.  I want to take the time to acknowledge them this morning and wish each and every one of them, and each and every Member, a happy Christmas.</p></speech>

It is an incredible privilege to walk through the doors, if not overwhelming and daunting at times.  I pay a special tribute to my party colleagues whose forbearance has been extraordinary at times when I have gone in to their offices, and particularly that of the Leader, and asked, "How do I do this?".  I have had great guidance from them for which I thank them.  I thank all of the staff, Martin and Bridget, and the Cathaoirleach.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have good news that I want to share but I cannot do so without acknowledging the existential crisis facing the hospitality industry.  I am familiar with the hospitality industry and know the terrible hardship experienced by those working in and supplying it at the moment.  It seems trivial to go on with lighter happy things, but there are very serious challenges that we need to embrace and figure a way through in this most horrible of years.  I will end my contribution on a series of good news items.</p><p>I thank my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, for her announcement yesterday of the opening of Scoil Colm in Crumlin, Dublin 12, as a special needs school.  It has been fantastic to work with her.  She has only been in her role for six months and already major strides forward have been made.  I am very grateful for that.  It is a great relief to the Dublin 12 campaign for an autism-specific school.  We still have work to do with the Involve Autism group and we will move ahead on that in the new year.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I stood here and got very emotional about the need of Chernobyl Children International.  I am glad to announce that at least one of the containers has already been financed.  I thank my party colleagues who went out of the way and have asked not to be named but did special work on my behalf.  I am very grateful to them for that.  I am very grateful to Adi Roche and her team for their work.</p><p>Yesterday, a blue plaque was unveiled on the house in Leighlin Road in Crumlin where Phil Lynott grew up.  At this time of year, I always remember his mother, Philomena, and the legacy she ensured for her son.  I pay tribute to her as a great mother and a great role model.  I also pay tribute to Phil, by saying, "I sure miss you, honey, now you're not around".</p></speech>

It is a real honour and a privilege for all of us to be in this House.  I am conscious of what a difficult year it has been for everyone, with most of us facing into a difficult Christmas.  I and all of us in this House are very privileged to be here and I am grateful for that.  I thank all my colleagues in the Seanad.  I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and Grace Coyle in your office.  I thank Martin Groves and Bridget Doody.  I thank the Captain of the Guard and the ushers.  I thank the catering staff and everybody who works in Leinster House.  I thank the garda&iacute; who work outside and the postmen who come in.  They all help us to serve the people.  We have a great privilege.  I thank all of those who help us and enable us to do that.</p> <p>I am my party's spokesperson on housing.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has made a great start.  The budget has made an unprecedented investment in housing of &euro;3.3 billion.  Significant sums have been allocated to homelessness prevention.  There have been announcements of investment in affordable and public housing.  We will have significant work to do when we come back in the new year.  I look forward to working with everybody on all sides of the House to deliver on that.</p> <p>I have listened to my colleagues, Senators Casey and Crowe, and others who work in hospitality, including suppliers to the industry.  While we might feel we will not have the full Christmas we would have had in previous years, many people are risking their lives and their livelihoods to try to provide others with a Christmas.  The Government has a very difficult task and has done very well.  We have all done very well by keeping our distance, washing our hands and reducing our contacts to suppress the virus.  I believe everybody will try to do that.</p> <p>I urge the Leader to ask the Government to give certainty to the hospitality sector so that for the next two weeks at least, it can manage or attempt to manage the situation.  Those in the sector have had difficult choices to make on whether to open.  Many of them have, but uncertainty has been created in the last 48 hours.  NPHET has a job to do and I thank all those on NPHET for doing their job.  However, the hospitality sector needs some certainty over the next two weeks.  I urge the Leader to address that with the Government.  Nollaig shona do gach duine.</p></speech>

Last night, proof of that co-operation was evident in the announcement that in the North, schools will be supplied with period products free of charge from next year.  I again call on the programme for Government commitment to provide free period products to women and girls to be implemented as soon as possible.</p> <p>I wish to raise a very sad and annoying issue.  Despite the assurances the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, gave the House and despite assurances by the Taoiseach on 9 December that deportations would not happen during the pandemic, the evidence shows that deportations are being sped up this week and a number of people have been deported.  In the week leading up to Christmas, they will not have access to the courts and, worse, from 30 December those being deported to Britain will lose access to their EU rights.  They will lose their rights under the Common European Asylum System, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Everybody would agree that deporting people during a pandemic is particularly cold and callous, but especially in the week leading up to Christmas when we had been given assurances that it would not happen.  I ask the Leader to take that message back and to reiterate what this House endorsed, which was that deportations would not happen. </p></speech>

These businesses have bought stock on the assumption they would be open until early in the new year.  Even though people tried not to talk about it, there was always a feeling that they might need to close in January, but no one foresaw that it could happen between Christmas and the new year.</p> <p>In different areas of the country the hospitality industry has faced this situation of having to close down and reopen three, four or five times.  Every time it has asked for clarity as quickly as possible, which I know is a challenge.  Almost every time the decisions made for the hospitality industry in particular have been in line with the NPHET recommendations.  If we go with the recommendations NPHET gave last night, I urge especially at this time of year that we give those guidelines to the hospitality industry as quickly as possible.  As others have said, those in the sector have done a considerable amount in recent weeks to reopen their premises, taking the risk of them and their employees contracting the virus.  I ask that they be given as much clarity as possible.  It is an extremely difficult time for them.  Obviously, we worry about the people who want to go out and socialise during Christmas, but the most important thing is to give clarity to the people working there.</p> <p>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, Martin Groves, Bridget Doody and everyone in Leinster House for the phenomenal work they have done in the past six or nine months that I have had the privilege to be a Senator.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am very new and I want to wish all of my colleagues well over the Christmas period.

I thank everyone for their work.  Staff from across the House have been good to me and to all elected representatives and I thank them for the courtesy they have shown to us since we were elected.  I wish them well and hope they have a happy Christmas.</p> <p>I wish to raise a number of issues this morning, the first of which is the upcoming announcement relating to the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, which is expected early in the new year.  One of the towns in my constituency, Athlone, has submitted an application and I ask that it be given favourable consideration.  The application is for funding to redevelop a strategic but derelict site beside the shopping centre in the town to improve facilities as well as to augment the successful shop front enhancement scheme.  That scheme was introduced by Westmeath County Council a number of years ago and has been fantastic for every single town in that county.  It has been introduced in Longford too and has been very successful.  It enables businesses to upgrade the front of their premises.</p> <p>On sport, I was speaking to representatives of my local Longford Rugby Club recently who are seeking clarification from the Minister regarding the guidelines on what sports can be played.  Many local schools and the vast majority of club players have not played a game of rugby since 19 March.  This is an extremely important issue.  Participation in sport is difficult in these times but Longford Rugby Club has asked that school-age teams and clubs be allowed to play matches while adhering to all Covid-19 safety guidelines in level 3.  That is a key request and it is only fair when both soccer and Gaelic games teams have been allowed to play at that level.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter.</p></speech>

It is great that we have reached this stage of what has been an amazing year.  Some of us have fought a general election and a Seanad election, we have endured a pandemic and have been locked up at home for long periods.  It has been a year that none of us will ever forget.  I wish to acknowledge the courtesy of the Cathaoirleach and thank the staff of Seanad &Eacute;ireann for their kindness over the past six to eight unusual months.  I also thank the Leader of the House and the Members who have helped me over the past few months.</p><p>The news that emerged last night in terms of the uncertainty regarding the catering trade is worrying.  I realise that we are very close to Christmas but, as many speakers have said, clarity <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>supply chains and so on is very important for traders and society at large.  I hope the Cabinet will convene sooner rather than later and make a decision on this because the longer the uncertainty persists, the more difficult the situation becomes.  Clarity is needed.  </p><p>I compliment the Leader on her statement earlier this week on the anti-vaccination campaign.  Public representatives should not proffer medical advice on who should or should not be vaccinated.  Some public representatives are using their platform to speak on behalf of the anti-vaccination campaign, which is not appropriate.  We have medical experts in this country who have the ability to dispense medical advice.  They should lead the vaccination campaign and public representatives should not comment on matters as if they are experts.  It is unfortunate that some are doing this for nothing other than political gain.  People's lives will be lost because of the anti-vaccination campaign being conducted by certain public representatives.  They are just doing it for their own benefit and it sickens me.  We need to stand strong, particularly given the good news around the roll-out of the vaccine.  Hopefully by the time this House sits again, the vaccination programme will be up and running and people will be getting the vaccine.  That is really positive news and something that we must continue to talk about.  I am no medical expert but I listen to the medical advice on the ground.  Every single expert I have spoken to has said that we should back the vaccination programme.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate on this matter after Christmas.  We need to call out the people who are saying that they will not get vaccinated because that cannot continue.  If it does continue, lives will be lost and that is something that nobody in this House can stand over.</p></speech>

This day last year was my last day in Leinster House as a member of staff, after seven years.  I finished to focus on the general election that I hoped would be called in the summer but it was called about two weeks later.  If it had not been called, we would have gone straight into Covid-19 and many of us would not be sitting here.  None of the new Senators would be here because the previous Government would still be in place.  It is funny how things work out.</p> <p>I wish to compliment my colleagues on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action and the chairperson, Deputy Brian Leddin.  This morning, the committee published its pre-legislative scrutiny report on the Climate Action Bill, which is landmark legislation.  It is so important that we are putting it through in the first 100 days of this Government.  We have started that process strongly and I hope that this report will inform all Oireachtas Members about the legislation.  It sets ambitious targets in terms of carbon budgets and strengthens oversight of climate policy by the Oireachtas.  The Bill seeks to change the role and composition of the climate strategy advisory committee and sets out strong national objectives up to 2050.  It is landmark legislation and I compliment all my colleagues on the committee and particularly my Seanad colleagues who have worked incredibly hard over the past ten weeks to get this report through.  We have been meeting every day and have heard really important expert witness testimony which fed into report.  This will undoubtedly benefit the legislation.  The vast majority of the report was put together without votes.  We only voted yesterday morning on certain issues where we could not reach agreement but the vast majority of it was put together through cross-party co-operation, give and take and trying to understand the needs of both Opposition and Government.  That type of collegial politics is lacking in these Houses sometimes.  We could do with a lot more of it but it was certainly evident in how the committee worked over the past ten weeks.</p></speech>

My heart sank when I heard what they had to say about the hospitality industry and what it has suffered because they are so right.  The news last night was yet another blow to the sector and I agree with what others have said on the need for clarity.  Clarity is important and I hope it will come in the next day or two.</p> <p>Senator Lombard spoke about the Covid-19 vaccine and those who are anti-vaccination.  This is so serious.  It is such a critical issue and, as public representatives, we must show leadership when it comes to articulating the benefits of the vaccine.  It will not be compulsory but I hope that more than 90% of those who are able to take the vaccine will do so.  Yesterday I wished everyone a happy Christmas and I reiterate that today.  I also want to wish a lady who works on the fourth floor well.  Lydia is finishing up today and is moving on to bigger and brighter things.  I wish her the very best.  I hope everybody has a safe and enjoyable Christmas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#F00600"><p>I will begin by wishing the Cathaoirleach a happy Christmas.  I thank him for his guidance during the year.  I also extend Christmas wishes and thanks to Mr. Martin Groves, Ms Brigid Doody and all the Seanad staff as well as to the Leader, whose constructive approach thus far must be acknowledged.</p> <p>I was struck by the comments of Senators Casey and Crowe and my heart genuinely goes out to them.  I cannot imagine how hard it is for the hospitality sector at the moment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I appeal to the Government to review this constantly and determine what more it can do for the hospitality sector at present.  That said, I believe there is probably no alternative but to go back into some kind of lockdown.  Considering the figures and what is happening across Europe, health has to come first.  That, however, does not make anything any easier for all the businesspeople who have struggled throughout this period so far.</p><p>I was really pleased that Senator Casey mentioned the staff in the Oireachtas, particularly the cleaning staff and other contractors.  I feel passionate about the idea that this Oireachtas should be a living-wage site.  It can be done.  My union, SIPTU, has pioneered the concept.  It means that every worker, regardless of whether they are employed directly by the Houses of the Oireachtas or here as contractors, gets a living wage.  There are a number of sites in Ireland that have already established this practice.  It would make a substantial difference to the people who do an amazing job in these buildings and who are paid very low sums of money.  It would make a substantial difference to them.  It would not be a huge drain on the Exchequer.  It would be very small.  When we come to work next year, would it not be wonderful if we knew the workers were getting at least a living wage and could earn a living?  I appeal to Members on a cross-party basis in this regard.  I have written to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and asked the Chair to consider my proposal actively so we can make a real difference for people.  It is not enough just to give applause to the essential front-line workers.  Maybe we could consider my proposal for next year.  I wish everyone well and a happy Christmas.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#G00300"><p>I have two points, one being on the matter of the new Standing Order, which I acknowledge is included on the Order Paper today.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for the initiative on bringing in outside constituencies in this way.  It concerns sexual harassment and bullying within the university sector but, most important, the use of non-disclosure agreements, NDAs, not only to move people around a university but also as tools to silence victims of abuse or bullying.  Over the past few years, many people from various universities have contacted me in this regard.  I will not elaborate on the issues raised now as we can tease them out in the new year.  Reference was made to certain staff members having several NDAs within one university, which just perpetuates a culture of silence and abuse.  I look forward to being able to debate this in the new year.  My office has legislation ready to go on the use of NDAs but I regard this as the very first port of call in being able to understand the severity of the culture of using NDAs in the university sector.</p><p>In the debate on deportations and the deportation moratorium a few weeks ago, we were assured there would be no more deportations during the pandemic.  This has not been the case.  Two days ago, a young many was brought to the airport and put on an plane to England, from where he was to continue to Sudan.  Another young man was taken from his accommodation last week and put in Cloverhill Prison until deportation.  I hope the Leader will speak to the Department of Justice and ascertain whether the message on deportations has been clear.  The Taoiseach and Minister for Justice have referred to the moratorium but maybe there is a lack of communication with the authorities who deport people.  If we are to say something in the House on deportations, we need to be really clear and strong in our stance, and we need to reassert the position that nobody will be deported during the global pandemic.</p></speech>

I wish him a very happy Christmas and a good 2021.  It is a pleasure to work with him in my role as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I wish our Leader and all my colleagues across the House a good Christmas.  There is tremendous commitment in this Seanad.  There is also great dedication and genuine ambition to do the right thing, be responsible and make a difference for people.  This is very palpable.  Maybe the privilege that the Cathaoirleach and I have is that we get to listen to debates in a way that allows us to absorb what is going on around the Chamber.  The more I am present for debates here, the more I am impressed by the commitment of Members, the way they go about their business, and the sincerity, depth and thoughtfulness of contributions from all sides of the Chamber.</p><p>I also wish a happy Christmas and a good 2021 to our administrative staff in the Seanad Office, led by Martin and Bridget, and all the other staff there.  We have an excellent administration.  Without that, we would not have the kind of House we have.</p><p>I have a general remark on what I believe is a theme of the morning.  I did not hear the contributions of Senators Casey and Crowe and can only imagine what they were saying.  I have an arm's-length connection with a small part of the hospitality business &mdash; a very small retail outlet.  Thank God, it is an arm's-length association because I know how bad circumstances are in the sector.  I empathise with those affected.</p><p>Given our privileged position as leaders in the community, we should use this Chamber at every opportunity to exhort people to be sensible over the Christmas and observe the rules on social distancing and the other rules on Covid.  It is very difficult.  It is a terrible strain.  I find I have to go back to the car for the mask, as we must all do at times.  What we must do is shocking and onerous but it should and must be done.  I exhort people to do it.</p><p>There is a bit of bad news coming and, as a Senator said, we need clarity on it.  The big news, however, is the vaccine.  The Leader, who is a former Minister, has considerable influence so she should ensure, when reporting from this House, that she conveys in any way she can our great desire to have a very efficient and quick roll-out of the vaccine to the front-line workers and elderly and then to those with special medical needs.  Those are the main points.  In the meantime, people should hold their discipline.</p><p>I feel privileged and honoured to have an office in this Chamber and to work with the Cathaoirleach in my role.  I do not take this lightly.  I genuinely admire and am occasionally in awe of the quality of personnel here and their input.  I am very sincere about this.  It is very clear.  The Cathaoirleach would echo these comments because he hears about the quality of the personnel also.</p><p>Cr&iacute;ochn&oacute;idh m&eacute; le c&uacute;pla focal as Gaeilge.

It is pleasure working with him.  I thank him for his kind words.</p><p>It has been an extraordinary year for the Leader, who, like all Senators, has done an extraordinary job under really difficult circumstances.  I congratulate Senator Bacik on her good news.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">An Cathaoirleach:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If times were different, we would organise a little reception to celebrate the good news.  Please God, we will be able to do so in the new year.  Other Senators, including Senator Boyhan, referred to Senator Flynn.  I do not know if they saw the extraordinary interview she did last night but we are truly privileged to have her in the House.  Her achievement would have been unimaginable a number of years ago but she has brought new ideas and new achievements to this Chamber.  </p><p>The UN human development index measures health, education and income.  In a world where there is very little good news, we have seen that Ireland is ranked joint second with Switzerland on that index, one place behind Norway and ahead of the likes of France and Germany, which is an extraordinary achievement.  When we joined the index more than 30 years ago, the average life expectancy was 74.  It is now 82.  The average number of years our people spent in education was then nine and is now 12.  That kind of achievement is only possible through the work of extraordinary people in this Chamber down through the years since Independence.  We are truly standing on the shoulders of giants in that regard.</p><p>Many have raised the issue of the front-line workers, whose service and sacrifices have meant that, while the pandemic has affected many, it has not been the disaster it has been in many other jurisdictions.  We acknowledge them for the service they have given so far.  When we are at Christmas dinner, they will be out working.  We also think of those who will have empty chairs this Christmas.  They are in our thoughts and prayers as well.</p><p>I thank all the ushers, the cleaners, the catering staff and everybody else who works in Leinster House.  I also thank Mr. Martin Groves and Ms Bridget Doody, who do extraordinary work late into the night to get all the amendments organised and issues resolved to ensure the Seanad works as smoothly as possible.  I thank Ms Carol Judge, Ms Carmel Considine, Ms Ilinca Popa, Mr Eden McLaughlin, Ms Aisling Hart and, of course, Ms Grace Coyle in my own office for their extraordinary work throughout the year.  It is quite extraordinary that such a small team runs such an important part of our legislative process.  I also thank Ms Orla Murray in the Leader's office, who also does extraordinary work.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the use of the Chamber.  Nothing says more about how historic this year has been than the Seanad sitting in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We thank the Ceann Comhairle for his generosity in that regard.</p><p>Finally, I wish all Members a safe Christmas.  I hope they get time to spend with their families and friends.  Please God, we will see them all in the new year.</p></speech>

In response to Senator Ruane, Senator Higgins contacted me over the weekend with regard to the gentleman about whom Senator Ruane spoke.  I did not contact the Minister for Justice, but the Taoiseach.  They are well aware of the circumstances.  We are all well aware of the commitments made by the Minister of Justice in this House and by the Taoiseach last week.  I will send that message again today.</p><p>Senator Boylan mentioned the commitment we made earlier this year in passing a motion in this House.  It is momentous.  It probably does not affect everybody, but the fact that schools in Northern Ireland yesterday received supplies of period products is a real step forward and a real sign of leadership.  I am aware that there is legislation in preparation.  Senator Seery Kearney is drafting legislation at the moment to ensure this matter is put on a legislative footing this year.  </p><p>Would it not be wonderful if this House could show leadership in that regard?  This brings me to the point Senator Gavan made.  We are the Houses of the Oireachtas and we have control over the leadership we give not only through legislation, but through our actions.  Would it not be wonderful if this House could provide period products as a sign of leadership which might instruct all of our Departments to do the same thing for all of their staff?  I was going to say my next point was more important but perhaps it is just on a different level.  It would be an absolutely wonderful sign of leadership to be able to declare this site a living-wage site.  This is something the Senator should definitely pursue.  I will support him in the new year in that regard.</p><p>This has been a hell of a year.  Life is not meant to be easy; it is meant to be lived.  There are happy times and rough times.  We all know them.  With every up and down, we learn something.  We learn lessons which, I hope, make us stronger.  We have certainly learned an awful lot this year, if not about ourselves, certainly about one another and about all that is good in this country.  That stems from our people.  This year, leadership has been shown from the ground up by our volunteers, organisations such as sporting groups, industry and every other section of society.  Indeed, all of our politicians have shown leadership this year.  It was certainly a time for Government to be generous and to support people through an unprecedented time.  I know we use the word &quot;unprecedented&quot; too often but I certainly hope it is a word we will have to use less when we see the light at the end of the tunnel next year.</p><p>I did not see the programme the Cathaoirleach mentioned last night but Senator Boylan brought it to my attention.  I have, however, witnessed over recent months some of the most thoughtful contributions ever made here being made by our new Senator, Eileen Flynn.  She is a wonderful example of the ordinary people in this country who can do extraordinary things.  I wish her every success in the future.  She perfectly proves the point that one cannot be what one cannot see.  This can only happen with our co-operation because she comes from a minority section of our society that does not have the votes on the panels that would allow her, and others like her, to be successfully elected.  We all need to be aware that sections of our society do not have the same voice as some other sections.  She is a wonderful advocate for that community.  One can be sure that, having seen her, people will want to be like her in the future.  </p><p>She is not unique.  We have a lady mayor from a minority community and the President of the European Commission is a lady.  Very shortly, we will have the first lady Vice President of the US.  The gentlemen present are on notice; we are here and we are here to stay.  I only hope we can continue to receive their support to ensure equality of opportunity for every woman, regardless of her background, ethnicity or love life.  It does not matter; we just want equality of opportunity.  I know that they will know, because we know, that society will be better and that decisions will be better made if we have that equality of opportunity.</p><p>Politics is always about the personal and there was nothing more personal than the contributions made by Senators Casey and Crowe and others in support of the hospitality industry.  It has gone through the absolute mire.  I know everybody else has as well and that we can all advocate for particular industries, for sport or for dancing.  We do that.  That is our job and we do it with passion.  The passion Senator Casey has shown not only this morning, but over recent weeks, in speaking on the impact and effects of the decisions being made - although they are being made for the right reasons - are having on his family and countless other families in the hospitality industry cannot be understated.  I will absolutely will send the clear message back today that hanging around and waiting until next week is not acceptable.  This delay might be to allow more informed decisions to be made but there was a gentleman on the radio this morning who said that he had a six-figure sum worth of stock coming in.  Another gentleman said he had &euro;30,000 worth of food coming in this weekend.  The absolute least that can be done is to give certainty as to what is going to happen for the next week or two.  I assure the Senator that I will send that message to the Taoiseach's office as soon as I am finished here today.</p><p>By the same token, we have all worked incredibly hard this year.  The Cathaoirleach himself has touched on the more than 3,000 families that will have somebody missing from their lives and from their Christmas tables.  We will be able to sit around our Christmas tables with our families and, it is to be hoped, enjoy ourselves, although it will be in different circumstances.  Every decision being made, however, is being made in the best interests of our people.  These decisions are not perfect because we are not perfect.  They are being made by human beings and we hope they will give us a better chance at a good outcome.  We can sometimes be a little bit severe in our criticisms of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, so I would like to thank its members sincerely, I hope on behalf of us all, for the endless hours of work they have put in since the beginning of this year.<b></b>That is well deserved.  Dr. Holohan was announced as man of the year yesterday.  He has certainly given far more than is expected of a public servant.  Many of our other public servants have done the same behind the scenes.  I will write to NPHET today on all of our behalf to thank its members for their public service over the last ten or 12 months.  They really have been exemplary.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> That brings me to the public servants in this House - Martin, Bridget, their staff and all our staff, including Orla and Grace, and all the staff in the wider House.  I have had the privilege of working in Leinster House for a number of years.  I used to think when I was first elected to the Oireachtas that our ushers were hand picked because they were so special, kind, caring and generous.  It was not just one or two of them but all of them, which is why I used to think there must be a special recruitment process for ushers in the Houses because they do an incredible job with such good spirit and such warmth towards us.  I can attest to that.  I thank them so much for everything they do and for all the care they give us.</p><p>Equally, I thank all the catering staff.  I think we probably know more about the lives of the people who work in the bars, canteens and the coffee dock, and they about ours, than we do of those of our friends.  They are wonderful people.  The high spirits they have been during an incredibly difficult year have put a smile on my face on many a day, so I thank them and wish them well.  Our cleaners, too, are some of the happiest people.  As was noted, in most cases they are probably members of our new Irish community.  They come to the House and they are quiet and unassuming.  Sometimes when I say hello to them, I almost think they are surprised that someone is talking to them.  Every one of us should talk to them, know their names and make a point of thanking them for what they do, which is keep us safe in an unassuming and understated way.  All the officials and public servants in the House do an incredible job of making us look good when we are doing our jobs and I pay tribute to them all.</p><p>I started this year in one role and am so privileged, lucky and blessed to be in the role I am in today.  This House is full of thoughtful, co-operative and collegiate people.  Unfortunately, that probably could not be said about the other House, which is far much more adversarial.  We have an opportunity, because of a regard for one another and mostly because of the issues we bring to the House, to make a real and substantial difference.  I thank Senators for giving me the honour of being in this role and for the co-operation and good wishes I have received over recent months.  We had a few niggles at the beginning of my tenure because I did not really know what I was doing, so I apologise for that, but I thank them for their co-operation.  It is the honour of my political career to date to be here and I will continue to serve the House next year, please God.</p><p>I wish all Senators a happy and safe Christmas.  As Senator Hoey noted yesterday, and I could not have put it better myself, we need to keep Christmas small and safe because we need to get through this.  We need to ensure that there are as few possible fatalities between now and that wonderful light at the end of the tunnel that will, hopefully, come on 27 December.  With that light, however, comes the responsibility of our actions, which lies on all our shoulders.</p><p>I issued a press release at the beginning of the week because I was astounded at the level of ignorance of some public representatives in refusing to take the vaccine and at their explanations and reasons for that stance.  I fully understand fear, and many people in Ireland will be nervous and anxious, but it is our job to ensure we allay those fears, not feed into them or into the propaganda that has resulted in measles being a problem in this country again when we had all but eradicated it because we gave our children measles vaccines over the years.</p><p>It is outrageous that leaders in this country would feed into conspiracy theorists and give rise to allowing those people to have those fears and concerns and to think their fears and concerns are warranted.  They are not warranted and every one of us has a job and responsibility to ensure that we act responsibly.  I fully commit to getting the vaccine whenever I am in the queue.  It is important that each of us says that to our constituents, voters, friends, neighbours and anybody who will listen.  It is probably the most important message we can put across in the coming months.</p><p>There will be hiccups and arguments that the conspiracy theorists will be able to hang their hat on.  We need to stand steadfast, however, and ensure that we are strong and that we know what we want, which is to get through this pandemic and to get people vaccinated in order that we can get back to talking about health, housing, the living wage, unemployment and all the matters we so passionately care about fixing in this country.</p><p>I cannot speak Irish.  It is one of my major failings, although perhaps I will get around to it when I retire, when it will be too late.  Nevertheless, I wish Senators and their families and friends a safe and very happy Christmas.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.60" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#L00400"><p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senators for having me here today.</p> <p>The Appropriation Bill 2020 is an essential element of financial housekeeping that must be concluded by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of this year.  The Bill serves two primary purposes.  First, the Appropriation Bill is necessary to authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2020 on the basis of the Estimates that have been voted on by the D&aacute;il during the year.  Section 1 and Schedule 1 set out the amounts to be appropriated for supply services.  These relate to the amounts included in the Revised Estimates for 2020 voted by the D&aacute;il earlier this year, and the Supplementary Estimates voted by the D&aacute;il earlier this month.  In aggregate, these Estimates amount to nearly &euro;69.7 billion.  Undoubtedly, this is a significant investment and reflects, when including expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund and the national training fund, approximately &euro;16.75 billion in additional Covid-19 related expenditure supports provided this year.  Without an investment on this scale, the Government would not have been in a position to introduce a series of critically important expenditure measures that were required to support our economy, enterprises and households from the unprecedented shock of Covid-19, and to provide the necessary funding to our health service to respond to the pandemic.</p> <p>A further key purpose of the Appropriation Bill 2020 is to provide a legal basis for spending to continue into 2021.  The passage of the Appropriation Bill allows, in the period before the 2021 Estimates are approved, continued funding of social welfare payments from the social protection Vote, Exchequer pay and pensions and other voted expenditure.  If the Bill was not enacted before the end of December there would be no authority to spend any voted moneys in 2021 from the start of January until approval of the 2021 Estimates, since this authority for 2021, as contained in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965,  is based on the amounts provided for in the Appropriation Act 2020.</p> <p>Under the rolling multiannual capital envelopes introduced in budget 2004, Departments may carry over, from the current year to the following year, unspent capital up to a maximum of 10% of voted capital.  The multiannual system is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management by Departments and agencies of capital programmes and projects.  It recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning and profiling of capital expenditure and acknowledges that capital projects may be subject to delays.  The carryover facility allows for a portion of unspent moneys, which would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned under the annual system of allocating capital, to be made available for spending on programme priorities in the subsequent year.</p> <p>The Appropriation Act determines definitively the capital amounts that may be carried over to the following year.  The aggregate amount of proposed capital carryover from 2020 into 2021 is &euro;748.5 million, which represents 7.5% of the total Exchequer capital programme of more than &euro;9.8 billion for 2020.  This figure is considerably higher than last year's carryover figure of &euro;215.4 million, which amounted to 2.9% of the 2019 capital allocation.  This increase reflects both the increase in the core capital allocation from 2019 to 2020 of approximately &euro;1 billion, as well as the impact of Covid-19, both in terms of additional capital allocations to certain Departments and delays to other capital projects as a result of public health measures and restrictions.</p> <p>The proposed amounts to be carried over by Vote are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  The 2021 Revised Estimates Volume sets out detailed financial and key performance information for Departments and offices.  Part III of the Estimates includes, for each Vote availing of the capital carryover facility, a table listing the amounts to be deferred by subhead.  In line with last year, section 3 of the Appropriation Bill includes a specific provision to allow for an advance from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account, with this advance then being repaid to the Central Fund in January.  The amount included this year is up to &euro;280 million.  The need for this provision arises as certain Exchequer liabilities and social welfare payments are due for payment by electronic funds transfer on 1 January and 4 January 2021.  With the banking system closed on 1 January, funding will need to be in place in departmental bank accounts before the end of this year to meet those liabilities on a timely basis.  In addition, An Post needs to be pre-funded before the end of 2020 in order to physically transfer cash to its network of post offices throughout the State.</p> <p>These Exchequer pay, pension and social welfare payments form part of the supply services for 2021, and these costs will come under moneys voted in 2021 in respect of which the usual processes and mechanisms for voted moneys will apply.  The signed Act is required by the Comptroller and Auditor General for clearance of the end-year issues from the Exchequer.  Under Article 25.2.1o of the Constitution the President may not sign a Bill earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill is presented to him.  However, there is provision in Article 25.2.2o of the Constitution whereby, at the request of the Government and with the prior concurrence of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the President may sign a Bill on a date earlier than the fifth day mentioned.  In view of the urgency of this Bill, the provision in Article 25.2.2o is sought, and a motion to this effect is placed before the Seanad.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Such an earlier signature motion has also been sought in relation to the Appropriation Bill in previous years.</p><p>The Appropriation Bill is an essential element of housekeeping which those of us in both Houses of the Oireachtas are required to undertake.

The passage of the Bill, which is of fundamental importance to those who depend on our essential public services, will also ensure that payments funded from voted expenditure in 2020 can continue to be funded in 2021 in the period before the D&aacute;il approves the 2021 Estimates.

I do not think anyone has a problem with it.  It has been an exceptional year with levels of expenditure that we have probably never seen before, and which we will hopefully never need to see again, around Covid-19.</p> <p>Following the news last night about hospitality, I take this opportunity to ask for certainty about what is happening in the coming week or ten days.  We just need that.  I spoke earlier on the Order of Business about the effect it is having on the families who are engaged in the sector.  I spoke to my brother this morning.  He said we would be better off being told that we will be closed until March or April because the in-out, open-closed, half-closed, half-open, half-partially open approach is playing havoc with everyone involved.  I appreciate the level of supports that have been given to us so far to keep us alive and so that we can open.  It was difficult to get staff to come back to work for what was going to be a period of 20 or 30 days, but we found out last night that it could be curtailed to a ten-day period.  It is worrying.  I ask the Minister of State to take back to the Government a message that it should make a clear decision for us and give us plenty of notice.  The uncertainty is very difficult and emotionally draining for the families in business and all the staff, whom we coaxed to come back to work for 20 days and now we are going to have to tell them it is for just ten days.  </p> <p>I fully support the Bill, which was needed.  The supports were put there.</p></speech>

It is the signal for the end of the legislative term and the fiscal year.  It covers the spend on all Departments and State agencies for the next year from the offices of the President and the Taoiseach to our newest Department, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  I also acknowledge the Department of Community and Rural Development, where I had the privilege to serve with the former Minister, Deputy Ring, and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We should never be afraid to establish new Departments to cover very important areas.  They give a focus.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, covers two Departments - the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Rural and Community Development.  It is important to recognise that.  Key supports for health, business and social welfare play an important role every year, but they were very much in focus this year because of the pandemic.  The Department of Health has been on the front line protecting our health.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has provided so much support to people and businesses over the last year to maintain the key link between businesses and workers.  Obviously, the Department of Social Protection has administered the pandemic unemployment payment, the temporary wage subsidy scheme and all the supports that were enacted over the last year.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is responsible for rates, which are so important for businesses in what has been a very challenging year.  No one could have imagined that 2020 would end up like this.  This time last year, we were looking forward to growth in the economy.  We had full employment and balanced books.  The challenges of Covid have changed all that.  The supports put in place by the Government are accounted for in this Bill for the year ahead.</p> <p>The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is important.  As a Senator who is elected by councillors, as well as Members of the Oireachtas, I will focus on local authorities.  My county of Galway has had difficulties with the funding model in place for 20 years over successive Governments.  I do not think the model is fair for a county of its size which has numerous challenges, including offshore islands, a long coastline and a large geographical area.  It receives proportionately less money per head than many neighbouring counties.  It does not have the same rates base as some neighbouring counties because the city of Galway is a separate local authority.  This presents challenges.  The Department wanted to amalgamate, which I support, but a decision was made not to proceed.  As a result, Galway county is still left behind.  We are told that the Department will wait for the review of the local property tax to look at the whole funding model.  The officials were not fully sure how the original funding model came up.  A mix of 600 different criteria for each county was used in the formula which decided how counties would be funded.  The officials were not sure precisely how this was arrived at.  The historical bias is still there and is particularly prevalent in Galway County Council's funding.  It has knock-on effects in the delivery of services and the annual debate over whether rates are increased and so on.  No one wants to do that but it can be necessary.</p> <p>I acknowledge the very important work done by the Minister of State with responsibility for local government, Deputy Peter Burke, on councillors' pay.  He has presented proposals on their pay and conditions which are with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Councillors do very important work for everyone and deserve to be better recognised than the present system where their pay and conditions have not changed since 2004.  I hope the Minister of State brings that back to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, as an issue that needs to be dealt with very soon.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to give statutory authority for the amounts voted by the D&aacute;il during the year as required by the Constitution.  The Appropriation Bill must be enacted by the Oireachtas in December.  Otherwise, there will be no authority to spend any voted moneys from the start of 2021.  The amount of &euro;69.7 billion in respect of net voted expenditure in the Bill includes the original Estimate, Further Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates presented to the D&aacute;il.  The final Supplementary Estimates were voted by the D&aacute;il on 9 December.</p> <p>I will not spend too much time speaking on this Bill because we all agree it has to be passed today, but I wish to raise one issue which the Minister of State should bring back.  It relates to the tax reliefs that are contained in the current rules.  Social Justice Ireland published an interesting piece which showed in 2016, 10% of our total tax revenue was made up of tax reliefs.  Taking the figure of &euro;70 billion for this year, if the 10% holds true, and it probably does, that is approximately &euro;7 billion in tax reliefs.  I find it shocking that there is never any information on the budgetary process about the costs of tax relief by time for each past year.  They are not published.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Neither is the estimated cost of tax reliefs for the year ahead.  This is an important issue.  We all know of tax reliefs that are unfair, in that they benefit the very well-off.  I could point to pensions.  Middle-income earners benefit from tax reliefs in this regard, but higher earners benefit disproportionately more.  There were changes to the real estate investment fund, REIF, system in respect of real estate investment trusts, REITs, in 2019 because the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, stated that there was aggressive behaviour to avoid tax among Irish real estate funds.  Those changes were welcome.  Afterwards, however, <i>The Irish Times</i>wrote that well-paid accountants and advisers were already working on finding the next tax ploy.  We all know that these things are happening.<br/><br/>These reliefs are fundamentally regressive in nature.  Even Departments have acknowledged that.  They lead to those at the bottom subsidising the investments and savings of those at the top.  This issue requires much more analysis from the Government.  We are in a state where the super rich get tax breaks all the time while those on the minimum wage see a 10 cent per hour pay rise, student nurses work for free and workers across the State have no statutory right to sick pay.  This is such a gross injustice.  Bearing in mind the &euro;7 billion in tax reliefs, it should not take a great deal of radical Government thinking to ensure a greater degree of equity.  Loopholes and well-paid accountants are not available to low-paid workers.  We need to rethink our economy and build the tax system around the basic principle of fairness that benefits those with the least through those who can pay most.  The PAYE system is progressive, but the surrounding tax architecture is anything but.<br/><br/>That is all I have to say.  We will support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1637" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#N00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his elevation.  I will begin on a discordant note, although the responsible Minister is not present.  I wish to raise two issues.  We all support the Appropriation Bill, which is an important parliamentary fixture, as Senator Kyne stated.  It is normally taken on the last sitting day of the legislative calendar and gives the Government the approval to spend and embark upon the Estimates process in Departments.  Every Department is listed in the Schedule.  We are spending &euro;70 billion or thereabouts.  Senator Gavan, whom I disagree with, raised issues about tax reliefs and so on.  We set up the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which is something about which we agree.  However, it is important to consider how we can debate these measures without shoehorning that debate into the last day.  I do not blame the Minister of State, but if we are serious about parliamentary reform, this is an area where we as parliamentarians can play a role, not just in scrutinising, but in debating.  On the Order of Business, Senator Kyne, Senator Casey and others spoke about the hospitality sector, supports for local government and so on.  That is why this is important.</p> <p>It is regrettable that the Bill does not make any mention of councillors' pay and conditions.  We are allocating moneys, and rightly so, to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, the Departments and all sectors in terms of salaries, expenses and "retired pay, pensions, compensation, allowances and gratuities payable".  However, no decision has been made by the Government on councillors' pay and conditions.  We have had the Moorhead report under the former Minister of State, Deputy Phelan.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has sent a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is time that the Government made up its mind.  If it is for local government and our councillors, that means paying them properly, fairly and justly irrespective of who they are and their political ideologies.  They work hard and deserve to be treated fairly.  Money has rightly been given back to people as part of the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation, but for some reason it seems that there is obfuscation and procrastination on this matter by the Government, in particular the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ask the Department to sign the statutory instrument and pay the public representatives of our country at local authority level a just and fair level of remuneration for their work.  That is what we have to do.  This has to stop.  It is codology of the highest order that we are on the last sitting day of the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2020 yet there has been no Government decision on councillors' pay and conditions.  I appeal to the Minister of State as a former local authority member to continue representing and advocating for these people who do a great amount of work that we can see every day.</p> <p>Almost &euro;70 billion in Government spending is an extraordinary amount and deserves to be discussed in more than just one shoehorned debate.  In the context of next year's financial outlook, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, stated that he could not rule out some tax increases.  I call for a debate rather than kite flying in the Houses.  Critically, the ordinary citizen cannot pay much more.  As Senator Casey eloquently stated on the Order of Business, there are hard-pressed people in the hospitality sector who have lost businesses and jobs and who have no incomes other than the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  They are facing into an uncertain 2021.  The Minister of State knows well where I am coming from in this regard.  As a Government, let us not fly kites in public about tax increases.  People are justifiably concerned and they deserve better than Ministers saying that we might have to increase taxes.  They cannot take much more.</p></speech>

For example, I agree with his point that the sheer scale of the budget merits further discussion and longer sessions.  I join the Senator in congratulating the Minister of State on his appointment and, in the context of what I am about to say next, I recognise the Minister of State's background in local government.</p> <p>It is a disgrace that, in the weeks before Christmas, the Government did not announce an increase in councillors' pay.  It was a ludicrous form of cowardice and was wrong on many levels.  For years, councillors have been in a difficult situation.  I know a number for whom carrying on is proving difficult.  Doing much of their other work is not possible and other opportunities to earn are displaced.  The job of a councillor, including being out and about physically, requires a great deal of expenditure, but the remuneration they get is far below that level.  The Moorhead report was an objective study led by a legal individual.  It established in objective terms that there was a strong case for councillors to get their pay.  On foot of that study, the Minister of State sent a memo that was negotiated with all of the councillors' interest groups and would give councillors the dignity of a certain level of income.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would not put them in a great position but it would put them in a position that they could do their job.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, did that with great efficiency and sent it up the line.  It should be implemented.  Senator Buttimer referred to the input of the former Minister, Deputy John Paul Phelan, in this matter, which merits acknowledgment.</p><p>There is an injustice.  As the Minister of State will know from his own background in local government, there is now a whole proliferation of meetings which did not exist when I entered local government.  There are municipal areas with meetings after meetings.  Councillors have to respond to the public, interest groups, attend public meetings and travel away from home.  It is a difficult situation to be in.  I could cite individual cases of councillors who are in difficult positions because of this but it would not be appropriate for me to do so.  The Moorhead report established that in proper objective terms, stating there is a gaping need in this area.  This matter needs prompt action.  It is a disgrace.  Councillors should have assurance of this issue before Christmas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#O00200"><p>I thank Senators for their comments and for supporting the Bill.  I also thank Senators on all sides for the acknowledgement of the great expenditure that went into protecting people and businesses this year.  The pandemic unemployment payment was a significant innovation and rapidly delivered by the Department of Social Protection.  Impressively, most people got this payment online.  For businesses, there was the tax relief at source, the employment wage subsidy scheme and the Covid restrictions support scheme.  There were full rebates of rates for the year, along with restart grants and trading online vouchers.</p> <p>Even with all of that, however, it has still been difficult for people in the hospitality sector.  It is incredibly difficult for somebody to have a business reopen and then shut down again, to be given hope and then have it dashed.  Some pubs in Dublin which never served food have never reopened because they did not have a chance all year long.  That has been incredibly difficult for those people, no matter how much support they were given.  The frequency with which they have been opened and shut down has created anxiety.  I will bring those sentiments to the attention of Ministers.</p> <p>The Cabinet will be meeting throughout the Christmas break and over the new year as we are still in a critical period.  The vaccine roll-out project, one of the most important projects in the history of the State, is taking place and will have to be got right.  Dealing with daily data which shows how the disease is spreading must also be responded to by the Government.  All the way through Christmas, the Cabinet will be working on that.</p> <p>I have been working on the base funding of local authorities - Galway was mentioned - and it is being reviewed.  I take the point that it has always been discussed in the context of local property tax but it can be considered separately as well.  Whatever is done, it would be difficult to produce a funding model that satisfies everybody and that every local authority feels it has been fairly treated.  It is a challenge and it is not a simple thing to do.  It is difficult to divine what the logic was at the start.  I am working on that and I know there have been detailed proposals as to how it could be reworked.  If the Senator wants to come to my office, I am happy to engage on that.</p> <p>Our programme for Government includes a commitment to the full implementation of the Moorhead report which involves a dramatic difference in the way councillors are paid.  All major public expenditure decisions that involve pay always come back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because they involve multi-year commitments, not just something within one year's budget.  They have to be approved.  I am happy to find out what stage that is at and report back to the Seanad.  Many Members are concerned about the pay and conditions of councillors.  We know the endpoint is the full implementation of the Moorhead report.</p> <p>I was a councillor for a number of years and served as cathaoirleach of my local council.  I have first-hand experience of the difficulties and the challenges councillors have nowadays, particularly this year when they cannot even meet easily.  One function of a local authority is that it is the agency designated for emergencies.  During severe weather emergencies, it is the local authority which grits the streets for example.  It is the local authorities which stood up during the pandemic to provide emergency services to older people, to bring food to their homes and to organise volunteer groups.  I am grateful to them for all of that, particularly the chief executive of my own council.  I am still in contact with my local authority.  I was meant to meet its chief executive, Philomena Poole, who is very competent, this morning but I am here.  I will report to the House as how we are getting on with the Moorhead report.</p> <p>Tax reliefs were mentioned by Senator Gavan.  My Department is keen to eliminate as many tax reliefs as possible.  They are expensive and grow like weeds.  They are sometimes introduced to facilitate legislative or strategic change.  A decade ago, there was a major pruning back of tax reliefs.  If there are any which the Senator would like to see abolished, he should feel free to ask me and we would be very happy to consider them.</p> <p>It is our policy to bring in a statutory right to sick pay.  Ireland is one of the developed countries which does not have such a statutory right.  At the start of the pandemic, it was brought into focus that many people did not have a right to sick pay.  It is dangerous for the population if those on low wages are obliged to go to work at a time when disease is spreading.  That is why the rules were changed to allow for people to claim pay on an accelerated basis where they felt they had symptoms of corona virus.  We need to extend that into a general statutory right for sick pay for all workers.  That is something we are working on.</p></speech>

Schedule 1 at Vote 34 refers to the allocation of moneys to the office of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, &quot;including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, water services, miscellaneous schemes, subsidies,grants and payment of certain grants under cash-limited schemes&quot;, while Vote 35 refers to retired pay, pensions and compensation.  Political courage is needed here, as is a sense of reality <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the pay and conditions of councillors.  I am not going to labour the point but assure the House that this is not about us as parliamentarians reaching out to the people who elect us but about respect.  This is about recognising the role of local authority members and ensuring that people will continue to come into politics who will not be beholden to anyone else.  My greatest concern is that we are making politics at all levels the preserve of the few.  We should not do that.  </p><p>Ireland is very different from other countries in terms of the amount spent on elections.  The amount spent in America, for example, on state, House of Representative and Senate elections as well as presidential elections is absolutely absurd.  In terms of raising money to run for election, we have very strict limits on political donations in this country, which I fully support, and I hope we never deviate from that.  In the old days, we had what was called &quot;walking around money&quot; in the context of local government and we all saw what happened at various tribunals of inquiry.  We can never go back to those days.  I do not know anybody in this House who wants to see politics demeaned.  Nobody wants to see anyone other than voters - the citizens to whom representatives are accountable -  having an influence over elected members.  That is why it is important to take the bold but correct decision to improve the pay and conditions of councillors.  The can has been kicked down the road and the buck has been passed repeatedly.  The issue is with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at this point.  To be fair to the Minister of State, he has to work within certain parameters.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who has been in politics for a long time, both as a local authority member and as a Member of these Houses, should just sign the order to pay our councillors properly.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach made reference earlier to the Moorhead report but that report did not get everything right and we should not pretend that it did.  I appeal to the Minister of State to use the funding available.</p><p>I also appeal to him, as a member of the Green Party, to ensure that the lower Lee flood relief scheme in Cork is built.  As can be seen from the Schedule, new Departments have been created and I welcome that.  Today Mr. Barry O'Connor retires as president of Cork Institute of Technology, CIT.  I mention this in the context of the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and thank Mr. O'Connor for his leadership at CIT and for the way in which steered the amalgamation of CIT with the Institute of Technology Tralee, ITT, to form the Munster Technological University, MTU.  </p><p>The aforementioned flood relief scheme must start.  The Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy O'Donovan, was in Cork a couple of weeks ago following a serious flooding event.  This week we had an orange weather warning in Cork, with more flooding forecast but thanks to the grace of God, the wind changed direction and the city was not flooded again.  It is time for the talking to end.  We have had a gargantuan consultative process and we must now ensure that the money that has been allocated is not lost.  The former Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Moran, said previously that the money could go elsewhere but I do not want to see that happening in Cork.  The lower Lee flood relief scheme is being held up by a very well-intentioned group, whose motivation is not in question but the project has been seriously delayed and businesses have closed as a result.  Business owners are in constant dread and families living in the inner city are worried and fearful.  </p><p>I appeal to the Minister of State to raise the aforementioned issues with the Minister.  We are missing an opportunity here, especially as we are dealing with a Bill that speaks to salaries, expenses and administration costs as well as referring to local government.  I thank him for his attention.</p></speech>

I agree that the time for talking is over.  A decision must be made and it should be made sooner rather than later.  This has been a protracted process.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has been mentioned twice during this debate but he has only held that brief for the last six months.  Previous speakers should remember that their party held that brief for a considerable number of years previously and no decision was made.  I sat on the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government in the previous D&aacute;il, which found it impossible to get access to the Moorhead report.  Fianna F&aacute;il actually had to include the report in the programme for Government to be able see it.  I would not have said anything today except for the fact that a colleague of mine was mentioned and it was implied that he has sole responsibility.  I just want to remind those Senators that their party has been in government for the past nine years and could have dealt with this issue.  We all agree that councillors need to be respected for the work they do and the role they play in their communities.  Everybody has accepted the principle but the decision has not been made.  A debate was had in public at the previous committee meeting before the dissolution of the previous D&aacute;il.  The media ran with it so I do not know what we are waiting for at this stage.  We just need to get on with it but I am not overly happy with how it has been portrayed here.  Senators have suggested is that it is a decision for the Minister and have asked why he has not made it yet but the same Senators were in government for the past nine years and did not address the issue.</p></speech>

I also concur with Senator Casey's point that many people think councillors have already received pay increases because they have been announced a number of times.  A number of councillors have told me that people have said to them that councillors have received X amount over the recent period when they have not.  It is time to make a decision on this very important issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Councillors' pay is pretty much what it was when I entered a local authority in 2004 so it needs to be addressed.  Successive Governments have been afraid to do anything that benefits politicians because politicians are almost regarded as bad people now.  There seems to be a view that one could not possibly do anything for them, even though they have difficult jobs and do difficult work across the Houses of the Oireachtas and in local authorities.  This view is regrettable because elected public representatives and other public servants have noble professions that we need to encourage people to embrace.  If we did not have democracy, people who guard democracy and people who run for election, where would we be?</p><p>We have heard about many working from home during the pandemic.  They have been doing so out of necessity but there has been a move across all Departments and agencies to encourage working from home anyway.  Has there been any feedback from Departments on how it has worked?  Obviously, it has benefited many people.  What is the view of assistant secretaries and Secretaries General of Departments?  Do they regard working from home as positive or are there drawbacks and limitations?  It is worth having a review in each Department to determine whether it could be promoted.  We are aware of its benefits in terms of reducing commuting times, the carbon footprint and pressure on roads and public transport, where it is available.  I do not like asking whether working from home has improved efficiency but is it at least comparable with working in Departments or State agencies in normal times?</p></speech>

First, I concur with what everyone has said on several occasions in this Chamber over several years about councillors' pay.  I am genuinely puzzled because, in my na&iuml;vet&eacute;, I had assumed this problem would have been dealt with by now.  I suppose I have an interest in the Sinn F&eacute;in councillors, in particular, because most of them tend to be full-time councillors.  The problem we have is that it is almost impossible to live on the salary of a full-time councillor.  It is part of the ethos that runs through our party, however.</p> <p>In the five years I have been here, Senators from all sides have spoken about the need to address this matter.  I take Senator Kyne's point that there may be reluctance to do anything for politicians but I would counter that by saying that we all agree on what is required.  There is no one in opposition saying the councillors should not be given the money.</p> <p>I take Senator Casey's point, that is, that this really should have been dealt with in the nine years in which Fine Gael was in government.  It had ample opportunity to do something about it.  It is inexcusable that nothing was done; let us be clear about that.  The damage that was done to local governments by the Fine Gael&ndash;Labour Party Government was appalling.  I refer to how it took apart many of our local government structures, town councils and so on.  However, I do not want to revisit old history, particularly today, other than to make the point that I am genuinely surprised this was not dealt with in the expenditure items for this year.  I would like to understand when it will be dealt with.  Surely to God we will not have to have this conversation again in 12 months, or even six months.  Surely this has to be dealt with sooner.  Senator Kyne is correct that the public is under the impression that councillors have received pay increases although no such increases have been made.</p> <p>My colleague Senator Craughwell has rightly been making the point about the special class K contributions that Senators make.  I meant to raise this the other day but I did not get the opportunity.  The contribution is absolutely useless to us.  This really needs to be addressed as part of an overall review of finance.  Solutions have been suggested.  Senator Craughwell has been championing this particular issue in the House, again for five years or more.  I really hope we will not still be talking about it in 12 months.  The whole Chamber agreed something needs to be done because what is occurring is fundamentally unfair.  Colleagues from all parties lost their seats in the last Seanad election and find they have no support from social welfare.</p> <p>I have to raise the Coonagh Cross&ndash;Knockalisheen road project in Limerick and the fact that it has had 15 start dates postponed since 2012.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has admitted he is delaying the project for a further review.  The project is crucial to the infrastructure of the north side of Limerick.  It is a working-class area.  The project is crucial to opening up Moyross, in particular.  The good people of Moyross have waited for years.  They have been disappointed by Government after Government and are at their wits' end.  I appeal to the Minister of State to speak to his colleague, the Minister for Transport, because the project must not be delayed continuously.  It is an essential part of the Limerick city infrastructure.  It is essential to open up the north side, which is the most deprived side of our city.  Action and an urgent start are required.</p></speech>

Normally I would not try to curtail Senators' time but I am doing so now only for one reason and with a view to being helpful to colleagues.  This motion has to be concluded at 12.45 p.m.   There is just less than ten minutes left.  I will call colleagues according the order in which they offered to speak.

All Members of the Seanad bring their own experiences and they are all very helpful in offering their opinions and making suggestions on supporting local county councillors.  I would like to believe my own journey can add some value to the debate because I may have the near-unique distinction of having served in two county councils in two provinces.  Therefore, I am aware of what county councillors do at the front line.  I am aware of meetings that take place after midnight, when the pizzas come in and when councillors have not got a chance to put their children to bed.  I am aware that county councillors comprise the lifeblood and nerve centre of our democratic system.  It is only right that they be recognised not with empty lip service but with concrete action.  The Minister of State, having served as a councillor with distinction in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, has, like most of us, come through the school of privilege, hard knocks and excitement himself so he knows at first hand what I am talking about.</p> <p>Nine years is a long time to wait for progress on this.  The Green Party is now in government.  I will expect words to be translated into action.  Nothing else will be accepted.  I acknowledge that I have the support of the Minister of State in this regard.  We will be judged by our actions.  I will not go down the road of populism and ducking for cover.  Our county councillors deserve a salary rise &mdash; end of story.  We are losing county councillors who got elected in good faith because they simply cannot continue in their privileged role as servants of the people due to the financial constraints.  That is not good enough.  We are also failing to attract people to this vital tier of democracy because they cannot make it work financially.</p> <p>Why is there an anomaly in the system whereby county councillors have to pay rates on their offices, unlike MEPs or Deputies?  A county councillor who is working really hard and wants a constituency office is treated differently from democratically elected people at other levels.  Why do the county councillors not get leave from their workplaces?  Some nearly have to beg their employers to go to a plenary session of the county council. </p> <p>The Government will be judged on actions, not words.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P.

This is straightforward.  I was a councillor for 11 years.  The reality is that we are losing young and ambitious people from local government because they just cannot give the commitment that is required.  This is causing untold difficulties.  I believe every Member has great respect for local authority members and the work they do, which we know at first hand.  The majority of Members have been members of local authorities.  Councillors must be respected.  The reality is that the present terms and conditions are a farce.  I am fully aware that this is the case on the ground.  It is unacceptable.

I brought this issue up on Inchydoney Island in 2015.  I said that no government was going to increase the pay of councillors and, to date, I have been proven correct.  How does any government or political party dare to treat these people in the way they have treated them over the five years I have been in this House?  These are the foot soldiers for political parties.  They are the guys who go out in the rain.  Senator Kyne said a few moments ago that we do not respect local politicians in the way we should.  Every other Senator has said the same.  None of us have a monopoly on this issue.  The Government should pay them.  By the way, what is offered in the Moorhead report is not worth giving to them.  They need a decent salary.  If one is on social welfare and is elected as a councillor, one's social welfare payments stop.  A councillor's money is not, however, a salary.  There is no master-servant relationship between the council and the councillor.  It is an allowance to assist them in doing the job they have been elected to do.  When their salaries are fixed, therefore, they must also be taken out of the loop with regard to any social welfare benefit to which they are entitled.  I respect those on social welfare in the same degree as I respect millionaires.  I would love to go on for another ten minutes but the Leas-Chathaoirleach will not let me.</p></speech>

We have reduced the money and power they get and, as a result, the job of councillors, who receive this low wage, is even harder.  They do not have money to fix water infrastructure or to fix houses.  That has all been centralised.  As we discuss the Appropriation Bill, I would like us to look at that issue and to rethink how we allocate power and money to local government in addition to considering the issue of councillors' wages.</p></speech>

As Senators will be aware, this Bill is a Private Members' Bill, sponsored by Deputy Brendan Howlin, which was heavily based on recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in its 2016 Report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety.  The report identified areas of the law in relation to harmful communications online that needed to be strengthened to ensure that people are adequately protected.  I thank Deputy Howlin for introducing this important Bill and for working with the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and me to get it to this point.</p> <p>I also thank Senators for agreeing to take all Stages of this Bill in the House today.  I think we all agree that the issues addressed in the Bill are significant and I welcome the support it has received from across the Oireachtas.  I understand and appreciate that Senators would probably have preferred more time to consider the issues involved.  However, I think there is an appetite to get this done before the end of the year, and we can all be happy that we will have done work of real value today, when the Bill completes its passage.</p> <p>The Bill was amended significantly on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to reflect the policy aims of the legislation and to strengthen its provisions.  As a result of these structural changes, my Department has published a new explanatory memorandum to the Bill on the Oireachtas website.  The new memorandum recognises the role of victims in campaigning for a change in the law, particularly Ms Jackie Fox, who tragically lost her daughter Nicole to suicide.  I thank Ms Fox for sharing her story and for keeping these issues in the spotlight.</p> <p>In today's world, more and more of our interactions and communications are taking place online.  While this has been a largely positive advancement which enables us to communicate instantly with people anywhere in the world, it can also mean that people who wish to do us harm have a readily accessible platform from which to do so.  This Bill will strengthen our response to harm perpetrated online, as well as offline, to ensure that individuals can be punished in a proportionate manner.</p> <p>Senators will recall the recent leak of intimate images that was reported widely in the media.  While I cannot comment on any individual cases, there was obvious concern that the once-off sharing of intimate images without consent is not a criminal offence in Ireland.  The Bill addresses this by creating two offences to deal with this behaviour.  The first will address the distribution or publication of an intimate image without consent with intent to cause harm to the victim.  It will also be an offence to threaten to distribute or publish such an image.  The second offence is a strict liability offence to target the recording, distribution or publication of an intimate image without consent, with no requirement to prove an intention to cause harm.  These two offences will mean that this type of activity will no longer go unpunished.</p> <p>The Bill will also deal with other areas of harmful communications by creating a new offence of distributing, publishing or sending a threatening or grossly offensive communication with intent to cause harm and will extend the current offence of harassment to deal with communications about a person, as well as communications to a person.  I am confident that these offences will act as a real deterrent and will make people think twice about the type of behaviour they are engaging in online.</p> <p>It must be acknowledged that while this Bill is a positive development, the criminal law is not the only way to tackle the spread of harmful communications.  Education and awareness-raising, particularly among young people, is also crucial to ensuring the Internet is a safer place for all users.  The Government's action plan for online safety addresses a number of areas for improvement and work is ongoing to that end.</p> <p>Turning to the detail of the Bill, I would like to outline its key provisions.  Section 1 defines the key terms used in the Bill, the most notable being the term &ldquo;intimate image&rdquo;, which is used in the offences created under sections 2 and 3.  This definition was subject to much debate in the D&aacute;il and it has been amended, taking account of some of the concerns raised by Deputies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It does not require that the person was the subject of the original image, so long as they are represented in the image in some way.  The term "harm" is defined as including psychological harm.  This is extremely important, as much of the impact of the offences in the Bill will be psychological.  The word "communication" is not defined.  This is to ensure that it does not limit the wide interpretation of this concept to date in the courts.</p><p>Section 2 creates a new offence to deal with the publication or distribution of an intimate image without consent with intent to cause harm, or being reckless as to whether harm is caused.  The person who distributes or publishes the intimate image must have intended, or been reckless as to whether these acts would seriously interfere with the peace and privacy of the other person or cause the other person harm, alarm or distress.  This will be considered in light of whether a reasonable person would think that the behaviour would interfere with the peace and privacy of the other person, or cause him or her harm, alarm or distress.  Threatening to distribute or publish such an intimate image is also an offence.  The maximum penalties for this offence for conviction on indictment are up to seven years' imprisonment and-or an unlimited fine.</p><p>Section 3 is the second offence to be introduced in relation to intimate images.  It provides for an offence of recording, distributing or publishing an intimate image without consent.  This is a strict liability offence, as the person who records, distributes or publishes an intimate image without consent does not need to have a requisite intention to cause harm.  It will be sufficient that the taking, recording or distribution of the intimate image seriously interfered with the other person's peace and privacy or caused him or her harm, alarm or distress.  This is aimed at voyeuristic behaviour where an individual may not even know the victim.  The maximum penalty for this offence on summary conviction is 12 months' imprisonment and-or a &euro;5,000 fine.  Senators will appreciate that strict liability offences do not attract the same penalties as those where there is a clear intention to cause harm.</p><p>The Law Reform Commission, in its 2016 report, recognised the harmful effect that one single message may have on the person who receives it.  While we have strong laws in respect of persistent communication, there should be an offence to tackle once-off harmful messages through the use of any platform.  Therefore, section 4 provides for an offence of distributing, publishing or sending a threatening or grossly offensive communication.  This offence applies to all forms of messages or communications.  It will be an offence to send a threatening or grossly offensive message where the person who is sending the message or communication intends to cause harm to the person who is the recipient of the message.  This offence is intended to deal with the most harmful forms or messages and communications, both online and offline, where there is a clear intent to cause harm.  This offence is narrow in scope to ensure there is no undue interference in freedom of speech and to avoid criminalising adverse comment, for example.  The maximum penalties for this offence for conviction on indictment are two years' imprisonment and-or an unlimited fine.</p><p>Section 5 provides for the anonymity of victims of an offence under sections 2 or 3 of the Bill, that is, the two offences that deal with the recording, distribution or publication of  intimate images without consent.  Section 5(1) creates an offence where any person distributes or publishes any information that may lead to the identification of the victim of the offences.</p><p>Under section 5(2), a judge may, if it is in the interests of justice to do so, direct that certain information may be published or broadcast in such manner and subject to such conditions, if any, as he or she specifies in the direction.  I brought forward an amendment to this section on Report Stage yesterday to make it an explicit requirement on a judge to take into account the views of the victim in such a direction.  It shall be an offence if any person publishes or broadcasts any information in contravention of a direction under section 5(2).</p><p>The maximum penalties for conviction on indictment for an offence under this section are up to three years' imprisonment and-or an unlimited fine.  It shall be a defence for a person to prove that he or she was not aware that the material published or broadcast was material that was subject to the provisions of this section or a direction under this section.</p><p>Section 6 provides for the liability of corporate bodies as well as officers and directors of corporate bodies in respect of the offences under the Bill.</p><p>Section 7 relates to summary prosecutions.  There is normally a six-month time limit for the bringing of summary proceedings under the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851.  This has been extended to two years for summary offences under this Bill to ensure that there is sufficient time for evidence gathering, particularly where mutual legal assistance may be required if data is held outside the State.</p><p>Section 8 is an important safeguard in respect of prosecutions against children under the age of 17 years.  The consent of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, must be given prior to proceedings for an offence under the Bill where the alleged offender is under 17 years of age.</p><p>Section 9 amends the Schedule to the Bail Act 1997 to include the offence of distributing, publishing, or threatening to distribute or publish, an intimate image without consent with intent to cause harm, or being reckless as to whether harm is caused, under section 2 of this Bill.  This will mean that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may make an objection to bail under the 1997 Act in the case of a person who is remanded in custody for an offence under section 2 of this Bill.</p><p>Section 10 amends the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 to strengthen the offence of harassment under that Act.  The amendment will provide that harassment may be as a result of persistent communication with a person but also persistent communication about a person, sometimes referred to as indirect harassment.  The maximum penalty for harassment has been increased from seven years' imprisonment to ten years' imprisonment to reflect the serious nature of harassment and the wide range of behaviours it represents.</p><p>Section 11 amends section 40 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 to include the offences at sections 2 and 3 of the Bill as "relevant offences" for the purposes of that section.  Section 40 provides that where a "relevant offence" is committed against a "relevant person", it shall be an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing for that offence.  This means that it will be an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing a person for an offence under section 2 or section 3 of the Bill if that person is the spouse or civil partner of the victim, or is, or was, in an intimate relationship with the victim.</p><p>Section 12 provides that a review of the operation of the Act must be carried out within three years of the date from which it was commenced.</p><p>Section 13 provides for the Short Title and commencement of the Act and is a standard provision.</p><p>We can all agree that this Short Bill represents a big step forward in terms of harassment and harmful communications, and I am hopeful that the support in the D&aacute;il for the Bill will be echoed in this Chamber.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and I are both strongly supportive of this Bill.  Deputy Howlin made the point yesterday that this is an evolving area and it is an issue that we are likely to have to come back to in the not too distant future, to address new technologies and trends in online activity.  I could not agree more on this point.  That being said, I am looking forward to a good debate on this measure here today and I commend the Bill to the House. </p></speech>

As the Cathaoirleach outlined, Fianna F&aacute;il is delighted to support this important legislation which is referred to as Coco's Law, in memory of Nicole Fox Fenlon.  We are thinking of Nicole's family at this time, particularly given the time of year, and our thoughts are with them.</p> <p>The Bill provides for the creation of two new offences in respect of the publication and distribution of intimate images without consent.  The first offence concerns the distribution of intimate images without consent, or the threat to do so, with the intent to cause harm.  The second relates to the distribution or sharing of such images without consent.  It also provides for a number of other measures to strengthen the State's response to harassment, including increasing the maximum sentence for harassment to ten years' imprisonment, civil restraint orders, and providing that harassment may be the result of persistent communication about an individual rather than directly to an individual's face.  </p> <p>Recently, there was an outcry following a case that was widely publicised.  Unfortunately, this case was not an isolated incident, and there have been numerous reports of individuals, the vast majority of whom are women, who have been targeted with such abuse.  Yesterday evening, on the way home, I listened to Senator Hoey who is present today, as she outlined on the radio, her experience with harassment.  I sympathise with her and I admire her bravery in that regard.  The level of abuse to which the Senator was subjected is not good enough and simply should not be tolerated by anyone.  For that reason, I wish to commend Deputy Howlin, Senator Bacik and the Labour Party for their great work on this issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am delighted that further action will be taken in the month ahead to address harmful behaviour online through the online safety and media regulation Bill.

I often think that if I posted online the winning numbers for next week's lottery draw, there is no doubt that certain individuals would come back with a range of abuse and personal attacks aimed at me.  All Members have to accept such abuse, although maybe we should not have to accept it.  It is very sad that it has come to that point.  Unfortunately, that is the world in which we live today.  </p><p>I very much welcome the Bill.  I am delighted that we in Fianna F&aacute;il will be 100% behind it.</p></speech>

It is among the most important legislation to come before the Houses this year.  The fact that it was prioritised in the programme for Government sends a very strong message to the perpetrators of these vile online crimes that their actions are not just wrong and immoral, but that they are now illegal and that they will be criminalised for these activities.</p> <p>There is one plea I wish to make to the Minister of State.  He has acknowledged the work of Jackie Fox in terms of highlighting the whole area of cyberbullying.  Indeed, credit is due to Ms Fox and many other civil society organisations such as Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the Victims Alliance and the National Women's Council of Ireland, which have done a significant amount of work in terms of ensuring this legislation was a priority.  I also acknowledge the work of Deputy Howlin and the Labour Party on this issue.</p> <p>As I stated in the House two or three weeks ago, the Bill should be known as Coco's Law for several reasons.  We need to recognise the significant work done by Jackie Fox in memory of her daughter.  Young people in particular may not be attuned to the parliamentary language we use around legislation and it may be that the Bill being known simply as Coco's Law would make it more relevant, particularly for the younger people who we wish to help and support.  I ask that this proposal be considered again.</p> <p>The fact that the Bill creates two new offences relating to the publication and distribution of intimate images without consent is very important.  The first of those offences relates to the distribution of intimate images without consent or the threat to distribute those images with the intent to cause harm and the second relates to the actual distribution or sharing of images without consent.  The creation of those offences is very important but there are several other important measures contained in the Bill to strengthen the response of the State to harassment, including increasing the maximum sentence for harassment to ten years, provision for civil restraint orders and offences relating to persistent communication about an individual.</p> <p>All Senators know and have spoken in the Chamber about the significant shock to young women in particular that was caused by the 10,000 intimate images and videos, mainly of Irish women, that were shared without consent.  That is the clearest indicator to date of the urgent need to address image-based harassment.  Of course, Members also know about other individual situations.</p> <p>It is very important to note that further action to address harmful behaviour online needs to be taken following the passage of this Bill.  Of course, that will be done through the online safety and media regulation Bill, as well as the fact that there will be an online safety commissioner.</p> <p>There is much to be commended in the Bill.  One particular issue of note is the fact that it will be irrelevant that consent was given for an intimate image to be taken.  The fact that it will be irrelevant in terms of a case going to court is very important, particularly to young women who ended up with a sense of guilt or shame because they allowed an image to be taken with consent by a person with whom they were in a trusting relationship at the time.  I thank the Minister of State for his work.  I commend and support the Bill.</p></speech>

In light of the unusual origins of the Bill, it is appropriate that the Labour Party would have the opportunity to lead for the Opposition on the Bill and I am delighted to do so.</p><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I ask him to pass on our words of thanks to the Minister, Deputy McEntee, who has done so much to pilot the Bill through the Houses following its initiation in the D&aacute;il three years ago by my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Howlin.  I pay tribute to Deputy Howlin, who led on this issue from the start and initiated the legislation.  His enormous contribution to law reform in this area has very fairly been acknowledged by all in the D&aacute;il and in this House also.  I am delighted to see that the revised explanatory memorandum published with the Bill this week recognises the role of Deputy Howlin and the fact that the Bill started as an Opposition Bill introduced by the Labour Party but has now been taken up by the Government through a constructive engagement process with Deputy Howlin and has been steered through the D&aacute;il with support from all parties and Independents.  I hope it will make similarly smooth progress, albeit with robust debate, in this House.</p><p>I also wish to pay tribute to the extraordinary campaigning work of so many whose lives have been so severely affected by the scourge of online abuse, digital bullying and so on.  I refer in particular to Jackie Fox, the mother of Nicole Coco Fox Fenlon.  Nicole, who was known by the nickname &quot;Coco&quot;, tragically took her own life tragically in 2018 at the young age of 21 following years of being subjected to vicious abuse and bullying online.  I again thank the Minister of State and the Minister for revising the explanatory memorandum.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	The content of this Bill is strongly influenced by persons who have lost their lives because of online abuse, in particular Nicole Fox.  The Bill is in recognition of her mother&rsquo;s determination to honour the memory of her daughter and to strengthen the law so that others can be safer.  As a result this Bill can be referred to as <i>Coco&rsquo;s Law</i>. </blockquote> <p>That is a really fitting way of marking the enormous contribution made to law reform by Nicole's mother and the other bereaved families who have lost young people to suicide, often as a result of serious online abuse and bullying.  Deputy Howlin hosted an incredibly moving event outside Leinster House some months ago which I know a number of colleagues attended and at which we heard directly from Jackie Fox and other parents as to the seriously detrimental effect that online bullying had on their children and teenagers.  That brought home to many of those present the very serious nature of this phenomenon and the need for law reform in this area.  As I stated, Deputy Howlin pioneered this legislation and had originally introduced the Bill in 2017.  Thanks to the galvanising of support from across the House and, indeed, thanks to the support of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, the Bill has been progressed much more swiftly in this Oireachtas term and for that I thank colleagues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why, in the interests of seeing it passed into law now without further delay, we have listed it to be taken through all Stages today.  That was by assent of all of us represented at a recent leaders and Whips meeting.<br/><br/>Many NGOs have also engaged very constructively with the process and are anxious to see the Bill become law.  Safe Ireland sent us a very powerful email last night asking for the swift passage of this law with no further delay.  I pay tribute to Safe Ireland, the Rape Crisis Network and all the other NGOs that have been so actively engaged in respect of the Bill, including the National Women's Council and Women's Aid, which have done great work to support survivors and victims of domestic abuse in recent months.  Women's Aid and others are seeking further improvements to the Bill even at this late hour.  However, I believe colleagues appreciate that there is an imperative to get the Bill passed in order to ensure that we have, for the first time, a robust legal framework to protect those who are suffering from online abuse and harassment, including the sharing of intimate images we have seen reported in recent months.<br/><br/>Once it is introduced, legislation is subject to amendment.  I quote Deputy Howlin, who on this point on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il yesterday stated:</p><blockquote>	The one thing I am very clear on is that there is no end to the amendments we could actually consider.  People have been contacting me about this over the years, but also recently.  Since there is such an urgent need for legislation in this area, our objective should be to establish a framework.  As I said in my opening comments on this, the framework should not be the final word, by any stretch of the imagination.  We will be building on it ...  New technologies will have to be addressed in the future. </blockquote><p>The Minister of State referred to this as an evolving Bill, which is right.  it provides us with a first robust statutory framework.  Clearly, it needs to be built upon, as the Law Reform Commission pointed out in 2016, through the enactment of further legislation to deal with civil remedies relating to online abuse and harassment.  That is clearly not being dealt with in this Bill, which is a criminal Bill, as Deputy Howlin pointed out.  It will also need to be dealt with through other mechanisms beyond law reform, through, for example, education programmes and the establishment of awareness-raising programmes the Minister of State also mentioned.  It will take further legislation to establish, for example, the digital safety commission that the Law Reform Commission called for in 2016.<br/><br/>Our priority today should be to get this Bill passed, but we recognise that further legislation will be required to deal with other aspects of online abuse and harassment.  We are also cognisant that the Bill was amended quite extensively on Committee Stage and even on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Yesterday, and I believe on Committee Stage, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, indicated that a justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will come before the Oireachtas next year and that any issues with this Bill could be addressed via that legislation.  We are conscious that there is scope for further evolution of the law in the area, particularly in view of the speed at which technology is changing.  Even in the three years since Deputy Howlin first introduced his Bill and the four years since the Law Reform Commission issued its important report on harmful communications and digital safety, we have witnessed extensive technological change and much greater pervasiveness of social media access by much younger teens.  I speak as a mother of teenagers.  We are all conscious that that has been a feature.<br/><br/>In previous debates, colleagues have mentioned the visible coarsening and degrading of discourse and abuse online that all of us have received as public representatives.  In recent weeks just in respect particularly of our citizenship law and the Born Here, Belong Here campaign, I and other Labour representatives have received horrible abuse online.  We are all aware of that.  That has been a changing landscape which we need to navigate and address in our laws.<br/><br/>As Deputy Howlin has pointed out, this Bill is long overdue, even though we recognise that further evolution will be necessary.  Some of the law it seeks to reform is half a century old, including the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 relating to communications.  Even the much more recent Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, which itself was a major consolidating piece of legislation, is now 23 years old and much has changed during that period.<br/><br/>I will speak briefly about the content of the Bill and how it is now coming to us.  Essentially it seeks to address two different aspects of online abuse and harassment, first the sharing of intimate images and online sexual abuse we have seen reported on so widely recently.  The non-consensual sharing of intimate images of women and girls has caused much alarm in recent months.  That aspect of online abuse is dealt with in sections 2 and 3.  These sections provide a clear framework for dealing with the more serious aspect, which is the intentional or reckless sharing or distribution of intimate images which carries a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment and is provided for in section 2.  Because it is a more serious offence, it has a higher threshold to meet for prosecution.  Having looked at it extensively, I think it fits within our criminal law framework adequately.  Section 3 contains the less serious offence, which is a strict liability offence and does not require proof of intention or recklessness and therefore carries a lesser penalty.  However, it also addresses the terrible harm of recording, distributing or publishing an intimate image without intent.  That is a clear and robust scheme.<br/><br/>The second aspect of online harassment relates to the online bullying and harassment that does not involve the sharing of intimate images.  That is dealt with through two provisions in the Bill.  Section 4 creates the new offence of distributing, publishing or sending threatening or grossly offensive communication.  This offence carries a penalty of two years' imprisonment.  It is a crucial reform which is long overdue because it covers once-off abuse, the sending of a single abusive message which currently no law addresses.  Importantly, section 10 updates the existing offence of harassment in section 10 of the 1997 Act.  It expands the definition of that so that is not just communicating with somebody, but now crucially also communicating about them - the sort of horrible bullying we see taking place online where people are vilified through posts or messages to others.  There is also an increase in the penalty from seven to ten years' imprisonment.  That is a good scheme.  We have two graded offences under each heading, under the heading of the sharing of intimate images and under the heading of more general online bullying and harassment.<br/><br/>Deputy Howlin spoke about the motivation in introducing the Bill.  He said that the Bill is based on a fundamental view that the Internet and use of social media and online space generally is a public space and people who use that public space should be protected there and have their behaviour regulated in the same way that we regulate behaviour in a public street or a public park.  Clearly, we must also be mindful of balancing protections against the right of free speech and free communication.  We need to recognise the enormous benefits the Internet and social media platforms have brought us, but it is fair that we regulate that space, which is the purpose of the Bill.<br/><br/>The Bill also contains important safeguards such as the provision in section 8 that children can only be prosecuted with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which is right and proper.  We are all mindful of the need to ensure a balancing of the more serious offences and a higher threshold.<br/><br/>We are anxious to have the Bill passed by both Houses before Christmas.  We want to give relief, succour and reassurance to the many people, the women and girls, the teens and young adults who have suffered bullying and abuse online, who will continue to suffer from such bullying and who want to see, as their families do, some measure of redress and accountability for the perpetrators.  In particular, they want to know that there is a robust legal framework to protect them.  This Bill can provide that robust legal framework.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I am delighted to speak in support of this legislation which we initiated.  I ask colleagues across the House for their support.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for the extra time he afforded me for my contribution.</p></speech>

We recently had statements on exactly this issue and the Bill was discussed extensively on that occasion as well.  This is very important legislation and I will not repeat what other speakers have said about its import.  Suffice it to say that most people find it astonishing that this kind of activity is not already against the law.  We are behind the curve on the matter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is right and proper that we should correct that this week, so I look forward to the passing of this Bill into law.</p><p>I wish to comment on the fact that this is a Private Members' Bill.  It is a tremendously important function of these Houses that legislation comes forth from Members other than those in the Government.  I acknowledge that it has been amended somewhat in the D&aacute;il, but to a great extent the Bill that was drafted by Deputy Howlin, with the assistance of the Law Reform Commission, stands and will become law.  We should mark the importance of that.  All too often, Private Members' Bills from this and the other House are brushed aside.  There was an improvement in that regard in recent years, particularly in the previous Houses when there was a need, perhaps, to engage more with the Opposition.  Both Government and Opposition Members have an equally valid opportunity to put forward legislative proposals and I welcome the fact that this is one such proposal that makes sense and has been championed by the Government.</p><p>I pay tribute to the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, in that regard as well.  In fairness, she came to the House for statements recently and she did a great deal of work on this Bill in the committee.  It is a tribute to her, as has been said by Senator Bacik, that she has taken this legislation on board and agreed to bring it forward and champion it in some respects.  It is not possible for an Opposition Member to do that to the same extent.</p><p>I also acknowledge the content of the explanatory memorandum.  Senator Bacik quoted the final paragraph of the background section on the first page in which specific provision is made for this to be called Coco's Law.  I am aware of the extraordinary campaigning Jackie Fox has done on this subject on behalf of her late daughter, but also on behalf of the myriad victims of this type of behaviour across the country.  It is appropriate that we acknowledge that, and credit is due to the Minister for flying in the face of convention, to a large extent, to make provision in the explanatory memorandum to specifically acknowledge this as Coco's Law.  It is only a convention and there is nothing to stop us calling it Coco's Law in the Title of the Bill.  However, that is more of an American affectation and, unfortunately, I associate that behaviour in America with much more reactionary, populist legislation, as opposed to this legislation, which is incredibly important and grounded in fact and in an identifiable problem.  The fact that it is in the explanatory memorandum is an important recognition of Nicole Fox and what she went through and of the campaign her mother launched in this respect.</p><p>I will not go into the details of the Bill.  In specific sections some of the changes that have been made by the Department in the drafting are, perhaps, unnecessary.  They are done now and I do not propose to try to undo them on Committee Stage.  However, I return to the point I was making about Private Members' legislation.  When something is drafted a particular way and it does the job, it does not have to be written in the Department's style for it still to be perfectly legal, correct, justiciable and functional in the context of prosecutions.  I slightly resist the desire sometimes of the Government and the permanent government, if I can put in those terms with the greatest respect to the people who keep the country going, to write things in a Bill in the official form.  It can make it more wordy, less accessible but no better in real terms to what was drafted in the first instance.</p><p>Finally, I wish to make a comment in respect of what I said earlier about the Law Reform Commission.  This is a perfect example of where Members of the Oireachtas have an opportunity to make the best of what the commission does.  The commission is a State body that makes recommendations on legislative changes.  It provides incredible reports that are very detailed and bring forth the benefit of extensive research and consideration of legislative changes.  It also publishes consolidated legislation.  Reference is made to many legislative measures in this House, but they are amended all the time.  The Law Reform Commission publishes consolidated legislation on its website for the benefit of everyone.  It is free of charge for everyone as well.  The commission produces reports time and again, on budget and on time.  It is remarkable for that fact because it is not an enormous organisation.  The fact that Deputy Howlin, no more than any Member of this House, can benefit from that expertise, professionalism and depth of understanding is extraordinary.  I encourage all Members to engage a great deal more with the commission, take on board its suggestions and bring forward Private Members' Bills such as this, which identifies and solves a problem that very clearly exists.</p><p>It is wonderful the Bill is here and that we are making progress.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, for the work he has done and for coming to the House, and all Members for allowing this Bill to pass quickly today.  That is exactly what should happen.</p></speech>

It was, and I am proud to participate in the passing of this Bill by the House.  It is extraordinary that we live in an age in which the threat of the publication of an image and the harassment of individuals can happen online in the manner in which it does.  It is appalling, and I am delighted that it will quickly become a criminal offence.  It is long overdue.</p><p>I have great respect for Safe Ireland and all the other NGOs that contributed and have spoken on it, as well as their email to us urging us to get on with getting the legislation onto the Statute Book and into effect as quickly as possible.  I am glad that consent is irrelevant in the context of this Bill.  That was extremely important.  The phenomenon of the use of social media is quite extraordinary.  I pay tribute to Professor Mary Aiken who published a book, <i>The Cyber Effect</i>, in which she deals with what happens in our psychology whereby things we would never say to somebody in person we would say online or over social media.  She explains that phenomenon very well.  It is amazing.</p><p>In the abuse I have received people refer to me in the most extraordinary and certainly unparliamentary language.  They will do that in a Facebook post in between celebrating a daughter's birthday and something else for another family member.  They can do it without considering that perhaps the child may grow up to be a Member of the Oireachtas and be subjected to similar abuse.  Hopefully, as a consequence of this Bill, the child will not.  It is important that the discourse online is safe, and that it is a place where we can all engage in a positive and constructive manner with our freedom of speech.</p></speech>

This is the first time I have addressed him since his elevation and it is great to see him here.</p> <p>I was proud to step aside and let the Labour Party take the slot, given the debt of gratitude that is due to Deputy Howlin, the party and, indeed, Senator Bacik, for bringing this legislation forward.  It has been a long and arduous journey.  I wish to tell Jackie Fox that Coco did not die in vain.  The outlandish and horrendous torment, abuse and harassment she took from bullies online was not in vain.  She has made this country, at least, a safer place.  I met the family outside the gates of Leinster House thanks to Deputy Howlin.  It was a harrowing meeting, to see what was done to that beautiful child.  She could have been 21 years old, but she was somebody's child.</p> <p>Something terribly wrong is happening in our society with respect to the use of social media.  The fact is that one can register anonymously and throw out any abuse one wishes.  There is a misconception that it is scumbags who engage in this type of behaviour.  My personal experience is that I asked a question in this House about the HPV vaccine.  I asked it because I knew nothing about it and I called for a debate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

The people who were bullying me were not scumbags but registered general practitioners in medical practice.  I still have the screen captures of what they said to me online.  One of them went as far as to diagnose me as somebody who needed mental treatment.  At that stage, I contacted him and told him that I knew who we was and that he had gone too far.  Within three minutes, every tweet was gone.  These tweets came from medical practitioners.  If medical practitioners can behave like that, what are those who do not understand the damage they are doing capable of?</p><p>This Bill is about use of images and the horrendous work that is done on young ladies.  I understand this issue as I was a teacher for 25 years.  One of the worst things someone can do online to a girl is not to comment, for example, if a girl puts up an image of herself in a new dress.  That is one side of it.  The other side of it is one on which I have to speak to the young men of Ireland.  What are they thinking of in asking young girls to take intimate photographs of themselves and send them on to them?  What the hell is that about?  If they want to see some part of their anatomy, they can go and meet them.  They do not need the image to be sent to them online and then have this big stick to hold over their heads for the rest of their lives.  I have seen some of this carry-on in schools.  Really and truly, this has to stop.</p><p>In my first week as president of the Teachers Union of Ireland, I had to travel to the north west where two young girls had taken their own lives because of what was going on online.  What sort of country do we have?  On the day I arrived, a school principal told me he could not understand what was going on in family homes.  We were talking about children aged between 13 and 15 years.  He told me these children are sent to bed at night at a particular time, their parents ensure they have washed their teeth, put on their pyjamas and, in some cases, have said their prayers before they go to bed.  Then they will leave them with the most lethal instrument in bed with them, namely, their mobile phone.  They can either be the bully or the bullied.  This is a societal issue and this legislation will go a long way towards changing the society we live in.  I am very grateful to Deputy Howlin for bringing forward this Bill.  He fought long and hard to bring it to both Houses.  It will pass as Coco&rsquo;s Law and it is not before time that we have had such a law.</p><p>We now have to go one stage further.  I hope the Minister will engage in a national advertising campaign to ensure nobody is left unaware of exactly what this means.  I hope my former colleagues in education will explain to children in schools, particularly in the later years of national school and all of second level, that they do not have to provide images of themselves to anybody.  &ldquo;Oh, if you loved me you would send me the photograph&rdquo; they are told.  They do not have to do that and if they do so, they will leave themselves open to these blackguards and what they will do.  I could use much stronger language if I wanted to.  There has to be penalties.  I am glad that both the Minister of State, the senior Minister, Deputy McEntee, and Deputy Howlin saw that this was a dynamic Bill.  This legislation will have to change.  </p><p>I am in my 60s.  I started communications with Morse code, dots and dashes, and it is not that long ago.</p></speech>

In that short space of time, I have seen how communications have been used as a weapon to pull people into line.</p> <p>I know this Bill deals with online communication but we must also look at bullying in the workplace and the classroom but particularly the former.  I am familiar with this because a former colleague took his own life because he could take no more of it.  The bully is the guy one meets in the staff room or corridor who may be the nicest person any of us could possibly meet until he or she gets into a room with one of us alone.  These people can be the most heartless creatures.  If they are like that one-to-one, what will they be like online?  Much of the stuff that we have seen online has come from the school yard and we have to move to stop it.</p> <p>While this Bill will go a long way in dealing with cyberbullying and the like, we need to look at other laws.  I know the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act is a law that can be used to deal with bullying but it is difficult to prove a case.  Bullying is usually a one-on-one issue.  I remember a schoolteacher telling me one time that if she was called in by a certain person once more, she would close the door as she entered, bang her head as hard as she could off the wall, run out and say this person hit her, because this was the only evidence she would ever have that she was being bullied.  I thank the Labour Party for really good work on this and the Government also for accepting the work of Deputy Howlin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#Y00600"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also commend Deputy Howlin for instigating this important Bill which he first introduced in 2017.  I am pleased that the Government has worked constructively to bring it to fruition.  It is regrettable that it did not take the same approach to Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire&rsquo;s Bill on establishing an online safety commissioner.  Maybe as a new year&rsquo;s resolution, the Government would set out to work with the Opposition on Private Members&rsquo; Bills, especially where they seek to address real gaps and deficiencies in our legislation.</p> <p>Since the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill was restored to the Order Paper in September, it has moved swiftly, which is to be welcomed.  That is because a truly collaborative approach has been taken by all parties, which reflects the seriousness of the issue.  Through co-operation and a genuine desire to make this legislation robust and fit for purpose, many of the loopholes highlighted at the start of the process have now been addressed.  That said, there are, as has been conceded by many Senators today, area that can be improved.  A number of amendments have been submitted and I am sure the Senators who submitted them will speak on them later.</p> <p>I share the view of many organisations that we need to get this Bill passed as soon as possible to put the critical protections in place.  We have seen the devastation that was caused when the Victims Alliance discovered that thousands of images of women and girls had been shared online.  I commend Linda Hayden and the Victims Alliance on their Trojan efforts in bringing that situation to light.  Up to 140,000 intimate and sexual photos were shared without consent and traded on the Internet like children would trade trump cards.  This is a profound violation of the rights of women and girls.  I cannot even imagine the hurt, pain and emotional toll it would take to be told or to find out that one has been violated in this way.  </p> <p>It is long overdue that we as a nation face up to the fact that we have a problem with consent in Ireland and that we need to start addressing it immediately.  It is too late at third level.  We have to start much earlier.  The Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution made recommendations on sexual health and relationships education and called for these to be addressed in our school system, youth clubs and all organisations involved in education and interaction with young people.  The case for education on consent was never so stark as when one scrolled through the responses to those who had highlighted the online sharing of intimate images.  It was terrifying to see the level of victim blaming and misogyny that poured out over the Internet.  Just because consenting adults create and share intimate images does not mean that those images can be widely shared with random strangers or friends.</p> <p>I disagree with Senator Craughwell.  It is absolutely up to individuals, whether they are in relationships or not, to share images if they so desire.  The issue is whether those images are shared with others.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I welcome that the Bill has been amended to include deep-faking, which involves the superimposition of someone's face onto someone else's body and is becoming a more common form of image-based sexual abuse.  Everybody agrees this is good legislation, even with the omissions, and it will provide essential protections that are currently lacking leading to exploitation due to the lack of legislation in Ireland.  Getting this Bill passed today is critical because we need it.  It will be beneficial to the safety of women and girls.  That said, the legislation is only as good as its ability to be enforced.  We tend to be good at passing legislation but not so good at implementing it.  Ireland has a disturbingly low rate of detection and sanction of sexual offences and other forms of gender-based violence.</p><p>We need to hear commitments from the Minister of State that the Garda will be fully resourced and that its members will be trained to deal with reports made under this legislation and provided with the technology and the powers to ensure material can be taken down swiftly from the Internet and that those responsible for the offences will be pursued with vigour.  We also need assurances that victims will be treated with the utmost care and professionalism when they come forward.</p><p>I thank Jackie Fox, who has fought tirelessly to get laws enacted to deal with online bullying.  We have all heard how Jackie's beautiful daughter Nicole, known affectionately as Coco, was subjected to relentless online bullying, which eventually led to her suicide.  It is only through the campaigning of her devastated mother that this Bill is brought to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  It is only right that the Bill should be known as Coco's Law.  Coco was a beautiful young woman with her whole life ahead of her.  When she needed the protection of this State, it was not there.  That changes today and that is a good thing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#Z00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for being here this afternoon.  The Oireachtas scheduling means that, though I will speak to the amendments, realistically I cannot push them.  I do not want to hold the Bill up and I am the only one who has tabled amendments to it.</p> <p>When the domestic violence legislation was going through, I took a back seat because of the impact some of the conversations in respect of coercive control could have on me.  I got a phone call about the images that were shared online before the story went live.  I had to tell them to ring me back because two garda&iacute; were in my sitting room with me as I began to look at taking my own case concerning harassment that has been ongoing for five years.</p> <p>As this Bill was coming through at speed, I sat down to look at it to see how I and people who have had my experience could be protected by this legislation.  That is why I will focus heavily on the harassment part of the amendments.  The bar is set so high to prove harassment.  In the 21st century, harassment looks very different from how it used to.  You cannot display all these phone calls you are getting because there is the ability with technology to block people so they find resourceful ways to continue to harass and abuse you.</p> <p>On my first ever speech in this Chamber in 2016, I was escorted by an usher.  I had to be walked to the bus stop.  There are two men in the last five years who have not taken me off their radar.  I have had many conversations with garda&iacute; and have been trying to find ways to protect myself.  I have a firm belief that I want to see culture change and not imprisonment.  I am caught between a rock and a hard place because I want to see culture change and I do not always think that hefty sentences achieve that.  It is hard to find a balance between advocating for these changes while realising that a huge level of information and education is needed, as Senator Boylan said, in relation to consent.  Early intervention is needed to ensure understanding of what is harmful communication and what is not.</p> <p>Like others, I commend the Labour Party and Deputy Howlin on bringing this forward.  It is important legislation and the difference for me between now and the time the domestic violence legislation went through is that I am no longer willing to not speak out of fear that I would put myself back on someone's radar by speaking.  I put in the amendments today because it was important for me to correct my silence throughout the last few years on this issue.  It was important for me to feel that, when the time to speak came, I could speak with confidence and without fear of the repercussions of my voice.  </p> <p>The Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Department have committed to bringing forward consequential miscellaneous provisions in respect of justice legislation.  I would like to be able to have input into that and most of my amendments are in the vein of hoping to frame some of the discourse on those future amendments and conversations and on how we redefine harassment.  Showing a garda a postcard saying "Keep up the good work" and trying to convince that garda that it constitutes harassment is a funny place to be in.  It is subtle and insidious.  I have had my kids getting up to lock the doors at night and I still do not reach the bar for harassment.  While harassment is included in this legislation, I do not believe it protects women from harassment, given the way in which it is defined.  I would love for Members to look at that in the future and to see this as a huge step forward in beginning to name these issues and in bringing the legislation forward into the times we are in, in terms of how people abuse and control people.  I hope I can use today's debate as an opportunity to signal what we need to do going forward.</p> <p>I acknowledge, as everyone has, Jackie Fox, the work she has done and the investment she has made in using her daughter's tragedy as a way to make change.  It is unfortunate that sometimes, it is tragedy that makes change, motivates us and drives us forward but that should not be the case.  I also wish to recognise Dara Quigley and her family.</p> <p>Intimate images or offensive images of somebody at the time of his or her death are covered to an extent by "harmful communications".  My childhood friend, Paul Griffin, has been as vocal as he can about the death of his sister Jackie on the M50, when her horrific death was shared online within moments.  The family were sent images before they even knew it was their daughter dead on the M50.  We need to ensure this type of image is captured in legislation like this.  I thank the Griffin family for pushing forward on that becoming a law, making it possible to hold people accountable for a gross invasion of someone's privacy and dignity at the time of death.</p></speech>

Like others, I pay tribute to our Wexford colleague, Deputy Howlin, for his championing of this legislation, and to Senator Bacik and her Labour Party colleagues.  It is a good sign that this has cross-party support.  I echo the tributes paid to Nicole Fox Fenlon and her mother, Jackie.  Not alone has Jackie Fox striven to ensure we get this legislation in, she has also spoken to schools and other organisations trying to get the message to young people about how important it is for people to behave responsibly on social media.</p> <p>We saw the case recently around image-based sexual harassment, which was to the fore.  It struck me that if one thinks even about ourselves in our teens but particularly about a teen girl or a young girl and the impact it would have on her, conscious of the need for the approval of her peers, to have intimate images shared without consent, it is frightening.  The point is clear that this has to be evolving legislation.  Senator Craughwell was right.  We will be moving quickly into an era of virtual and augmented reality.  How will we deal with bullying and harassment in those circumstances?  Senator Ruane in her personal and powerful testimony talked about the different forms of harassment we have to deal with, in terms of abuse and control.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I also reference parental alienation.  The key point about it is that nobody should be afraid to speak out.  As legislators, we have to help empower people to be able to do this.  I agree with Senator Bacik on the need for civil remedies to be addressed also.<br/><br/>What I want to raise is the question of the responsibility of the social media companies.  A number of people here, beginning with Senator Gallagher, spoke about how we have all received abuse online.  We can deal with a certain amount of it but the problem is with some of the anonymous accounts that literally spew vile abuse on a regular basis.  I was used to it but an anonymous Twitter account in the name of P O'Neill targeted me and others earlier this year.  When a local businessman who was the subject of the abuse tried to get information from Twitter to find out who was behind it every possible barrier was put in his way.  Facebook and Twitter in particular hide behind a wall of anonymity.  If we look at Revolut, which people will know as a financial technology company that is revolutionising digital banking, with almost 1 million people in Ireland using it, anyone who signs up to it has to produce a picture of their passport.  It is similar to opening a bank account here and it is because of rules required by the Central Bank.  People have to identify who they are.<br/><br/>People may know in recent days that <i>The New York Times</i>had a big story about Pornhub and some of what had been uploaded to it.  By the way, Pornhub is the ninth most viewed website in Ireland, far more than any news site.  To deal with the fact there were anonymous postings on Pornhub of vile and abusive acts, MasterCard and Visa took action and said they would not allow cardholders to pay for anything, and Pornhub had to take action.  The result was the Pornhub took down approximately 80% of its content.  I do not want to comment on the nature of pornography sites but now if people want to upload content onto Pornhub they must identify who they are.  They can no longer be anonymous.  Whether it is in banking or pornography, people cannot be anonymous yet Facebook and Twitter have no requirement to prove identity.<br/><br/>One of the concerns I also have, and it has been covered by the media, particularly by <i>The Business Post</i>, is with regard to the content moderators in Facebook.  As part of their contract they have to acknowledge they have the risk of post-traumatic shock disorder because of some of the content to which they will be exposed that will be anonymously uploaded.<br/><br/>There are good reasons for anonymity.  This is entirely accepted.  For particular reasons, people should not necessarily have to identify themselves publicly but where we have a situation where there are defamatory, violent or abusive images we should be able to find out who is responsible for them.  The social media companies have to take responsibility in this area.  As Senator Bacik said, this is about a public space and we have to have regulation of the public space.<br/><br/>I strongly support the legislation.  I know the online safety and media regulation Bill will be coming before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture Sports and the Gaeltacht in the new year for pre-legislative scrutiny and we can look at enhancing a number of the provisions that have been raised.  While we as legislators are taking responsibility, and there is a personal responsibility on everyone and we need digital literacy and education, responsibility also has to be placed at the door of the social media companies, in particular Facebook and Twitter.  If they do not act we, as legislators, have the responsibility to take action against them.</p></speech>

I know there is probably not a person in the Chamber who has not experienced it.  I am really sorry to hear of the length of harassment that Senator Ruane is going through and I really wish her success, if not with the current legislation which is abysmal, but with this new legislation.  I hope she can bring it to fruition with a happy outcome for her.</p><p>Nobody in the House, our local Government colleagues, our D&aacute;il colleagues or probably anybody in any walk of life has not suffered in some way, shape or form on the medium we call the wonderful world of social media and the great invention that is the Internet.  The legislation will go if not the full way then a long way to address many of the concerns we have.  There are two aspects to it.  One is the sharing of images, and the stark reality of how harmful it can be was probably really highlighted to us all only a couple of weeks ago when we saw the dump of tens of thousands of very personal images that caused great hurt and particularly exercised the young women in Ireland.  It did in my household anyway.  I really welcome this aspect of the Bill.</p><p>I want to talk about the other aspect of the Bill, which is the harmful harassment and bullying aspect.  While the legislation is very welcome, and particularly the penalties are very welcome, I do not believe we really fully appreciate the extent of where it will go.  When we hear about people being bullied we think they are being bullied by a certain stereotype of person we have in our head.  We think the perpetrators are all adults.  We think they are all in a box, and that when we do shine a light on them and point the finger at who they are that the two year sentence will be well justified, and that it will be grand and everything will be great.</p><p>We spoke this morning about politics being about the personal and I can only speak about the personal experiences I have had with regard to bullying.  The bullies are not all adults because we had an incident in my house a couple of years ago, which was greatly helped by schools and the Garda but there was no happy outcome because the bullies were 13 and 14 year old girls.  These girls were vicious and relentless.  When we looked them in the eye in front of their mammies and daddies butter would not melt in their mouth and they were really sorry but the Snapchat messages we read back to them were relentless.</p><p>Senator Craughwell will said earlier it is awful for a parent to let their child go to bed with a mobile phone.  In some cases when a child is being bullied it is the only friend they have.  That does not make sense but when we are in the throes of it, with a child we love the bones of, and not being able to help them because what we want to do to help them is probably not legal, we are left with absolutely no tools in our kit.  Children aged 13 or 14 years do not actually realise the damage and psychological harm they are doing to the child they are bullying.  I am not sure the legislation, welcome and all as it is and I really mean that, will actually fix this problem.</p><p>I am encouraged by the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy McEntee, when they say there is a need for educational programmes and a need for awareness.  It is not just the 14 year old or 13 year old children who need to be made aware of how harmful the communications they are snapping at 1 a.m. 2 a.m. or 4 a.m. are because they do not go away, and the harmful impacts they have on another 13 year old child's psyche.  We end up doing the full circle of why we are all here today.  It is because a young woman, and there are plenty more like her but we all know this girl by name today, was not able to cope with the harmful communications she received relentlessly and she took her own life.  It is because of the ferociousness of her mother and the unwillingness of her mother to allow those people to get off the hook that we are all here today celebrating a young woman's very short life but a legacy that will live long after the legislation is passed.  It is absolutely right and fitting that it is called Coco's Law in her honour.</p><p>I am really not sure this will do the trick, which is why I am so glad it is not a stand-alone piece of legislation.  It is not something that is to be put in a drawer or on a shelf that we will get back to in a few years time because I absolutely believe when we start to monitor the bullying online, which we will now start to be able to do because of this legislation, we will also be able to start to measure it.  The ugly reality of it is that its perpetrators are not some awful men and women who have no feelings.  In many cases we are going to discover they are children who just do not realise the harm they are actually doing.  This is an even bigger problem we need to address.</p><p>I want to add to the cloud that Deputy Brendan Howlin is probably travelling home on today because it is so well deserved.  Often, when I had the privilege of being a Minister, one of the first things I used to say during legislation was that no Minister or official in the Department had a monopoly on wisdom and this is a perfect example of how this is true.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I thank Deputy Howlin.

That is not true of all of us but it is definitely true of some.</p></speech>

Some of us are very much looking forward to the season of goodwill - the celebration of a time when the entry into the world of an innocent child brought so much hope to humanity - and yet what we are hearing today is about a real loss of innocence in our society and a lost of decent childhood for many children who should not be exposed to some of these particularly modern harms.</p> <p>The more I have looked at this legislation, the more I favour its essential provisions, but also the more I worry about flaws in the legislation and the more indignant I feel about the fact that this legislation is being put through at all Stages today.  Several colleagues have said that this is a Bill that will have to change which is masking the fact that there is no excuse for rushing through a piece of criminal legislation on the week before Christmas at all Stages.  I have already spotted at least two issues that gives me concern and this Bill only passed the D&aacute;il yesterday.  This is not emergency financial legislation.  Nobody will be done an injustice.  We do not know when the Bill will commence - at least, I do not know.  This could have been concluded in the new year.  I was told by a Fine Gael colleague that we all supported this because, apparently, at the group leaders' meeting, everybody agreed.  I am also told it was suggested unless one wants to come in next Tuesday and Senators shied away.  We are bringing our politics into disrepute every time we do this.  The parties in government must take a lead.  It is wrong to give people no opportunity to listen to Second Stage speeches before they consider amendments.  It is wrong to give Senators no time between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  The Government is contributing to the contempt that people have for the Oireachtas and for politics and it needs to stop doing that.  I say that to my own group as well.  We have to stop rushing through legislation in this way.  This is important urgent legislation but, in fact, the Government is dishonouring it by giving it so little scrutiny.</p> <p>For example, why is the recording of intimate images without consent not being criminalised in section 2?  Somebody could record something in order to inflict harm on a person, but not distribute it.  Is that a mistake or is there a rationale for it?  In section 3, there is a saver for somebody who is involved in prosecuting offences in distributing or passing on images, but has consideration been given to the possibility that someone, for example, a medical person, might send an image to a colleague, perhaps to get his or her opinion, or to educate a student about something, and maybe the person did it without consent?  Maybe they should not.  Maybe it should be a regulatory or an administrative offence, or maybe a civil offence.  Has this even been thought through in this rushed legislation that will pass all Stages today?  Maybe there is a very good answer to the concerns that I have raised, but that is not good enough.  Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; need an opportunity to hear what the Minister has to say to make a freer decision then about whether they want to bring forward an amendment.  I am not going to dignify this pathetic process today by bringing forward amendments when it is quite clearly on green paper.  It is intended that this will be done and dusted.  Our views, as Senators, do not matter.  This is a joke, and yet it is a joke in the context of some really serious and important legislative change which I welcome.  It is a Bill that gathered dust for almost three years and then, suddenly, because there is publicity in the media and controversy, it is all happening at once.  This is the wrong way to do it.</p> <p>There was no mention in the D&aacute;il, for example, that in the United Kingdom 30% of victims of these incidents are men.  That is an important point.  This is legislation about protecting women and men, and yet there was no talk about the UK experience.</p> <p>There is also the question of what would happen where a person accesses images that were taken originally with the person's consent and put up on a website, perhaps for the purposes of making money, and then somebody - perhaps an immature young person - right-clicks and shares that information.  Is that person to be convicted of a crime under this legislation?  I think the answer to that is "Yes", but if it is to be a crime to share, for example, legal pornography that has been accessed, should it also be an offence to put it up in the first place?  Should it be an offence to put it up for purchase, because I get the impress, and I am being advised, that one of the reasons this proviso is in here is that some of those most vocal about their images being shared online on the Discord platform had uploaded their own intimate images to a subscription website and their complaint was that they had not been paid?  Are we shoring up a section of the pornography industry here by the way we are doing this?  I do not like any of this stuff.  I support protective laws.  I supported the criminalisation of the users and the purchasers of sex, and others followed my on that issue over the past decade and now it is the law, but perhaps it follows from that that we need to criminalise the sale of such images, particularly when we consider its link to prostitution and, indeed, the trafficking industries.  There is no possible chance to tease these issues through here today.</p> <p>I favour laws that will protect people in this area.  I would not oppose this legislation but I suspect it is very flawed.  I favour education about consent, and the more of that the better, but there is a cultural problem in our society and politicals are trying to address it by creating more and more laws and talking more and more about the need to educate people about consent.  That is all good and well, but it is not going to be enough.  It will not protect people against harm because there needs to be a conversation about how we treat each other as human beings.  It enters into the domain of morals and values, and if we lack the courage to have that conversation none of these laws will protect our society.</p></speech>

As many Senators here have, I commend Ms Jackie Fox for her relentless campaign, not only on getting this law passed but also to tackle the scourge of online bullying.  I also think of, and commend, the other parents who have lost their children due to suicide because of online bullying.  I can only image their pain and anguish when they tried to get legal recourse by going to the Garda to try and get something done to stop the relentless bullying that their children were experiencing and they could not.  I am thinking of the parents who are, possibly right now, watching their children suffer.  No doubt this online bullying is continuing to happen and it is having devastating results.</p> <p>Like Senator Craughwell, I and many other Senators here stood outside the gates of Leinster House and listened to Ms Fox and other parents talk about their children who had been driven to suicide from bullying.  I think of those children who are not here with us anymore and hope that when this law goes through there is a better outcome.</p> <p>There has been reference in here to consent and the need to get explicit consent.  I agree that we have to tackle this area before we even ever have to get to the legal stage.  I have talked a lot about my time in the student movement and how, by the time people get to third level, it is too late to be talking about consent.  Not everyone goes on to third level.  We have also got an even bigger divide there around talking about consent.  We need education around having positive healthy consensual relationships with other people, how to give consent and how to receive consent.  We talk about how we can be very awkward and that we do not like to say it as it is too awkward but sometimes we need to give people the explicit language to say, "I consent to this", "Yes, you can do that", "Yes, I want to do this", "Yes, that is something that I enjoy and I would like to do that again."  We need to teach people how to say that.  That is a long time coming.  It is an awkward conversation, perhaps, for parents to have, but we need to have that.  I want people to be able to have healthy sexual relationships with their partners and we need to get to grips with that.  It is too late at third level to be talking about that, although, of course, we will keep doing so.</p> <p>It is not the fault of the person whose photos others have shared.  If the person consents to an intimate image to be shared between two consenting adults, the only person who is at fault for sharing that image is the person who has done so without the other's consent.  I believe those people when they say that they did not consent to that to be shared widely and I want them to know that there are Senators who believe them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I have spoken about this briefly before, that I am someone who has suffered sexual violence.  I do not talk about it too often.  It does not define me.  When I see online anonymous accounts calling for that to happen to me again, which has happened, it is not pleasant.  I thank Senator Gallagher for referencing the interview yesterday where I spoke of my experience of people calling for that to happen to me because I have spoken out against sexual violence and because I have spoken out against image-based sexual assault.  That it happened to me in the first place is never acceptable, but it is even more unacceptable for those people to call for it to happen to me again because I have spoken up.</p><p>I am very lucky that I have an opportunity to speak out where many others cannot.  Senator Doherty said there was probably not one person in here who has not experienced online abuse, and perhaps even concentrated harassment.  Sometimes we are told it is just part of the job and that we just have to toughen up.  I welcome the collective position that has been taken whereby we are saying we do not have to toughen up, that it is not right, and that people have to stop saying this.  It frightens and terrifies me to think of young people having to process some of the most ghastly things online.  I can brush it off and deal with it, but for young people it is very difficult.</p><p>I reiterate the comments on the need for a societal response to this.  I agree with Senator Ruane.  I would prefer to see behavioural change rather than legal sanctions, which should be a last resort.  It is very important to ask why people behave the way they do.  I am not referring just to online abuse.  Why do people perpetuate hate?  Senator Flynn spoke extremely eloquently last night about her own experiences as a Traveller woman, and I suggest that people should watch that interview.  Why do people perpetrate sexual violence, as done to me?  Why do people harass and torment, as is done to Senator Ruane?  We need to challenge and change these behaviours.  The Bill gives an option for legal recourse and penal sanctions and, it is hoped, perhaps some small comfort to those who have been affected.  As I have said, however, there is a wider societal issue that we need to tackle.</p><p>I am very grateful to Deputy Howlin and my Labour Party colleagues for this legislation.  A journalist congratulated me for writing the legislation in 2017 when I was merely in the Union of Students in Ireland, but it was great to be associated with such a thing.  I am very grateful to be associated with helping to bring the legislation forward and, I hope, some comfort to those who have been deeply affected by the issues we talk about today.</p></speech>

I listened to the debate today and last night and the way they spoke on the issues makes me honoured to serve with both of the Senators.  I just wanted to say well done.  My wife, my family and I have also suffered harassment from a person, and we had to go the full way to court on it because of the effect it was having on our young kids and family.  I am delighted to say that it was successful.</p> <p>I commend the Labour Party, Jackie Fox and her family, and the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, on bringing the legislation to this stage.  We have also seen the recent uploading of images of individuals against their will.  It is not acceptable.  As Senator Ward said in the Chamber some weeks ago, we as men need to stand up and say it is not acceptable.  When such images are shared, we as men need to say that it is not good enough and it is not acceptable.</p> <p>Domestic violence does not just take place behind closed doors.  It is now part of our daily lives through our mobile phones, through our laptops and can come in many forms, not just images or verbally.  As our lives change with technology, it is important that we legislate for the new forms of communication, which is what the Bill does.  I welcome the Bill.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Doherty when she speaks about educating our children about posting on social media.  I strongly believe that we need a programme throughout our schools to educate the younger generation on the effects that social media can have.  I firmly believe that Facebook and Twitter should fund this programme.  The taxpayer should not fund it.  I fully call for the companies to fund the programme on the effects of social media to be delivered throughout our entire school system.</p> <p>I look forward to working with Members when the online safety and media regulation Bill comes before the Oireachtas joint committee.  I look forward to having an input and hearing the input of other Members to make sure that the legislation covers all the aspects needed.</p> <p>I fully support the Bill before the House today.  It is important that no other life is lost due to this.  I commend Senators Hoey and Ruane, and I am honoured to serve with them here in the Seanad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-12-18a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020121800002#CC00300"><p>I indicate my complete support for the campaign brought to public attention by Jackie Fox on the part of her daughter, Nicole.  I commend Deputy Howlin and his colleagues in the Labour Party on introducing legislation to deal with this matter.</p><p>What Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen has just said is true.  We should not be in a position that we are pushing this through without adequate time to fine-tune it or work out what the small detail actually means.  It is a pity that three years after Deputy Howlin introduced this as a Private Member's Bill in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, we find ourselves, as described here, having to choose between coming back in Christmas week or dealing properly with the amendments to this legislation, which many have submitted.  It is not befitting of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, as a revising Chamber, to be cornered in this way.  I fully accept the moral force of getting something done within three years of its introduction and I do not need to be lectured on that by anybody, but I also feel that we should never put ourselves in the position that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann passes something yesterday and it is plonked on our table today, with myriad well-intentioned amendments to it put down.  We all know they count for nothing and that any criticism of its text is going to be bulldozed out of the way.  Although it is said, to excuse that, that there will be other opportunities to correct, tweak or improve it, we are still left in the position that this Bill should not be considered in such hurried circumstances.</p><p>I noted that Senator Mullen had problems with sections 2 and 3.  I have a problem with section 4.  If one reads it, section 4 makes it an offence to send by any means any grossly offensive communication to another person, with intent to &quot;cause harm&quot;.  In this context, &quot;harm&quot; includes causing &quot;distress to the other person&quot;.  This means that sending any letter to any person if, objectively, it is likely to cause that person distress - nothing to do with sex or privacy, just distress - is now to be criminalised.  I believe that this is an excessive overreach for what is undoubtedly well-intentioned legislation.  The sending of a letter to somebody with grossly offensive material, which I presume is grossly offensive to the person who receives it as such, for example, sending religious comment to a person of the Islamic faith, is an offence if it causes that person distress.  This is not something we should just lightly enter into.  A judgment was handed down by the Court of Appeal in London recently where the majority said &quot;Freedom only to speak inoffensively is not worth having&quot;, which is an interesting quote.  I wonder if section 4 of this Bill is too widely cast and I ask the Minister of State to contemplate that point.</p><p>Another problem with section 4 is the penalty provided, which is two years' imprisonment.  This is in contrast with seven years provided for in section 2.  One of the consequences of not thinking this through is that the capacity of the Garda to arrest, search, seize property, and interview people they suspect of having committed an offence under section 4 disappears, because under the Criminal Justice Act 1984 and the categorisation of offences, a serious offence is one that carries a five-year penalty.  This is a second point that needs to be brought in.</p><p>The last thing I want to say, and I would love to have said a lot more but I do not want to hog time, is about the fundamental moral hypocrisy of the age as described by Dr. Mary Aiken in <i>The Cyber Effect</i>.  I launched that book, I read it, and it is a great book.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a fundamental moral hypocrisy about an entire generation that values privacy so heavily in one way and then demands blanket anonymity in others.  Why do people not have to stand over their own opinions?  We are not all Wikipedia people.  There are occasions where, if someone wants to bring into the public domain his or her views on an individual, a thought, a process or an entire section of society or if he or she wants to be offensive to their beliefs, he or she should at least have to stand up and name himself or herself.<br/><br/>One of the problems goes back to the Pirate Party in Sweden and the idea that youngsters should be encouraged to steal copyrighted music without remunerating the bands or the composers involved.  It was considered wrong in some sense to make them accountable.  We have a moral vacuum which tries to span an absolute desire for privacy with an absolute desire for anonymity and the two do not work together.  I write articles in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  It always amuses me that the newspaper publishes letters to the editor in which people profoundly disagree or agree with what it prints and their names appear at the bottom.  The same newspaper has online commentary which is done through pseudonyms and I am sorry to say that some of them are Sinn F&eacute;in trolls.</p></speech>

The sharing of intimate images without consent is a serious issue, which warrants legislation and severe penalties.  We need to call it out as a criminal offence and we need to hold those who offend in this way to account.  I am very pleased to join with other Senators and to support Coco's Law today.  I am thinking primarily of Jackie Fox, Dara Quigley's family and all the NGOs that have campaigned on this issue, such as the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Victims Alliance and the National Women's Council of Ireland.  I am glad the Government is supporting this legislation.  It is not ideal to be dealing with this issue in this way, and I certainly bow to the greater legal minds in this Chamber, but I am glad we are dealing with it and we need to get on with the business of doing so because it is important.</p><p>By passing this legislation, we are not going to stop online abuse or harassment and we are not going to bring every bully to heel.  In my life, the bullying and harassment I have experienced has been as much the human face-to-face or behind-your-back type of stuff that goes on in real life as harassment on digital platforms.  It is important that the House and the Government legislate on this issue because we need to set a marker and set the bar.  The law as proposed will call out such activities, state that they are unacceptable, criminalise them, identify penalties and provide anonymity for victims.  It will also set, as standard, the fact that there may have been or was an intimate relationship as an aggravating factor, because that level of betrayal of trust is a real violation.  That is an aggravating factor, be the harassment physical, online, or written.  In this instance we are dealing with harassment on digital platforms, which is important.  This legislation will not be perfect but it is important.</p><p>It is also important that we recognise that this legislation will not fix the problem and that we do not create that false impression.  There is a real job to be done in education.  When we use digital platforms we all have an opportunity to exercise the powers and facilities they give us.  We need to report, block and delete anything that is offensive, not just to us but to each other because we all follow each other and see the trolls.  We should not subscribe to the platforms and digital outlets that encourage clickbait, harassment, hate speech and abuse.  The Internet - and the digital environment - amplifies human behaviour, magnifies and disseminates it in a much broader global way.  When we all participate in the Internet, we should do so in the same way we would if we saw that abuse happening beside us in the street.  In that case, we would intervene and would say &quot;That is not nice, please do not do that in front of me.  Please do not speak to somebody else like that.&quot;  When we do something like that, we are asserting and championing good values in that space.</p><p>I also support the comments of my colleague, Senator Byrne.  We should hold to account any platform that does not operate to a decent moral standard, including Facebook, Twitter or <i>The Journal. </i>Common decency is all any of us are looking for or have a right to expect.  Further legislation will be introduced in respect of that matter, which we also need to tackle.  It is not acceptable that they continue to operate very profitably on the basis of anonymous, abusive and what in many cases will now be criminal contributors.</p></speech>

At around 11 o'clock on the morning of 22 December 2012, I got the phone call about the death of Shane McEntee, our Minister for Justice's dad.  I remember the amount of online abuse he received coming up to that time, which went on over a period of a few months.  I knew the individual who continued to harass Shane McEntee at the time and I rang him asking him to stop.  I rang that individual on multiple occasions and told him that what he was doing was not right, not kind and to please stop.  He did not stop.  On the day of the funeral, Shane McEntee's brother spoke out about that online abuse.  That was back in 2012.  Each and every one of us here today will have been the subject of harassment, harmful communications and related offences.  One can snowball it in any way one likes.</p> <p>For two years I suffered nuisance phone calls.  I received 98 phone calls in one day alone.  For two years I was getting calls and we could not get a prosecution because the person who owned the phone was not the person making the calls.  That is ridiculous.  I have received online abuse and been the subject of threatening behaviour, as have other female politicians.</p></speech>
