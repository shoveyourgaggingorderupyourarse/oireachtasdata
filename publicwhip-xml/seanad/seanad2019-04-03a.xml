Graffiti is a real problem in cities and towns all over the country.  One cannot travel through cities like Dublin, Cork or Galway without seeing the impact of graffiti on the public space.  I am calling on the Minister for Justice and Equality to consider reintroducing the anti-graffiti programme that was in place up until 2009.  Many people refer to graffiti as a mere irritant but I prefer to refer to it as vandalism or criminal damage.  </p> <p>I met an elderly gentleman last Saturday who was trying to clean the gable end of his house for the third time in three months, at great expense.  This gentleman is a pensioner in his early eighties.  He explained that he could no longer climb a ladder to remove the graffiti and that no assistance was available to him.  The anti-graffiti programme that was in place previously funded the removal of graffiti in public spaces and places that could be seen from public spaces.  It supported small business people in removing graffiti from their premises and distributed anti-graffiti kits.  The reintroduction of this programme would be a recognition of the many volunteers who clean their own communities week in and week out.  While there are many Tidy Towns committees that clean up their communities on a weekly basis, they cannot deal with criminal damage to householders' property.  I ask that the Government would consider reintroducing the programme which could be funded in various ways.  It could be co-funded by the Departments of Justice and Equality and Communications, Climate Action and Environment, with matching funding from local government.  We need a programme because volunteers must be recognised.  The financial hardship that householders are suffering when trying to remove graffiti must be acknowledged.  People have pride in their homes but are waking up to find the gable end of their houses destroyed by criminal activity.  The fact that there is no assistance available to them to remedy the situation is unacceptable.  </p> <p>The Minister of State may have been provided with a stock answer by the Department but I ask him to consider the matter and discuss it with his colleagues and the Department.  I ask that some mechanism be provided to assist communities in dealing with the scourge of graffiti which mainly affects urban areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-03a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040300002#A00600"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.</p> <p>The community graffiti reduction programme was introduced in February 2008 and was sponsored at that time by the then Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Pobal managed and delivered the programme on behalf of these Departments and a total of approximately &euro;1 million was spent under the first phase of the scheme.  Due to the declining state of public finances at the time, the programme was formally brought to an end in the middle of 2009.  The programme was separate from, and in addition to, graffiti abatement programmes carried out on an ongoing basis by the local authorities.  </p> <p>As the Senator will no doubt be aware, and as the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has previously advised the Oireachtas, primary responsibility for management and enforcement responses to litter pollution, including the defacement of structures by writing or other marks, lies with local authorities under the Litter Pollution Act 1997.  The Act provides significant powers to local authorities to deal with these issues, including on-the-spot fines.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions to deal with graffiti, taking account of local circumstances and competing priorities.</p> <p>In terms of the justice sector generally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has advised that it tasks local community policing units with compiling information which might identify individuals associated with various graffiti incidents.  The Criminal Damage Act 1991 is the legal framework utilised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to police anti-social behaviour of this nature and alleged offenders are processed in accordance with the provisions of this legislation.  The Probation Service, which falls under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, operates two graffiti removal projects as part of its community service scheme.  One project is based in Dublin and the other is in Cork.  The Probation Service does not have a dedicated graffiti project budget.</p> <p>While the Minister for Justice and Equality is supportive of any measures to remove graffiti from our local areas, he regrets to advise the House that his Department has no plans to reintroduce the community graffiti reduction programme.  The issue is not a primary function of the Department and while the public finances are clearly in a better position than ten years ago, there are other competing pressing demands on the resources available for allocation by the Department.</p> <p>I encourage the Senator to approach the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to see if his Department would provide additional funding for a pilot scheme under the aforementioned anti-graffiti awareness grant scheme administered by the local authorities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paul Kehoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I understand from where the Senator is coming and the frustration of a lot of people, but it is not just in Dublin that there is an issue with graffiti.

Mr. Peter Horgan is a local election candidate in Cork.  Yesterday he raised the issue of graffiti in Cork.  It is what I call criminal damage done to householders.  We are all too aware of it in our cities and town.  Deputy Kehoe is Minister of State in the Department of the Taoiseach and  I ask him to take one thing from the debate on my Commencement matter.  I ask him to reconsider whether we can have a Government-led programme within the Department of the Taoiseach.  I ask him to consult the relevant Departments to see whether a programme could be brought forward to alleviate the problem in every city and town.  The programme that was in place was discontinued because of the financial crash, but there is now an opportunity for the State to show leadership to the local authorities in reducing the size of the problem.  The only thing I ask the Minister of State is to reconsider and talk about the issue within his Department and with the Taoiseach to see if we could have even a small fund of, say, &euro;5 million that would be matched by local government to deal with graffiti.  I am not asking him to give me a "Yes" or a "No" answer; rather, I am asking him to reconsider the matter and consult the Taoiseach and revelevant Departments to see if we could take a step towards acknowledging the volunteers who try to clean up their local community.  It would be a good day's work if he were to give me an undertaking that he will reconsider the matter to see whether central government could assist local government in tackling the scourge of graffiti.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-03a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040300002#B00300"><p>I reiterate that the removal of graffiti is supported by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  As I outlined, agencies of the Department of Justice and Equality continue to play a role in tackling the problem.  However, primary responsibility for the removal of graffiti lies with other statutory bodies.  I understand the Senator's frustration.  He mentioned that I should approach the Department of the Taoiseach.  I encourage him to go to the Minister responsible for local government and the environment because it is through that Department that the issue should be tackled.  The Department of Justice and Equality can prevent the problem of graffiti from happening through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but the issue of the removal of graffiti should be pursued through the local authorities.  The Senator should, therefore, approach the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, or his Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, who has responsibility for local government to see what can be done to deal with the problem.  It is not the statutory function of the Department of Justice and Equality.  While clearly the public finances are in a better position than they were ten years ago, I understand there are other competing and pressing demands within the Department of Justice and Equality.  I encourage the Senator to raise the matter with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, given that he has statutory responsibiliy for the local authorities.  I personally believe the anti-graffiti scheme should be reintroduced but through a different Department.  It would be more appropriate, therefore, for the Senator to ask the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to reintroduce it.</p></speech>

I thank her for being here and appreciate her attendance at this very busy time.  I am glad that she has come to take my Commencement matter.</p> <p>Let me outline what moved me to ask this question again.  I have raised it consistently since I entered the House.  I am sure the Minister of State and her officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been alert to the mobilisation on social media on the concerns of Irish citizens living in the North.  What we are seeing play out is Brexit exposing not just the negativity but also the anomalies and issues that need to be addressed for Irish citizens resident in the North.  The reality is as follows.  </p> <p>As we all know, the Good Friday Agreement is an internationally binding agreement between two sovereign states.  It confers, as a birth right, both Irish citizenship and British citizenship or everyone born in the North.  That assertion has never been codified in British law and to the extent that is necessary in domestic law in this State.  All of the anomalies have come into sharper exposure as a result of Brexit.  It is obvious that people are concerned and will mobilise.  They are offended, hurt and worried as a result of our failure to deal, both legislatively and legally, with this firm commitment that was made 21 years ago.  Given the threats posed by Brexit and in a climate in which we have already lost our right to vote in European elections and to representation in EU institutions, as well as access to various EU institutions such as the European Court of Justice, it leaves people not only deeply exposed and worried but also creates a tiered level of citizenship.  It creates inequality and goes against the core and heart of the Good Friday Agreement because we will have citizens resident on these islands who will have at various levels rights and entitlements and access to European mechanisms and institutions.  </p> <p>That is an important point to make and I will listen intently to what the Minister of State has to say because it is crunch time and the Government must address these issues.  The UK Minister of State for Immigration, Ms Caroline Nokes, brazenly stated, in contradiction of the Good Friday Agreement, that as a matter of law everyone born in the North was a British citizen.  Not only does her comment run contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, it also runs contrary to it in word and letter.  I ask colleagues to take one minute to think about how that makes people feel.  We do not derive our Irishness from our passport or even the Good Friday Agreement but from being Irish.  After centuries of conflict the Good Friday Agreement indicated to the world, on a legal basis, that we had created a path out of conflict and that people's identity, allegiances and rights would all be respected.  It is now clear in the already calamitous environment created by Brexit that these important core aspects of the Good Friday Agreement are not being lived up to or fulfilled.  I do not think we will hear the end of the matter until it is resolved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-03a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040300002#B00600"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  He is right that it has been raised with me directly and indirectly via social media and otherwise.  It has also been raised with the Minister.</p> <p>Ensuring both the citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are upheld in all relevant areas is vitally important.  It is something on which the Government and I are continuing to engage intensively.  The Government has noted the update on UK immigration rules announced on 7 March, as the Senator outlined, to give effect to the UK settled status scheme and the letter from the UK Minister of State for Immigration, Ms Caroline Nokes, MP, on 5 February.  We are all fully aware, including the Government, of the concerns the statements made raise for Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland, particularly, as the Senator outlined, given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.  It is important to be clear that the statements in no way change the current position - the EU citizenship of Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland will continue in all circumstances.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As EU citizens, they will continue to enjoy the right to live and work throughout the European Union, as well as the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality.  It is very important that we return to the words of the Good Friday Agreement.  It "recognises the birth right of all of the people of Northern Ireland to identify and be accepted as Irish or British or both, as they may so choose".  Accordingly, it is confirmed in the agreement "that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments".  </p><p>Last December the T&aacute;naiste wrote to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to raise the case of Ms Emma DeSouza, the concerns related to the identity and citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and suggest a review of the issues and questions which have been raised not just in recent weeks but for some time, as the Senator outlined.  Following this engagement, the Government noted and welcomed the fact that the Prime Minister had acknowledged in her recent speech in Belfast on 5 February that there had been serious concerns raised about how UK immigration rules treated citizens exercising their right under the Good Friday Agreement to be Irish.  The British Prime Minister affirmed that "the birth right to identify and be accepted as British, Irish or both" and the right to hold both British and Irish citizenship were absolutely central to the agreement.  She said she had asked the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to urgently review the issues surrounding citizenship to deliver a long-term solution consistent with the letter and the spirit of the agreement.  They were welcome commitments and acknowledgements by the Prime Minister.  The Government and our colleagues in the North are now actively seeking the outcome of the review announced by the Prime Minister in February.</p><p>There is clearly a need for the UK Government to provide an assurance for everyone living in Northern Ireland that the citizenship and identity provisions in the Good Friday Agreement are being fully taken account of in all policy areas, regardless of the United Kingdom's approach to exiting the European Union.  The Government also fully recognises the importance of access to EU programmes for Irish citizens and, therefore, EU citizens living in Northern Ireland.  We are continuing to work to find ways by which they can be protected, consistent with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  I repeat that this is irrespective of the approach being taken by the United Kingdom to exiting the European Union and whether we have a deal.  Obviously, we would prefer to have a deal scenario.  The protocol expressly confirms that Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland "will continue to enjoy, exercise and have access to rights, opportunities and benefits" that come with EU citizenship.  Access to specific programmes is to be addressed during the period of transition and in the overall context of the future relationship.</p><p>We are ready for a no-deal exit by the United Kingdom and have actively been exploring ways by which we can protect continued access to EU entitlements for Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland, wherever possible.  In any scenario the Government, the T&aacute;naiste and I will continue to engage with the UK Government to ensure the important citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement will be upheld in all relevant policy areas.</p></speech>

While I understand and appreciate this is a complex issue and a trying time for the Government, this is really high-wire stuff.  With the greatest of respect, the answer the Minister of State has given me is, more or less, the one I have been hearing for the past two years about this process.  What we are not yet seeing is a resolution of the issue.  While I fully understand and appreciate that the main responsibility for dealing with it rests with the British Government, inside our passports, it is stated the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible for us.  People need to hear these words, but they also need to see them being translated into action by the Government.  There must be pressure from this state and our colleagues in the European Union.  The British Government must be told that it will be in breach of the Good Friday Agreement if it does not codify in law what is expressed within it.  Potentially, this issue affects 1.8 million people.  It will not affect everyone as there are those who are content with their British citizenship and identity in the North.  Fair play to them; I fully support and respect that right.  However, an increasing number in the North, rightly and understandably, are demanding that their rights under the Good Friday Agreement be asserted and legislated for.</p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned the speech made by the British Prime Minister on 5 February in which she outlined a review of these issues.  We have heard no more about it since.  Actually, what we have heard is the statement made by Ms Caroline Nokes, MP, on 7 March, that, as a matter of law, that we are all British.  From 5 February to 7 March, that was the British Government's approach.  We need to ensure we will up our game and that citizens, particularly those living in the North and those who will be affected the most, will see action by the Government because the situation is so precarious.  I know that the Minister of State appreciates and understands this, but we need to start to see those words being translated into legal, actionable and tangible works.</p></speech>

Many are concerned by statments made more recently since the Prime Minister's speech.  I reaffirm the commitment made by her that the birth right to identity and to be accepted as British, Irish or both, and the right to hold both British and Irish citizenship are absolutely central to the Good Friday Agreement.  We absolutely intend to ensure the Prime Minister will uphold that commitment.  What we would like to see is the outcome of the review which was announced and for which the T&aacute;naiste has specifically asked.  Whether it is in the overall negotiations or in our engagement with our EU and UK colleagues, we are stressing that in any scenario, whether it be a deal or a no-deal scenario -  we are working towards having a deal in order that we can work towards having a future relationship - there must be a transition period to work out some of the more complex issues such as the rights of and access for citizens of Northern Ireland if they choose and wish to exercise them.  In any scenario in the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union the obligations and commitments of the Irish and UK Governments under the Good Friday Agreement must remain.

The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was also unable to come to take this matter.  It is a matter of life and death for some.  The specific issue I raised last year has not been advanced by either Minister.  I thank Mr. Mark Murphy of the Irish Kidney Association for coming to listen to the response that will be given by the Department of Health, if not the Minister.</p> <p>On 13 March I asked for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House in order that we could find out why he had not signed the statutory instrument to allow the HSE access to the driving licence registry to see the names of people who had indicated on their driving licence that they would like to be an organ donor.  He cited two reasons on that occasion, one of which was related to the issue of data protection under EU law, while the other was Brexit.  He was too busy in dealing with it.  In May 2018 we informed him that, according to research conducted by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, he was able to share the data.  The Schedule to the legislation could be amended to allow the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, under section 63 of the Finance Act, to make a regulation to make the database available.  When the Minister, Deputy Ross, told us that he was not able to share the information because of EU data protection law, he was not aware that the previous Minister, Deputy Donohoe, had shared data in the driving licence registry with everybody, from car manufacturers to the Health and Safety Authority, the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, eFlow, a private company, the Road Safety Authority, the National Transport Authority, the National Consumer Agency and the local authorities.  People approved by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, commercial services and the office of the provost marshal of the military police have access to it.  Tribunals of inquiry also have access to it, as do the Office of Official Assignees in Bankruptcy and the Courts Service, yet the HSE and the national transplant authority do not.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We asked the Minister to come in again and he has not shown up today but he replied on 22 March that it is not a data protection issue and the issue is the Department of Health has not requested that the national organ transplantation unit have access to information from the driver's licence registry.  A year ago, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, said that he would ask the HSE to give me its views and see if progress can be made in a constructive way.  Has the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport engaged with the HSE on this issue and when will he be asked to sign the statutory instrument that will allow the HSE to have access to the drivers licence registry so that people will know if their loved ones want to be an organ donor?</p><p>It should be borne in mind that figures supplied by the Irish Kidney Association to me show that when asked by a professional in organ co-ordination and transplantation if they would consider donating their loved one's organs, the figure internationally is approximately 52%.

The only place we currently have a registry is in National Driver Licence Service.  I have outlined all of the other organisations that have access to this registry.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is clearly blaming the Minister for Health and his Department by saying that they quite simply have not asked for this information.</p><p>Will the Department of Health ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport for this information in order that it will be available to healthcare professionals, organ donor co-ordinators and the families of the donors so that they can make an informed decision when considering to donate organs?</p></speech>

The improvement in the quality of life for organ recipients and their families cannot be overstated.  We have a duty to do everything we can to ensure that as many people as possible benefit from organ donation.  Work is continuing to finalise the general scheme of a Human Tissue Bill and to deliver on the commitment in the programme for Government to provide for a soft opt-out system of consent for organ donation and an associated register.</p> <p>The aim is to make organ donation the norm in Ireland in situations where the opportunity arises.  Under the soft opt-out system, consent will be deemed, unless the person has, while alive, registered their wish not to become an organ donor after death. However, it is proposed that even though consent is deemed, the next-of-kin will always be consulted prior to removing any organ.  If the next-of-kin objects to the organ donation, the donation will not proceed.  The best way to ensure that a person's wish to become an organ donor is realised is to have a conversation with one's family and to make one's wishes clearly known to them.  </p> <p>The proposed opt-out register for organ donation will create a clear and easily communicable choice to individuals to either opt-out of deceased organ donation entirely, or to allow deemed consent to apply.  Signing up to the opt-out register will be a definitive expression of the person&rsquo;s wish not to become an organ donor after death.</p> <p>The Senator&rsquo;s proposal to share code 115 on a driver&rsquo;s licence in respect of organ donation with the HSE's Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland would not guarantee that the person&rsquo;s wish to become an organ donor would be carried out.  This is also the situation in regard to organ donor cards.  The decision to donate organs in the case of a deceased person rests with the next of kin.  Health service personnel will not proceed to transplant organs without the permission of family members, irrespective of whether the deceased person carried an organ donor card or had ticked code 115 on their driving licence.</p> <p>Furthermore, due to the need for medical practitioners to be informed about the medical history of the potential donor to ensure the safety of the recipient, the co-operation of the family will always be required as part of a safe organ donation process.  An opt-out register will make organ donation the clear default option, and signal to citizens the move towards organ donation being the norm.  The general scheme of a human tissue Bill is being finalised at present and will be submitted to Government shortly.</p></speech>

That information is available in the Government system.  This will increase organ donor rates from 52% to 92% if the family are informed that their loved one wants to be an organ donor.  The Government is saying it will not do this and make this information available to families, the health services or doctors and nurses so that families can be assisted in making one of the most traumatic decisions that anyone can ever make.  When people sign up for a driver's licence and indicate that they want to be an organ donor, they want to share that information.</p> <p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is saying that it is available to the HSE if it asks.  What the HSE, the Department of Health, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State are saying is that they do not want this information to be available to the doctors, nurses and the families.</p> <p>As I stated earlier, this is not the worst reply I have ever heard in this House but it is pretty close.  People are dying as they await organ transplants.  It is costing the State hundreds of millions of euro in dialysis and so on with people waiting in the system and taking up beds.  That is not the reason we should do it; the reason we should do it is it would save lives.  If making that information available saved one life, would it not be worth doing?  Yet the Department of Health is saying that it does not want this. </p></speech>

We welcome the Senator's support for our efforts to increase the rate of deceased organ donation.  Deceased organ donation, however, cannot proceed without the support of next of kin, as I outlined in my previous contribution, even in circumstances where the deceased person had an organ donor card or had indicated his or her wish to be an organ donor on his or her driver's licence.  The Minister's proposals to introduce a soft opt-out system of consent for deceased organ donation are one of a number of measures being taken to increase transplant rates.  The Department continues to work with HSE's Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland, intensive care units, ICUs, and the transplant hotels, which are Beaumont, the Mater and St. Vincent's hospitals, in building upon the achievements of recent years.</p> <p>Improvements to our organ procurement service will continue to be achieved through improved infrastructure in ICUs, a more robust organ retrieval service, and through transplant centres achieving high conversion rates from opportunities that are presented.  The legislation will be accompanied by a publicity campaign which will aim to ensure that individuals understand the opt-out system and to encourage individuals to have the conversation and make their wishes on organ donation known to their next of kin and to other family members.</p> <p>Finally, I encourage everybody to consider becoming an organ donor and to make their loved ones aware of their intention in this regard.</p></speech>

I still hope there will not be a Brexit but, hopefully, at least there may be a softer Brexit than might otherwise have been anticipated by the hard Brexiteers.  We need to be cognisant of the fact that it is only next week, next Thursday, it all may go wrong.  If it does not, the European Council will be meeting this day next week, 10 April, so time is really pushing on.  In fairness, the Government probably needs to let us know there are some plans in place just in case there is a no-deal.  I know people do not want to scaremonger and that we do not want a hard border but failing to plan is not necessarily the greatest of strategies either.</p> <p>I want to raise a few other points on which we might need a debate at some point.   A big row broke out about school patronage in recent days.  We know there is a demand for non-denominational or Educate Together type schools, which I know are not exactly the same but, equally, the process of managing the transition of any school, which is currently a faith-based school, into a non-denominational or interdenominational school needs to be handled very sensitively.  The parents of the pupils attending such schools will have sent them there with an expectation of a particular type of education.</p></speech>

Clearly, 90% plus of primary schools are in the patronage of Catholic schools, albeit the parents of many of the pupils in those schools would not necessarily regard them as being Catholics or certainly practising Catholics.  The transition needs to be managed very carefully in terms of the way it is processed, whether it be that the junior infants come in under a different ethos and are taken by the existing teachers or new teachers come in to take the junior infants and other teachers transition to other schools.  That is a debate that will need to happen.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People sent their children there with the expectation of faith formation and with the expectation of Christmas and Easter holidays, St. Brigid's Day and St. Patrick's Day and other religious types of festivals.

It is an important point and we should have the new Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, to the Chamber to discuss that topic sooner rather than later.</p><p>I attended the recent T.K. Whitaker lecture at the Central Bank on the future of money and cash payments and so on.  I believe the ATM taken out of a wall last night in the Border region was the 11th in recent times.  Four were taken in the Republic of Ireland and seven in Northern Ireland in the past year.  I am not saying that we should give in to these kind of people but we need to look at how we deal with cash and with plastic money over time.  We need to look at how we bring people who are not very comfortable with banks, for lots of obvious reasons, into a system of using debit cards and being able to handle and manage plastic transactions.  We may not like banks but they are required in a modern economy.  Payment systems are certainly required.  The idea of everybody collecting their pension in cash-----</p></speech>

The point is that people can use debit cards and plastic to tap and they do not have to physically get cash out from the ATM in the wall anymore.  We need to have a look at the future of money, and equally at ATM security in the shorter run.</p><p>If the Cathaoirleach will indulge me I have one more brief point.  An important report has been published in<i>The Economic and Social Review</i>on the rent trap that is swallowing half of the working income of some couples.  Childcare costs are up to one fifth of their costs and people are not able to save for deposits.  Home ownership is something that many people in this country have aspired to and we really need to look at how people are being trapped in that window where they can barely survive in rental accommodation and are not able to save for a deposit.  I thank the Leader and I would appreciate a debate on this issue in the future.</p></speech>

I am concerned that President Macron might be putting the arm on the Irish and might link French "solidarity" with concessions on taxation.  I would like an assurance that this is not happening and has not been attempted.  President Macron is being very aggressive about a no-deal Brexit and all the rest of it.  He has been laying down very hard lines for the British withdrawal process.

I am sure that the student accommodation proliferation is good for those students who can afford it and it is good for Ireland as an international education hub, but it is tax driven.  It is strange that we have all of those cranes, with each crane probably representing a couple of hundred building workers working on those projects, and yet we are not making significant progress on housing for people in the city centre.

The land was for social and affordable housing but the lands have lain empty for 14 years.  Now there is a row between that council and the Land Development Agency.  Somebody needs to get people to talk or to crack heads together.  If that is the record - 14 years lying vacant - and now there is a row about who should develop them, then we have a real problem on our hands.</p> <p>In today's newspapers there is an account of a F&aacute;ilte Ireland spokesperson saying that we need a 1,000 bed hotel in Dublin for conferences, and that we are missing out because the city does not have a mega hotel of that kind.

It means that some farmers received multiples more per hectare than others.  There are still farmers in Ireland receiving as little as &euro;150 per hectare in basic payment, while others are getting right up to &euro;700 per hectare.  This vote means that the disparity will be lessened and calls for full convergence of payments by 2026.  There is a long way to go towards full convergence and full equality, but this is a start and will benefit those on the lowest payments.  For some people this could be the difference between surviving as farmers or not.</p> <p>The only way to sustain family farms is for them to have a decent basic payment.  Every farmer should be brought up to the national average basic payment which is &euro;250 per hectare.  A Sinn F&eacute;in MEP, Matt Carthy, has supported an upper limit of &euro;60,000 for basic payments, with farmers having the option of topping up their payments through participation in environmental schemes.  This would allow for front-loaded payments that would offer additional support proportionally for smaller and medium sized farms.  It is absolutely vital that there is a separate environmental scheme available, such as GLAS, in the next round of the CAP.  Any attempts to incorporate GLAS into the basic payment will lead to a severe reduction in income for farmers and must be resisted.  In this week's vote, Fine Gael's political group significantly weakened this ambition so that the direct payments will be capped at &euro;100,000, with loopholes that will allow payments even above this limit.</p></speech>

It is vital that Ireland is represented by progressive MEPs who will demand fairness and equality for our farmers.  The challenge now rests with the Government to protect the family farm and the agricultural sector, as more autonomy will be given to member states in the application of the new CAP.</p> <p>This is a real opportunity for Ireland to right the wrongs of the past and to right the wrongs of the reference years and the entitlements that had been given that led to such inequalities for farmers, and especially for farmers in the west of Ireland and on marginalised land.</p></speech>

As far as I know, it was pretty mild but hazing is a very noxious practice.  An attempt is now being made to suppress the college newspaper, <i>The University Times</i>, which published a report on same.  It is shocking that a university body would try to stamp on freedom of expression in this way.  Although I am a Knight of the Campanile myself, I strongly resist these motions and hope they will not take place.</p><p>The second matter I wish to raise is a rather sad one.  I had a communication today from a man who seems to be a remarkable and good father to his two children, aged three and five.  They were both perfectly normal, well developing children until the age of two.  Suddenly they started to deteriorate and it turns out that they have a very rare disease called metachromatic leukodystrophy.  They are both in a difficult situation but one has had treatment and may be stabilised.  In Ireland we only test for eight rare disorders as opposed to the 35 recommended by the American Food and Drug Administration, FDA.  In one year, the Italians have increased the number of rare conditions tested for from four to 40.  This is an area in which we need to improve.  We must align ourselves with the test programmes being conducted in Italy.  We must increase the number of conditions for which we test because it is often significantly cheaper to test and treat rather than waiting until a chronic situation develops.  I appeal to the Government to move in this direction and to increase to 40 the number of disorders for which we test and treat.  That is the compassionate response.  The father to whom I referred talked with so much passion about the fact that had this test been done and had his children been diagnosed early, they would now be in a much better condition.  Although his situation is tragic, he felt the need to speak out on behalf of other parents to prevent them from being involved in a similar horrible situation.</p></speech>

We all received the email to which Senator Norris referred and anyone who read it could not fail to be moved by the sentiments contained therein.  Time is of the essence and it is very important that children are tested.  The second child has been stabilised because he was tested earlier.  It is a worthwhile issue for the Minister to consider.</p> <p>I wish to discuss disability services in this country.  I live in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 8 where there are serious budget issues in the context of disability services.  I am trying to fight for a number of people at the moment, including a patient in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire who is about to be discharged.  If a service is not put in place for him, he will end up in Tullamore general hospital.  I do not like the term "bed blocker" but that is exactly what he will be if he does not get the service he needs.  An organisation is willing to put a service in place and has prepared a business plan for that but there is no funding available.  In another case, a lady needs a house.  A house is available and rent is being paid on it but there is no funding available for staff.  Will the Leader invite the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, to come to the House to discuss disability services in general and those in CHO 8 in particular?</p></speech>

I praise the manner in which the Prime Minister of that country, Ms Jacinda Ardern, handled the aftermath of the Christchurch mass shooting.  I know that other Senators have spoken about this recently but events could easily have been mismanaged by someone with a lot less tact or compassion.  Given that my sister lives in New Zealand, I am glad that the Prime Minister managed the crisis so gracefully and instigated change so swiftly.  She changed the gun laws in that country within six days of the atrocity.  We have a lot to learn from that.  I ask that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges would consider inviting Ms Ardern to address the Houses of the Oireachtas because we have a lot to learn from her.</p> <p>I wish to make brief mention of the coastguard service.  Last year my party colleague Deputy Robert Troy introduced a Bill which would establish an Irish coastguard authority and designate said body as the principal response agency to engage in the management and co-ordination of responses to major emergency events within the State.  The Bill would create a statutory Irish coastguard authority, and in doing so, acknowledge the stellar work the coastguard already does and ensure that it would continue to be able to do so.  Since the introduction of that Bill, the coastguard has banned volunteers from using blue lights and sirens on vehicles while travelling to incidents.  Clearly this situation needs to be rectified and proper training for volunteers provided.  Staff and volunteers were informed that drivers are no longer permitted to use blue lights and sirens while driving on public roads but can use them when parked, which seems ludicrous.  This undermines the valuable role of the coastguard.  A second-rate emergency response service is not in the public interest.  A plan must be put in place immediately to roll out emergency driver training for coastguard volunteers to restore their full use of emergency lights and sirens.  Will the Leader consider organising a debate in the House on this issue and on the emergency services more generally?</p></speech>

There was much contention surrounding the legislation, much discussion and a lot of concern among those stakeholders directly affected.  Their concerns and fears are ones for which I have both understanding and great sympathy.  Their fears for the future of their businesses, the viability of the industry and the welfare of fishermen and their families are genuine and real.  However, the Bill is not about an added threat.  It is about fairness and, most of all, about reciprocal arrangements.  It is about ensuring an environment that is conducive to a shared future for the northern and southern fishing fleets.</p> <p>I had a conversation on Monday morning last with Mr. Alan McCulla, the CEO of Sea Source in Kilkeel.  Sea Source is a fishermen's co-operative and is a member of the Anglo North Irish Fish Producers Organisation, ANIFPO.  While Mr. McCulla welcomed the progression of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, he made a number of points which deserve mention in this House.  He first made the point that he was disappointed that the trigger for action was the impounding of two Northern Irish vessels in Dundalk Bay.  He said that it was a pity that it took this highly visible demonstration to mobilise action.  He spoke to me from his office at the harbour in Kilkeel where he could see a significant number of Irish-registered fishing vessels.  Those vessels presented no threat to or issue for him.  He expressed concern about comments made last week that Northern Ireland vessels were sailing under flags of convenience.  He said that there is an argument to be made that, in some quarters, this was a question of people in glass houses throwing stones.  Mr. McCulla reassured me that any notion of an armada of fishing vessels heading into Irish waters was ridiculous.  The suggestion that these vessels would detrimentally impact the industry, environment, ecology or economy in any way was unfounded and the contrary was the case.  Mr. McCulla made the point that the northern and southern fishing industries needed to work better together.  He argued that a stronger working relationship would support and safeguard the entire fleet, wherever that may be on the island.  He spoke about ensuring a sustainable, profitable and viable industry for all.  Even though the incident in Dundalk Bay appeared to have political undertones, it was dealt with swiftly and the subsequent actions by the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government must be commended.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ian Marshall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2486"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2486&amp;amp;pid=IanMarshall&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Mr. McCulla felt strongly that in light of the current debate, it would be useful to propose that the Government should initiate a joint discussion forum to further these relationships, build bridges and ensure that we have a strong, resilient, all-island industry, ultimately avoiding a similar contentious incident happening in future.</p></speech>

It has great plans and I compliment the CEO, Jim Meade, for the wonderful presentation.  There will be an investment of approximately &euro;2 billion in Irish Rail over the next years and it wants the Government to bring forward some of that investment, which would make sense.  He informed us that all of the hybrid trains that are currently used will be used on the long services, such as from Cork, Galway, Sligo, Westport and Ballina.  He said that the new trains which are being purchased will all be electric and will be used on shorter routes, such as to Maynooth, Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and such.  This makes sense and it is a fabulous plan.  I ask the Leader for a debate on Irish Rail's plans.  I put it to Mr. Meade that we need more people working in customer service on trains and platforms.  Quite a number of people use wheelchairs and such, and they are at a disadvantage when large numbers of passengers use the service.  There are quite a number of complaints.  He is willing to address many of those issues.  Some of the train stations will become ticket-only and no staff will work on those platforms.  I ask for more investment in this area by Irish Rail and for better customer service on trains and platforms.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on Irish Rail's plans.</p></speech>

This is a new national record.  I will not repeat all the points I made last week again but ask for an urgent debate as conditions continue to worsen weekly.</p> <p>I raise the issue of school patronage.  It will not surprise the Leader to know that I have a different take on it to the conservative stance taken by my colleague, Senator Horkan, from Fianna F&aacute;il.  St. Sylvester's infant school in Malahide has become the third Catholic school in north Dublin to write to parents, warning them not to vote to change from a Catholic school to a secular school.  These letters, which were ordered by the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, contain a number of unsubstantiated claims, such as: stating that the standard of education will drop; teachers' contracts will be under threat; there will no longer be school uniforms; children's safety will be compromised on school tours; and grandparents will no longer be allowed to be celebrated.  It is utter nonsense.  These letters represent nothing more than scaremongering tactics by a powerful vested interest.</p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills should demand an explanation from each of the three schools and from the archdiocese.  It is unacceptable that such an important consultation process is being manipulated and influenced by a body with a powerful ideology.  The reality is that in north Dublin, 97% of school places are in schools with a religious ethos.  The Department has discovered through consultation that there is demand in the area to divest patronage and move to a secular model.  We must work towards ending the patronage system completely.  It is time that the State finally took responsibility for running and delivering an education system for all of its citizens through a secular medium, rather than simply outsourcing its responsibility to private patronage bodies.  As a republican, I believe in the separation of church and State.  It is fundamentally wrong to separate children at the age of five on the basis of religion.</p></speech>

He was a very well-known sports journalist.  I met him several times at Cork City matches over the years.  He is an awful loss not only to the sporting world but to Cork's sporting community.  I register my deepest sympathies to his family and the Cork community.  Pat was a lovely, jolly man.  Every time one met him, he had a kind word.  He is an awful loss to us in that part of the world.</p> <p>This week is National Tree Week.  We need to start talking about it.  We published a comprehensive report regarding climate change last week.  We included nearly 40 recommendations in a comprehensive, ten chapter, all-of-Government report, and most parties bought into the concept behind it.  It is important that we acknowledge that this week is a week where we try to promote the planting of trees and people getting involved in that.  The turn of the millennium was 19 years ago.  We put a project in place where we planted a tree for every person in the State.  Perhaps 20 years on, we need to look at another similar project, with the State getting behind a proposal of planting a tree for every person in the State in 2020.  Perhaps the Seanad could lead on this issue.  We could get the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine into the House to have a debate on the proposal to plant a tree for every person in the State.  It would take into consideration so much of what has changed in the world.  Climate change is a significant issue.  Perhaps the State and local authorities need to be the driver for growing trees.  We will have a 12-month period to plan it.  It is sustainable.  The millennium forest is now 19 years old and was a very positive step.  Let us push forward and have another drive to ensure that we can get another 4 million trees planted by the State next year to celebrate our commitment to climate change and what we need to do.</p></speech>

He was a Fianna F&aacute;il candidate in the Gort-Kinvara electoral area.  Our colleague, Senator Boyhan, visited him in hospital quite recently.  He was a wonderful public representative who represented the area for four decades.  His name came up many times over the last years.  I pay deep sympathy to his family on the sad and very sudden death of a great public representative and friend to all of us in the Seanad.</p> <p>The developing situation in Westminster is a very moving subject.  This last stand by Prime Minister May might work, calling on the leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, and the Labour Party, to act in the national interest, as Fianna F&aacute;il is doing in the confidence and supply agreement to ensure that we have a Government here.  The leader of the party gave a commitment because of the Brexit situation.  He was not going to precipitate a general election.  It is a good example to our colleagues in Westminster, to show how a democratic state can operate in a crisis.  It is vital that, on 12 April, Britain exits the European Union in an orderly way.  That is the most that we can hope for at this point.  It will then enter into meaningful negotiations regarding the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, with deep concern about the Border, Republic of Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement.  That is the way forward.  I am hopeful that the national interest will be taken on board.  They can deal politically with the fallout from that.  If the Prime Minister gets that deal signed, sealed and delivered through the House of Commons before 12 April, then it can move on in a positive and orderly manner.  Talking about referendums and such at this point is not practical.  There is a way out.  The Brexiteers and non-Brexiteers may unite in the national interest to return sanity to the House of Commons and agree to this Brexit deal which has been negotiated by the European Union and United Kingdom in good faith and should be ratified by the Westminster Parliament.</p></speech>

It is timely that we would have that debate now.  As Senator Lombard pointed out, last week we launched our climate action report after seven months of hearing witnesses and deliberations.  It will chart our way forward to decarbonise our economy.  A key issue in that is decarbonising transport, and without a doubt, railways have a big part to play in it.  For a considerable period of time, when there was no money in the country owing to our economic situation and our banking situation, which was about a 15-year period, there was no proper investment into railways.  Now, as we are beginning to invest in rolling stock in the lines and in the engines and carriages, we want to make sure that they are investing green, they are being supported in doing so and that it is part of the solution in reducing our carbon emissions.</p> <p>We also need to address other issues with our railways, particularly with journey times, especially into the west and into Mayo so that there would be shorter journey times, more services to make it more practical for people to use and an improvement in capacity because often there is not enough space for passengers on trains.  It is becoming chronic at certain times of the week and that really is not acceptable.  Our investment in railways also ties into our economic growth and development.  I mention the issue of West on Track, which would see a rail line going up pretty much along the western seaboard or charting a path along what we call the Atlantic economic corridor, which is obviously a notion or a proposition.  To back it up we need to see this rail infrastructure which would not just take passenger services but freight services as well.  I would like to see further development of the freight service within Ballina, which is the second largest freight yard in the country.  It needs upgrading and new facilities and it has great potential to take some of our freight off the road.  It is a very interesting topic and it is very timely.  As a priority of business for this House, it is a good opportunity for us to discuss the importance of and the need to invest in our railways in this House in order to see some results from it.</p></speech>

In the media today, both in broadcast and in print, there has been much discussion about the Government's expected announcement today to defer the local property tax for another 12 months.  That is clearly a political decision with political consequences but it defers the real issue that we need to debate in both Houses, namely, how we will fund local government in a reasonable, fair and sustainable way.  It is unacceptable that blocks of people are crippled with the property tax without the capacity to pay, and one of the flaws which everyone agrees on across the Houses, is that the system is unfair and that needs to be put right.  I am advised that there is a report on the desk of the Minister for Finance since November on this local property tax.  It is disappointing that this report has not been fully published but let us not pre-empt the whole day yet and see what comes out of the decision of the Government.</p> <p>I am calling for a debate in this House because realistically, we need to have a full, fair and comprehensive debate on how we will fund local government and services.  Members will remember the great fanfare at the launch of the local property tax.  We were told this was an additional source of funding, not a substitute source of funding for the central funding of local government.  It was marketed on television, radio and leaflets as bringing new community facilities, new swimming pools, new parks and new public amenities and that has not happened.  Chief executives of the 41 local authorities will tell us that the reality was that the central government allocation was dropped and substituted by the take of the local property tax and there is an unfair balance across the country.  I am not suggesting for one moment that local authorities that are weaker and do not have the revenue resources should be crippled either.  They need to be supported by central government but for those who collect and have money, it should be kept locally and spent locally and decisions about that local funding should be made by councillors.  I am calling for a debate on the local property tax.</p> <p>I would like to be associated with my colleague, Senator Leyden, in expressing sympathy for Councillor Michael Fahy.  I knew him well, as everyone did here, including the Cathaoirleach who knew him very well.  He always spoke very highly and fondly of the Cathaoirleach and of the Cathaoirleach's support for him.  He was a character to say the least and local government had many characters.  We will never see his like again.  We will never see men and women who served for 30 and 40 years in local government because they cannot do it and they do not have the support to do it.  That also feeds into this issue of local government reform and support for councillors and people who wish to carry out that noble and honourable profession of being a public representative in a local council.</p></speech>

I agree that we need to have a debate on railways and on the speed of same.  Where I live in Boyle in Roscommon, it takes two and a half hours to get to Dublin.  I had a Commencement matter last week to the effect that if we want to have an agreed Ireland, there must be a one hour train journey between Dublin and Belfast.  It was mentioned at a breakfast in Galway last Saturday by the head of the Galway Chamber of Commerce that we really should be looking at high speed railways between all our major cities, because if one could get on a train in Galway, Sligo or Castlebar and be in Dublin in an hour it would do an awful lot towards getting the economy to the west coast, but that is happening.  Great, exciting things are happening in the west and in the next four or five years that will be seen.  Project Ireland 2040 has been great in that respect.</p> <p>I mentioned President Macron coming here and I said that France will never abandon Ireland or the Irish people.  Tomorrow we have Chancellor Angela Merkel coming to see for herself what the situation is.  We are at one with Europe but Theresa May sitting down with Jeremy Corbyn is good and I hope that we will have a deal without a crash out in the next few days.  As Senator Leyden rightly said, Friday week is the deadline.  Great hurt has been caused by Brexit in the last three years and I hope there will be a good deal.  Whatever happens we will have to repair that hurt in the north, the south, the east and the west.  We can do that as politicians, standing together with our colleagues in the North and in the east.</p></speech>

This is the third ATM to be stolen in the locality in the past three months.  One was stolen in Ballybay prior to that and one was stolen in Kingscourt in County Cavan prior to that.  To my mind, this clearly illustrates that we do not have enough garda&iacute; on patrol to prevent crimes such as this happening in the first place.  It must be considered that in County Monaghan for example, a Border county that straggles three northern counties, namely, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Armagh, there are only two marked patrol cars covering the entire county for most nights during the week.  This crime clearly illustrates that these criminals are brazen enough to drive in with a jeep and a trailer attached with a digger on the back, park up, drive the digger off, remove the ATM and drive off into the dark of night in the direction of the Border, never to be seen again.  If it clearly shows that we do not have enough garda&iacute; to prevent crimes such as this happening in the first place, it also raises the question of whether we have enough garda&iacute; to investigate crimes such as this thereafter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am gravely concerned about this matter, especially when I understand that no overtime is available for the investigation of such crimes in the Border counties.  This matter clearly illustrates that we have a serious problem.  I have preached here for long enough that we are totally exposed in the Border counties and it is time that the Government gave us the resources that we need.</p><p>The banks also need to step up to the plate as they have a responsibility.  I understand that there is no tracking device attached to any of these ATMs.  One would also question why such large amounts of money are lodged overnight in banks in towns like Castleblayney and Ballybay in the first place.  I ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality requests of the banks that they step up to the plate and play their part in security.  Today, the main street of Castleblayney is cordoned off so businesses are suffering because nobody is allowed to enter the town.  There is also an ongoing issue with the market house in Castleblayney and part of the town is cordoned off on an ongoing basis.  We need help in the Border counties.  We need extra resources, especially with Brexit on our doorstep at the moment.  I ask the Government to please keep these matters in consideration going forward.    </p></speech>

It deeply disturbs me the way things are going on.  This woman is in her 60s.  I lost my house in my 30s and while it is possible to recover when one is in one's 30s, it is totally impossible to do so in one's 60s.  The heartbreaking thing behind this story is that this woman has been through several court cases.  There was not a word, letter or telephone call for almost seven years but yesterday, she received a telephone call to say her case would be before the High Court today and she would be out of her home within six months.  She has nowhere to go.  I am mindful of the woman in a film I saw some years ago who had her entire life in a group of bags or a shopping trolley and that was it.  That is all there was.  l asked myself what had gone wrong and there are no simple answers.  The house was repeatedly sold from one lending agency to another.  I assume that by the time the house was eventually purchased by the people who are now justifiably recovering their asset - and I am not for one moment complaining about that - they probably bought it for 10 cent in the euro.  That is the problem.  If somebody said it to me that I could have bought the house for 10 cent in the euro then I would have bought it and would have seen to it that the person was not thrown out on the street.  There are families all over this country who would do the same thing, rather than see somebody they love suffer.  I am totally baffled that we can sit idly by and allow these major multinationals come in here and buy up properties at 10 cent or 20 cent in the euro yet evict Irish citizens.</p> <p>I was president of the Teachers Union of Ireland when we cut the pay of our members by up to 30% and we did so to save this country.  While none of us liked the measure, and people in this House took similar cuts, we did it because the country needed it.  Can we not now in some way take control?  Can we set up a housing agency that will be offered these houses at 10 cent or 20 cent in the euro?  Can we ensure that when somebody is about to be chucked out on the street that the house is sold to that agency, which allows the person to continue to live in the property?  I am talking about a woman in her 60s.  I am sick of listening to calls for debates on homelessness.  I am sick of listening to the Minister for House, Planning and Local Government being lashed verbally.  There is no simple answer.  Can we have a debate that might consider how to deal with deviant mortgages and people who are about to find themselves on the street?  I am heartbroken today for this particular person.  I wish I could go, pick her up, take her in my arms and take her away.  I do not want her to suffer the pain that she is suffering today.  I would do anything to take her pain away.  I respect the right of the bank to seize its property but, good God, I respect the woman's right to live out her life in some sort of peace.</p></speech>

I, too, attended the presentation made by Irish Rail yesterday.  I applaud its plans and what it is Irish Rail is striving to achieve by way of the provision of new electrified rolling stock and improvement in journey times.  As the two Senators have raised, there are important issues regarding passenger comfort, ease of access and so on.  Many smaller stations throughout the country will not be manned in future.  The Irish Rail officials told me yesterday that they hope to provide personnel on trains on all lines to help passengers.  Obviously the personnel will be expected to assist passengers getting on and off at these unmanned stations.  I suggest that the initiative is worked out more properly.  I support the call made by the Senators for a debate as it would be timely in regard to everything that Irish Rail is trying to do and hope to do.</p> <p>I wish to raise another subject matter.  It is very good that the British Prime Minister has at long last - and I suppose it was forced on her really - dropped her red lines and now there is hope of progress being made.  It is good that there is going to be a cross-party approach.  It is the only way they would make progress, seeing that the two parties in the UK had their own difficulties for so long.  I hope that the meeting will bear fruit and that progress will be made in the near future.  </p></speech>

Ash dieback is a quite a serious disease, particularly in the midlands and a lot of the Ulster region.  Let me explain my reason for asking the Leader to raise the issue with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  His Department closed the scheme to tackle the problem in February 2018 and continued to tell people who have been affected by ash dieback that it will open the scheme next month but that been promised for the last year.  I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Minister and ask him to come here to discuss the matter.  I have discussed the issue before and Senator Boyhan is well in tune with it.  Ash dieback seems to have become a serious issue, particularly in the midlands.  As this is National Tree Week, which is an initiative that calls on people to plant trees, forestry is a topical issue at present.  A lot of forestry and certainly ash plantations in the midlands have been decimated by ash dieback.</p> <p>I wish to raise a curious query.  There has been a lot of talk, particularly by a Deputy in the area, about a new bridge being built in the town of Newbridge as part of a national plan.  I ask the Leader to ask the relevant Minister and then inform me whether there are plans afoot to build a new traffic bridge in Newbridge, as touted by some local Deputies.  I would appreciate if the Leader will bring me up to speed on the matter.</p></speech>

On my behalf I and that of my party, I express sympathies to the family of the late Michael Fahy who died.  Senators Leyden and Boyhan very eloquently paid tribute to the man for his longevity of service and his unique role in Irish politics.  We send our deepest sympathies to his family and to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on his sad passing.</p> <p>I join Senator Lombard in paying tribute to the late Pat McAuliffe who died suddenly on Monday in Cork.  In a previous incarnation I had the pleasure of working in RT&Eacute; Radio Cork as a sports reporter with Pat McAuliffe.  He was one of the most accommodating and supportive broadcasters to anybody engaged in journalism.  His encyclopaedic knowledge of sport was legendary.  His gentleness in his interviewing of managers and players after games was exceptional.  To his partner, to his brother Matthew, to the RT&Eacute; family and to the sports family in Cork we wend our deepest sympathies on his death.</p> <p>Senators Horkan, McDowell, Leyden, Feighan and Coghlan raised the issue of Brexit, which is a moving target every day.  We all share the sentiment the Senators expressed this morning.  We hope the British Parliament in tandem with the British Government arrives at a common-sense decision.  There is a joke going around that the British people might see the end of May before the end of April.  However, we have to pay tribute to the British Prime Minister at one level for her steadfastness in trying to get a result.  I welcome her engagement with Jeremy Corbyn this morning and I hope it will bring results.</p> <p>I note Senator McDowell's words regarding President Macron and the whole relationship.  I do not believe there is a payback for tax realignment and tax policy.  The T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and the Minister for Finance have said it repeatedly.  I certainly hope there is not because this is a stand-alone issue.  This is about the European project in itself as opposed to tax harmonisation or what individual countries do.  However, I would certainly be happy to agree to the Senator's request for a debate on the issue.</p> <p>I repeat that I hope the DUP will recognise that it has a key role to play.  It can bring people with it and it should take leadership given that the people who vote for that party will be dreadfully affected by a hard Brexit.  Equally, it is important that we continue, as the Taoiseach has done this week with meetings with President Macron and tomorrow with Chancellor Merkel, to build bridges across the Continent.</p> <p>Senators Horkan, McDowell and Gavan raised the issue of school patronage.  As Senator McDowell said, the issue needs to be handled sensitively and in an intelligent way.  The Minister and his Department have not been involved in the letters sent to schools in Malahide.  The process outlined by Government has two distinct phases: identification and implementation.  That is important because the transfer of patronage is about one issue.  In tandem with that, there needs to be proper consultation with the school community on the reconfiguration and the patronage issue.  The formal implementation phase has not yet commenced and there is no requirement on the Department until September of next year.</p> <p>There can be considerable scaremongering and hyperbole on the issue with suggestions about the refusal to celebrate Christmas, Easter or other festivals.  Many schools already do that in a non-denominational manner as it stands.  It is important to have a calm debate and a process that is informative and that is handled sensitively and carefully.  I understand the letters parents received are not based on information from the Department of Education and Skills.  I hope that the reconfiguration process around diversity will allow choice for families so that we can have the school communities that people want.  I look forward to that happening.  We will certainly have that debate again with the Minister in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Senators Horkan and Gallagher raised the issue of what is happening to ATMs.  Senator Horkan made the sensible suggestion that the money could be dyed or decommissioned in some shape or form.  While I do not want to get into a particular row with Senator Gallagher, it is a bit rich of him to criticise the Government when his party decimated rural areas.  He can do it if he wants, and he can say it again.  Fianna F&aacute;il closed Garda stations.  It closed the Garda College in Templemore.  It cut recruitment.</p></speech>

Even if several squad cars came up to the particular ATM, the road was blocked.  It took two minutes and there were 11 of them.  Senator Horkan's point is relevant.  Technology can assist in the matter of ATMs.  As Senator McDowell said, it is about making it easier for people to avoid using cash.  Today people use debit or credit cards for everything.  Senator Horkan also made the point.  That is a debate we can have.  However, it is nonsensical for Senator Gallagher to come in here every day and blame the Government for everything.  We need to focus on giving security to the people.</p></speech>

I would be happy to have that debate in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Senator Horkan asked for a debate on the ESRI and I would be happy to have that debate, probably after Easter.</p> <p>Senator McDowell referred to a F&aacute;ilte Ireland spokesperson saying that we need a mega hotel in Dublin for conferences.  I have not seen the report.  His remarks are correct.  We need a clear debate on future urban living.  I support him in that and we will have the debate in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the vote of European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  As she will be aware, the previous two CAP reforms moved money away from large farm payments to smaller ones.  That benefited more people.  It is about supporting family farmers, as we have been doing.</p> <p>Senators Norris and McFadden spoke about the expansion of neonatal screening.  We all received an email this morning, and if Members have not read it, they should.  It is a very emotional email written by a parent in distress looking for a change.  Those of us involved in politics could not fail to be moved by the email and the need for change.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House.  I suggest to Senators Norris and McFadden that raising it as a Commencement matter may get an answer quicker.</p> <p>Senator Swanick raised the issue of the Irish Coast Guard and the blue light.

It is important but urban areas also need trees so we should promote their planting.  The Minister came into the House for a debate on forestry following a request from Senator Boyhan and we will invite him back again.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the very important issue of the local property tax and I do not disagree with many of his comments.  The Minister for Finance, who was on "Morning Ireland" and "Newstalk Breakfast" this morning, is anxious to have a real debate on the matter.  The Senator made a point about deferral but the Minister has bona fides in respect of this issue.  His approach is to keep, but reform, the local property tax and to avoid a sudden increase in bills for people.  He wants to ensure valuations are based on a considered measure, rather than a rushed one.  Senator Boyhan spoke about money being spent but money is being spent locally, though I take his point that more needs to be done and that it needs to be better explained.  The Minister is sending a report to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which is welcome.  I would be happy for him to come to the House on the matter.  It is important that property tax is funded locally and is fair and consistent.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised a very sensitive matter.  All of us are anxious for people to remain in their homes and to engage with banks.  I hope that a solution is found in the case he mentions.  Finally, Senator Davitt raised the issue of ash dieback, which is causing a lot of difficulty.  I will ask the Minister to come back to us on that, perhaps for a Commencement matter.  The bridge in Newbridge is beyond my remit but I would be happy for the Senator to put a Commencement matter to the House on the subject.  I am sure there are many fine Deputies in Kildare who could work with him on a cross-party basis to ensure the bridge is built.</p></speech>

I thank the academics who have worked with me, particularly Deirdre Halloran from NUI Galway, to Ciara Gaynor and Janet Horner from my own office who have done huge work to bring the Bill to this stage.  I also thank my group for supporting me and I thank all those who have spoken to me over the course of the development of this Bill in the past two years about their experiences of procurement, either as procurement officials or as people on the receiving end of public procurement.</p> <p>This topic may seem wide and abstract but public procurement affects every area of our lives, even the most intimate areas such as the food we eat in hospital, the surfaces our children fall on, the person on the other end of a phone line when we have called for help.  It affects the landscape and the greatest infrastructural projects too.  Our roads, streets, public spaces, schools, hospitals and all the buildings we share are part of the public procurement process in many cases.</p> <p>There are areas where the public delivery of services is better than public procurement but where public procurement is used, it is vital we do it responsibly and that we design and sign contracts on behalf of the people of Ireland.  When we do that, we have to ensure we get the maximum public benefit, including the social and environmental benefit.</p> <p>My interest in this area dates back to 2014 when the current European directives were being introduced.  In 2015 and 2016, when I was still a member of civil society organisations, we worked around the potential we saw in those directives and the scope in them for social, environmental and other considerations, a scope which has, unfortunately, largely been unrealised.  My Bill is not simply more pressing in the context of recent controversies such as CervicalCheck and the collapse of school projects under Carillion and Western Building Systems.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not simply a response to the problems which need to be addressed.  It is also about the potential to be realised, the fact we spend tens of billions on public procurement and that those tens of billions are an incredible source of leverage and potential benefit to all our people.</p><p>We turn to the subject matter of my Bill, which concerns public procurement.  What it does is to try to join up the dots in the procurement process and put quality at the heart of that process.  There are three ways that a contracting authority may decide to undertake procurement, three bases on which it can decide to make its decisions.  It can decide on the basis of the price-quality ratio, the balance between price and quality, it can decide on the basis of life cycle costing, or it can decide on the basis of lowest price only.  Lowest price only was what was used in regard to CervicalCheck.  It has been shown to have serious consequences because it removes quality from the equation.  If the decision is made to go with the lowest price only approach, it becomes very difficult to try to introduce quality later on in the process.</p><p>At the time the European directives were transposed, France and Scotland chose to exclude lowest price only altogether so that lowest price would not be an option for contracting authorities.  I am not attempting to replicate that.  Instead, my Bill focuses on the Dutch model, which respects the discretion of contracting authorities but seeks to change practice and culture.  Under my Bill, the price-quality ratio, where price and quality are considered, would become the default and the norm.  Contracting authorities have the discretion to decide they want to go for lowest price only, but if they go for lowest price only, that needs sign-off at a senior level and they must publish a rationale.  Effectively, what this Bill does is to oblige authorities either to think about quality or to think about why they are not thinking about quality.  I hope it will lead to a change in practice where lowest price will become the exception rather the rule.</p><p>In most areas, the Bill does not seek to prescribe the exact ratio between quality and price in a decision.  It recognises that this may vary and, for example, it may be 30%, 80% 60% or 40% on quality.  The one area where we do set targets, however, is in regard to the billions which will be spent under the national development plan.  These projects are not like those where, if we sign a three-year contract, we can learn from it and make changes the next time.  National development plan projects are once in a generation or once in a lifetime projects.  We simply have to get them right.  That is why the Bill sets a threshold or target of 50% minimum for quality on national development plan projects.  Again, exceptions may be made but a sign-off at senior level is required and the rationale must be provided.</p><p>I want to clarify an important point.  This Bill does not mean that procurement has to cost more.  In the Netherlands, the model which we are following, 73% of contracts still went to a lower bidder but those lower bidders also had to prove themselves in terms of quality.  What it means is that commitments and evidence in regard to quality were on the table alongside the proposals on price.  It is very important to note that research from the construction industry and from academic institutions in the Netherlands found that the public benefit was 2.4 times higher where a mix of price and quality was used.  What we saw was that for a little bit more thought earlier in the procurement process, almost double the public benefit was delivered.</p><p>What do we mean by quality?  This Bill is not prescriptive.  It recognises that what is quality in one area may differ in another.  Sometimes it is about the track record, the performance and the materials that may be introduced.  The Bill is not prescriptive.  It largely reflects the wide space within the language of the directives in terms of quality.  What it also does is to require ministerial guidelines to be put in place.  Those guidelines will contain existing commitments and targets, that is, cross-cutting commitments made by Government and already signed off on.  They are not ones I am adding in but ones that already exist.  These would be in areas like climate, accessibility and inclusion.  This will get people out of their silos when they are doing procurement and it promotes joined-up thinking.  If I am designing a space and I look to the commitment in regard to, for example, Irish Sign Language accessibility, maybe I will build a space for an interpreter because I have become aware of that cross-cutting commitment.  If we are using materials, we may think more about their sustainability and how they contribute to our emissions targets.  It is joined-up thinking.  Again, it is for contracting authorities to decide which elements of those guidelines they wish to take on board, but it requires they show they have thought it through.</p><p>In the Bill, I also put forward the human rights duty.  Again, the human rights duty already exists for public authorities and they are required by law, including in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission legislation of 2014, to promote equality and human rights.  What this Bill simply does is require them to report on how they are delivering on equality and human rights, and to build that in to their regular procurement reports, as required by the regulations.</p><p>I want to address a few questions and concerns that have been raised with me over the course of my conversations with different parties.  Who is involved in the sign-off?  In the Bill, I set out Accounting Officers, accountable officers and Ministers as sign-off.  Having engaged with the Government and listened to the concerns that were raised, however, it is my intention to remove Ministers from that sign-off process on Committee Stage, and I have engaged the Office of Parliamentary Legal Adviser, OPLA, on amendments to that effect.  It will be Accounting Officers and accountable officers, usually at Secretary General level.</p><p>Will this require more red tape?  The answer is "No".  What this Bill does is save us from complicated processes of repair later on in the procurement process by making sure things are done in a clear and transparent way from the beginning.  It is empowering legislation.  It empowers procurement officers to think about quality.  I have spoken to those who feel nervous about using quality because they feel they would have to get permission from above.  Now we know they can think about quality and they can do a better job.  In the same way that, for example, the fines being added in terms of data protection empower data protection officers, this Bill empowers procurement officials to think in creative and positive ways about the benefits to society.</p><p>The Bill has wider benefits.  It rewards and allows for the recognition of those companies, usually SMEs, that are delivering higher standards, that have records and that have done the work in terms of quality.  It gives SMEs from whichever European country a potential comparative advantage.  It also has the wider benefit that when the State, as the largest customer in Ireland, raises the standards, it raises standards right across the board.</p><p>I thank all of those who have supported me on this Bill.  I believe it can be a game changer in terms of the landscape, culture and practice of public procurement.  If successful, I believe it will have ripple effects across every area of our life together.</p></speech>

I formally second the Bill and commend Senator Higgins on bringing it forward.  It is an incredible Bill that will have an immeasurable impact on people's lives through how the State engages in the public procurement process.  It is a testament to Senator Higgins and her drive for positive reform in this sometimes complex and technical area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I pay tribute also to Ciara Gaynor and Janet Horner in our office for all their work to get the Bill to this point.</p><p>Getting the process by which the State tenders, vets and awards contracts to companies in the private sector for the provision of State services right is important in many areas.  Ethical, fair and balanced public procurement is key to fostering public confidence, ensuring the State leads the way on the use of procurement to advance human rights and equality and ensuring we do not take a short-term perspective for a short-term financial saving which, in fact, ends up costing more and more in future.  Procurement may be a complex process in itself, but the end result impacts on the lives of citizens in incredibly intimate and important ways.  While the Bill may involve a great deal of jargon and appear, on the surface, simply to change the balance in assessing the ratio across price, cost and quality, it is actually about immeasurable improvements in the real lives of people who interact with the firms we contract through public procurement.  The Bill is not prescriptive about who should be awarded contracts.  Rather, it sets the philosophical underpinnings according to which those choices should be made.  As such, we say quality, accessibility for disabled persons and sensitivity to the experiences of minority communities, including migrants, LGBT people and Travellers, are just as important as financial costs and just as valuable in the achievement of excellence and confidence in our public procurement process.  This area may be full of complicated processes and various oversight and accountability measures but at its heart, it is about people and making their lives and experiences better and safer while providing higher quality services.  That is why the Bill is so important.  It seeks to create a shift in culture where we end the race to the bottom and start to think about public procurement in a new way.</p><p>The Bill is not about simply saving ourselves money for the coming budget but about a commitment to valuing the quality of goods and services.  If the State cannot be everywhere and do everything, it is the people we choose and the goods we select through public procurement that will make up the foundations of our motorways, food for our schoolkids and the processing of our most personal and private data.  Public procurement cannot and should not just be about how to spend as little money as possible in the here and now.  It should be about building a process that can look 20 years into the future when assessing costs while learning from past mistakes to ensure procurement processes grow and develop.  In the procurement process for once-in-a-generation projects such as those under the national development plan, we must set ambitious targets in the weight we give procurement quality.  We will not get a second chance.  Price should not be the be-all and end-all when decisions are made as to who will build our schools and hospitals, feed our kids in schools and administer important parts of our health service.  Personally, I do not want the only thing to matter in who we choose to be how low they dared to bid for a contract.  I want to know that when a procurement officer decides who is to get a contract, he or she has the well-being of my children in mind and is thinking about our domestic and international human rights and equality commitments, not seeking only to make an immediate saving for the Exchequer.  I want officials to take a long-term perspective and to consider properly the importance of the quality of the services being tendered.</p><p>At the briefing on the Bill in the audiovisual room yesterday, it was stated that everyone who had been involved in public life or the provision of services in Ireland would have many examples of bad public procurements which they wish could have been avoided.  They would not have proceeded if they had known how they would turn out.  I am sure the Senators present can think of examples.  Could they have been prevented by a Bill like this?  Could the CervicalCheck errors have been avoided if a Bill like this had governed the public procurement process that outsourced those checks?  Today is the first anniversary of those errors becoming public knowledge.  Could the lives and health of the women involved have been safeguarded if quality of procurement had been mandated as of equal importance as cost?  I sit on the education committee where we investigated the failings by Western Building Systems, which led to 42 schools being assessed in respect of their structural safety.  My daughter was a student in one of those.  I want my daughter to go to school in a building that is warm, comfortable and safe, not one that was built as a result of a race to the bottom for the lowest-cost bid and which may simply fall down.  Could the building errors have been avoided if quality was given as much weight as price?  We will never know.  However, the Bill will go some way to safeguarding against catastrophic errors like this in future.  Even when it comes to the food served in schools, hospitals, direct provision centres and our prisons, I do not want contracts awarded on the basis of the lowest cost.  Nutrition is an important area where even small increases in cost can result in huge increases in quality.  I want to know considerations like this are required to be factored into a procurement process.</p><p>I thank Members who are supporting the Bill and pay tribute to Senator Higgins again.  It is a great Bill and it will improve people's lives.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-03a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040300002#Q00200"><p>I welcome the thrust of the Bill albeit there are aspects of it around which I have concerns.  The Bill is about getting the most economically advantageous tender and how that process should work.  A fundamental point, to which Senator Higgins referred, is that one cannot have the final decision-maker involved in any way in the process.  Section 2(4)(b) of the Bill provides that &quot;In applying <i>subsection (2)</i>, contracting authorities shall not include a best price&ndash;quality ratio in a case to which the National Development Plan relates where the price criteria is greater than 50 per cent&quot;.  Ultimately, we have to get value for money.  I do not fully buy the argument that one can absolve contractors on the basis that there was not enough emphasis on quality in a tender process.  If one is building, one should be building to standard.  There are regulations in place according to which one must build.  Therefore, I am nervous that if one brings the issue of price down to 50%, one may not actually get value for the taxpayer.  It is something I am concerned about.</p><p>The Senator said there was an exemption in section 4, which relates to departing from the contracting criteria.  Section 4(1)(b) provides that &quot;The requirements of <i>paragraph (a) </i>do not apply where the chief decision maker of the contracting authority or contracting entity concerned is satisfied that there is no material difference in quality between the potential options&quot;.  Once again, whatever criteria and weightings apply should be dealt with in their entirety.  One might now have a situation where a person says that in fact the bulk of the criteria can be parked because they are all the same and simply go back to price.  It might undermine the Senator's argument about it not being solely around price.</p><p>A review is ongoing between the Department and stakeholders around the best way to get value and around social considerations.  I place the matter in a local context for myself.  When we had the regeneration projects under way in Limerick, I would have liked to see more local workers involved.  Typically, however, projects had to go on eTenders under the public tendering process to which anyone could apply.  However, a requirement was later brought in that 10% of people had to be employed locally, which I supported strongly.  I understand that Senator Higgins has met the Minister and that there are discussions taking place.  I fully understand the import of the Bill but I will always look for unintended consequences.  As such, I do not particularly like the fact that the Bill prescribes that not more than 50% of the decision on a contract can relate to price.  The worry is that those other aspects could be open to abuse.  I suggest we come up with some other basis.  Decisions cannot be solely on price because that has given rise to unintended consequences too and there may have been a race to the bottom, albeit we do not know if that is the case, and a review is ongoing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Value for money is also important.  I do not want a situation to emerge where contractors come in who are aware of the process involved and who kick the value for money issue down the road.  We are taking money from taxpayers and we have to spend their money wisely.  I understand the point of carrying out public projects, but we can never get away from the fundamental point that if people are paying income tax or if they are on social welfare and are paying VAT on the goods they buy, we have to ensure we spend their money wisely.  That point is often lost in the process.  When I speak about taxes, I am not referring to taxes paid by people who are working but rather all taxes, including income tax, companies paying corporation tax, VAT and stamp duty.  We have to ensure we get value for money. This is an important matter, and I welcome the discussion, but I do not support much of the detail proposed.  I support the social aspect of it, but I will let the Minister put the Government's view.  I regard this as a working document.</p></speech>

I am happy to tell them that Fianna F&aacute;il is happy to support it through to Committee Stage.  That is not to say that it is perfect as it is - we all acknowledge that it is a work in progress - but the idea of examining public procurement and public authorities and utilities under the contract preparation and award criteria is a very timely topic to be discussing in the context of issues such as the national children's hospital.  I do not want to be party political about it, but we are all wondering how an initial figure of &euro;650 million seems likely to rise to &euro;2 billion.  Equally, the national broadband plan for rural areas, which is the scheme the State has been promising since 2012 or 2013 and which intends to deliver to areas that do not have high-speed broadband, is associated with high costs.  There are implications around how we will deal with that.  This is not just about the cheapest way to do things.  We need a quality product.  Technology is changing by the week or month in terms of what can be delivered and how it can be delivered, and there are questions as to whether we should use fibre optics or wireless systems or alternatives.  These things are all very important.</p> <p>We probably all know the adage that if something is too cheap to be true, it probably is not true.  The saying "buy cheap and buy twice" is equally true.  I have often seen scenarios where people have been presented with a list of contractors for a school building project, for example, or any kind of commercial contract, having been told that they must select the contractor offering the work at the lowest price.  They end up praying that particular contractors do not come in with the lowest price, because they know that particular contractors have a history of coming in low, finding fault with everything, making many changes to the plans, and then charging enormous prices.  They end up being thankful that particular contractors do not get the tender or feeling that they are in trouble because the contractor did get it because, although they tendered at the lowest price, it is well known that it will require far more management and attention to ensure that problems do not arise and costs do not escalate.  There are many reputable contractors, but they are not all as good as each other.  There are those which are better and there are those which have a bad track record of delivering the projects they promised to deliver.  There is certainly merit in looking at a system which does not say that the lowest tender always has to be accepted, regardless of who the contractor is or their track record.  There is scope to change that.  Perhaps, as the Bill is teased out, there are ways in which we can deal with that.</p> <p>We have the Government Procurement Office, and it is the case that many areas, including the 400 voluntary secondary schools, have schools procurement units which advise schools on how best to procure things, such as negotiating with the ESB or for gas or any other items schools require.  If a security alarm contract or a burglar alarm contract can be negotiated, there are savings that can be made.  Nobody has to pay over the odds.</p> <p>CervicalCheck was mentioned by a number of people as an example of another scandal.  I am not sure that this Bill would automatically solve the problems that arose around CervicalCheck, but it is certainly timely in that it looks at how we procure and how we look at the initial tender.  We faced issues about mobile phone licences years ago and the weighting that went to various things.  People were on the committee that decided how those weightings would be allocated.  Almost by default, once a level of subjectivity is introduced, we enter an area that can possibly be manipulated.  It can be coerced in a particular way to favour one person or another, and I do not know if that can be legislated for.  It is something we need to be careful of.  As Senator Higgins develops her Bill, we must ensure that there is a significant level of transparency involved.  People may not like the CAO system, but at least it is transparent.  Once interviews are brought into processes, it becomes likely that people will meet others that they know directly or through other people.  It will all be transparent, but there will be a level of subjectivity involved.  Sometimes it is useful, but problems arise over how the process is handled, the personnel on the board, who selects the tender and whether they have any conflicts of interest.  All of those points have to be considered.</p> <p>Relevant points were made about Carillion and Western Building Systems.  Both companies appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to discuss the collapse of Carillion.  We heard how contracts are awarded and how the main contractor gets the work.  I know many people who have done work for the State having got the job as a subcontractor to a main contractor.  The main contractor was paid by the State, but the subcontractors got treated very badly in some cases by that main contractor.  I know some of these people, and they are very good business people who were very good at the work they did.  These people thought they were doing work for the State, whether for the Garda or the courts system, but they were caught out because the main contractor and subcontractor fell out, leaving the subcontractor in a very difficult position.  The main contractor benefited from that difficulty.  All of those things must be looked at when we are dealing with State money.  It is not fair that anybody who does the job they signed up to do does not get paid.  Equally, it is not fair if people do not do the job they are being paid for.</p> <p>This is useful legislation.  I have a couple of concerns that the Minister of State may be able to address when he makes his contribution.  It may not be possible to allow a money Bill to be introduced by someone who is not a member of Government.  I will be interested to see if the Minister of State considers that this is legislation that will require a money message at some point.  If it does and it is not going to get one, this could be the most wonderful idea but it will go nowhere.  I hope that is not the case, but perhaps the Minister of State could address that.</p> <p>In terms of procurement and contracts generally, whether broadband or the national children's hospital, there is a need to shine a light on how this is done.  I do not want to repeat the valuable contributions made by Senators Higgins and Ruane, who covered many of the points I might have made were I introducing the Bill.  I wish it well on Committee Stage.  We have concerns but we are happy to tease it out further on the next Stage.  I congratulate the Senators and their group for introducing the matter.</p></speech>

It is important to take time out of one's schedule in advance of the day.  She did that to explain the Bill to the Independent group.  That was really helpful and I wish to acknowledge that.

It aims to improve the quality of procurement, as well as protect the construction sector from a system that at times focuses predominantly on price at the expense of the construction sector, particularly subcontractors.  The Bill focuses primarily on improving the weighting of price and quality and on enhancing the guidelines on social considerations.</p> <p>I will offer some observations on the Bill.  It gives further effect to the 2014 EU directives on public contracts and utility contracts.  Its primary purpose is to mitigate the use of pricing as the exclusive grounds for contract award criteria.</p> <p>Section 2 relates to public authority contracts, while section 3 deals with utility undertakings but it deals with them in much the same way.  The Bill details the most economically advantageous tender, MEAT, criteria under which contracts may be awarded, noting that these criteria include elements such as price, quality, social and environmental considerations and so on.  However, the way these elements are weighted is not specified in law and is for the contracting authority to decide.</p> <p>Section 2(4) specifies that contracting authorities shall not use price as the sole award criterion and that contracting authorities shall not weigh price above 50% in the contract award criteria.  This applies unless, as per section 4, the contracting authority does not believe quality would make a material difference to the public work or undertaking and issues a declaration to that effect to the Office of Government Procurement.  Such a declaration should then be published on its website.</p> <p>Identical provisions are given for utility undertakings in section 3.  A number of comments could be made in this regard.  There are times when price being given a predominant weighting in the awarding of a public contract makes sense.  One example is when there is little scope for differing quality among the bidding economic operators.  At other times, such as in the restoration of a heritage building such as Leinster House, it is advised that quality be given the predominant weighting.  It is universally acknowledged by industry that the use of price as the determining criterion in the awarding of public contracts has a number of negative effects.  Lowest price tendering leads to lowballing in the tender bids which inevitably leads to cost escalations.  We saw this with the national children's hospital.  The lowest price can compromise quality and lowest price favours large companies over small and medium-sized enterprises, since they possess large enough cashflows in their business to adjust for low bids.  For this reason, the Bill's attempt to restrict the use of price only in contract award criteria or in its weighting at over 50% is welcome.  However, there are some deficiencies.  In particular, the declaration that must be given to the Office of Government Procurement by the contracting authority, as per section 4(1)(b) is not fleshed out.  What must the declaration include?  On what grounds can it be rejected?</p> <p>Section 6 provides for the issuing of guidelines on social considerations concerning qualitative, environmental, social, human rights and equality considerations.  Contracting authorities would be obliged to compile a record of compliance with any of these obligations.  The Minister would then issue a revised set of guidelines or a report justifying why compliance is not required.  Any consideration of these social clauses is welcome, and, while we support it, we would also welcome legislation that hardwires principles of social justice and equality within the procurement process.  One example of this is the Social Clauses in Public Procurement Bill 2013, initiated by Deputy McDonald.  That Bill provided, among other things, that one long-term unemployed person should be employed for each &euro;1 million comprising the value of a public contract.  We would like to see such principles hardwired within the procurement process.  My party colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, is currently working on this.</p> <p>We are keen to see greater transparency and accountability in procurement practice.  Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien recently initiated the Regulation of Tenderers Bill in the D&aacute;il, which provided for the disqualification of abnormally low tenders and the disqualification of badly performing contractors from the tendering process.  Any Bill that seeks to improve the Government's lacklustre and costly procurement strategy should be welcomed.</p> <p>I thank Senators Higgins, Ruane and Black and the others involved in bringing forward this Bill.  We look forward to the Bill going to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

She indicated that, as a result of discussions in the House, it will be amended in certain ways.  She has already indicated some ways in which it will be amended.  This is a good parliamentary approach.</p> <p>My good friend and colleague, Senator Kieran O'Donnell, talked about value for money.  What is value for money?  It is patently not value for money if we take the lowest price but the company collapses.  That is not value for money.

Under this law, a public contract is defined by who is doing the purchasing, what the person is buying and who the person buys from.  The various directives also set down minimum time limits.  That is fair enough because it gives companies from other countries in the European Union the opportunity to put in a tender.  Under the 2014 directives contracts are required to be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender, known as MEAT.  Again, I would argue that "most economically advantageous" also implies that some degree of quality control in place.  I would have thought that was absolutely essential.  Member states had the option of restricting the use of lowest price or lowest cost standards but Ireland failed to do so.  I do not understand why we did not do so.  This is something we certainly should have done at the time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We did not do that and Senator Higgins's Bill provides that contracting authorities should award contracts based on best price quality ratio, BPQR.

I understand that this is based on the Dutch approach to this area.  The Dutch experience is reassuring according to the briefing I have received from the Senator because it might be assumed that if this quality system was introduced, then the lowest priced bidders would be ruled out in many cases but this has not turned out to be the case because in-----</p></speech>

In the Netherlands, 73% of contracts were awarded to the lowest bidder.  We still have a situation where the State is getting the best price but is also getting good quality, and that is very important for the taxpayer.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell spoke about taxpayers but we all pay tax.  Even the most penurious old age pensioner has to pay tax because he or she pays VAT and this, that and the other.  We are all taxed to death practically in this country.</p> <p>The Bill is significant in that it acknowledges the fact that there may well be situations in which the lowest price is the best.  It is significant that discretion is allowed here and one is not tied into a contract in a rigid way.  The parties that award the contracts are allowed significant discretion.  Other Members referred to various situations which call for a parliamentary response.  I refer to matters such as the Scally report where it was clear that part of the problem was opting for the lowest possible price and that created a significant problem.  Then there is the Carillion issue.  This work was outsourced to a British company, despite the fact that it was widely known that it had a high risk rating, but the State took the lowest price possible, not worrying about the question of quality.  Then we have the question of the construction of the children's hospital.  This is quite extraordinary.  There was a low quality rating and 75% of it was awarded on the low cost and 25% of it on quality.  That is ridiculous, particularly when the lowest bid was &euro;130 million less than the next one.  That is a margin of 20%, which is unheard of.  There might be 5% or 10% flexibility but when it reached 20%, questions should have been asked and if this Bill were in operation, such a situation would not continue to occur.  I applaud Senator Higgins and her group for introducing this Bill and I look forward to its passage through the House.</p></speech>

We have heard a lot about MEAT but what Senator Higgins is trying to achieve here is the addition of the two vegetables, which is a balanced diet and a balanced approach to public procurement because quality needs to be put at the heart of public procurement policy.</p> <p>The Labour Party is pleased to support this Bill.  It is a modest proposal and if taken on by Government and if it passes through the various stages here, and subsequently in the D&aacute;il, it could deliver a paradigm shift in tendering and procurement processes.  There is an onus on us in this Legislature to ensure that the State operates best practice and leads from the front in the power, influence and leverage that the State has in terms of it and us being the largest procurer of services, products and so on.  We have significant power and leverage that we do not often use in promoting best practice in labour standards, environmental standards and achieving quality design standards and aesthetics in public buildings, for example.  Some of the public buildings that have been constructed in the State in recent years and recent decades - and I acknowledge that design is a subjective matter - leave a lot to be desired.  It should be ensured in our  public procurement processes and in tendering and design standards that quality and aesthetics are at the very heart of them because the development of public buildings and public projects should be an expression of who we are and demonstrate who we are and what we want to be as a State.  At the heart of this Bill is an ambition to achieve those kinds of aims.</p> <p>State procurement should always aim to have a high standard of labour practices at the heart of everything we do.  At least in theory there is an obligation on those who successfully obtain public contracts to ensure that high labour standards are maintained and that labour and employment standards are maintained, respected and complied with but that is not always the case.  For example, in 2017, following an investigation that I established, it was found that a number of cleaning contractors which were used by the HSE were not paying the employment regulation order rate.  In one case it was in a hospital in the southern part of Ireland, not too far from Senator Kieran O'Donnell's base.  All the HSE did was to insist that the rate be paid to staff but the contractors got away with breaching and being non-compliant with an employment regulation order with absolute impunity.  Anyone in breach of employment and labour standards and in breach of our laws, whether they be tax laws, employment laws or whatever the case might be, should immediately lose the contract.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.</p> <p>I was interested in Senator Horkan's remarks on disputes that arise between subcontractors and main contractors in construction.  They are damaging disputes and many subcontractors went under in recent years because of the behaviour of large contractors.  Back in 2016, I appointed a panel of adjudicators under the Construction Contracts Act 2013, which emanated from this House under the guidance of former Senator, Feargal Quinn.  That legislation was nuanced and finessed by me and the then Minister, Deputy Howlin.  That panel of adjudicators is in place now and I understand it is working well.  It is an important protection for subcontractors who are employing many thousands of people in dealing with the vagaries of that industry because the reality was that in some cases a lot of subcontractors would have to go to the superior courts to get satisfaction and to get money that was owed to them returned to them.  Now we have this clear process in place that is very effective, from a cost point of view as well, to vindicate the rights of subcontractors.</p></speech>

I will try to respond as best I can to some of the points that were made.  Reference was made to the Government's lacklustre procurement policy.  I remind Senator Conway-Walsh that I have never had a single proposal from her on anything to do with procurement.  If the Government is lacklustre, we would welcome any suggestion that she has in the same spirit as we have welcomed Senator Higgins's proposal.</p> <p>Public procurement is a key part of my portfolio and an integral part of the Government's overall reform agenda.  The Government acknowledges that the Bill is well intentioned with many good points raised and we appreciate, in particular, that Senator Higgins has engaged with my officials and those of the Office of Government Procurement in the development of the Bill.  However, as she will be aware, the Government has concerns regarding the Bill's impact on the ability of the State to seek value for money and the implications for Ireland with respect to EU public procurement directives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Several Senators referred to the issue of value for money and some railed against the issue it.  I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General would not support some of the comments made.  I will address them shortly, but, first, I want to place the Bill and the Government's concern in the context of its public procurement reform programme.  The reform of the public procurement programme is and remains driven by the need to obtain value for public money in procuring goods, services and works.  The Office of Government Procurement and the procurement policy were put in place at a time when the country had literally run out of money and was banjaxed.  It is essential that the achievement of value for money is not adversely affected by the inclusion of overly prescriptive requirements and increased administrative and reporting burdens, which I know is not Senator Higgins' intention.  Public procurement is essential for the sustainable delivery of much needed public services.  The State spends approximately &euro;12 billion per annum on goods, services and works and procurement is a powerful tool in spending public money in an efficient and sustainable way.  Contrary to some of the commentary to the effect that the Government is spending nothing in Ireland, 94% of the &euro;12 billion is spent in the economy, of which approximately 54% is spent in the SME sector, to which the State is a large contributor.  Better managed procurement can lead to significant savings in public budgets and more investment.  How public authorities purchase directly affects an economy, through competitiveness, economic growth, levels of taxation and innovation, as indicated by Senator Ruane when she correctly said the State was the largest procurer in the country.  Public procurement also represents a huge business opportunity for all businesses, large and small.</p><p>It is essential that the public service operate in a co-ordinated and effective way to deliver value for money and sustainable savings for taxpayers.  Senator Norris who is not present questioned what is value for money.  I am sure if he took down any report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, he would find a succinct definition of what it is and, more importantly, what it is not.  Significant progress has been made since reform of the public procurement programme began and the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, commenced operations in 2014 under the then Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  Together with four key sectors &ndash; health, defence, education and local government - the OGP has been driving the achievement of value for money, enabling compliance, promoting business participation in procurement, increasing communication and guidance, professionalising the service and driving transparency.  It is doing so in the context of the EU directives specifically set out for procurement.</p><p>While the OGP has made significant progress in driving implementation of the reform programme since 2014, this is an opportune time to reflect on the progress made and the challenges that remain and to consider the learnings, with a view to identifying the future direction and shape of public procurement and how best to achieve it.  It is something I have asked my officials to initiate in conjunction with Government colleagues and others to see what suggestions can be made.  I have said it previously in this and the other House.  It is welcome that Senator Higgins has taken up the opportunity to do so.  If there others who wish to do so to bring forward proposals without using words such as "lacklustre", I would welcome them.  A consultation process is under way to ensure all elements of the reform programme will be aligned.  I have sought the views of Ministers, their Departments and bodies under their aegis, as well as SME representative bodies via the SME advisory group.  I chair the group which meets regularly and reflects the leadership of small and medium-sized enterprises across the country.  All suggestions made in the group are considered and many of them have been implemented by the Government.  The feedback from the consultation process will help to shape future public procurement policy and operations aimed at having a more efficient and accountable public procurement process.  I do not think any Senator is suggesting it is anything other than accountable.</p><p>My Department recently launched a consultation process with construction industry stakeholders to develop the next generation of public capital works management framework, to which reference was made.  Both the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I are very conscious of the construction industry specifically.  While several references were made by Senators who are no longer present to the construction sector, not everything is falling down.  Not every hospital is falling down and not every school project is over budget.  Not every process is failing.  The vast majority are totally within budget and of very good quality and we never hear about them.  That is probably true in the case of 99% of them, but that is a separate issue. </p><p>A specific issue to be addressed in the consultation process is the consideration of creating a revised quality to price balance in the award of public works contracts.  It will address the use of MEAT, most economically advantageous tender, an unfortunate acronym that I do not particularly like to use, and the words "lowest price" in contract evaluation.  It would not be appropriate to be prescriptive in primary legislation in that regard.  The Bill proposes that contracting authorities should award contracts on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender, rather than price only, unless sanctioned by a Minister or the Accounting Officer.  While I appreciate the concerns raised by Senators about the use of price only in procurement processes, such a provision would be disproportionate and add to the administrative burden in buying generic, commonly acquired goods and services.  I think the Senator also acknowledged this.</p><p>When debating the issue of procurement, a lot of attention is focused on the award stage of public procurement processes.  What many do not realise is that there are a number of stages in the process that can be used to develop and assess the quality of commonly acquired goods or services that make them suitable to be assessed on a price only basis.  A lot of work goes on in the Office of Government Procurement specifically on this issue in the development of frameworks that can be used in the procurement of individual products.  For example, the specifications and requirements in the procurement of office supplies, books, electricity, fuel, consultancy and recruitment services and a range of other products can be set out clearly in tender documentation, leaving the buyer room to judge the primary difference between suppliers, which is the price.  It has to be acknowledged that public procurement facilitates the State in being in a position to provide much needed public services in a sustainable manner.  Therefore, reducing the public buyers&rsquo; choices in assessing tenders could impact on the sustainability of such service provision.  The existing model reduces considerably the burden that would otherwise be carried, for instance, in respect of bureaucracy, if we had to treat each procurement process as separate.</p><p>Under EU law, the method used in evaluating tenders must be set out clearly at the start of the process.  The proposed legislation would, therefore, require a Minister or an Accounting Officer to become directly involved in developing the strategy for numerous procurement processes.  This would not be practical, as the Senator said.  It would not be possible to intervene at award stage because the methodology to be used in marking would have been decided and published as part of the tender documentation.  I think everybody accepts that if a Minister or an Accounting Officer was directly involved, it could lead to a situation where he or she would be wide open to allegations of improper interference in the procurement process.  While I know that is not the intention, it could, as Senator Horkan noted, be an unintended consequence.  It would be not be realistic to expect a Minister or an Accounting Officer to be in a position to develop detailed award criteria for all processes.  It would invariably lead to questions about the integrity of the process and political interference, perceived or otherwise, in individual spending decisions.  Therefore, a Minister should not be involved, as proposed in the Bill.  While I understand and appreciate the Senator intends to remove that provision on later Stages of the Bill, having Accounting Officers or accountable persons involved in the development and sanctioning of individual procurement processes raises similar issues.  These posts require a level of independence in order to be able to gauge and question the activities of officials reporting to them.  Everybody accepts that they have to be above reproach.  If they were required by law to be directly involved in procurement processes, this reporting line would be broken, creating a potential gap in accountability.  The legislation is not entirely clear on the reporting or declaration arrangements for the utilities sector which is largely privatised.</p><p>The Government is exploring the scope for the inclusion of social considerations in public contracts such as environmental sustainability, disability access and training for young or disadvantaged persons.  This arises specifically from an issue that was raised with me a number of months ago by former Senator Kathleen O'Meara which I took on board.  It is because of that very positive engagement with the former Senator that we have started to explore the inclusion of social considerations.  There might be an opportunity for me to update the House on what we are doing in that regard.  A cross-departmental social considerations advisory group has been established.  It brings together relevant officials from policy departments and procurement practitioners to promote and facilitate the incorporation of social considerations into public procurement projects.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This was done with the support and leadership of three Ministers of State, Deputy David Stanton, Deputy Finian McGrath and myself.  The group will give practical assistance to public buyers that wish to use public procurement to enable wider public policy considerations.  It held its first meeting on 12 March 2019.  Membership of the group is drawn from the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Rural and Community Development, Justice and Equality, Health, Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Housing, Planning and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Education and Skills for guidance on training issues.  The group's functions include the identification of social policy objectives that could be advanced through public procurement; matching some of those identified social objectives with suitable procurement opportunities, to be trialled on a pilot basis; and advising on the appropriate method for incorporating social considerations into frameworks and contracts.<br/><br/>The group will consider monitoring and reporting arrangements, which can be applied to future projects where social considerations are to be incorporated.  It will also advise on the development and implementation of strategies to communicate its work across the public sector, including any policy and training implications therefor.  If opportunities arise this framework and group provide a means of exploring them.<br/><br/>Public procurement in Ireland is governed by EU and national law and national guidelines.  The EU treaty principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination, transparency, mutual recognition, proportionality, free movement of goods and services and the right of establishment must be observed on all tenders.  All public procurement processes must comply with national legislation.  There is, therefore, no need to restate the requirement to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 as this is already the case.<br/><br/>Two articles in the directives also cover human rights issues.  Article 18 of the public procurement directive provides: </p><blockquote>Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that in the performance of public contracts economic operators comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or by the international environmental, social and labour law provisions listed in Annex X.</blockquote><p>Senator Nash rightly referred to this provision in his contribution.  He legitimately raised cases where people have been unfortunately mistreated in the public sector.  This is not unique to the public sector or to Ireland.  We must all work collectively to stamp this out. <br/><br/>In addition, Article 57 gives contracting authorities the right to exclude an economic operator where it has been the subject of a conviction by final judgment in a number of areas, including child labour and other forms of trafficking in human beings as defined in Article 2 of directive No. 2011/36/EU.  Extensive general guidance on conducting procurement in line with legal requirements is available to public authorities on the Irish portal for public procurement and the website of the OGP. <br/><br/>Staff involved in public procurement processes are required to be aware of the provisions of the various Acts, directives, regulations, policies and procedures that relate to their procurement area.Moreover, the OGP has developed standard template tender documentation which sets out obligations for the successful tenderer.  This strong regulatory regime, combined with a consistent application of procurement practices through the use of standard template documents, ensures that human rights are fully considered in a public procurement process.  That is notwithstanding the concerns that Senator Higgins raises.  However, I am sure she will accept that a lot of what she has raised could be covered in other legislation. <br/><br/>I understand that the Bill, which deals with the fundamental aspects of how the State procures, has not undergone a regulatory impact assessment.  In answer to Senator Hopkins' query, the Government's view is that this Bill would require a money message.  The Bill places an additional administrative burden on contracting authorities and limits options open to the State in seeking value for money on commonly acquired goods and services.  The measures proposed in it would call into question the audit trail of individual procurement processes and restrict the State's ability to provide services that represent value for money.<br/><br/>The Government appreciates the intention behind the Bill.  We have discussed it at length.  However, for the reasons I have set, it will abstain in the vote on the Bill.  This allows an opportunity to examine other options.  We appreciate the work that the Senator and her colleagues have done and the genuine and significant concerns that have been raised.  However, we have raised issues that could prevent the passage of the Bill.  I will abstain on it.  When it proceeds to further Stages, there will be an opportunity for us to have a discussion on it line by line.  <br/><br/>Many of the contributions rightly stemmed from some procurement processes have gone pear-shaped.  People often form their own analyses, thoughts and reflections on things that go wrong.  There is an awful lot about the current processes that goes right, particularly our engagement with representative organisations of the small and medium enterprises, SMEs, that are doing this work throughout the country on a daily basis.<br/><br/>Issues pertaining to construction have recently been raised.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I are acutely aware of that.  We are working on the medium-term review of the construction works management framework.  Reference has also been made to costs arising from the national children's hospital.  I accept that point.  However, nobody is suggesting an issue concerning quality.  Quality was referred to in one of the contributions. <br/><br/>The Government will abstain on the Bill so it will probably proceed to Committee Stage, which will give us an opportunity to discuss it further.  As I outlined earlier, we are in the middle of a review of procurement processes in a range of areas.  We have sought the views of Departments and State agencies.  We are going to engage with the lead spokespersons of the Opposition as part of that.  Anybody is free at any stage to bring forward a detailed Bill on these issues, as Senator Higgins has done.  Not everything we do is wrong.  Throwing glib comments around in the Seanad or the D&aacute;il about how the Government spends money on behalf of the taxpayer will not get us anywhere.</p></speech>

I am grateful for the support many have given to the Bill.  I wish to address a few of the points that arose.  I appreciate that if the Bill passes today we will have further opportunities to engage on it.</p> <p>It is important to be clear that quality is not balanced against value for money.  Rather, it is a part of value for money.  As the Minister of State mentioned the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, I took the liberty of checking its definition of value for money.  It is interesting to note that finding the lowest price is only one third of it.  The definition of value for money used by the Comptroller and Auditor General includes spending less, but spending effectively and wisely is equally important.  This Bill is an attempt to ensure that spending well and wisely is placed alongside spending less.  Those considerations are not in contradiction of the need to spend less, but alongside it, which is important.  This week, two or three committees are discussing procurement issues where problems were encountered.  These problems could be avoided if time was taken for a little more thought earlier in the procurement process. </p> <p>I wish to briefly address a couple of concerns.  There were questions regarding the criteria.  To be clear, there is no scope for the criteria to be discretionary.  They must be measurable, objective and clearly applicable to all who apply.  There are currently constraints on how criteria are applied and there is not much scope for discretion.</p> <p>There is concern that this would be used or manipulated.  Mention was made of tenderers who may be aware of the process.  At the moment those who are aware of the process know that all they have to do is tender an unrealistically low bid and if that is the lowest quoted cost, the contracting authority will be legally obliged to give them the contract.  As was described eloquently by Senator Horkan, this is despite the officials in the room knowing that it is not a quality bid.  This Bill seeks to address these issues upstream before any companies are involved and before there is a call for tenders.  It would take effect at the design stage of the tender to ensure that space to reflect on those issues is provided later when the call for tenders goes out and companies have applied.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I had already indicated that I intend to remove the reference to Ministers.  The Minister spoke of Accounting Officers being involved in detailed processes.  They would not be.  It would only be in what I would call exceptional cases, where lowest cost is being used in a very simple way, which will not be detailed, that an Accounting Officer would be involved.  In that case they would be involved simply in signing off on that decision.  It does not involve them in the process and they are not required to be involved.  Where quality is being used it would sit with the procurement officer.  I have talked with procurement officers who want to use quality measures, and sometimes feel nervous about whether they would be allowed to do that.  This would empower and encourage the appropriate level of procurement officers to go ahead and use quality measures in the right way.  It is an empowering piece.</p><p>The provision is at pre-call for tender and no companies are involved, so I do not believe there is the concern about company A, B or C.  This is before any company has bid, before the process is finished and before any involvement from an Accounting Officer has begun.</p><p>We are aware of the unintended consequences: we have seen them at lowest cost.  There is 2.4 times the benefit, which is back to the value for money issue.  This is what we have seen.  It is double the public benefit.  There were a few other issues but I will skip over most of them.</p><p>On the question regarding the Office of Government Procurement, it would not be in a position to reject a declaration but at least the rationale would have been published because the decision must sit within the discretion of the contracting authority.</p><p>I welcome that the Minister has indicated there is a national conversation under way on this.  It is very important.  The Minister referenced many of the stakeholders and I suggest that he may add another stakeholder.  As well as the companies and the contracting authorities, I would add the users of services to the list of stakeholders to ensure the users are heard, consulted with and given an invitation to talk about what it means to use adult diapers, to use a playground, to try to access a building and so on, and that this is reflected.  There is a real opportunity there.</p><p>Other Members have spoken about potential areas of exclusion such as poor employment standards, the non-payment of subcontractors and tax evasion.  That is another part of the procurement landscape, as are social clauses.  The Bill, which deals with design and criteria, will sit very well alongside proposals that other parties may bring around social clauses, social considerations and exclusions.  It does not attempt to do everything.  It is not attempting to intervene at one point in the process but I believe it will change the landscape, the practise and the culture.  It could change the experience of the public in a good way, as my colleague, Senator Ruane very eloquently noted, in respect of the trust the public has that their concerns and experience are cared about in procurement in Ireland.  I thank all Members who have supported this Bill.</p></speech>

This Bill was brought before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport in October 2018 for pre-legislative scrutiny, where we had a robust and constructive debate.  The Bill was published in November 2018 and passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in December.  It then passed through Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il in January and Report and Final Stages between February and March this year.  At all Stages, there has been constructive debate.  Deputies on all sides made valuable contributions and, as far as possible, I have worked to accommodate the amendments tabled from the beginning of the process.  I have accepted four Opposition amendments and I tabled a further 14 amendments which were either agreed with Deputies in advance or simply served to refine the wording of the Opposition amendments.  While there have been differences of opinion, the spirit of the engagement has been largely collaborative and I believe the current version of the Bill is greatly improved on the version first published.</p> <p>The main purpose of the Bill is to implement European Union Regulation 598/2014, which came into effect in June 2016.  This regulation sets out the rules and procedures regarding the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports.  As the regulation only applies to major EU international airports, based on traffic levels in Ireland, it only applies to Dublin Airport.  That is highly unlikely to change for the foreseeable future.  This Bill provides, for the first time, that noise generated by aircraft activity at the airport, including inbound and outbound flights, will be subject to extensive, detailed assessment, ongoing monitoring and regular review.  I propose to raise the bar for what the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, as the operator of Dublin Airport, is required to do to comply with noise rules.  This Bill is fundamentally about ensuring the sustainable development of the airport, which balances the ambitions of the DAA, the needs of business and tourism interests and the legitimate rights of local residents.</p> <p>As an island economy, we are heavily dependent on air connectivity and there is no doubt that the threat of Brexit on the horizon has brought that dependency into sharp relief.  At the same time, no reasonable Government can envisage unfettered development on pure economic interest grounds.  There have to be rules and regulations to ensure that all developments are justified, proportionate, appropriate and respectful of a broader range of criteria than simply economics.  This Bill provides for that broader perspective.  It respects existing planning and development and environmental laws and is underpinned by binding EU regulations and directives on environmental and aircraft noise.  It ensures that every time a planning application at Dublin Airport is considered, the aircraft noise implications will also be considered.</p> <p>Under Regulation 598, member states must designate a competent authority as the independent noise regulator, with responsibility for assessing noise, setting restrictions if required and monitoring and enforcing compliance.  In Ireland's case, Fingal County Council is to be designated as the independent noise regulator for Dublin Airport.  This is what the Government has decided and the Bill as passed in the D&aacute;il provides for that.  This designation has been the subject of extensive debate in the D&aacute;il, and during pre-legislative scrutiny.  Opposition Deputies have expressed concern that Fingal County Council is conflicted, largely because it receives rates from the airport authority, and there were also concerns that it did not have the required noise expertise.  I have addressed both of these issues head-on during the D&aacute;il debate, and I have also addressed them separately in parliamentary questions over recent months.  I do not believe there is substance in either of these points.</p></speech>

The fact that Fingal County Council raises some of its revenue income from commercial rates, and the fact that some of its rates income comes from the DAA, does not represent a conflict of interest in the context of the council being responsible for the regulation of aircraft noise at the airport.</p> <p>On the matter of resourcing and expertise, the council will establish a new, well-resourced, and dedicated aircraft noise regulation office within the executive branch, which will include the appropriate noise expertise.  The office will be headed at a senior level by a director of services, with all of the appropriate arrangements to ensure decisions are taken fully in accordance with the law.  By all reasonable, verifiable measures, there is a compelling case in favour of Fingal County Council.  I stand over the decision of the Government and the advice which underpins it.  It has been subject to extensive policy deliberation and legal scrutiny.  It is a robust and sound proposal.</p> <p>Any decision to be made by the council, in this role as noise regulator, will be evidence-based and will be fully in adherence with the requirements of national law and the EU regulation.  If it is anything other than this, then it will clearly be susceptible to challenge under the appeals process and-or judicial review.  That said, I have responded to concerns by agreeing to new provisions, passed in the D&aacute;il, for a regular periodic review of the performance of the noise regulator with regard to its functions under this Bill.  This review will take place within seven years of enactment, once a full cycle of the entire regulatory process, including any appeal, has been completed.  Furthermore, the noise regulator will be required to produce an annual report, detailing the work it has undertaken throughout the year and setting out its work programme for the following year.  This will be separate from, and in addition to, the annual report produced by Fingal County Council.  These new provisions were specifically included to address concerns raised by opposition Deputies in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>I would like to take Senators through some of the finer detail of the Bill.  At least once every five years, the noise regulator will undertake an assessment of the noise situation at the airport.  This will include taking into account future developments planned at the airport.  Where the noise regulator identifies a noise problem on foot of that assessment, it will adopt the so-called balanced approach.  The balanced approach is set out in the EU regulation and allows the regulator to decide what steps need to be taken by the airport authority to offset the impact of the noise.  It might mean more home insulation or adjustments to flight paths or it might require physical works to act as sound barriers.  That will be a matter for the regulator following its detailed assessment.  The balanced approach entails undertaking an analysis of the various measures available to reduce the level of identified noise through the exploration of four principle elements: noise reduction at source; land-use planning and management; noise abatement operational procedures; and operating restrictions as a last resort.  This process will be open and transparent.  There will be public consultation, and at each stage, the regulator will be required to publish information and evidence and keep all stakeholders abreast of developments.  Open consultation is an important aspect of the EU regulation which has been carried through to the Bill.  The draft decision will be accompanied by a report detailing how the decision was reached, which will include a non-technical summary.  This will ensure any individual will be in a position to input into the process and that the consultation will not be limited to those with technical expertise.</p> <p>This comprehensive assessment of noise by the regulator will involve consideration of the health impact of noise levels on local residents.  There was extensive debate on this issue during the D&aacute;il debates on Committee and Report Stages.  Some Deputies took the view that the Bill did not sufficiently reflect the importance of human health in the overall assessment of noise at the airport.  A number of amendments were put forward which they believed would address the perceived gap.  However, as I tried to explain during the debate, much of the commentary on the lack of reference to health in the Bill was based on a misreading of the Bill and of the underlying EU regulations and directives.  The Bill must be read in tandem with EU Regulation 598 and EU Directive 2002/49/EC, the environmental noise directive, because the noise regulator must have regard to all three of these in carrying out its regulatory assessment of noise.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In doing so, the regulator will have regard to the impact of aircraft noise on human health.  I tabled two amendments on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to highlight and make it more explicit that health aspects are to be considered by the noise regulator.  Two further amendments, however, which were passed in the D&aacute;il and which relate to the evaluation of health impacts on local residents, will need to be undone because they make the Bill legally unsound.  I will explain my rationale in greater detail on Committee Stage for seeking to remove these provisions. </p><p>The Bill also provides that where the airport authority applies to the planning authority to review and amend any current planning permissions, any such application will also require the input of the noise regulator before the planning authority makes a final decision.  This includes the current planning permission for the new runway, which has operating restrictions attached to it that reduce the number of allowable night-time flights.  It is well documented that the DAA views these operating restrictions as overly restrictive.  The Bill does not pre-empt any decisions that may be made by the noise regulator on the appropriateness of those restrictions if it has cause to review them.  It simply allows the noise regulator to examine all noise mitigation measures available, in line with the balanced approach, in order to mitigate any noise problem that may arise from the operation of the second runway.  Once it examines any application to review the operating restrictions attached to the second runway project if such an application is made, the noise regulator may determine that no change to the operating restrictions is needed, or decide on more onerous restrictions, or decide on an entirely new set of noise abatement measures.  That will be a matter for the new regulator. </p><p>Another aspect of Regulation 598/2014 is the requirement to designate an appeals body to provide for an appeals mechanism against decisions of the noise regulator.  To provide for alignment with the Planning and Development Act, the Bill designates An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the independent appeals body.  Where an appeal against a regulatory noise decision is made to the board, it will have 18 weeks to make a decision.  There is also provision for the board to undertake a 14-week public consultation process where it is of the view that there are alternative noise mitigation measures or operating restrictions other than those proposed by the noise regulator.  An appeal against a planning decision can also be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In the circumstances where a planning decision into which the noise regulator has input is appealed to the board, once again the board will have the power to decide on the most appropriate noise mitigation measures and operating restrictions, if any, that are to be introduced at Dublin Airport.  The Bill, therefore, sets out a process for a noise regulation regime that will allow for full stakeholder engagement, along with an independent appeals process which will provide certainty to stakeholders.  In essence, it sets out a structured approach to assessing and addressing aircraft noise at Dublin Airport with the objective of facilitating airport development and expansion in a way that minimises, as far as practicable, the noise impact of that expansion. </p><p>The Bill outlines monitoring and enforcement powers, another area in which important changes were made in the D&aacute;il to address concerns raised by Deputies.  Provision has been made to allow any person to request the noise regulator to review the effectiveness of noise mitigation measures, which will allow for a system where local residents, businesses and schools with genuine complaints have somewhere to go.  On foot of a commitment I made in the D&aacute;il, I will table a further amendment on Committee Stage to make it clear that the noise regulator must respond in writing to any request made to it to review the effectiveness of measures.  There will also be an onus on the airport authority to ensure it adheres to any decision of the noise regulator and that any measures are implemented effectively.  The airport authority will be required to produce an annual compliance report, to include a non-technical summary, which will be published by the regulator.  The regulator will monitor compliance and has the power to direct the airport authority and airport users, as necessary, to comply with any noise mitigation measures and operating restrictions, with recourse to the High Court for non-compliance.  This is the most effective method to ensure compliance. </p><p>The Bill also provides for other consequential amendments to the Planning and Development Act, one of which is the declassification of development at Dublin Airport as strategic infrastructure development for the purposes of planning applications.  This measure will mean that an application for planning permission for development at Dublin Airport will revert to being processed in the same way as most planning applications, that is, any application will be made to Fingal County Council in the first instance, with provision for appeal to the board against its decision.  This arrangement will facilitate the involvement of the noise regulator in the processing of a planning application that has a noise dimension, with a direct appeal to any such decision to be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>I will table a small number of further amendments on Committee Stage which will include commitments that I made during the Bill's passage through the D&aacute;il.  Ultimately, Regulation 598/2014 is intended to ensure that major European airports are developed in a sustainable manner and are subject to oversight and scrutiny in respect of planning, environmental laws and noise levels.  The Bill will ensure that Ireland has an airport noise regulatory regime that is compliant with EU law and which meets international best practice.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-03a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040300002#CC00200"><p>I thank the Minister for appearing in the House to present the legislation.  We will reluctantly support the Bill to aid the development of the airport, although we share the concerns of many of the residents around the airport and in wider Fingal in respect of the manner in which the Government has approached the establishment of what it claims is an independent regulator.  Ireland will become one of only three countries in the EU which, when transposing the legislation, have given the local authority the responsibilty.  The Minister pointed out that the local authority is a large rate payer but argued that there will not be a conflict of interest.  It is the definition of a conflict of interest, however, that the people who pay the regulator a sizeable portion of their annual budget would be monitored by the same organisation.  As we know, the Irish Aviation Authority was originally intended to be the designated body but that was proven to be unlawful.</p> <p>While all the arguments on the importance of the airport have been made well, we will again table amendments that we tabled in the D&aacute;il and expand on them.  Since 2016, we have spoken about the issue of the noise regulator and which body it should be.  We have expressed our concerns time and again that the power will rest with the local authority, and we are concerned that it is being made such a large part of the local authority's responsibilities, given that there will be a director of services.  Having considered the other options, we believe such a role is unnecessary and will not provide the necessary balance for the independence that we, or anyone else, would require.  The requirement to have recourse to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is specifically mentioned in the Bill as a result of amendments we tabled.</p> <p>We would like to hear again the Minister's views on the ability of people to access funding, on how much will be made available for those directly affected or whose properties may have been directly affected, on the target, which will almost double the amount of air traffic approaching Dublin Airport, on the flight path adjustments and on the capacity of the new authority to impose the changes.  In light of the fact that once the runway is built, the flight path adjustments will be quite limited, I wonder what scope there will realistically be for the regulator to do anything in that regard.  When we table those amendments, we hope the Minister will reconsider them in order that we can make more progress on shaping the Bill.  As I stated, we are not happy with the alleged independence, which is the kernel of the issue.  While an ability to appeal decisions surrounding the legislation is important, that the referee will be paid by the airport leads us to be concerned that the legislation does not contain even the cover of independence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The reason it is being proposed the Irish Airport Authority be designated is airport authorities are being and have been used in other jurisdictions as the mechanism to ensure independence, but there is too much scope for people to be justifiably concerned in Fingal County Council being chosen.  Dublin Airport employs 20,000 people and there are a further 114,000 indirect jobs linked with it.  We would like to see that number expanded.  We would like to see more jobs being created, but the kernel of our concern about this necessary infrastructure is the ability of citizens to make sure their rights will be protected by a fair referee.</p><p>The Minister has accepted amendments we have brought forward.  Please bear in mind that this is a slow process.  Planning permission to build the second runway was granted in 2007.  Nearly 12 years later the issue of noise is still being considered in the context of why it cannot be done by the Irish Aviation Authority.  If it is not legally sound, surely there must be somebody else available.  The Fingal County Council issue is the source of the gravest concern for citizens who believe they will not be listened to because of the fact that there is so much money involved.  That is the only issue.  Other than the fact that the airport is located in Fingal, no one would have a problem because then we would be able to say there was no direct tie or link between the two bodies, but, ultimately, there is.   It has taken 12 years to get where we are, even though, as I said, planning permission for the second runway was granted in 2007 and the directive was issued in 2014.  There have been huge arguments and we continue to argue about the need for legislation.  The Government stated it was not necessary, but that has proved not to be the case.  Now we are dragging our heels again.  It is taking quite some time to deal with it, but we will table the amendments mentioned.  As I said, we have engaged with the residents and, as a party, listened to their concerns and included them in amendments where it is legally possible to do so.  We have listened to the people who will be directly affected by noise and who will need to have their homes insulated.  For the people who need to have their properties and quality of life protected, the issues need to be expanded on further.  We must ensure Fingal County Council has the capacity to address them not just for the residents in its area but also for those not in its area but who will be directly affected.  </p><p>We will bring forward further amendments to the Bill which we reluctantly support because of the common good elements, given the necessity for this piece of infrastructure, as the Minister pointed out, to ensure the connectivity of Ireland to the world and in the light of Brexit and of all of the other issues we need to face.  Expanding the economy and having an airport like Dublin which has the ability to service the needs of a growing economy should not be at the cost and expense of the citizens living around it.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister for making himself available today to engage in a discussion prior to the debate.  It is certainly reassuring that both he and his officials are willing to listen and engage.</p> <p>I am delighted to see in the presentation made by the Minister that economic factors will not be the sole drivers of development at Dublin Airport.  That aspect of the Bill is commendable and it is reassuring because so much can be driven against people's wishes purely on an economic basis. </p> <p>I know from my engagement with the Minister today that he has engaged with residents.  However, there is a small cohort in St. Margaret's whom I believe need further engagement with him or his officials.  I met four of them in the early hours of yesterday morning when I went to the area to experience the noise levels for myself.  There is no doubt that the noise levels in aircraft taking off every five minutes or thereabouts are hard to take.  We were in the sittingroom of a newly built house which was well insulated, with PVC windows, when a large jet took off and one could not hear anybody else speak.  Therefore, noise is a serious problem.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-03a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040300002#DD00300"><p>The residents pointed out that there was an option to have their properties bought to remove them from the flight path.  I believe the deal is the valuation of the property plus 30% which, on the face of it, is generous, but two issues remain to be teased out.  Who will value the property?  Will the property valued as one that is on the flight path or as one that would be worth X amount if it were located somewhere else, with 30% being added?</p> <p>The Minister will be happy to know that the residents whom I met were satisfied that the amendment brought forward in the D&aacute;il to restrict the decibel count to 45 by day and 40 by night, on average, would be unworkable.  They were satisfied that the limits would simply not work and were willing to agree to negotiate on a change.  They were talking of a figure of 65 decibels by day being stipulated, but wanted the figure of 40 decibels by night, on average, to be retained.  During my visit to the area we looked at some readings and, I think, the highest I saw was 88.7 decibels.</p> <p>The next issue I want to discuss is that of the regulator.  As my colleague pointed out, the IAA was taken out of the equation because of a legal difficulty.  The residents have a difficulty in understanding how a local authority that annually collects &euro;29 million in rates could be regarded as independent when it comes to having the noise regulator on its staff.  The residents need further reassurance in that regard.  I know from speaking to the Minister today that many of the issues surrounding noise levels are already covered in European Union directives, but the position needs to be explained to residents in the area.  I take the opportunity to ask the Minister whether he is willing to arrange for his officials to meet the specific group of residents in St. Margaret's whom I met to reassure them in that regard.  </p> <p>Night flights seem to be a source of particular concern.  The residents told me some harrowing stories about the difficulties encountered in maintaining sleep patterns.  Sleep deprivation is a problem and we must consider the matter.  I have also heard there are difficulties in local schools in not being able to keep windows open during the day.  We have got to do something about that issue as we simply cannot have people living in sealed boxes.</p> <p>It is great that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has an appeals mechanism.  I remember being a member of a residents' association in the west.  As the chairman wanted to appeal everything, we spent our lives paying solicitors.  That is not the way to move forward.  I would much prefer to see engagement with local people and local representatives in order to have a very clear path painted for them with respect to appeals mechanisms.</p> <p>The point was made to me that when the second runway was constructed, the flight path would be over a large housing estate.  As I did not view the area, I cannot be 100% certain on the claim made, but if there will a large housing estate on the flight path, will it cause serious problems?  Are people expected to live their lives in sealed boxes?  </p> <p>The residents in the area I visited maintained that a roundabout in it had to be resurfaced on a regular basis because of the damaged caused by pollution pumped on top of it from aircraft taking off.  In other words, they had to contend with the surface of the roundabout becoming skiddy every couple of months.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

I wonder if we could organise something along those lines, even at this late stage, in order to facilitate the passage of this Bill.  Everybody accepts that the passage of this Bill is important for the development of the airport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-03a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1421" speakername="James Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040300002#EE00300"><p>I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to let me know when I have one minute left.  I welcome the Minister and I welcome the Bill.  I thank Senator O'Mahony for the opportunity to take the Bill on behalf of Fine Gael and the Government.  He is tied up in the sports committee.  There is concern in the constituency of Dublin Fingal about this, in St. Margaret's and Portmarnock.  The people of Ireland and Fingal need a regulator but we also need our airport as it is critical to the economic future of Ireland and Fingal.  I join with Senator Craughwell in hoping the Minister can get his officials to meet with community groups to address their concerns.</p> <p>The Bill is a consequence of EU Regulation No. 598/2014 and its transposition into Irish legislation.  It proposes the appointment of Fingal County Council as regulator.  In the short time I have open to me, I cannot go through all the notes I have but there was concern within the council itself as to whether it was suitable as an authority for noise regulation.  The council wrote a letter and all the issues, including that of independence, were fully examined and worked through using legal advice.  Issues of competencies and resources were also addressed at the time and they were all examined, discussed and addressed before bringing the recommendation of Fingal County Council to Government in January 2018.</p> <p>In October 2018, Fingal County Council issued a statement clarifying that, while it did previously express concerns about taking the role, having worked with the Department those concerns had been satisfactorily addressed.  Fingal County Council added that it had a track record of performing the role of competent authority in areas such as planning and environment and does it in an independent and transparent way.  Fingal is best placed for the role of noise regulator as it has existing responsibility for environmental regulation and for planning, as stated.  Furthermore, it has experience of managing large and effective public consultations and there is no other suitable body that combines all the attributes of Fingal County Council in this respect.</p> <p>I remind Senator Craughwell that Fingal County Council is elected by the people of Fingal.  Perhaps the airport will have concerns about a conflict of interest there.  The Senator suggests that it is conflicted because its rates are collected by Fingal but is he suggesting that the Medical Council is conflicted because all its fees are paid for by doctors, even though it has a lay majority?</p> <p>The previous speaker acknowledged that the amendment put down by Deputy Clare Daly would have severe consequences for jobs at Dublin Airport and the surrounding communities.  The World Health Organization guidelines that were inserted in the Airport Noise (Dublin Airport) Regulation Bill 2018 are just that - guidelines.  I understand they have not been fully assessed by Europe yet and are not in operation at any international airport in Europe, or any other airport in the world to my knowledge.  According to Airports Council International, ACI, the WHO guidelines will not be attained or reached by infrastructural changes at the top 20 European airports.  The WHO recognises that the limited evidence base on the health effects of environmental noise interventions is thinly spread.  I fully agree with this finding and strongly support the WHO&rsquo;s call for further research on the effectiveness of interventions.  The foreword to the WHO document states that they are not standard or legally binding criteria.  They are guidelines that can only be attained by severely curtailing flying activity, according to the ACI report addressing the future of aviation noise.</p> <p>Dublin Airport employs over 19,000 people directly, 80% of them in Fingal, and a further 98,000 are indirectly employed in related industries.  In total, 47,200 people are employed in Fingal as a result of economic activity at Dublin Airport.  Deputy Daly&rsquo;s amendment would threaten the livelihoods of tens of thousands of families in the Fingal area.  If passed, Deputy Daly&rsquo;s amendment would necessitate a massive relocation of people from areas close to Dublin Airport.  If similar measures were enforced in other European city airports such as Madrid Airport, this would mean an exclusion zone of 40 km, and it would mean 70 km at Frankfurt.  To achieve the WHO guidelines in Frankfurt would mean 890 flights a day would be cut to ten.  It is clearly not tenable.</p> <p>I believe we need a more measured approach to noise pollution.  Dublin Airport is going to be even more important to Ireland as we move into a post-Brexit space.  For every 1 million passengers an additional 1,200 new jobs are created.  Dublin Airport has thrived and grown under successive Fine Gael-led Governments and this Minister, with passenger numbers growing from 18 million per annum in 2010 to an expected 32 million this year.</p> <p>I understand the very real concerns in certain local parts of Fingal regarding noise from Dublin Airport.  That is why we need a noise regulator to look at best practice internationally.  It is to protect the citizens of Fingal from unnecessary noise pollution.  I support the appointment of a noise regulator, so residents and, indeed, businesses can have a port of call to seek independent assistance if there are problems with noise pollution in their area.  However, we need to remove this unrealistic amendment from the proposed legislation and let the airport noise regulators get on with designing bespoke, realistic solutions for noise regulation in the vicinity of Dublin Airport and protect both people from excessive noise and jobs and economic activity in Fingal.  There is potential for a further 18,000 new jobs at Airside in Swords, which is only eight minutes from the airport.  Fingal County Council and IDA Ireland will be marketing this to large foreign direct investment companies which require an airport link, just like Kellogg, which has moved into new offices at Airport Central at Dublin Airport.</p> <p>I will be supporting the Minister&rsquo;s amendment to remove this unrealistic proposal from the legislation, which would put Fingal's regional plans, and indeed national development plans, at risk.  As the Minister said, this amendment would pre-empt the outcome of an EU policy making process.  It is not a question of whether the guidelines are right or wrong, it is about what is possible and implementable and what the timeframe and cost would be.  It would also pre-empt the work of the noise regulator, which needs to be free to set what it believes to be the right levels, etc.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.  We urgently need a noise regulator to protect citizens from noise pollution.</p></speech>

It is incredible that the Minister has dithered on such an important issue, particularly to the local community and the airport authorities.  Certainty and confidence in the community and in airport managers are crucial elements for the north Dublin communities and for the airport's future development, in terms of support from the local community.  They live there and hear the regular, thunderous, nerve-jangling roars of flights taking off and landing, and of the environmental pollution it causes which we know will increase and which will affect not only their well-being but their physical health, in the form of respiratory diseases.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The future development of the airport is also co-dependent, more so on the community than on a noise regulator.  The Minister needs to bring the local community along with him as well as the DAA.  A harmonious tripartite relationship between the local community, the authority and the Minister or a noise regulator who will act in his stead is needed.  It needs to be respectful and collaborative.  It is this relationship that the Minister has undermined effectively by his inept handling of the appointment of a regulator.  I do not know if he realises there are health and well-being issues, which we have discussed, facing this community.  There are all the more real as we look towards an uncertain future in terms of our health and the pollution of our planet.  I hope this has not being overlooked and has been taken on board.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in and the local community are well informed of what is going on.  They are well aware of the health implications of noise and environmental pollution and the importance of noise abatement plans.  We proposed two amendments to the Bill, which were accepted, which place the health and well-being of the community to the fore, where they should stay.  My experience living on the southside of Dublin of the building of the national children's hospital, which it is perceived will involve another ten years of construction and consequence noise, is that members of communities and I have come to realise that we are not powerless, that we have something to say about the impact on such works on our neighbourhoods and on the areas where we live and work, and that we will be heard loud and clear.  The communities of north Dublin realise this and they will exercise their right of participation in our democracy.  They will no longer be easily appeased.  That applies across the board for any planning, construction or change in significant infrastructure in our country.  </p><p>At face value, the appointment of a noise regulator, in keeping with the EU regulation, appears to be a straightforward matter.  The regulation requires Dublin Airport, now that it is over a certain size, to appoint a noise regulator.  The issue was complicated when the Minister failed to appreciate basic ground rules with respect to the expertise required and the remit of a noise regulator.  Expertise is essential.  That expertise will have to be acquired over time because this is the first time the airport has been directed to appoint such a regulator.  We have all experienced learning curves and what will be involved for the noise regulator and what we will have to do will be a learning curve.  </p><p>Of equal importance is the requirement that the noise regulator will have to be independent and seen to be so.  My  Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Deputy Imelda Munster, suggested that the Commission of Aviation Regulation was such a body but that was ignored.  Other suggestions were made but they were also ignored.  Instead the Minister decided that Fingal County Council should be the noise regulator, yet the council has no record in the area of aviation and it is also in receipt of 8% of its annual rates revenue from the airport.  I would call that an obvious conflict of interest.</p><p>On those two crucial tests, that of independence and expertise, Fingal County Council does not meet the requirements.  These comments are in no way a criticism of the council's staff.  They have provided and continue to provide an excellent service , often in the face of the difficult challenge of limited resources which restrain what they can do, but they have served the public well in Fingal.  </p><p>My comments are a criticism of the Minister.  I would have expected him to learn a lesson from the mistake made from the first choice for the noise regulator, which was the IAA.  This did not work out.  Then he casually shifted toward Fingal County Council and now he has decided to stubbornly dig in rather to listen to other voices advising him to appoint an independent noise regulator.  This is a serious matter and certainly the people of north Dublin believe it is be so.  They will be looking in on this debate this afternoon.  They are looking to their elected representatives to support them and their concerns about this issue.  They are clear that Sinn F&eacute;in is supporting them and we are arguing on their behalf and suggesting and supporting amendments to the Bill that are mindful of the health and well-being of the community.  Representations have been made not only to the elected representatives on the northside of Dublin but to Deputy Imelda Munster's office as far away as County Louth.  I have extended family and friends and they have a conflict in this respect.  It relates to what Senator Reilly said about the members of the  community who live in the vicinity of the airport and work in it at all levels ranging from senior to not so senior.  That are conflicted but they are determined in respect of the outcome of their deliberations.  The issue is not only about jobs but about the lives of those in the community, the rearing of children and children going to school, and people being healthy and continuing to be healthy.  People's jobs supports that type of lifestyle but the priority has to be that one's health is one's wealth.  </p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il has not come out of this debate well.  It is supporting the mulish approach of the Minister.  Residents are understandably angry at him and want their elected representatives to listen to their opinions and respond to them.  They have our support.  It is important for Fianna F&aacute;il and others to support the community and convince the Minister to listen to the concerns of the local people, to change his stance and appoint a noise regulator who has the confidence of all those concerned about this important issue.</p></speech>

He spoke about being in a newly built house.  Why are houses being built in this area in the first place?  It is madness.  How are people getting planning permission to build them?  It is a complete nonsense.  In this country we seem to be building houses on floodplains, in places where there is airport noise pollution and so on.  This is quite extraordinary.  There are impacts on health from such noise pollution, despite what Senator Reilly said.  It has significant ill-effects on the health of a population, including with respect to children's cognition and learning, cardiovascular health, sleep disturbance and annoyance.</p><p>I notice that the Minister just stated that Fingal County Council is to be designated as the independent noise regulator.  He made a robust defence of this and suggested there is no conflict of interest.  Even in his own contribution there is a conflict of interest.  One of the areas over which the council is charged is land use, planning and management.  This is classic.  It could not be clearer.  There is a conflict of interest.  I have to say, with very engaging honesty, Fingal County Council has acknowledged this.  Senator Reilly referred to a letter that was written by Ms AnnMarie Farrelly, director of services, planning and strategic infrastructure department, Fingal County Council.  She states:</p><blockquote>In the light of the existing complex and varied role that Fingal County Council plays, as outlined above, it is considered that the Council may not be best placed to act as the 'Competent Authority' for the purpose of the implementation of the Regulation 598/14 with particular reference to clause 13.  Clause 13 states that <i>&quot;The competent authority responsible for adopting noise-related operating restrictions should be independent of any organisation involved in the airport's operation, air transport or air navigation service provision, or representing the interests thereof and of the residents living in the vicinity of  the airport.  This should not be understood as requiring Member States to modify their administrative structures of decision-making procedures.&quot;</i></blockquote> <p>In other words the council is saying it is not independent.  </p></speech>

First, it is not independent and, second, it does not have the capacity or the capability to do this.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Of course there is a conflict.  The council has a conflict of interest in that it is shaping the future of the airport via the Fingal development plan and the Dublin Airport local area plan, which are two of its reserved functions.  It is responsible for determining planning applications at Dublin Airport, some of which may relate to caveats concerning operating restrictions there.<br/><br/>The letter acknowledges that Fingal does not have the requisite competencies in the area of &quot;aviation operations, noise and economic feasibility assessments&quot;.  The council receives &euro;29 million in rates from the airport campus.  It received a development levy of &euro;21 million for the new north runway.  What could be a clearer conflict of interest?  The council has enormous economic interest in this.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 85, which the Minister has impugned, provides that &quot;The competent authority shall direct the airport authority to ensure that average noise exposure is reduced below 45dBL, and night noise exposure below 40dBL&quot;.  I note that the World Health Organization, WHO, has stated:</p><blockquote>For average noise exposure, the GDG strongly recommends [not just recommends, Members will note, but strongly recommends] reducing noise levels produced by aircraft to below 45 dB L, as aircraft noise above this level is associated with adverse health effects.</blockquote><p>Moreover, the WHO has stated:</p><blockquote>For night noise exposure, the GDG strongly recommends reducing noise levels produced by aircraft during night time to below 40 dB L, as night-time aircraft noise above this level is associated with adverse effects on sleep.</blockquote><p>With regard to night-time noise it states:</p><blockquote>To reduce health effects, the GDG strongly recommends that policy-makers implement suitable measures to reduce noise exposure from aircraft in the population exposed to levels above the guideline values for average and night noise exposure.</blockquote><p>Noise control maps around the airport are only produced from 50 dB upwards.  Assistance with noise reduction measures, such as insulation, is only available in areas with a noise level over 63 dB.  Although the difference may not seem that great, I must make a very interesting point.  The average layperson will not appreciate that every increase of 10 dB represents a doubling of the loudness perceived by the human ear.  Therefore 50 dB is twice as loud as 40 dB and 60 dB is four times as loud as 40 dB.  My correspondent took measurements of noise levels with a calibrated sound monitor and recorded levels above 80 dB in a house where levels had been rated between 50 and 55 dB.  The rating is based on an average.  That means there is a peak of 80 dB, which is 16 times the loudness of 40 dB.<br/><br/>With regard to the question of people living in the area, I am astonished that they are still building new houses.  It is an extraordinary abrogation of the planning process.  One of my informants objects to Fingal County Council being made the competent body and talks about the victory it has had.  She is the fourth generation of her family to live in the area.</p></speech>

It is very clear that Fingal County Council has skin in the game if it receives &euro;29 million in rates.  Everybody in this House wants to protect Dublin Airport and its investment, but we have to take into consideration the local residents and the impact on them.  They must be treated fairly.  As Senator Norris pointed out, the WHO has raised significant concerns.  I wish to be associated with those comments.</p><p>I am quite concerned about Fingal Country Council being the regulator.  Another section of a letter from Ms AnnMarie Farrelly of Fingal County Council concerned the matter of independence.  She wrote:</p><blockquote>In this regard, and again in the context of clause 13, it may be that other independent bodies, which do not hold conflicting responsibilities in the provision of other functions that influence the development of Dublin Airport, should be considered for appointment as 'Competent Authority' for the purpose of Regulation.</blockquote> <p>The local authority itself clearly recognises that it may have a conflict of interests.  This also undermines the confidence of the local community in the regulator.</p></speech>

Many of the points that must be made have been addressed already.  I welcome the appointment of a regulator.  It is clearly necessary.  Obviously the development of Dublin Airport will provide thousands of jobs.  A huge percentage of workers there live in north Dublin, near to the airport.  It is important to point out that any decisions made by regulators can be appealed by local residents.  We are seeking a compromise, because the airport is clearly not going anywhere.  Citizens' concerns must be listened to.</p> <p>My colleague asked me to clarify that there were two letters from Fingal County Council which should be on the record.  I understand that Senator Norris and probably Senator Humphreys were referring to a letter dated November 2017.  In October 2018, Fingal County Council issued a statement clarifying that while it had previously expressed concerns about taking on the role, it had worked with the Department and those concerns had been satisfactorily addressed.  It is important to make that point.</p> <p>Moreover, the health issues are clearly very subjective.  Overall, the WHO recognises that the limited evidence on the health effects of environmental noise interventions is thinly spread.  The constituency of my colleague, Senator Reilly, is much closer to the airport, but I have had correspondence from people living as far away as Baldoyle about the difficulties they experience, including interrupted sleep and difficulty functioning.  It is important that we bear them in mind.  It shows how subjective all of this is.  That needs to be taken into account.</p> <p>Having heard what others have said and having looked at the issue, a noise regulator is badly needed.  Ideally, it would be an independent body.  Perhaps that is not feasible due to the cost implications that might arise.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether it could be envisaged in the future.  As in any other area, independence is very important.  I have always been very impressed by Fingal County Council and the professional manner in which it goes about its business, but it would be ideal for the regulator to be independent.  I am very interested in the Minister's comments in this regard.  I will not delay other speakers' contributions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-03a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1376" speakername="Lorraine Clifford Lee" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040300002#GG00800"><p>I would like to add my voice to the concerns about the development of Dublin Airport and the additional runway, which I have been raising continually since my election to the Seanad.  I refer to the effect on the surrounding areas, specifically St. Margaret's, Portmarnock, Kinsealy and Malahide.  As the Minister knows, I lived in Portmarnock for several years.  I invited the Minister to my home to experience for himself the noise difficulties experienced in that area.  It is having a significant impact on people's health, well-being and safety.  I would like the Minister to engage further, even at this late stage, with the local community and the officials in his Department to find a solution to this.  Jobs are important and Dublin Airport is very important to north County Dublin, but communities and people's lives and well-being are also very important.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The other transport infrastructure around the airport also needs to be upgraded in conjunction with the development of the airport.  I would like the Minister to discuss with the local communities how we can all move forward with this.  We know how important Dublin Airport is for the development of the whole economy and country, but the country is made up of more than just the economy; it is also about communities.</p><p>I want to specifically refer to the people living in St. Margaret's who have been made quite a low offer by the DAA in regard to the buying out of their properties.  Senator Craughwell referred to this offer already, which is the value of the house plus 30%.  As he pointed out, it is very hard to value a house that is on a flight path.  The more correct way of dealing with this would be the replacement value of that house plus a premium on top.  I appeal to the Minister at this late stage to liaise with the DAA and to make better offers to these people.  In the grand scheme of things, it is not going to be a huge additional cost but it would transform the lives of those people, who have been living under threat for a number of years.</p><p>Many colleagues have referred to the shambolic handling of the noise regulation directive.  This shambolic handling has resulted in treating the local communities with contempt, which is all I can call it.  The Minister first indicated that the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, would be appointed and the authority began making plans to fulfil that role.  He also maintained that primary legislation would not be needed but the Attorney General then advised that the IAA was not suitable and that legislation would, in fact, be needed.  That put further doubt on the Minister's plans and, again, treated the local communities with contempt.</p><p>We raised the need to appoint a competent authority on 25 occasions between late 2016 and late 2018 and these requests were constantly ignored by the Government.  Delay and incompetence prevailed.  All parties have tried to work with the Government to improve this Bill.  A number of amendments were put forward in the D&aacute;il and we will be tabling further amendments in the Seanad.</p><p>We have serious concerns with Fingal County Council being appointed.  Senator Noone said it would be ideal for an independent body to be appointed as the competent authority.  It is not that it is ideal; it is essential that there is independence.  Clearly, Fingal County Council is not independent, it does not have the expertise and it is not enthusiastic about it.  I deal with people in Fingal County Council all the time and know they are not enthusiastic about this new role.  I would like the Minister to outline what supports and extra resources he is going to provide to Fingal County Council in order that it can perform this role adequately.</p><p>I would like the Minister to meet with the residents, sit down and see how we can all move forward.  This airport development is very important for north County Dublin and the country, and the local communities are just as important.</p></speech>

I know the Minister and his officials have been available generally to assist us in this regard.  While I was not present for the Minister's speech, I have read it thoroughly.  There is probably not a lot I can say that has not been said by others but I want to echo, in particular, aspects of the contributions of Senators Craughwell and Norris.</p> <p>Like others, I have been in touch with people who feel directly concerned about this.  We are all aware of how important our economic future and well-being is to the country and how central to our economic and social and cultural life Dublin Airport is.  This is a classic case of the hard choices that legislators have to make when trying to identify and follow through on the common good, which is to say, to promote business, enterprise and the proper and effective functioning of an airport, on the one hand, while at the same time ensuring people's welfare and that those most directly affected are properly heard and their needs properly addressed.</p> <p>Like others, I have been in touch with people living in St. Margaret's and I want to reflect some of the concerns they continue to have.  While they are supportive of the developments and of the new runway at the airport, they feel their interests are not being sufficiently protected and they still do not feel sufficiently consulted around mitigation measures regarding noise pollution, traffic and so on.  In general, they are not impressed by what is proposed to be done for them in terms of insulation schemes, buy-out schemes, adjustment to flight paths and, possibly, sound barriers, which are all part of the balanced approach the Minister described in his speech.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell brought out an important point about the value of houses, where people would be allowed to relocate, and Senator Clifford-Lee has asked questions about whether the baseline should be the value of the house or the replacement value.  Even there, I wonder can this properly address the difficulty, given the housing situation, of finding accommodation that is equivalent to what people already have in terms of transport links, quality of life and all the other criteria.  More needs to be done and said in that area.</p> <p>Of course, there is the question of the independence of Fingal County Council as the independent noise authority for the airport.  The Minister said what he said and he is clearly of the view there is not a conflict of interest.  However, the issue remains of serious concern to residents, who point out, as others have in the House, that the income in the form of rates directly from the airport, and from various businesses servicing the airport, means it simply cannot be an independent player in all of this.  I was thinking recently of the debate in Britain whereby it is proposed to split up the big four accountancy and auditing firms, and to separate out the consulting side of the house from the accounting and auditing side of the house, but the question remains whether it is really possible to get completely solid Chinese walls.  The Minister went to considerable pains in his speech to say there is not a conflict of interest yet I did not hear him use the word "independent" in the context of the noise regulation office.  Can it be ensured that there would be absolutely no chilling effect on the role of the noise regulation office, having regard to the financial and other connections with the airport and related businesses?</p> <p>With regard to the number of night-time flights, the Minister is not on board with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which has restricted the number of night-time flights to 65 movements per night.  While I understand the Minister's position, we cannot reckon enough with the concerns of people.  We had a similar debate in the context of people affected by wind turbines and we discussed just how destructive this can be of people's quality of life.  It really is an important issue.</p> <p>With regard to insulation schemes, I want to quote my correspondent.  She pointed out the DAA is not proposing to allow heat exchange systems to be installed in houses and this effectively means that if people want to sleep at night, they cannot open their windows.  Think back to last summer, when opening your windows was a necessity, not a luxury, she says, yet this is something facing residents due to inadequate nature of the insulation programme on offer.  She again decries the lack of negotiation, as she sees it.</p> <p>In recent times, we had all sorts of talk about what the World Health Organisation had to say and how important it was to heed it.  The Minister himself talked about the noise regulator operating on an evidence base.  If the WHO says that certain levels of noise are dangerous, do we take that seriously or not?  That is a very fundamental question at the heart of all of this.</p></speech>

They echo a large number of the problems that were expressed in the D&aacute;il.  Everybody is very keen to represent the views of residents, which I greatly appreciate.  It is a pity to hear people making accusations against the Minister and saying that I am not listening to the views of residents.  I presume they are not aware of the fact that I have received numerous delegations of residents.  To suggest that we have not listened to them at a very early stage is just misleading.  The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has also been involved in a great deal of dialogue, as have my officials.  We have at all times taken its views very seriously.  The entire purpose of this Bill is to use a balanced approach to reconcile the obvious difficulties we have to bring together the interests of keeping the airport running - it is a vital piece of infrastructure - as well as not making the lives of residents more uncomfortable.  It is difficult to square, but we have made the best possible efforts.  This Bill represents many years of hard work to that end.</p> <p>To those who were critical of the delays I say again that those delays were not of the Government's making but were created elsewhere.  They may have happened for good reason, but I understand the frustrations people had because of these delays and the uncertainty that has been brought into their lives.  We all recognise the contribution Dublin Airport makes to the national economy and the greater Dublin area and the fact that all parties are keen to see the airport thrive in a measured and sustainable way.  That is what I am trying to achieve.</p> <p>The balanced approach process, which is international best practice and endorsed by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization and adopted by EU regulations, is being embedded into our own planning and development system.  By doing so, we are establishing a consistent approach to the introduction of noise mitigation measures and operating restrictions associated with any development at Dublin Airport.  The process is highly transparent and open.  There is extensive information sharing and extensive stakeholder engagement and public consultation.  All information consulted upon will be accompanied by a non-technical summary report which will allow any person who wishes to do so to participate in the process, to contribute and to challenge as he or she sees fit.  There will also be continual monitoring of noise at Dublin Airport to ensure compliance with the measures and limitations that the noise regulator decides upon.  It should be noted that the regulator has the necessary powers of enforcement.  To my mind this is a fair Bill which takes on board the competing interests and rights of all stakeholders.  It does not favour any one interested party over the other, it has strong transparency and public consultation and it has a strong appeals mechanism.</p> <p>As I said in opening, this is complex legislation, but I hope that my statement today has brought Members some clarity around the process.  In the time I have left, I will deal with some of the issues that have been raised.  The main issue raised was the independence of Fingal County Council.  I guarantee the House that I will deal with the rest of the issues on Committee Stage, when those who raised the issues today are here again.  To reiterate, I totally and utterly reject the argument that there is a perceived conflict of interest from Fingal County Council because of the rate it receives from the DAA.  Those who say the DAA pays commercial rates are correct, but I do not accept that this would somehow influence the council in its role as independent noise regulator.  Any decision to be made by the council in this role will be evidence-based and fully in adherence with the requirements of the EU regulation.  If it was anything other than this, it would clearly be susceptible to challenge under the appeals mechanism or by judicial review.  Stakeholder engagement has been provided at every stage.  Once Deputies have had a chance to examine fully each section of the Bill on Committee Stage, their concerns about any perceived conflict will be allayed.</p> <p>Many people in this House and in the Lower House have second-guessed the Attorney General.  The Office of the Attorney General, or the Attorney General himself, made a decision that the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, was not independent.  The same office made a decision that Fingal was independent.  We accepted the decision of the Attorney General in the case of the IAA with great reluctance because we were ready to press ahead.  Similarly, when the Attorney General's office came to us with a finding on Fingal County Council that it was independent, we accepted that.  Had I decided, as some members of this House wrongly want me to, that the Attorney General was wrong in the second case and foisted a noise regulator on the nation in spite of his advice, this House would rightly be criticising me.  I would be told that I was taking a risk with a noise regulator that I had been advised was subject to legal challenge.  That is not a decision I was likely to take, nor is it one I am going to take.  Senator Mullen, as a lawyer, will understand that.  If the Attorney General advises me on one thing and I take his or her advice, and then he advises me on another similar matter-----</p></speech>

To be clear, once a regulatory decision is made by the noise regulator, that is not the end of the process.  Some Senators were under the impression that it was.  As mentioned, any regulatory decision is subject to appeal.  Apart from that course of action, however, the noise regulator has a strong role to play in the continued monitoring of the noise situation at the airport.  The regulator will not only monitor compliance with noise mitigation measures and operating restrictions but will also examine their continued effectiveness.  In this regard, the council has the ability to bring forward the five-year assessment process if it sees fit.  The noise regulator has the power to enforce a regulatory decision and will work closely with the planning authority in the enforcement of planning conditions.</p> <p>I also wish to respond to pleas for further engagements.  Senator Reilly made a compelling case that perhaps there should be further engagements, and I am willing to ask my officials, before it is too late, to meet Senators Reilly and Craughwell and others who want to engage further.</p> <p>Senator Clifford-Lee was extraordinarily critical of my attitude to the residents.  She said that I was treating locals with contempt.  I remind her that I met the Portmarnock residents' association and Senator Clifford-Lee at her request in 2016.</p></speech>

T&aacute; idir muid a bheith ina bhfabhar go teoirici&uacute;il ach ina gcoinne go praitici&uacute;il nuair at&aacute; cinnt&iacute; le d&eacute;anamh a mbeadh de thionchar acu an Ghaeilge a shealbh&uacute; in&aacute;r measc.</p><p>Is minic a deirtear gur beatha theanga &iacute; a labhairt, agus aonta&iacute;m leis an r&aacute;iteas sin.  Caithfear an Ghaeilge a labhairt n&oacute; caillfear &iacute;.  Labhra&iacute;onn thart ar 20% den daonra an Ghaeilge d&aacute;r le daon&aacute;ireamh 2016, ach n&iacute; labhra&iacute;onn gach duine acu an Ghaeilge gach l&aacute;.  N&iacute; mar sin at&aacute; s&eacute; sna Gaeltachta&iacute;.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar thoscaireacht i nGaeltacht Chiarra&iacute; ag t&uacute;s na seachtaine seo i mBaile an Fheirt&eacute;araigh le Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOile&aacute;n agus chuala m&eacute; go leor faoi na fadhbanna at&aacute; ag muintir na h&aacute;ite maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais, c&uacute;rsa&iacute; airgeadais agus mar sin de.

T&aacute; s&eacute; sin f&iacute;or i gc&aacute;s na Gaeilge freisin &oacute;s &eacute; gur mionteanga &iacute;, agus sin an f&aacute;th go gcaithfimid &aacute;r seacht nd&iacute;cheall a dh&eacute;anamh gach rud a dh&eacute;anamh chun an Ghaeilge a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il mar t&aacute; an Ghaeilge mar theanga labhartha laeth&uacute;il i mbaol, in ainneoin d&uacute;thracht na m&iacute;lte daoine sa t&iacute;r seo.</p><p>Labhra&iacute;omar le go leor m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus chualamar faoi na fadhbanna maidir le teacht ar acmhainn&iacute; ceart ar n&oacute;s t&eacute;acsleabhair do na scoileanna.  D&eacute;anann an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, COGG, obair mhaith ag cur acmhainn&iacute; ar f&aacute;il, ach dar le muintir na Gaeltachta agus m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; na Gaeltachta, is minic go mb&iacute;onn siad r&oacute;chasta lena bheith oiri&uacute;nach do na scoileanna agus is minic nach mb&iacute;onn idirdheal&uacute; ceart &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh idir na can&uacute;int&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la.  D'fh&eacute;adfadh t&eacute;acsleabhair a bheith scr&iacute;ofa i gcan&uacute;int amh&aacute;in, gan a bheith oiri&uacute;nach do dhalta&iacute; i nGaeltacht eile, agus is minic go mb&iacute;onn orthu fanacht go dt&iacute; go mb&iacute;onn na t&eacute;acsleabhair ar f&aacute;il.  Is minic nach mb&iacute;onn ach rogha amh&aacute;in de th&eacute;acsleabhair i gceist agus b'shin ceann de na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in ar luadh linn maidir leis an tr&eacute;aniarracht at&aacute; muintir na Gaeltachta ag d&eacute;anamh chun oideachas a chur ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Luaigh siad freisin c&eacute; chomh deacair agus a bh&iacute;onn s&eacute; amanta teacht ar aoichainteoir&iacute; le Gaeilge.

N&iacute; aon ionadh d&uacute;inn an figi&uacute;r sin agus an laghd&uacute; sin.  Molaim Conradh na Gaeilge agus eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; eile as ucht an misneach agus an d&iacute;ograis at&aacute; acu i leith na hoibre seo ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a spreagadh agus a chur chun cinn mar theanga bheo i measc na ndaoine.</p><p>Tagra&iacute;m d&rsquo;acmhainn&iacute; ar n&oacute;s seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a chinnti&uacute; d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag iarraidh Gaeilge a labhairt agus iad ag dul i mbun a ghn&oacute;.  T&aacute; sc&eacute;al m&oacute;r ansin, mar is eol don Aire St&aacute;it.  Glacaim leis an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt s&eacute; faoin chusp&oacute;ir at&aacute; sa Bhille at&aacute; le teacht go mbeadh an Ghaeilge ar a gcumas ag 20% d'earcaigh nua sa seirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite agam roinnt uaireanta sa Seanad go gcaithf&iacute; tos&uacute; leis an St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras.  Chuala m&eacute; sc&eacute;al an l&aacute; cheana faoi dhaoine ag lorg seirbh&iacute;s tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Cuireann siad glaoch ar oifig &aacute;irithe sa St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras, br&uacute;nn siad an cnaipe chun Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id, t&aacute; r&iacute;r&aacute; agus ruaille buaille ar an taobh eile agus ansin tagann duine ar an l&iacute;ne agus deir s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; that the person who speaks Irish is not here today and offers their help.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; sin inghlactha sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu.  Mar is eol d&uacute;inn, bh&iacute; an t-am ann nuair a bh&iacute; g&aacute; le Gaeilge d&aacute; mbeadh duine chun post a fh&aacute;il sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.

I welcome the Bill.  It is good legislation which will help people in mortgage arrears to stay in their homes and avoid having them repossessed.  As many of the cohort of new homeless persons have had their homes repossessed through the courts, the broadening of the criteria judges will be able to consider and take into account is most welcome.  However, I have a query that I have raised with the office of the Minister of State, whom I thank for his engagement on it.</p> <p>In the briefing note on the Bill supplied to Senators there is a reference to an objection lodged by the European Central Bank to a provision in the original Private Members' Bill that would have allowed a court to consider whether the lender seeking repossession was the original lender of the mortgage.  It would incorporate circumstances in which the original lender that provided the mortgage on the property had sold it on to a third party such as a vulture fund which then sought repossession.  The briefing note states the ECB objected to this provision on the grounds that"it could impede investment fund activity in secondary markets and reduce participation and price competition in the lending market".  I do not have much time for this objection.  We are facing a crisis of repossessions and homelessness and our laws should be assessed on their benefits to vulnerable citizens, not the needs of actors in the international financial market.  It seems very important that such a provision be included in the Bill.  Whether a person's mortgage is still with the original lender or a third party is salient and relevant in considering his or her ability to repay the loan and a court should be allowed to include it in its deliberations.  If the mortgage is with the original lender, one will have a pre-existing relationship that can be used to discuss personal insolvency arrangements, whereas if it is with a vulture fund, there will be a very different relationship.  A court should be able to take this into account when deciding whether to grant a repossession order.  </p> <p>The briefing note goes on to state the relevant provision was not included in the Bill owing to the ECB's objection but would be introduced as a Committee Stage amendment later in the process.  I presumed it would be introduced in the Seanad, but as that has not happened, I ask the Minister of State whether there are plans to introduce it in the D&aacute;il.  Has there been further engagement with the ECB and where do we stand on its objection?  I considered tabling an amendment to this effect, but I did not want to prejudice the process under way with the ECB.  This provision is a critical part of the suite of measures required to tackle the homelessness and repossessions crises.  I would appreciate an update on the issue from the Minister of State.</p></speech>

A decision on this matter will be taken as soon as possible.  I am thankful for the support of the Senators for what I am trying to do.  It is a very short Bill.  We will work with the ECB as we have been doing.  As Members will know, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has continued to engage with it.  Our objective is to get this Bill, including section 3, through this House today and into the D&aacute;il.  As the Senator noted, it is to help those who find themselves in a vulnerable position.  It is a short but very positive Bill in what it sets out to do.  In fairness to the Minister, he approved the proceedings of the publication of the Bill without receiving comment from the ECB.  He will engage further with it.  If we have to refer for further clarification we can do so but we are happy to proceed with getting it through the House. </p></speech>

Does he envisage discussions with the ECB on its objection to this provision continuing for so long that it will not feature in the Bill even in the D&aacute;il debates?</p></speech>

I know the issues that Senator Ruane is describing.  We are working as a team to make sure that we get this Bill through the House and onto the Statute Book to help people in that position.  If we have to go further, there is nothing stopping me or anybody else from adding to this Bill at a later stage.  I have travelled throughout the country, especially since I became a Minister of State and people know this Bill is coming through.  More and more people contact me about these issues on a daily basis and I imagine the same is true for the Senator and every other Member.  My entire focus is on getting section 3, which is really the core of the Bill, on to the books to help those people.  I will look at doing more at a later stage if I must but my focus is to help those people at this time..</p></speech>

It has been brought to my attention that in lots of cases, when a loan is sold to a vulture fund it is still the bank that brings the mortgage holder to court.  I have asked representatives of the Central Bank about this at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  How does that fit into the legal proceedings?  The bank sells the loans and sells the property to a vulture fund.  When a vulture fund seeks possession of a house, through agreement, litigation or eviction, in some cases it is the bank that issues the proceedings against the borrower in the first place.</p></speech>

I understand where he is coming from.  As I said earlier, the core of the Bill is section 3.  The matter the Senator raises is for another day and another extension to a Bill.  At the moment we are all beating up vulture funds.  Everyone has their own term for them.  As I said at the outset, I am trying help people throughout the country with this Bill.  I will continue to do that.  If we need to add on other elements, we will look at them at a later stage.</p></speech>

It is important to achieve a balance.  There are genuine cases where the views, considerations and family circumstances of the property owner are not taken into account.  I would like the Minister to take that consideration forward but balance is important and this Bill certainly helps that.</p></speech>
