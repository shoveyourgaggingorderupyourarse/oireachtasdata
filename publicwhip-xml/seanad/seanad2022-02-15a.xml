There is no doubt that this will foster real debate and, indeed, has started to do that around the defence Ireland needs as a modern European country.  This is very welcome.  It is a substantial report running to 224 pages and making 69 recommendations.  I commend all of those involved in this very comprehensive report.</p> <p>There are many noteworthy recommendations within the report such as: a meaningful transformation in the military hierarchy; an increased focus on cybersecurity; new armed personnel carriers; a larger and more robust naval capacity; a larger aircraft fleet; and many others.  Of course, there was a huge emphasis on the people within the Defence Forces.  That is absolutely the greatest strength we have.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The recommendations for the regeneration plan for the Reserve are critical.  The proposal of regular potential officer courses, what we call the commissioning of the ranks, enables experienced non-commissioned officers to train to join the commissioned ranks.  They are recommendations that the former Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, made in 2006.  In 2022 it is still a recommendation but nothing has happened in between, which is regrettable.  We have to recognise there has been a lost decade for the Defence Forces and that defence needs an increase in current funding and investment to undo the damage caused by neglect and return Defence Forces modernisation to the path originally charted in the 2000 White Paper.</p><p>I hail from Kildare and represented that area in the last D&aacute;il, where I advocated strongly on behalf of the defence community not just in Kildare but across the country.  I have continued to advocate strongly for it in this House.  While I am pleased to see the comprehensive report, I am concerned and slightly sceptical about the implementation process.  We need to see action now.  We have broken the trust of the defence community before by failing to act and this cannot be allowed happen again.  For far too long the Defence Forces have been under-resourced, ignored and not shown the respect they deserve.  This has to be a turning-point for the defence community in my area of south Kildare and across the country.  The days of reports and talking about reports must come to an end.  We need to come to the next phase if we are to revitalise our Defence Forces and if we are serious about attracting people to a career in our forces, which is hugely important.</p><p>In this House last week, I asked the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, to prioritise the immediate establishment of a permanent pay review body in tandem with my party colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  Pay and conditions for Defence Forces personnel must improve and the establishment of this pay review body must be a priority.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, to outline when we will see a comprehensive implementation plan.  How long does the Minister of State estimate full implementation will take?  Will he on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, commit to prioritising the establishment of a permanent pay review body as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>

The Minister welcomes the publication of the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  The establishment of the Commission on the Defence Forces was set out in the programme for Government and was a key priority for the Minister for Defence.  The publication of the report represents the culmination of the work carried out over the past 13 months and is testament to the considerable efforts of all who contributed to its completion.</p><p>The report is wide-ranging and comprehensive.  As Senator O'Loughlin mentioned, it contains 69 main recommendations and, together with sub-recommendations, there are 133 recommendations in total.  The report proposes significant changes for the Defence Forces, including to high-level command and control structures, and for the level of defence provision in Ireland.  It challenges the <i>status quo</i>across a range of areas and is forthright about the requirement for cultural change in the Defence Forces.  It proposes a range of measures to make the Defence Forces a more inclusive, diverse, equal and attractive workplace.  The importance of the Reserve is also clearly stated.</p><p>The report poses serious questions regarding defence provision that we as a society must carefully consider.  This includes the type of defence capabilities we should retain and the level of resourcing we are willing to commit to in order to equip and train our Defence Forces for the roles we require them to undertake.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Colm Brophy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2427"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2427&amp;amp;pid=ColmBrophy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister hopes that this report will foster real debate about the defence that we need as a modern neutral European country.</p><p>The report sets out three indicative levels of ambition, LOAs.  LOA 1 would encompass the current capability; LOA 2 would enhance our current capabilities and seek to address specific priority areas; and LOA 3 would look to develop full spectrum defence capabilities to protect Ireland and its people to an extent comparable to similar-sized countries in Europe.</p><p>The commission recommended a step to LOA 2 in the short term, pending more detailed policy debate and decision required for higher levels of ambition.  This step up to LOA 2 would require an additional &euro;500 million per annum.  LOA three would require expenditure of &euro;3 billion per annum.</p><p>Clearly, there are matters that require careful consideration and, in some critical aspects, interdepartmental discussion and agreement.  This includes the level of resourcing that may be allocated to defence and the governance framework that will be required to underpin the changes that the commission has recommended.  The Minister is also anxious to engage with key stakeholders in the Oireachtas.</p><p>There have been calls, obviously, for quick movement on the recommendations in the report and I understand that there may be an impatience to move on certain aspects of the report.  The Minister believes that a four- to five-month timeframe is necessary to bring a considered and comprehensive proposal back to Government to address the fundamental issues that the commission has set out.  The Minister intends to engage with key stakeholders in the intervening period.</p><p>Significant work is currently ongoing, which the commission has referred to in its report.  This includes key issues such as the development of a capability development planning process, the work of the independent review into dignity and equality issues, the ongoing procurement of equipment and infrastructure and direct entry competitions and the amendment of legislation relating to the working time directive.</p><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-15a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022021500002#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his response on behalf of the Minister for Defence.  While I note the points that he made, to be perfectly honest, I cannot understand how the Minister needs five months to prepare his response.  Nothing in the commission's report can be a surprise to him or, indeed, to his officials because for the past ten years we have been listening to the issues, challenges and problems, particularly around recruitment and retention.</p> <p>While much of the public commentary has unsurprisingly been focused on the big ticket items, the real meat of the commission's recommendations relate to structural and system reforms that will go a long way to tackle the twin problems of poor morale and personnel retention.  These are the two biggest issues that we have.  </p> <p>I participated in a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence along with the Leas-Cathaoirleach two weeks ago in the Curragh where we heard all of this first-hand.  It used be a situation where those who went into the Army certainly took great pride in their role and in their position.  While they still take great pride, there is certainly a huge lack of morale and that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

I will certainly take on board what she has said and the important points that she has raised and bring them to the Minister, in terms of following on from this.</p> <p>I reiterate that given the significant recommendations in the report, that period of consideration is required.  The report will require detailed consideration and interdepartmental consideration.  It is important that having done the work the commission has done, the Minister would get those views clearly from all the stakeholders.  In that context, four to five months is a reasonable timeframe.  The process will proceed from the engagement.  I thank the Senator again for raising the matter.</p></speech>

The purpose of this Commencement matter is to highlight the concerns raised by councillors in counties Cork, Monaghan, Longford, Westmeath, Tipperary, Waterford, Offaly and Galway, from whom I have received representations.  I am asking the Minister for Transport to explain the rationale behind the decision to shelve certain major road projects scheduled for this year; and to make a statement on the matter.  The roads that I wish to single out for attention are the N25 from Carrigtwohill to Midleton in County Cork; the N2 from Clontibret to the Border in County Monaghan; the N4 from Mullingar to Longford in counties Westmeath and Longford; the N24 from Waterford to Cahir, County Tipperary; the N25 from Waterford to Glenmore, County Kilkenny; the N52 from Tullamore to Kilbeggan in counties Offaly and Westmeath; and the N59 from Clifden to Maam Cross.</p> <p>The councillors who raised the matter with me said that they were somewhat concerned by the official statement issued by the Department and the Minister, in which the Department of Transport confirmed that the projects had been stalled and would be considered for funding next year or possibly the year after.  An explanation of the rationale for the decision is required.  What is the logic for it?  There may be other valid reasons for the decision that people are simply not aware of.  Perhaps they have been missed.  However, I think there is, and was, an expectation among the Oireachtas Members in these areas and indeed, the citizens and people who travel on these roads and their local councillors, that these works would be done.  The projects are not new; they have long been thought-out.  They were part of the plan and the programme of national roads projects.  I know that the Minister of State is very familiar with these roads.  When people hear and read that local, and particularly important, road projects are shelved for an indefinite period, there is some concern.  It is happening at a time when I thought there was a substantial amount of money around for critical infrastructure, which these roads are.  We cannot argue with that.  It is important to have critical infrastructure for the travelling public but also for the commercial life and the economy of the country.  These are significant and important routes.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could shine a light on the issue and perhaps outline some of the rationale behind the decision and a possible timeline for the new dates on which these projects might commence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-15a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022021500002#E00400"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this important issue.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport, who has responsibility for the overall policy and Exchequer funding for the national roads programme, which includes the motorway network along with national primary and secondary roads.</p> <p>As the Senator may be aware, once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, and in line with the national development plan, NDP, the planning, design, improvement and upgrading of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  TII ultimately delivers the national roads programme in line with Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework and the NDP.  In the new NDP, which was launched in October 2021, approximately &euro;5.1 billion is earmarked for new national road projects up to 2030.  This funding will enable improved regional accessibility across the country, as well as compact growth in our towns and villages, which are key national strategic outcomes.  The funding will provide for the development of numerous national road projects, including the completion of projects which are already at construction stage and those close to it, as well as the development of a number of others.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This year, approximately &euro;615 million of that &euro;5.1 billion of Exchequer capital funding has been provided for national road projects through TII to local authorities.  These allocations were announced on 17 December 2021 and details are available on the website.  Funding for regional and local roads was announced earlier today.  </p><p>I agree wholeheartedly with what Senator Boyhan said regarding the importance of the road projects he outlined.  I thank him for raising this issue on behalf of councillors in several counties.  My colleagues, Senators Paul Daly and Carrigy and Deputy Flaherty have also raised this issue, as I have, with the Minister for Transport.  When the roads projects office is undertaking its planning, it is important for it to have certainty regarding when these projects can progress.  </p><p>As I said, &euro;5.1 billion is earmarked in this regard up to 2030.  We need greater certainty, however, concerning when these roads projects, as outlined by Senator Boyhan, will be progressed.  I know the roads from Mullingar to Longford and Tullamore to Kilbeggan especially well.  In some cases, these projects only require a small amount of money to progress to the next stage.  As the Senator rightly said, the landowners on the routes also need certainty and clarification.  I have been consulting with the Minister for Transport in this regard.  He has assured me that he has brought my concerns to the attention of TII.  I assure the Senator that on foot of his strong contribution on behalf of the councillors in the respective counties that I will now go back to the Minister to ask him to engage with TII to bring certainty and clarity in respect of the road projects highlighted in the Senator's Commencement matter.</p></speech>

The disappointing aspect is that these road projects were announced, there was great excitement and press releases were issued.  Local politicians promoted and welcomed these projects, as did the Minister of State.  He travels these roads and two of them relate directly to his constituency.  Therefore, I have every confidence that he will make these projects happen and that he will pursue this matter.</p> <p>We need some sort of indication now that these projects will be back under way in 2023.  I say that because there is some disappointment in this regard and a suggestion that certain elements of the Government are not pro-roads to the same extent.  These projects, however, are critically important.  They concern rural connectivity, communities and the economy.  I thank the Minister of State again for his comprehensive response, and I will come back to him if I need further information.</p></speech>

There has been disappointment.  Nobody likes to see a road project on schedule moving backwards.  We want to see these projects continue to move forwards.  Funding of &euro;5.1 billion has been allocated to the roads programme up to 2030, and in that context the bare minimum required is certainty regarding when these projects can move to the next stage.  The local authorities need to know, as do the impacted landowners and road users.</p> <p>Some of these roads are very dangerous.  They have a high frequency of accidents and require upgrading.  I have undertaken already, and I do so again now, to bring the Senator's concerns back to the Minister for Transport and to try to ascertain a clear timeframe for these projects.  I would like to see a clear timeframe for work to be undertaken on the road from Mullingar to Longford.  It is a busy road and one with a high frequency of accidents.  It went through various stages of work to 2010, and was then paused.  I do not want to see this project paused again.  I undertake to raise Senator Boyhan's concerns with the Minister for Transport and to ask him to respond directly to the Senator.</p></speech>

In the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, we stated we would support the establishment of a joint labour committee, JLC, in the childcare sector and the drawing up of an employment regulation order, ERO, which would determine minimum rates of pay for childcare workers, as well as their terms and conditions of employment.  This subject has been particularly close to my heart.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I lobbied hard for this to be in the programme for Government because I have represented the childcare sector.  I have worked with childcare providers during the past ten years prior to becoming a Member of the Seanad and seen first-hand the difficulties they experience in retaining and recruiting staff from the point of view that, in many cases, highly qualified women with experience working in child care could not work in the sector because the cost of living was such that they lost too much by being in full-time employment in the sector and the rates of pay were not sufficient, and that was prior to more recent escalation in the cost of living</p><p>I want to say a big "Thank you" to those involved in the Big Start campaign.  They talked about pay and conditions in childcare.  For example, 66% of early years educators earn less than the living wage and 42% of managers stated they earned less than &euro;15 per hour.  These are the group of people who care for our children, who enable predominantly women to access the workforce and who are dedicated professionals in the creation of care of our children.  It is important they have a career in this sector and that money is red-circled for this sector to support childcare providers in meeting whatever pay and terms and conditions can be put in place by an ERO.  As a Government, we have red-circled money in the budget for later this year.  I am anxious we achieve a timeline on that, that the momentum continues and that by September this year we are in a place where we can be sure the people who are recruited into childcare will stay in the industry, will be able to build careers and grow in the industry, and will be encouraged to pursue higher level education in order that we have that level of expertise for children prior to their going to school. </p><p>I am anxious that we would know we have a constant momentum with respect to this sector.  At what time will we have a report and be in a position where we have an ERO that will apply to this industry?</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  Everybody knows she is s a very strong advocate for this sector and has worked tirelessly in this area.  This debate gives us an opportunity to reaffirm to those working in early learning and childcare services the recognition they deserve for the very important work they do and the benefits their work brings for children, families and society.  The programme for Government makes extensive commitments to improve access and quality of childcare, and, crucially, we have begun work delivering on those commitments.</p> <p>In recognition of the importance of this sector and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring high-quality, affordable and accessible services, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth,, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, announced major reform of funding for early learning and childcare following the report of an expert group last year.  Budget 2022 committed to a transformative and groundbreaking package of measures to begin to implement the vision set out in the report.  Some &euro;78 million is being made available to enable this in 2022, including &euro;69 million for a core funding stream, equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full year.  Furthermore, throughout the pandemic, substantial State supports, including the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and other sectoral specific supports such as the reopening funding package for childcare services have been provided to the sector, which have enabled services to operate safely and ensured the increased costs associated with public health requirements and with lower demand were not passed on to parents.</p> <p>However, on the topic for discussion today, I would like to clarify the Minister of State, Deputy English&rsquo;s, role regarding the ERO for childcare.  As the Senator will be aware, in line with his statutory obligations as set out in the Industrial Relations Act, he approved a recommendation of the Labour Court to establish a joint labour committee, JLC, for the early learning care and school age childcare sector in June 2021.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, policy responsibility for this sector sits outside his remit and is a matter for my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, as the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I understand that the joint labour committee, JLC, for the early learning care and school age childcare sector, which is independently chaired, has met on a number of occasions to date and is progressing its work.</p><p>Proposals for an employment regulation order are formulated in the first instance by a JLC where it is satisfied that such proposals would promote harmonious relations between workers and employers.  The Labour Court then considers whether or not to adopt the proposals of a JLC.  If the Labour Court is satisfied that the proposals are in a suitable form for adoption, the Labour Court adopts the proposals and submits the issue to the Minister of State with responsibility for business, employment and retail.  If the Minister of State is satisfied that the relevant legislative requirements have been met and it is appropriate to make an order, he will give effect to the proposals through the making of an employment regulation order.  I am informed that the Minister of State, Deputy English, has not yet received any proposals from the Labour Court regarding an employment regulation order for the early learning care and school age childcare sector.</p></speech>

My request is that the Minister of State is poised and ready to respond as soon as he receives that report, so that it can be implemented urgently.  Many contracts in this area run on a fixed-term basis.  It would be lovely to issue long-term contracts from September this year and for them to be at the new rates, which are appropriate for the retention of staff in this area.  This area is predominantly staffed by women.  The high cost of living has seen a loss of staff from this sector.  There is consequently a knock-on effect on the sustainability of services and the ability of parents who rely on those services to get back into the workplace as we return to a more normal, though hopefully hybrid, society.  I urge that we be ready for that report whenever it comes in.  If it is listening, the Labour Court should urgently move to ensure that we have this report as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It is a significant and welcome development.  It is an independent process and I encourage bodies representing both employers and employees to engage with the JLC process because it can yield significant positive benefits for both parties.</p> <p>An agreement on a new set of terms and conditions for employment will help to maintain and grow the talented pool of people working in the sector, as well as providing security and opportunity for career development in the early learning care and school age childcare sector, as the Senator alluded to.  I have no doubt that when a recommendation comes before our colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy English, he will not be found wanting.  The Government is committed.  We have proven through our actions and support for the sector in the last years that we want to support it, since it is crucial for our economy and society.</p></speech>

I hope that with the arrival of the Minister of State to the House, she will have some good news for us regarding the opening of the facility which will provide a home and cater for up to five people in the Carrickmacross area who have physical and sensory disabilities.  The building has been lying idle for many years and families have been waiting for far too long for the facility to be opened.</p><p>I was delighted that with the change in Government some 18 months ago came a change in attitude and a sense of urgency that the project needed funding to get the facility open.  I thank the Minister of State because I know she took her portfolio, grasped this issue by the scruff of the neck and secured funding.  I am delighted things have moved on as far as they have.  They would not have without the work of the Minister of State.  It has been an issue for the people of Carrickmacross since the building was first initiated.  Local councillor P.J. O'Hanlon has worked tirelessly to try to open the facility.</p><p>The last time the Minister of State and I spoke, we were given a projected date of the last quarter of 2021.  She told me she had allocated some funding so that works could be done to the building.  Due to the fact it had lain idle for so long, some small remedial works were required so that the building could be opened.  I understand the works have been completed.  Now all we await is the good news I hope the Minister of State will have for us.  Families have been waiting a long time to get their local ones housed in the facility.  I hope we will finally have an opening date.</p></speech>

He has long advocated for the opening of the group home in Carrickmacross, and I thank him for the raising this important matter again today.</p> <p>As the Senator knows, there have been protracted negotiation between HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, 1 disability services and the Respond housing agency regarding the lease agreement for the B&oacute;thar Oirialla group home in Carrickmacross.  I can inform the Senator that HSE estates confirmed it has received and has now forwarded the full suite of executed lease documentation to the HSE solicitors to support the final handover of the premises to HSE CHO 1 disability services.  The HSE solicitors will forward these documents to Resilience, the contracted service provider, once documentation is fully reviewed.</p> <p>HSE CHO 1 is awaiting contact from the approved housing body, Respond, to arrange handover of the premises and will then immediately complete the local licence arrangement with the service provider, Resilience.  Resilience met all residents at meetings during quarter 4 of 2021.  While the residential service is awaited, various supports and interventions are in place for residents, determined by the individuals&rsquo; needs.  The HSE advises that the full staffing complement has been recruited by the care provider and a person in charge of the unit has been identified.</p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, all designated centres for people with disabilities are required to register with the office of the chief inspector of HIQA.  Once the HSE is in receipt of the keys to hand over the premises to the contracted service provider, Resilience can lodge its registration application to HIQA.</p> <p>In some positive news for the Senator, the HSE has advised me today that the Carrickmacross group home should be open for residents to move in by the end of March.  I know the Senator and others in the community have been waiting a long time for this home to become a reality.  I am acutely aware there have been a number of delays over recent years, but I have kept a close eye on developments in Carrickmacross and it is welcome that we are now so close to this becoming a new home for five residents.  I am sure this will be a huge relief and an exciting update for families who need reassurance the facility will be open and running.</p> <p>My Department has provided the money and worked closely with the HSE to ensure that whatever obstacles were in the way since the matter was brought to my attention were addressed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This has been done in conjunction with the requirements to ensure the building will meet inspection once the handover is complete.</p><p>We are not talking about having more of a protracted process.  This house is now available for residents to move into.  It did not open at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 because it was around Christmas and a period of transition.  Some people did not want to make that full move; there was only one resident who was interested in the move at the time.  We are now doing it at the end of the first quarter of 2022.</p></speech>

People have waited years to hear that sentence and I am delighted, as the Minister of State has mentioned, that the facility will open in March.  On behalf of the community in Monaghan and particularly in Carrickmacross, I thank the Minister of State for her work and sense of urgency in securing the initial funding but also for driving this on so that today we have a date for the official opening, which is the end of March.  I am delighted with that.  It would give me great pleasure and it would only be right and fitting that someone who has done so much work in securing this facility would visit it and perhaps do an official opening, if that is in order.  I would be grateful if the Minister would do that and I look forward to her response.</p></speech>

There is a little bit of pressure on everybody, whether it is HIQA, the HSE or the Department, to ensure the building is opening and fully functioning for those five residents.  I am coming that day to ensure it happens.  It is money I wanted spent in 2021 but it dragged into 2022.  I am nonetheless delighted the providers - the HSE and Resilience - have worked really hard for me to ensure we can have delivery.  I look forward to coming down on 28 March to see our new facility opened.</p></speech>

It was very special to have Senator Norris and former Senator and former President Mary Robinson reflecting on the Seanad's role in society and politics and speaking about some of the issues that have been raised in the past and that we have to deal with now.  The one element that really stuck out for me was the word "passion".  Former President Robinson spoke about the need for passion when articulating the subjects we speak about.  She spoke about the importance of climate change and how we in the Seanad will need to be a very strong voice on this.</p> <p>On that note, with regard to the retrofitting grants which were announced two weeks ago and are incredibly welcome, I want to make several points.  If administered correctly, they could be transformative in respect of the energy we use and its cost.  With regard to the loans the Government has indicated it will give, I would like to see them rolled out through An Post.  There is a post office in practically every community.  We are looking at ways to make the post office continue to be a central space in every area.  It is important that the loans be administered through it.  We need to cut down on red tape and administration.  I know from those using the SEAI system they find it very difficult.  This is not what it should be.</p> <p>Over the weekend there was a debate about the National Women's Council's decision not to include women from Government parties at a rally outside Leinster House on 5 May to celebrate International Women's Day.  It is important to note that here.  The caucus has a good working relationship with the National Women's Council.  In any debate moderated by any group there should be a balance of female representation.  The journey to get here is hard enough.  I ask that women Oireachtas Members from non-Government parties support this also.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The last point I want to raise concerns the cost of living, including for students.  I heard contradictory remarks over the past week from the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on whether third-level fees would be reduced.  Let us be clear: they absolutely should be but not at the expense of the universities and other third-level colleges, which have been managing on a shoestring for the past decade.  The Cassells report was sent to the European Commission for an economic cost analysis of the three options put forward.  I understand the analysis has been submitted to the Department.  It is important that we have a debate on it and ensure that we do right by our universities and other third-level colleges.  Most important, we should do right by our students by ensuring they all have an opportunity to go to college.  I ask the Leader for a debate on that.</p></speech>

I welcome the extension of the consultation period requested regarding the flood relief measure planned for Ballinasloe.  It is excellent news that the OPW is going to co-ordinate an in-person public event.  This will be crucial in making sure communities in our area can engage on the huge development, which is to involve flood walls and embankments around the town.  It is really great news.

I had the opportunity yesterday to meet the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, who visited Galway, particularly Galway&ndash;Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, which on 1 April will become the brand new Atlantic Technological University.  Some &euro;430 million in Government funding was announced by the Minister yesterday.  There are four funding streams under that.  The funding will be divided between the traditional university sector and our brand-new technological universities.  There will be a specific fund for further and higher education, which is crucial.  Just as the Minister has expanded the CAO form to reflect further and higher learning and the apprenticeship programmes, we need to ensure our universities have the funding to match.  When we were in GMIT, we got to meet Dr. Orla Flynn, the institute's recently appointed president.  She was appointed just in the past two years.  We were brought on a tour of the various areas in the college and noted the investment that has taken place through Enterprise Ireland, particularly in respect of medical imaging.  There was a jobs announcement in Galway yesterday.  It is crucial to see how jobs announcements and investments are linked to investment in research, because the companies are working with all those involved in research and development in the universities.  It is important that we recognise that investment in third level results in jobs, income and a better standard of living for people in regional areas.  The technological universities appearing in the west and in regional towns across the rest of Ireland are crucial to our development.</p></speech>

It was a fabulous achievement.  We were asked to film a little bit afterwards and to give a sound bite, and I was particularly happy to be able to say both Ms Mary Robinson and Senator Norris have been two remarkable Senators.  Ms Robinson was an Independent Senator, just as Senator Norris is today.  It was interesting that Ms Robinson, having served three or four terms as an Independent Senator, became a Labour Party Senator.  David Norris has been a Senator continuously since he was first elected.  Ms Robinson was elected in 1969 and Senator Norris in 1987.  What a remarkable story.  I thank the Chair.  I hope we will have a really exciting year of celebration.  I know I speak for everyone in saying that there is not a day on which we come in here without being conscious of the enormous privilege it is to represent the people in the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly the Seanad.</p> <p>There was to be a motion taken in the House this week on a Dublin citizens' assembly.  In fairness to the Leader, she contacted all of us to say it would be deferred for a week.  Between now and then, I do not want to talk about the motion or the substantive issue but to highlight two or three concerns.  We have 183 councillors in Dublin: 63 in Dublin City Council, 40 in Fingal County Council, 40 in South Dublin County Council, and 40 in D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council.  It is important that we have a system.  The proposed amendment suggested 12 councillors.  How does one select 12 councillors from that total?  I simply do not know.  More important, I am anxious that we represent people across the board, of all parties and none.  Perhaps the D'Hondt system could be used, but that is a matter for councillors.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I am also concerned about gender.  If the Minister is suggesting there are only going to be 12 people out of 183, it is a bit silent about gender and how we are selecting them.  I think we should fight for a bigger majority.  Remember these sitting county councillors are politicians too and they are in the Minister's party and everyone else's parties or are Independent.  We need a better deal for them.  We want them at the heart of a citizens' assembly.  </p><p>The issue of a mayor is another one about which I am concerned.  I am not concerned about the mayor but the motion talks about having regard to an independent mayor.  The people of Dublin rejected a directly elected mayor among the four councils, although one or two of them accepted it.  It was scrapped so we need to be clear.  If we are having a citizens' assembly, we need an open debate and to let the assembly decide what it wants to do.  Let us not preordain the outcome.  Perhaps we might reflect on that in the next few days.  How will we get gender representation in this group and how will we have representation among city and county councillors?</p></speech>

It was really lovely.</p> <p>We are good at labelling.  Of course, this applies to all walks of life but today, I want to challenge our understanding of two ways in which we label farmers.  One is loaded with positive assumptions, the other much less so.  One is the label "productive or commercial farmer" while the other is the somewhat belittling term "hobby farmer", which is often used to describe those who farm on a part-time basis.  Regarding the term "productive farmers", we are referring to farmers who farm full time to produce as much meat, milk or grain as possible.  Traditionally, that was seen as an undisputed positive but we now realise that some of that production has come at a cost and many such farms put significant pressure on our natural environment.  Take something as basic as hedges.  Data from Teagasc has indicated that a staggering 90% of hedges on intensive farms are classified as low quality exhibiting issues such as impoverished ground flora, low species diversity and gappiness.  Increasingly, there are other pressures on such farms.  Rising energy, fertiliser and feed costs have impacted on farmers across the country.  Our pig sector is in significant difficulty and our grassland farmers are facing very challenging decisions in terms of fertility inputs this year.  </p> <p>Perhaps we should not be quite so quick to consider the drive for more and more production as an unquestionable good, particularly now when we allow the term "hobby farmer" to be tossed around almost as an insult because most farmers in Ireland are in fact part time and there is nothing wrong with that.  They manage their land and farming enterprises like any other but they rely on off-farm income to survive and raise their families.  Of course, many of these farmers are not in receipt of the big EU direct payments.  Often this is because they were not farming in a particular way during the reference years at the start of this century when we decoupled payments from livestock numbers to land area-based payments.  Many of these farmers may then have been breeding and providing quality stock to other farmers who are in the position to bring the animals through to slaughter but it is the latter rather than the former who have largely benefitted from the past 20 years of payments.  </p> <p>However, with the levelling of EU direct payments in the form of convergence and other measures, it is quite likely that we will see more part-time farmers in the future.  Some bemoan that but I believe it should be welcomed and encouraged.  Some of the best farmers I know are part time.  They love what they do and because they are not wholly reliant on their farms for income, they can afford to be more flexible, experimental and innovative.  I do not think it is really important whether a farmer is full time or part time.  What matters is that farmers appreciate that their land must do more than just produce a profit at any cost.  Profit at the expense of the environment is just too costly for us all so let us stop praising it and start acknowledging those farmers who see themselves as true custodians of the land - as managers of enterprises, yes, but also as caretakers who are just passing through determined to leave to the next generation land that has been nurtured, regenerated and enriched.  Such farmers are engaging in real productive farming.</p></speech>

It is not something I do very often.  Comments were made about the Irish Women's Parliamentary Caucus.  As long as the caucus excludes parliamentary and secretarial assistants and all the other women who work in these Houses, it is exclusionary and, therefore, I will not participate in it.</p> <p>Monday was the anniversary of the Stardust fire 41 years ago.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was a large gathering of relatives who met to commemorate their dead loved ones and also to call on this Government to stop putting obstacles in the way of their search for justice.  Over the last eight months, the State has put a series of obstacles in their way, the most recent one relating to jury selection.  There is an expert working group report on jury selection that is 20 years old.  Successive governments have done nothing to act on its recommendations.  One of the things the report says clearly is that the way juries are selected for inquests is deeply problematic.  We are now facing the largest inquest in the history of the State and are talking about the possibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na selecting the jury when it is itself a party to the inquest.  When the Taoiseach unveiled a bench at the INMO headquarters at the former Richmond hospital yesterday, he said he was listening to the families.  I hope he meant that and was not giving them false hope.  Under no circumstances will the families accept An Garda selecting the jury or accept the alternative the Taoiseach mentioned in the D&aacute;il two weeks ago, which would be to have a judge-led inquest with no jury at all.  Let us not forget that there have already been two judge-led inquiries into what happened in the Stardust nightclub and that both came out with deeply concerning findings.  One actually found that arson was probable and, although this finding was eventually reversed, it tarnished the entire community of north County Dublin and suggested that they were somehow responsible for what took place that night.  I really hope the Taoiseach was not speaking out of both sides of his mouth when he gave assurances to the families yesterday.<br/><br/>I would also like to raise a story covered in the <i>Irish Independent</i>today on the back of the reply I received to a freedom of information request.  It suggested that the Office of Public Works carried out works on Emo Court in Laois without the necessary derogation or licence, destroying a bat roost, before proceeding to try to cover it up and seek a licence for those works retrospectively.  When the National Parks and Wildlife Service investigated the matter, did it recommend prosecution?  That seemed to be the direction it was taking in the response to my freedom of information request.  It seems that someone intervened with the two agencies to ensure that investigation and prosecution did not proceed.</p></speech>

There was a real sense of pride and privilege in being able to listen to Senator Norris and the former Senator and President, Mary Robinson.  It was really heartening to see that the light is still shining very brightly for both of them with regard to their campaigning.</p> <p>I raise today the issue of the scheme to regularise the status of long-term undocumented migrants opened by the Government on 31 January.  For those of us who have been arguing in this House for justice for the undocumented in this country for a long time, this is a major breakthrough.  Like so many others, I want this scheme to succeed but I have serious concerns about the eligibility criteria.  It appears that some of those who were previously documented but who are now undocumented will be excluded from this new Government scheme.  We have to ask why that is the case.  The very nature of some of the employment schemes under which workers come here means that they are tied to their employers.  When such workers are injured or feel they have to leave their jobs because of harassment or appalling conditions, they not only leave their job but also lose their documented status.  I particularly wish to raise the plight of 200 ex-fishers who are currently not documented.  Because they were documented in the last four years, they cannot apply for the Government scheme announced on 31 January.  It is not right and it is not good enough.  If this groundbreaking regularisation scheme is to live up to its potential and if it is to afford a future to those who have come and made their lives here and who are working in the Irish economy or in the seas around this island, we cannot turn our backs on those workers.  I am conscious that an interdepartmental review group has been set up to look at the atypical permits scheme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This scheme was developed in 2015 on the back of Trojan work by the International Transport Workers Federation, which effectively unmasked and uncovered the appalling exploitation of workers that is happening in Irish waters and on Irish vessels, with exploited fishers working in those vessels.  The review is likely to come out over the next weeks.  In that review we really need to see that the process by which undocumented fishers are documented and how they are documented is corrected, that it is not just left to the vessel owners to document the workers and, crucially, that fishers working on Irish registered vessels are no longer tethered to their employers.</p><p>There are two distinct but related issues here.  First, all workers who were previously documented and who fell out of documented status have to be eligible for the Government's new scheme.  Second, it is no longer acceptable that any work permit in the State would tether an employee to his or her employer.  They have to be free of their employer and free to be able to take up employment wherever else after a period of time.</p></speech>

It is an exciting year ahead and it is interesting to be looking back at the past 100 years.  There have been some very strong contributions and inspiration from speeches from former Senator Mary Robinson and the current longest serving Senator, Senator David Norris.</p> <p>I rise to ask for an amendment to the Order of Business.  It has come to my attention that there are some significant concerns about the regulations.  I believe there is a proposal that there would be a motion to approve the draft Planning and Development Act (Exempted Development) Regulations 2022, without debate today.  Unfortunately, it has just come to my attention that there are some significant concerns regarding those regulations which may merit attention, debate and discussion.</p> <p>Specifically of concern are those regulations for a potential requirement of a two-year vacancy in the context of exempted developments.  Given the law of unforeseen consequences, we could actually see an incentive around vacancy if the promotion of vacancy was to allow, for example, exemption from planning.  We do not want to create that kind of perverse incentive.</p> <p>There are still concerns about some of the environmental factors around bats' routes and nesting birds.  Very importantly, and it may even be an inadvertent admission, it does seem that in the areas that are excluded from the exemption there is a concern that the subsection of Article 9.1 in our planning and development regulations, which is the piece specifically around protecting architectural conservation areas, they are not included in the areas excluded from the exemption.  There is a concern there.  I am sorry not to have raised this earlier with the Leader, but it has come to my attention since.  I am hoping that perhaps we might be able to table this item for another day.  We will be looking at planning issues on other days.  Perhaps we could at least have some debate or discussion of it, and perhaps some clarity from the Minister before we approve these regulations.</p></speech>

I raised this issue previously in the House, and I know that it is one the Leader is very familiar with.  Notwithstanding that the Government set aside significant amounts of money last year and this year, there is a considerable delay in rolling out appropriate services.  I believe there are only three centres in the State that deal with eating disorders and offer the kinds of therapy that people need.  There is one centre for adults and two for minors or those under the age of 18.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a huge issue which has grown in terms of numbers and impact on young people during the pandemic.  It would be appropriate if the Leader could schedule for the week commencing 28 February a debate in the House on eating disorders in general, look for a response from the Government and try to understand what more we can do to action those plans.</p><p>There are issues in recruitment across the HSE but it is not good enough to say moneys have been set aside and are in place, and then leave the operational piece to wither on the vine.  Reports this week from the Department of Health suggest targets are not being met in other areas of the health service.  This is an important issue.  There are wonderful interventions which can impact positively on the lives of those suffering from an eating disorder, get them back on track and allow them to live their lives, no different to other illnesses, particularly those with a mental illness dimension.  </p><p>It is an issue many people do not like or want to talk about, that is bedevilling our young people and that has grown through the pandemic for obvious reasons.  It is one we should grapple with in this House.</p></speech>

I assure Senator Higgins that this got ample discussion at last Thursday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, where the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, was present and all members of the committee present contributed on it.</p> <p>I have campaigned for some time on the fact that vacant and derelict former public houses have been omitted from the original regulations introduced in 2018.  It is now being rectified.  We all know many such former pubs across the country in towns, villages and cities that are a blot on the landscape and could be put to far better use as residential units.  That is what we are doing by introducing these regulations.  It removes the red tape in order to bring them back into use.  Since the regulations were introduced in 2018, they have delivered 1,400 residential units, including 676 in the last 12 months.  We are making progress and those numbers of units should not be sniffed at.  By including vacant and derelict former pubs, we will see a far higher take-up. </p> <p>There are notifications regarding section 57 that have to be negotiated with the local authority in the event that a property is a protected structure or has architectural merit.  Those protections are inbuilt as is the necessity to be in accordance with existing regulations, be it fire or size requirements for units.</p> <p>This is a welcome move by the Government that has come from evidence on the ground of issues that have been fed up through the Oireachtas joint committee to the Minister.  Action has now been taken and it is a perfect example of how the system can and does work.  We often give out when it does not work but this is an example of the system working.</p></speech>

I have called in this House before for a debate on the future funding of higher education.  We are no further along that track.  While the announcement is welcome that will result in the reduction of fees for students at third level, it cannot be at the expense of core funding for higher education institutions.  We need clarity on the future funding of those institutions.</p> <p>I raise the question of approximately 100 Tesco security workers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These are workers who are employed directly by Tesco.  Last Tuesday they were summoned into all of the stores throughout the country to be informed that a decision had been taken centrally to outsource their jobs to OCS security services.  In many cases, many of these workers, who are all around the country, have been working for decades with Tesco and frequently have to deal with much antisocial behaviour.  We know that, during the pandemic, retail workers and those working in our retail environments were front-line workers.  Some of these workers were attacked and experienced physical abuse.</p><p>For Tesco, which normally has a reputation of being a good employer, simply to call in the 100 workers around the country - the unions were not notified about this - and essentially tell them the jobs would be outsourced or Tesco may - the word used was "may" - be able to find them a job within the existing stores is the sharpest example I have come across in a long time of HR and industrial relations practice.  Tesco is a highly profitable store.  Tesco is making billions here in Ireland.  It generally has a reputation as a good employer.  I understand the unions, Mandate and SIPTU, were due to meet with Tesco management on Thursday.</p><p>We need to send out a very clear message that it is totally unacceptable that this sort of sharp industrial relations practice is being engaged in and that we, as public representatives, are hugely appreciative of the front-line retail workers and, particularly, those security workers in our supermarkets over the past two years, but indeed over many years.  I would hope that, in raising this issue here, it would communicate our anger and annoyance at the approach of Tesco management.</p></speech>

Senator Byrne mentioned Tesco, but the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and all involved in the horticultural sector have been looking to engage with Dunnes Stores with regard to prices, especially the price of vegetables.  We have seen over the past 24 hours the IFA holding a dispute at two Dunnes Stores centres.  I call on Dunnes Stores to engage with the IFA and discuss these issues.  We have seen, particularly in the pig industry and, as I said, the horticultural industry, that these are extremely challenging times, and it is only right farmers get a fair price for what is an excellent product.  That needs to be highlighted today.  Dunnes Stores is an Irish company and prides itself on being an Irish company.  We need to talk to the local farmers who produce for the company.</p> <p>I also wish to raise a housing issue.  It would have been on "Drivetime" a number of days ago.  There was a discussion with residents in Colmcille Terrace in Granard in north Longford.  Four years ago, I brought the Minister at the time, Eoghan Murphy, to Granard, where funding had been sought for a long number of years to upgrade a significant number of derelict houses in that area.  We secured funding, met with the residents and a process started between Longford County Council and Tuath.  It started in early 2019, we are now at February 2022 and not a stick of work has been done.  There are boarded up houses with dampness coming through the walls to where people are living.  There are rats and cats.  It is not acceptable in 2022 that this happens and people are living in these conditions.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to write to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to get me an update on when in 2022 the works will start on this project, when it will be completed and when the residents can live in what should be up to standard housing.  This is not acceptable at this day and age.</p></speech>

I have soft spot for it because I know so many people with this condition.  Epilepsy Ireland had a very catchy campaign saying to time the seizure, keep them safe and stay with them.  Therefore, it is "Time, Safe, Stay".  We are all about to be empowered to know how to look after a person who is having a seizure.  There are 40,000 people in Ireland who have epilepsy, so the chances are we could come across someone going through a seizure.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is most important that we all empower ourselves to look after people with epilepsy, to be aware of the signs and to make sure that they feel safe in society.  I call on the Department of Social Protection to amend the requirements for free travel and to build some flexibility into free travel schemes.  If a person with epilepsy has a seizure, they are not permitted to drive for six months.  That has a huge impact on many people's lives.  It often puts them out of education and work because they cannot afford the cost of travel.  It would be a good way to empower people to allow them to continue their day-to-day normal life as they would have done prior to having a seizure.  For many reasons, it would be really beneficial for the Department of Social Protection to look at introducing flexibility into the free travel scheme.  As the Leader is aware, the scheme is very rigid.  I ask for the introduction of built-in flexibility and for allowances to be made to make it reasonable in certain cases, such as epilepsy.  </p></speech>

One of the hardest things about living on a tight budget is that you do not have room for the unexpected or out-of-the-ordinary costs.  That can drive families to make impossible choices.  We need to stop those scenarios from arising where we can.  I am of the belief that the &euro;75 levy for attending children's urgent care centres should not be there in the first place.  There is one such centre in Blanchardstown that opened a few years ago.  It is part of Children's Health Ireland, CHI.  A new centre opened recently in Tallaght.  These state-of-the-art centres are run by CHI and its paediatric emergency medicine teams.  Urgent care centres treat conditions such as sprains, strains, broken bones, vomiting and diarrhoea, minor burns and scalds, fever in babies older than 12 weeks and small cuts and injuries.  Of course, the levy is there to try to prevent people from abusing the system, but the centres are there for parents who are worried about their children.  If they are worried, they should be seen without the imposition of a levy.  Cost should never be a barrier to urgent healthcare for children and families.  There are some exemptions from the levy, including medical card holders, members of the Defence Force and their families and people receiving services in respect of prescribed infectious diseases.  Children can be referred to these centres by their GPs.  Why should they have to go through their GP in order to be referred to an urgent care centre?  That just puts even more pressure on GPs.  We are already extending free GP care to those aged seven and under.  We need to do it for children of all ages attending these centres.  One final point that I wish to make is that the opening hours of the centres are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  The hours need to be extended.  I know that there are reasons for the current hours, including resources.  I have some suggestions on how we can help with that.  However, in general, the model was supposed to provide services seven days a week.  That is what we should be working towards.</p></speech>

Most people who have never been through it call it morning sickness.  It is nothing like morning sickness.  It is a severe illness that women have for nine months of their pregnancy.  It probably became well known because Kate Middleton had it the first time she had a child.  Currently, there are three drugs available in the market to treat people who suffer from the condition.  Two of them are not available in Ireland.  One of the drugs, Cariban, is available in Ireland, but it is unlicensed.  At the moment, people have to purchase this drug.  It costs them about &euro;45 a week.  For some people, the cost over the term of a full pregnancy is around &euro;3,000.  It is a severe cost for those going through pregnancies.  The cost of it actually impacts the decisions of women on whether to have a child.  For those who cannot afford the drug, going through pregnancy without it is totally and utterly unbearable.  I raised the issue nine months ago, ironically, and nothing has really changed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to commit to making this drug available to women going through this in Ireland?  It is a horrendous condition for the women who have to suffer through it for nine months.  The argument always made is that Cariban is unlicensed.  The State has put provisions in place to support people in the context of other unlicensed drugs.  It must be possible to find a way for the Department of Health and the Minister to make an exception for the small number of women who go through these very difficult pregnancies.  The condition can be alleviated through the use of this drug, but the associated cost is a heavy one for people to bear.  In fairness, we would in turn save on the cost of women having to go to hospital as a result of suffering from this condition.  Many women cannot work because it is so difficult.  The least we can do is to support women when they are going through pregnancy to bring new life into the world.</p></speech>

Two children were born in Kyiv.  Their Irish parents travelled there in recent days for the birth of their much-longed for babies.  Other babies will be born later this week.  They have been born into a context where our Government has advised people not to travel due to the impending possibilities that could occur in Kyiv.  Often in this House we get up and give out about officials, the Government and Ministers, and we hustle and hustle.  Throughout the increasing tensions in Ukraine, though, I have been incredibly proud of our Department of Foreign Affairs.  It has been extraordinary.  Its staff have been in daily contact with all the parents registered with the Department.  Those parents have been provided with support and welfare support.  The Department has helped in every possible way and it is trying to move mountains to ensure the parents are reassured as they go to Ukraine to try to bring home their much-longed for babies.  Many of these women have come through cancer.  Some of them were part of the 221+ cervical cancer group.  These are people who have had an arduous journey to get to this stage.  That they are arriving in a place where their baby is going to be born and terrified that it is going to be a conflict zone is unbelievably upsetting for them.</p> <p>I pay tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and to all the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs because they are full of compassion.  For people in that position, officials can hold such power over lives.  The Department's officials are going to extraordinary lengths to demonstrate how much they are on the side of Irish people.  It is a tremendous tribute to the Minister and the Department.  I just want to acknowledge that here and to congratulate those who are mammies and daddies today.  How exciting this is, and we look forward to welcoming them home at Dublin Airport.</p></speech>

I commend the Leader for withdrawing the motion on the creation and establishment of the two citizens' assemblies that were to be on the Order Paper for Thursday.  I ask that, in the interim, we have a debate on citizens' assemblies.  I was a proud member of the Constitutional Convention and I never missed a meeting.  The concept is an important part of our participative democracy.  The motion on citizens' assemblies, however, if it had been brought to the House on Thursday, was one that would have done a great disservice to our local government representatives.</p> <p>In the context of the contribution of Senator Boyhan this morning, I ask that we have a real debate about local government and the role of councillors.  Regarding the remarks of former President Robinson today concerning climate change, it has forced significant change on all of us, but particularly on local government and how it delivers.  I refer to aspects such as sustainable development, modal shift and active travel.  It is appalling, however, that the Government would shoehorn the role of local government in Ireland generally into a motion on a citizens' assembly for a directly-elected mayor of Dublin.  That does a huge disservice to our local government members and to local government.</p> <p>I do not dispute the need to have proportionality in representation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->With all due respect to my Dublin colleagues, there should be a representative from all regions of the country when discussing the future of local government.  I repeat we cannot and should not shoehorn the future of local government into a motion on a directly-elected major for Dublin when we should be having a specific citizens' assembly on the future of local government.  Given that the Taoiseach was such a fan and played such a significant active role in the plebiscite that took place in Cork, I ask that he consider the role of a directly-elected mayor for Cork city in the future.</p></speech>

The research was done over the course of two years and the findings are stark.  It has prompted Women's Aid to launch a campaign entitled "Too Into You".</p> <p>The findings tell us that more than half of our young people have experienced or known someone who has experienced intimate relationship abuse.  One in five young women and one in 11 young men in Ireland have suffered intimate relationship abuse.  In all cases where women were subjected to intimate relationship abuse, their abuse was perpetrated by someone who was very close to them, a former or existing intimate partner.  For young women, the abuse lasted longer than one year, almost one and a half years.  One in six young women and one in 13 young men have been subjected to coercive control by a partner or an ex-partner.  What coercive control means is a persistent, insidious controlling pattern of behaviour that intrudes on the person's independent sense of self and self-security.  The findings are stark.  Of the young women affected, 51% first experienced the abuse before they were 18 years of age.  That robbed those young women and girls of their childhood.</p> <p>Copies of the report have been circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas.  It is incumbent on all of us to draw public attention to the findings of this report, raise awareness about what constitutes abuse, support victims of abuse and let them know it is okay to speak out and that help is available, and for us all to respond to them.  I commend Women's Aid on the report and also the campaign it is launching and I encourage every Member of the House to support it.</p></speech>

The campaign is worthy of support from all of us.  I look forward to it.</p><p>I concur with Senator Buttimer's thoughts.  It probably got through the initial schedule last week because I did not read to the end to see that it was about far more than just establishing a citizens' assembly regarding a mayor for Dublin city.  There is absolutely no way that we will have just an hour-long debate on the future of local government.  It is far more complex than that and should not be determined for the entire country by 100 citizens and politicians from Dublin.  That is going back to the drawing board.  Once it is reworded, I will come back and offer it to everybody again.  We will agree on exactly how long is required for it.</p><p>Senator Seery Kearney, with such a beautiful smile, talked about the two babies who have been born and the babies waiting to be born in Kyiv.  I commend the Senator for her leadership in the last week.  I know that she knows this system inside-out.  She also knows the experiences that people are going through.  The empathy and leadership that the Senator showed during the week are a credit to her and the community she represents.  It is a small but growing community.  It is certainly worthy of the Senator's membership.  I congratulate her.</p><p>As he has on many occasions, Senator Ahearn raised hyperemesis and the drug in Ireland which is prescribed, bought and paid for by families, Cariban.  It is unlicensed, which has meant historically that the reimbursement scheme has not been able to reimburse families.  I am pleased to announce that last week, following suggestions from both female and male Senators, the Minister for Health set up a working group to try to find a way around the fact that it is unlicensed so that we can reimburse women.  I am sure that where there is a will, there is a way.</p><p>Senator Currie said that the cost of living for families can be directly impacted by the &euro;75 charge when people need to bring their children to an urgent care centre where she lives, in Dublin 15.  It seems like a lot of money to have to pay to attend an emergency care centre in the first place.  I will bring it to the Minister's attention.</p><p>Senator McGreehan talked about International Epilepsy Day, which was yesterday.  Coincidentally, I had the privilege of meeting Epilepsy Ireland on Friday with regard to a new planned project that it has in Fingal.  I was shocked to hear that there are 67,000 people in Ireland who are currently managing epilepsy, with just three doctors.  The dearth is staggering.  People have raised the lack of neurological nurses in the past.  We cannot monitor some of these patients more than once a year because we have no nurses and only three doctors.  We have a long way to go to look after the 67,000 people and their families, who rely on their good health.</p><p>Senator Carrigy spoke about the impasse between Dunnes Stores and the productive farmers in our pig and horticultural industries.  I am not sure that we really get that five entities in this country determine what we eat and what is on our supermarket shelves week-in, week-out, and what they pay to the producers.  If they do not like the prices that the producers offer, they just go to different countries and get cheaper products.  We row into Dunnes, Tesco, Lidl, Aldi and SuperValu weekly, thinking that we are buying an Irish product that is produced by our farmers and that they are making money from it.  They are not.  They are hanging on by their fingernails.  I commend Senator Carrigy for raising that issue.</p><p>As a former Minister for Social Protection and Employment Affairs, I am gobsmacked by the matter that Senator Malcolm Byrne raised.  He is right to call it sharp practice.  Tesco is a worthy employer.  It is sharp practice for it to try to downgrade and outsource the 100 security guards who have worked for and served it incredibly well, for many years in some cases.  I will contact SIPTU and Mandate after the Order of Business to offer our support and see if we can do anything to help them.  There is no way that those people should be made redundant, which is presumably what will happen.  Outsourcing those jobs has to be illegal.</p><p>Senator Cummins raised the building regulations and highlighted the lengthy debate that happened on the committee report last Thursday.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On Senator Dooley's contribution, I will gladly organise a debate for the week beginning 28 February for eating disorder week.  It is a silent issue, probably because many families do not want their children to be known as victims.  One of the most prolific ways in which women in this country self-harm is by controlling their eating.  It is very harmful but somewhat hidden.  A wonderful book, <i>The Raggy Dolls: Stories of Survival from Anorexia Nervosa</i>, was written by a psychologist who specialises in this area.  He produces very good podcasts.  We need a Government response and action plan, and I will happily organise that debate.<br/><br/>Senator Higgins and others spoke about Seanad 100 today.  It was a wonderful event and I pay particular credit to all of the officials who supported the Seanad and the Seanad 100 centenary celebrations.  A lot of effort went into it and it will be a wonderful celebration of the diverse and sometimes diverging views we share.  It highlighted the amount of work and thoughtful co-operation that happens in this Chamber, something that does not happen elsewhere to the same extent.<br/><br/>Senator Sherlock spoke about the regularisation of the migrant scheme and her concerns about the eligibility criteria.  I will pass those concerns on to the Minister.<br/><br/>Senator Boylan spoke about the expert group on jury selection today and the response to a freedom of information request she received with regard to the Office of Public Works, OPW.  I will bring that to the attention of the Minister so that the Senator can get a direct response.<br/><br/>The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, spoke about hobby farmers.  I have to be honest.  I am not sure I would 100% agree with her contribution because to my mind the reason most people are part-time farmers in this country is because they cannot earn a living from being full-time farmers and have children, wives and homes to support.  We have a long way to go to be competitive and not pitch farmers against each other and multiples, and definitely not farmers against the State and the Government that supports them.<br/><br/>Senator Boyhan spoke about Seanad 100 and the Dublin citizens' assembly.  He expressed his concerns about the amendment that has been withdrawn.<br/><br/>Senator Dolan spoke about Seanad 100 and her joy at watching Mary Robinson and Senator Norris, and the passion they displayed when they spoke so eloquently earlier today.  She spoke about her visit to GMIT.<br/><br/>Senator O'Loughlin, Seanad leader for Fianna F&aacute;il, spoke about how the Seanad can show its leadership on climate change, retrofitting grants and having daily and weekly conversations about how Government actions have an impact and can change people's lives.  She also spoke about the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, rally on 5 March.  I thank her for raising the issue.  I also thank Joe Duffy for talking about this on the radio today.  Women work supremely well when we work together in unison.  That does not necessarily mean we all have to have exactly the same political or ideological views.  Our power is when we come together and fight and campaign for something.  It is ironic Senator Boylan said she will not participate in the women's caucus in Leinster House because it is exclusionary but is quite happy to participate in the NWCI rally in a couple of weeks even though it is exclusionary.  This is a State-funded body that is supposed to represent all women in Ireland, not just a select few with some select views.  I have to be very honest: this is not the first time I have genuinely felt it does not represent me.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-15a.97" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022021500002#DD00300"><p>I am very glad to be here to introduce this Bill.  It is an important part of the Government's response to the recent increase in the cost of living due to high electricity and gas prices.  It is in this regard that we produced the Bill.  I am glad to be opening the debate today and to be able to set the context for the action to be taken on foot of this Bill.  I will describe the sections of the Bill and, having regard to its main provisions, set out some background as to why they are needed for the operation of the scheme.  My overarching message is that while the scheme this Bill will establish is just one of a package of measures, it is critical to put it into place within this quarter.  I seek permission to achieve that.  First, I will outline the main factors affecting electricity prices in Ireland.  Second, I will outline the Government's response to rising electricity and gas prices.  Third, I will reaffirm the Government's conviction that the best long-term approach to insulating consumers from volatility in international fossil fuel markets is to decarbonise our energy system and radically improve the energy efficiency of our housing stock.</p> <p>I will now turn to the first point, namely factors affecting Irish electricity prices.  Senators will appreciate that we face additional costs due to our geographical location, fossil fuel dependency, the small scale of the Irish market, our low population density and exchange rate fluctuations.  However, the most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland has been the unprecedented upward trend in international gas prices since 2020.  Indications are now that these higher prices will remain significantly higher for the immediate future.  This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices because gas is used for electricity generation.  It is a matter of serious concern to the Government that energy price increases caused by these international conditions are putting increasing pressure on consumers, particularly the most vulnerable.  These price increases are not caused by the Government or regulatory decisions.  Suppliers compete with one another on price and set their own prices, as expected in a competitive commercial liberalised market.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, indicated that customers could save &euro;300 by switching their electricity or gas supplier every year.</p> <p>It is important to state that all European markets are experiencing these same price increase.  Other member states have taken various actions, including suspending tariffs for networks, suspending tariffs for green energy subsidies, reducing VAT and introducing or increasing payments to low-income households.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eamon Ryan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2028"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2028&amp;amp;pid=EamonRyanGP&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Since Ireland's announcement of a credit to each domestic electricity household, Belgium has followed suit announcing that it will introduce &euro;100 credit for households.  </p><p>I will now turn to the Government's response to the rise in prices.  On 10 February, a suite of Government policy measures was announced by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform designed to further support households.  These new measures included an increase in the energy credit in this Bill to &euro;200, including VAT.  This will necessitate a change to the text of the Bill that specifies both the upward limit on funding for the scheme it establishes and the amount of the individual payment to be made to each domestic electricity account.  I will bring forward the necessary amendments on Committee Stage in this House.  </p><p>A temporary 20% reduction in public transport fares will apply from April until the end of the year.  A further lump sum payment of &euro;125 on the fuel allowance will be paid in early March to some 390,000 recipients.  In addition, there are reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children.  There will be a reduction in the drug payment scheme from &euro;144 to &euro;80, which will benefit approximately 70,000 residents.  The working family payment budget increase announced on budget day will be brought forward from 1 June to 1 April.  </p><p>All of these measures are on top of the existing measures taken in budget 2022 to support households.  Budget 2022 increased the weekly rate of the fuel allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;924 will be paid to eligible households over the course of this winter.  The fuel allowance is one of a range of income supports paid by the Department of Social Protection, which also includes general social welfare schemes, living alone increases to support those living alone and at a higher risk of poverty, and the household benefits package.  Targeted supports are also provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments and urgent needs payments while under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people with special heating needs, for example, in the case of ill health.</p><p>Looking to the future and the urgent need to decarbonise, I will now outline the long-term approach for Ireland and in that context, the Government's urgent focus on energy efficiency.  Energy efficiency is central to addressing the root causes of energy poverty and improving health and social inclusion outcomes while at the same time, contributing to decarbonisation.  On 8 February, the Government announced unprecedented grant supports for home energy upgrades and increased numbers of free energy upgrades for those at risk of energy poverty.  A new national home energy upgrade scheme providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump - up from 30% to 35% currently - with a one-stop-shop providing an end-to-end service for homeowners.  We are also introducing higher grants for cavity wall and attic insulation, which will more than triple to cover approximately 80% of the typical cost of these measures and will be available to all homeowners.  For instance, in the case of a semi-detached home, the attic insulation grant will increase from &euro;400 to &euro;1,300.  It is expected that these works will pay back in one to two years in most houses.</p><p>A total of &euro;267 million has been allocated for SEA's residential and community retrofit schemes in 2022.  This investment will support almost 27,000 home energy upgrades, including upgrading over 8,600 homes to a BER of B2, which is a near doubling of B2 output over 2021, and 4,800 free energy upgrades for households at risk of energy poverty.  In addition, &euro;85 million in funding has been provided by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the local authority energy efficiency retrofit programme.  Making our homes energy efficient not only means they are warmer, healthier and cheaper to run but also means we are taking concrete action on social deprivation, including energy poverty, that is sustainable and enduring.  </p><p>I will now devote my remaining remarks to the Bill's subject matter.  The Bill will establish a scheme through which the electricity cost emergency benefit can be paid in 2022.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, as an independent energy regulator, will provide oversight of the scheme, which will be operated by the electricity distribution system operator ESB Networks.  I will provide, under regulations, for a date on which the distribution system operator will calculate the total number of domestic electricity accounts in the State on the basis of meter point registration numbers, MPRNs.</p></speech>
