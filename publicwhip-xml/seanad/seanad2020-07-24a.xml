We all agree with the Irish Muslim Peace &amp;amp; Integration Council which said of Dr. Ali and all healthcare workers that they are at the front line of fighting Covid-19 and are true heroes.  We express our sympathies to the families of Dr. Ali and all those who died as a result of Covid-19, and of course to the family of Ruth Morrissey, her daughter Libby and her husband Paul.  She was a tireless campaigner for truth for all those who suffered as a result of the CervicalCheck issue.  She was a warrior for truth and justice.  We remember her today.</p></speech>

It is one I raised on a number of occasions in the previous Seanad, namely, period poverty.  For those who do not know what period poverty is, it is being unable to access sanitary products due to financial constraints.  It is a global public health issue and vulnerable women and girls in Ireland today are suffering from period poverty.  They cannot manage their menstruation in a safe, dignified and healthy fashion and without stigma and shame attached to it.  That poses a very real risk to their health and well-being.  A recent survey of girls in Ireland revealed that 50% have been unable to access sanitary products due to financial constraints and 61% have missed school as a result of their period.  Women are using rags and newspapers and some have suffered significant permanent damage to their health as a result of using inappropriate products.  It is shameful that, as a rich, developed country, we allow this to persist.  We already know that women have borne the brunt of this pandemic financially and otherwise.  Period poverty in Ireland is set to become an even bigger issue in the coming years as a result of the pandemic.</p> <p>Almost a year and a half ago, the Seanad and D&aacute;il passed identical motions on period poverty.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I was happy to play my part in that in the previous Seanad.  As a result of those dual motions, the Minister for Health gave a commitment that sanitary products would be available in all public buildings and a committee on this subject was set up within the Department, which brought together various NGOs and interest groups.  That committee has met, so I ask the Leader to call the new Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, to this House to get an update on its work.  Ireland was a global leader on public health in the past.  The current Taoiseach brought in the smoking ban when he was the Minister for Health and Children, and we were world leaders in that regard.  That ban changed the culture, public health and people's behaviour, and it saved thousands of lives.  Now is the time to make a bold statement on behalf of women in this country.  We must become global leaders and join countries like Scotland and New Zealand by giving the women of Ireland the respect they need and the dignity to have a safe period. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-24a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072400002#C00200"><p>I wish to proposed an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 5 be taken before No. 1.  I wish to draw the House's attention to the following health matter and I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to make himself available to deal with this issue, as he has other business in this House today.  I refer to the need for the HSE and the Department of Health to put in place a comprehensive programme for influenza inoculation right across the country.  We know there is a significant danger of flu coinciding with spikes in Covid infections and that the symptoms of some flus and Covid are easily confused.  Some scientific material also indicates that the flu complicates Covid conditions and makes the Covid infection more dangerous.  Given that there is a seasonal aspect to flu and that, ordinarily, there is a significant influenza problem from October to January or February, it is essential that the health authorities extend inoculation services to the maximum possible extent.</p> <p>A plan is currently afoot in United Kingdom - or in the English part of it, at least - to provide free influenza inoculation not only to those over 65 but to everybody over 50 and to other vulnerable categories of the population.  With all the problems we are experiencing at the moment, it is essential that the HSE makes preparations to do that in September and October.  I would like to hear from the Minister that that is going to happen, that the plans are well advanced and that we are not going to find ourselves running to catch up when this becomes a problem in November.  In the southern hemisphere, where the seasons are different, there are indications that social distancing and mask-wearing for Covid have reduced the prevalence of influenza and are having a repressive effect on it.  That may be the case but we have an opportunity now to do something about the coincidence of flu and Covid and I would like to hear what the Minister proposes to do. </p></speech>

In advance of the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill 2020 and the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Bill 2020 coming to the House next week, I have serious questions about what was announced yesterday.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There can be no doubt that the injection of &euro;5 billion in additional spending into our economy is badly needed, but let us be clear as to what needs to be fixed and what the July stimulus does and does not do.  There is no doubt that businesses need support and the vast majority of the firepower announced yesterday was directed at them.  For workers, there were some assurances on the continuation of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, but there was very little reassurance yesterday for people who are out of work, especially those in sectors that cannot open until there is a vaccine or treatment for Covid-19.   I am thinking of the arts sector in particular.  As the National Campaign for the Arts has already stated, this sector was the first to close and will be probably be one of the last to reopen.  Many venues simple will not be able to open and many performances will not take place.  The key issue is that a number of announcements were made yesterday on the performance fund and the arts but there was no detail.  The only clarity we got was that the pandemic unemployment payment is to be cut, which is deeply regrettable for those in the sector, many of whom were already on very low pay prior to the outbreak of the pandemic.  There are also anomalous situations involving people who were dependent on State benefits in 2018 and freelancers.  I refer in particular to those on maternity benefit who were working in the arts and who have not been allowed to count that maternity benefit as reckonable income in determining their entitlement to the pandemic unemployment payment. </p></speech>

For the decorum of the House, it is very difficult for Senators to speak when other Senators are interacting with each other.  If Senators need to speak to each other, I ask them to step outside.  Senator Sherlock will get extra time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-24a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072400002#D00500"><p>That is grand.  We need to see detail on certain matters in advance of the aforementioned Bills coming to the House next week, with regard to those in the arts sector in particular.  They are now facing a dual uncertainty, due to the pandemic unemployment payment and the freezing of rents and the eviction ban, as a disproportionate share of people in the arts sector are renting and are not paying mortgages.  I ask for that detail on the &euro;10 million performance fund and for certainty on how it will be distributed in the sector.  It would be great if it went to organisations and their employees, but there is a very real difficulty for freelancers.</p> <p>The real issue with yesterday's announcement is that the firepower of the State's resources is being directed at businesses in the hope that it will create jobs and that they would remain viable, but all the usual rules of thumb with regard to the incentives to business, elasticity in putting money in and ensuring that businesses will react accordingly are gone out the door.  We simply do not know what the next few months are going to bring for the Irish economy.  It is regrettable that we are dependent on businesses and the trickle-down effect to workers.  We need certainty for those who are out of jobs, in particular for those depending on the pandemic unemployment payment. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-24a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1688" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072400002#D00600"><p>Aonta&iacute;m leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir Sherlock.  I agree with pretty much everything Senator Sherlock said when expressing her concerns about some of the specifics announced, or rather not announced, in the July stimulus package.</p> <p>I am concerned about the way we are doing and are expected to do our business in this House over the next while.  While none of us is shying away from the important work facing us over the next few weeks, a number of substantial Bills are coming before us and they are being taken at all Stages.  That has been the case for the last number of weeks, for some reasons that are understandable and justifiable.  However, we need to reflect on the manner in which legislation is proceeding through the House.  It is not good practice for all Stages to be taken in one day.  Sometimes all Stages of one or two Bills are being taken in one day.  That is unsettling for legitimate parliamentary reasons, but also on the basis of the very legitimate points expressed by Senator Sherlock.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If it is a matter of us having to sit a bit longer we should do so, given the Government formation talks went on for so long and the pandemic restrictions prevented us from coming to this place and kept us at home.  That is not to say Members were not working, we were all involved in work in our own communities and representing people.  If it means that we can better scrutinise and do our job to improve legislation from the Government or the other House we need to look at that.  I appreciate that this is not on the Leader.  It is something for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to reflect on and is something I will take up next week but I ask Members from both sides of this Chamber to be cognisant of that reality.</p><p>I welcome the announcement from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade this week that it has granted over &pound;60,000 funding from the reconciliation fund to the CAIN website.   For anyone who does not know, CAIN is the conflict archive on the Internet, based in Ulster University.  It has been in existence since about 1997 and it is lauded internationally for its comprehensive record of conflict-related incidents.  It is held up as an educational, academic and indeed civic asset and resource.  As a student of politics, both at A level and in university, it was something I leaned on very heavily.  It is cited as a source at the end of many a paper or essay.  People were deeply worried that funding had come to an end for the archive and that it may have had to be mothballed.  This intervention from the Government and the Department is very welcome because it is such an asset, such a resource.  While it is only a temporary stopgap, I hope the universities and others will engage and appreciate just how important this website is and hopefully that funding can continue.</p></speech>

Early in lockdown, I spoke extensively about this issue and warned of the dangers, as did many of the organisations who deal with it on a daily basis.  It became a powder keg for already difficult situations.  In hidden homes, people were experiencing violence and felt they had nowhere to go.  The Garda followed up on all previous incidents of domestic violence to ensure that women and men were getting help.  However, we now have a legacy that we must deal with.</p> <p>The programme for Government is the first such programme to mention sexual violence and domestic violence.  We really need to look at it immediately because it is not just a matter of how we deal with the actual incidents.  Courts were sitting throughout lockdown and barring and protection orders were being given.  We have to look at the causes, however.  One of the really powerful things within the programme for Government is that we look at prevention of domestic violence, not just dealing with its consequences.  I ask the Leader to expedite this in order that we can see some early movement.  We are talking a lot about the economic consequences but there are also social consequences that need immediate action.  Yesterday we listened to the Irish medical officers speaking about 35 incidents of domestic violence occurring before people actually identified to authorities that they were suffering.  As such it not just about how we deal with it through the court system, it is the prevention that we really need to look at.</p></speech>

It is a concern that by the end of next week we will probably have had more Bills go through all Stages than went through the entire last Seanad by means of the "all Stages" mechanism.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a real concern because the job we are all elected to do is legislative scrutiny.  The very real and thoughtful concerns that Senator Sherlock expressed on social welfare payments and the insight that everyone on all sides of the House may have about different Bills is not being given an opportunity to be properly engaged with, to be properly considered by Ministers and to be an aid to them in improving legislation.  We need to look at that and make a very clear statement that that is not how business is going to continue.  Certainly, when we return in September we cannot be in a situation where there is not an appropriate opportunity for scrutiny between Committee and Report Stages of legislation.  In the past, this is very often where things have actually happened because an amendment brought in good faith on Committee Stage may be engaged with by a Department and then by Report Stage become a Government amendment.  That is a healthy conversation and we are missing the opportunity for that at the moment.  I urge that we look at how we plan to move forward with the legislative process and of course all of those other matters being addressed in the D&aacute;il where Members are having debates on the July stimulus package, for example.  In our very first session in this Chamber there were calls for a debate on the package prior to its announcement.  We did not have such a debate.  Now, we should at least have some opportunity next week to reflect on it.  There are very good measures in that package.  Some measures relating to public services and the arts need to be strengthened.  That input from us can help to inform the October strategy.  As such it is important that we have the Seanad doing its work.</p><p>In that same spirit of valuing the Seanad and caring about what it does, I am very happy to support the taking of No. 5 before No. 1 today, which relates to the introduction of the Seanad Reform Bill 2020.  Many of us, across all sides of the House, entered the previous Seanad very keen to move forward on this issue.  I am looking at Senator Ned O'Sullivan and thinking of Senators Warfield, McDowell and others.  We put a great many hours into thinking about how we could move forward with Seanad reform.  We wanted to reflect the mandate given by the public in 1979 for the expansion of the university franchise and in 2013 when the public, many of whom had no vote in Seanad elections, and who as non-graduates may never have had a vote, voted to retain the Seanad and reform it.  I am glad that new Members are also interested in these issues and I hope that we make this Seanad the place where we constructively find ways to move forward.</p></speech>

It is of concern on a broader scale as well.  I refer to the control of the noxious weed called ragwort.  Anyone who travels on a road will see this yellow weed and to the uninformed, it may look well.  It is a nice yellow weed to view but it is a noxious weed.  Livestock and horses avoid eating it.  If they eat it in a wilted or withered form after it has been cut, it is poisonous.</p> <p>It is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to oversee the control of this weed under the Noxious Weeds Act 1936.  However, based on discussing the issue with farmers and general observation, its prevalence is in fields close to roads and it is very prevalent on roadsides.  It is not being controlled by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, or the local authorities and the seeds are spreading.  Farmers, even with the best husbandry in the world, have lost control in their fields adjacent to roads because it is spreading from the roadside.  It is important that the Leader communicates with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which have responsibility.  Officials need to communicate with TII, the local authorities and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Until it is controlled on the roadsides and the verges, the farmers will be fighting a losing battle.</p></speech>

I ask that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, discusses how we move forward with expressing votes of sympathy for former Members.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was usual that the family would come here on the day on which sympathies were expressed.  I am sure that while that is not possible at this stage, there is a way forward.</p><p>In recent days the European Commission has given the Government the green light for the electricity support scheme to proceed.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Eamon Ryan, outlined this in the D&aacute;il.  It is great to see this coming forward but it presents problems for communities.  It includes a preference category to support communities to develop their own renewable energy projects, but they have a lot of problems in this field.  First, the communities do not have the cash to develop these wind farms.  Second, they have problems with the planning process, which is very detailed, complicated and expensive, and they need support on that.  LEADER provides feasibility study funding for communities to develop wind farms and to have feasibility studies carried out, but that process is complicated as well and slow-moving.  I ask the Leader to get the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and perhaps the Minister with responsibility for rural affairs to come before the House at some stage in order that we might have a debate on the problems faced by community farms, whether onshore or offshore, in developing wind energy or offshore projects.</p></speech>

The late Farrell McElgunn, a former Senator and MEP, departed this life in March as well.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh s&eacute;.</p> <p>It was reported, a Chathoirligh agus a Threora&iacute;, that the Cabinet on Tuesday approved the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020, under which terms a witness would no longer be required to swear before God or to make an affirmation when filing an affidavit.  What is proposed instead is that people will be able to make a statement of truth remotely.  This was said by the Law Society to be welcome because it would put an end to what it called the "embarrassing" practice of a witness having to indicate his or her religious faith when making an affidavit.  I disagree with the welcome given to this proposal because it attacks genuine pluralism by depriving people swearing an affidavit of the option of making a solemn oath.  What we should do is recommend by all means, if we must, the introduction of a statement of truth but in addition to an oath or affirmation.  In a similar way we found a very good arrangement in the Seanad whereby, instead of the prayer as Gaeilge and in English, we start with 30 seconds of silence, which is a very appropriate way to recognise that all Members, of all faiths and none, approach their duties here in a solemn and respectful fashion.  Indeed, in the absence of an oath or affirmation, the question of making a legally sanctionable statement of truth is a meaningless formula anyway because the law can simply provide for the prosecution of those who knowingly make false statements or averments in affidavits.  The effort is further weakened by providing that all this could be done remotely, without a person having to present before a solicitor or notary public to make this statement of truth.  This is all rather badly thought through.  This measure ignores a genuine lack of pluralism that exists whereby judges and Presidents are required to make a religious oath.  What is happening here, perhaps, is an attempt to anticipate the creation of some kind of one-size-fits-all formula for these cases as well.  It is not good public policy to regard religious belief or lack thereof as an exclusively private matter.  What we have here is a weakening of the atmosphere of solemnity and a failure to recognise that the dignity and seriousness of the State have always been bolstered by references to those questions of ultimate meaning.  They have buttressed the rule of law in this country, whatever views or outlooks on those questions of ultimate meaning people have.</p></speech>

There will be a serious injection of capital with some &euro;5.4 billion going into the economy to try to address the very significant fallout from Covid-19.  I understand that this is the largest amount - or wall of money, as I heard one commentator refer to it today - ever injected into our economy.  Additionally, more &euro;2 billion in loans will be guaranteed to a great extent by the State.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The real objective of this has to be to pump-prime our economy.  A debate here would be helpful because we need to tease out some aspects of this.  We cannot allow, as often happens, red tape to get in the way.  I have already had some people on to me from bed and breakfast businesses who were initially delighted to see a recognition of the impact on their sector but who are now concerned, since they may not be registered with Bord F&aacute;ilte, that they will not be able to be accommodated.</p><p>There is also the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  Companies applying for the scheme will have to demonstrate that they have been impacted to the extent of a drop in activity of a minimum of 25%.  What we do not want is companies ensuring they remain below that threshold in order to get the payment.</p><p>We need a debate here to try to ensure a degree of flexibility and a capacity to appeal certain decisions in respect of the payment of these sums because their whole purpose is to try to get people back to work rapidly and get activity going again.  It is absolutely necessary to ensure some flexibilities in respect of the various criteria.  Of course there must be criteria, and their purpose must be to assist companies that are affected to the greatest extent.  However, if one company has seen a drop in turnover of 25% and is entitled to the wage subsidy scheme, and if another company has seen a drop of only 24.5% and gets nothing, there is an anomaly there that needs to be addressed.  We must therefore be very careful in the application of the necessary criteria.  A debate would help to clear up some of the potential confusion that might emerge.</p></speech>

I think we would all welcome a debate on the announcement yesterday.  If time could be made available next week to have such a debate, that should happen.  I was looking at the schedule for next week and we seem to have a gap on Wednesday morning, so perhaps that morning would be the time to have such a debate.</p> <p>As the Cathaoirleach will be aware, this is Farm Safety Week.  In 2015, this House, through the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, an excellent committee of which the Cathaoirleach is a member and which has done fine work and published some great reports over the years, did a report on farm safety.  I had the privilege of being the rapporteur for that report.  Senators who were here at the time will remember that we had many witnesses before the committee over, I think, two days of public hearings.  There was a significant engagement.  In 2014, 30 people lost their lives as a result of farm accidents.  Sadly, while this figure has improved, so far this year 14 people have lost their lives tragically as a result of accidents on farms.  I commend the Government on taking the initiative of appointing for the first time a Minister of State with specific responsibility for farm safety.  This was discussed during the deliberations on the report to which I referred and it is very welcome.  I suggest to the Leader that she invite, perhaps in the autumn, the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, whose responsibility farm safety is, before the House for a debate on farm safety.  It would give him an opportunity to update us on the work he is doing on farm safety.  Perhaps there are Senators who would have suggestions that would help him in the critical work he is doing. </p></speech>

It is right for so many reasons that we encourage those who are fortunate enough to be able to afford a holiday to stay on the island, not least because it would help our economy and industry.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Elisha McCallion:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ElishaMcCallion&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It also encourages people to learn more about their own heritage and cultural identity.  I ask that the Leader at this point consider having a conversation with her colleagues with responsibility for tourism and suggest there should be some sort of quick intervention between Tourism NI, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to promote the island as a whole.  We have a small window of opportunity to do that.  Obviously, we are in the middle of the holiday season, but it would be useful if those three bodies could come together and begin to market and promote the one island as a place for people who are fortunate enough to holiday to come together.</p><p>A place I have spoken about many times in this Chamber - Members may not have heard of it as it is marketed - is the north west city region.  It is a place I encourage anyone here today and further afield across the island to visit.  Everything is on one's doorstep.  The north west city region has a city, namely, Derry, in the middle of it for a city break, and Donegal, which has some of the finest beaches and best golf courses.  I could say plenty about Derry and all the tourist attractions there, but I will not as I am running out of time.  However, an opportunity could be missed if we do not ask all those agencies to come together as a matter of urgency to try and promote the one island.</p></speech>

The Cathaoirleach will be aware there was a Labour Court recommendation in 2008.  This has been the subject of a long-running series of discussions.  I am aware the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, is due to meet representatives of the supervisors next week.  I am hopeful that we will finally be able to reach agreement.  Many of these CE supervisors have been working for a long number of years.  It is important that we implement the Labour Court recommendation and that these supervisors have access to an occupational pension scheme.</p> <p>Much of the focus has been on the emphasis on remote working.  The Government has started a consultation process around remote working and this is welcome.  However, it will be difficult for our towns and villages, which will be the centres of remote working, to continue to develop unless there is adequate water and waste water infrastructure.  When we have a debate on housing, representatives of Irish Water should be invited to come here to talk about the water and waste water schemes we need in place in smaller towns and villages around the country to allow them to be sustainable.  That will help in terms of regional development but also in providing housing.  I am conscious that in my own county, vibrant towns and villages like Camolin, Ferns, Our Lady's Island, Ramsgrange and Campile do not have the necessary water and waste water.  It will be impossible for them to develop unless those schemes are developed.  I am sure the Leader has found the same in her own country.  I hope that when we have that debate on housing, Irish Water will brought in to give answers on that issue as well.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the difficult job the Leader has, there is merit in the comments of Senator Higgins this morning regarding all Stages of Bills.  It is important for us to have our own autonomy here.  In advance of the schools and our educational establishments reopening in September, we should have a debate in the House next week on education and the reopening of our schools.  Let me put it in context.  A principal in Dunmanway, Mr. Niall Murphy, put out a tweet yesterday in which he said that 2 m equals eight students in a 7 m by 7 m classroom.  Therefore, 1 m equals 16 students in a 7 m by 7 m classroom.</p> <p>It is important we have clarity earlier rather than later regarding our return to third level, post-primary and primary schools.  We are heading into the last week of July and one thing our schools do very well is organise.  It is important that the Government and the Minister, Deputy Foley, come into this House next week to give us all clarity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I speak as a former teacher who has been engaged with some of my former colleagues on the return of schools and third level institutions.  We now have blended and online education but, as we all know, children need to be in the classroom in the school setting for their sociological, educational and physiological development.

These are based on recent correspondence residents received from the international protection accommodation service, IPAS, regarding those who leave direct provision overnight and similar matters. The correspondence states that in line with previous public health advice, any resident who is absent from the centre for one night or more without notifying the manager will not be permitted to return to the centre and will have to formally reapply to IPAS to be re-accommodated.  It goes on to state this will include a required 14-day quarantine period in an appropriate isolation location.  Huge concerns have been raised about this.  I ask the Leader to appeal to the Minister for Justice and Equality for common sense to prevail.  People in direct provision are grown adults.  This decision is not in line with any public health advice to any other resident in the State.  There are deep concerns about this and the infantilisation and treatment of those in direct provision.</p> <p>On that note, Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT, has announced a sanctuary scholarship.  Many other institutions have such scholarships and these need to be much more widespread.  I encourage Senators to share information on sanctuary scholarships that may be available in their local areas.</p> <p>The Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI, is taking a survey of educational attainment and aspirations of those in direct provision and the asylum process.  This research is valuable given our new razor-sharp focus on post-second level education.  I encourage the new Ministers, one of whom was in the Chamber yesterday, to engage with MASI and other such groups on the issue of educational attainment and opportunities for those living in direct provision or the asylum process.  </p> <p>As I will not be in the House to say this next week, Eid celebrations will take place in Croke Park this day next week and I wish all the participants and organisers well.</p></speech>

The list goes on.  On the day of the announcement, the leader of the Opposition described the stimulus as miserly and lacking in ambition.  Yesterday afternoon, the same party opposed the setting up of a new Department of higher education dedicated to empowering citizens to improve themselves through further education and reach their potential in whatever way that will be.  That is miserly and lacking in ambition.</p> <p>The July stimulus is an excellent package for many workers and businesses.  It needs to be teased out as it is not perfect but, as my colleague, Senator Dooley, said, these things can be tweaked.  The stimulus is part of our recovery and we have other schemes which assist in many other ways.  I also look forward to hearing how other sectors, namely, day-care services, health services, childcare services and, in particular, schools, will get back to some semblance of pre-Covid normality.</p></speech>

One may initially feel that those two events do not have an awful lot in common but there is a common denominator: they did, and will, bring people together.  Sport brings people together.  It has a dividend in a sense of community, health and mindfulness.  It also has a business dividend because sport is an employer and a revenue generator.  Sport brings people together.  Some Munster, Connacht and Leinster fans visited Belfast for the first time to watch interprovincial rugby matches.  Almost more important, our friends from the North also came south for the first time.</p> <p>Soccer, the beautiful game, is struggling in this country.  Jack Charlton was an iconic Leeds United figure and English international footballer.  He was a quintessential English sportsman whom we took into our hearts as one of our own.  If one ever wanted to see a crest that tells a thousand words, one should look at the crest of East Belfast GAA club.  England, Ireland and Ulster Scots are represented on it.  Sport can bring people together, yet the beautiful game is on its knees at the moment.  I ask the two governments on this island to consult with clubs and UEFA.  I am actively pursuing this and ask other Senators to come with me and come up with suggestions as to how we can reinject vigour into soccer on the island of Ireland.  An all-island league is one way to go.  Perhaps the winner of the league should be entered into the first round proper of the English or Scottish FA cups.</p> <p>The Seanad can be a catalyst for good in that regard.  We bemoaned the fact that no Northern Irish person was appointed a Member of the Upper House a few weeks ago.  We might have a role to play here.  We must bring back the spirit of Barry McGuigan, the Clones Cyclone, a Monaghan man who was adopted in Ulster Hall.  Let us work together and let the Upper House be a catalyst.  We do not have a Northern Irish representative among us but that means we should work twice as hard.  We bemoan the absence of such a representative but I am redoubling my efforts to do all we can to help bring our people together in a positive way.</p></speech>

I spoke last night to my colleague and friend, Councillor Joe Lyons, a representative in that area.  The community in Callan is at a loss about what to do about the levels of silt that have built up between the two bridges in the town.  It has reached a point where the riverbed has reached the same height as the riverbank.  Kilkenny County Council published a detailed strategic flooding assessment in April 2019.  A couple of years ago, the council provided &euro;75,000 for the river.  That money was used to clean out the river and riverbanks while doing nothing for the riverbed, which is the main cause of the problem.  The council has essentially told Councillor Lyons that responsibility for the riverbed lies solely with Waterways Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Waterways Ireland has carried out tests and reports, hemmed and hawed and not got anywhere with it.  It has said that finance is the biggest issue, that it cannot afford to desilt the river because it would cost &euro;365,000 to do it in the first place and that if it were done, it would have to be done again in a couple of years' time.</p><p>Councillor Lyons told me that the community is at a loss as to what to do.  I suggest to the Leader that it would be timely if we could have a debate about Waterways Ireland and, more importantly, perhaps a wider debate about what we are doing to protect the rivers on this island, North and South.  We must consider what we can do to make sure rivers do not get to a point where one cannot see where the riverbed is anymore and one can almost walk across it.  It would be timely to do that.  I know we will not be able to have that debate next week but perhaps we could look at it when we return in September.</p></speech>

The matter was well discussed in both Houses prior to this year's general election, but we did not get to the stage of taking any real action on it.  We are lagging behind in comparison to Europe in this regard.  We all know that hate crime is a prejudiced, mindless attack on any individual or group because of the colour of their skin, sexual orientation or anything of that nature.  That is abhorrent to all reasonable people.  On a more micro level, we see hate speech every day on social media.  Last week, slightly in jest but not fully, I put up on Twitter that people who post anonymously should be put onto a separate forum or platform to those of us who identify ourselves and stand over what we have to say.  Let those anonymous people go onto that other platform and have a happy time abusing each other and let other people get on with catching up with the news and having an occasional joust with somebody or other in a reasonable way.  Some of the things that are said on Twitter are hate crimes.  When I say that, the people responsible will respond that I am interfering with freedom of speech.  Indeed I am not.  In fact, they are an attack on freedom of speech.</p></speech>

It is also spilling over into politics as well.  I am not pointing the figure at any particular party but we should all take note that wise use of social media offers a political advantage and some are better at it than others.  My own party has a lot to learn about the use of social media.  That use of social media must be reasonable and civilised.  I hope the Minister, in her own time, will come before us and debate the issue.</p></speech>

It was a wonderful, well-deserved achievement.  She is certainly a Teachta D&aacute;la whom I admire greatly.  She always sticks up for and does the right thing.  She is well deserving of the position to which she has been elected and I am delighted that she won the vote yesterday.  I congratulate all the Deputies who voted for her and gave her that honour.  Please God, I will call all the female Deputies and Senators together for a photo on the plinth next week to celebrate.  It is something wonderful that women in politics must celebrate.  When we see other women doing well, we must get in behind them.  We must encourage women into politics when we can.  A young woman yesterday left the stage of politics, or is at least talking about leaving the stage.  That is a great shame because losing someone of the talent of Saoirse McHugh to the arena of politics is not good for politics.  I would like to see the women in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il getting out there and encouraging more women into politics.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It does not matter whether it is done through the party system or independently, as I have done, the doors are there and they can be opened so please go for it.</p><p>I second the call by Senator Ned O'Sullivan for the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House.

I also acknowledge the seven other health workers in Ireland who tragically lost their lives because of Covid-19.  Their names and that of Dr. Ali should be remembered.</p> <p>Yesterday, we had the announcement of the July jobs initiative, which includes &euro;75 million for minor works for primary and secondary schools to prepare for the much anticipated and needed return to school.  There has been an ambitious schools building programme under way since 2019, with commitments to build 42 primary and secondary throughout the State.  This excludes all of the major extensions that have been going on in recent years to deal with our growing population needs.  One of the schools committed to is in what is described as Blanchardstown west and Blanchardstown village, but will actually look after the needs of people west of the M50 and south of the N3, in areas such as Ongar, Clonsilla and Carpenterstown.  It will accommodate 800 secondary school students.  It will open in temporary accommodation in September and is under the patronage of Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board with an accomplished team of teachers.  Its name is &Eacute;riu community college and &Eacute;riu is where &Eacute;ire comes from.  Despite all of this good news, the school does not yet have a permanent site.  A permanent site has not been identified and this is a barrier to enrolment, particularly at this uncertain time.  Will the Leader request an update from the Minister for Education and Skills on the permanent site for this school?  I know that next week we will have a discussion with the Minister for Education and Skills but perhaps she will come to the Seanad in September to discuss the capital programme and the needs we have identified in our communities.</p></speech>

I will not spend my time speaking about Rooskey, the River Shannon, Lough Key, Arigna, Loughnanane Park and Slieve Bawn.  I will use my slot to speak about tourism.  I am very glad to see one of our colleagues, Senator McDowell, seeing the good fresh air and good people of Roscommon.  He joins us there frequently but I know that because of the lockdown, he has not been able to spend as much time as usual with us.  It is a lovely county.  That is my little bit for tourism.  Rather than pass through Roscommon, people should stop.  That message is directed in particular at Senator Dooley because a lot of Roscommon people go to County Clare.</p> <p>Very briefly, the package announced yesterday is very important and a lot of money is involved.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I take cognisance of what Senator McDowell said yesterday about an awful lot of money being tied up in it and there will not be money for everyone.  That is a fact.  I agree with the comments made by some Members that we should have a debate in the House.  There are issues regarding sole traders and others that need to be recognised.  The Minister, Deputy McGrath, and other members of the Government will be anxious to have these matters fleshed out to see whether we can do something for that sector.  I particularly refer to the arts sector, as has been mentioned.  I acknowledge this fact and that we need to have a debate about the package in the House.</p></speech>

One of the Bills of which I am most proud is the amendment to the Gender Recognition Act, which tried to right the wrong of the exclusion of young people from the original Act.  The House has a proud record of support and shows of empathy for our trans community, who bear the brunt of attacks on all of the LGBTIQ communities.  Before I resubmit the legislation I want to ask the Leader, in line with the programme for Government commitment, when the Government intends to bring forward legislation to recognise the right of self-determination for 16 and 17 year old transgender people?  Will it considering extending this right of self-determination, or even with parental consent, to those under the age of 16?  Will the Leader explain why need further research is needed into those aged under 16, when the review group, established as it so happens by the Leader's former Department, included research from experts on child welfare and legal rights and Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, and consulted doctors, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and parental rights?  Has the scoping exercise begun on non-binary identities?  Will it be completed by December as previously stated by the Leader when she was Minister?  It is not a phase.  Trans men are men and trans women are women.</p></speech>

I am not sure many people had the opportunity to watch the Wexford senior hurling championship match between St. Martins and Oulart-The Ballagh but to see 200 people in a venue the size of Wexford Park when our numbers are where they are is not reasonable.  In dealing with the pandemic we have shown a level of flexibility that we need again.  GAA matches and other events throughout the country are taking place and organisations are struggling with the pandemic.  We should not put in place false limits that will impact on the finances of organisations.</p> <p>Club GAA matches will happen in every county with 200 people attending.  It is not right when the Covid-19 numbers are as good as they are.  We had seven new cases one day during the week.  On average, there are approximately 17 new cases a day, which is less than one case per county.  We are still allowing only 200 people attend an outdoor event.  The flexibility required was there previously and should still be there.  We should consider opening up these events to more than 200 people.  I will not put a figure on it as there are people who are better capable and more qualified than me regarding public health who should be able to put a figure on it.  We need to move to a better place than we currently are.  The figure of 200 is an error and we need to get back to some degree of normality.</p></speech>

There was a lot of talk towards the end of the previous Government about the massive number of 600 people who wanted to return to the Defence Forces.  We now find that of the 600, 400 were deemed ineligible and, to date, only 11 have been called.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Those 11 have not responded as of yesterday, as far as I am aware, as to whether they will take up the call.  Let us be honest about it, the call was never about Covid-19.  It was about trying to fill a gap due to the failure of retention policies.  I know the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is in place and has taken a hands-on approach.  I sincerely hope we will see a turnaround in the fortunes of the Defence Forces, given that we now know that two further ships - that is half of the entire naval fleet - will be tied up by the end of this year.  They will not be able to patrol the seas, protect Ireland from people smuggling and drug running or protect the fisheries they are charged with responsibilities for.  It is interesting to note that abatement was waived for people returning to the HSE but not for members of the Defence Forces, which means the whole thing was a scam in the first place.  It was really a retention crisis they were trying to fix.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will do a much better job.</p><p>I would like to place on record my appreciation and, I am sure, this House's appreciation for the many hundreds of veterans around the country who have given up their time and personal resources to deliver meals on wheels and various other things to the public.  They are under the radar and they are not high-profile people.  I think this House, this Government and this country owes them a great debt of thanks.</p><p>I second Senator McDowell's amendment to the Order of Business and I will make one point on legislation.  The running of legislation through the House with all Stages in one day or in one sitting is fundamentally wrong and debases this House.  I know the Leader is under pressure to get urgent legislation through but I sincerely hope this practice stops as soon as we return in the autumn.</p></speech>

We cannot acknowledge it enough.  It is inherent in all of our DNA.  We are a very giving people.  Irish communities and societies are a great example of what we can do when we work together.</p> <p>I will briefly go through some of the things that have been asked of me.  The first thing is to say I gladly accept Senator McDowell's amendment.  That is no problem at all.</p> <p>On Senator Paddy Burke's point, I will be in contact with Terry Brennan's family.  We would rather do it in a way that not just dignifies our respect to our loved colleague but also allows his family to participate in our expressions of love and appreciation for Terry.  I will contact the family and do it at some stage later in the year when it is more appropriate for us to welcome them.</p> <p>Various colleagues have brought up the fact that we have in the last number of weeks and will continue next week to debate Bills at all Stages.  I would like to apologise but it is not being done in any sense to annoy, to detract from crucial analysis of legislation or to detract from the valued input from all Members of this House to Government legislation.  It is being done because most of the legislation we are passing at the moment is required by citizens, either to fix something that is wrong or is going to run out, as in the case of the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020, or to provide other supports that are needed by Irish people as a result of the financial strains arising from Covid.  I do not intend for us to conduct our business in that way when we come back in September unless there is a need for something to be turned around very quickly.  I will communicate with all leaders and Whips on a weekly basis to make sure we are all happy.  I have no intention of continuing to do business as we have done it over the last couple of weeks.  I appreciate Senators' support in allowing us to pass a sizeable amount of legislation in the last two weeks and in the next two.</p> <p>For Members' knowledge, in case they do not already know, there will be three debates in the House next week.  One will be with the Minister for Education and Skills and I am sure it will centre around the reopening of our schools.  I believe we will get notification of the protocols for the reopening of schools, both primary and secondary, on Monday.  The Minister will be with us on Tuesday.  As a parent of four children in education, it is vital.  This is not just because they need to get back into learning mode which has been unusual, to say the least, in the last couple of months, but also because their mental health and well-being is crucial to engaging with their peers and teachers, and I do not mean over Zoom calls or on iPads.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is not to discount the enormous effort that has been put in on behalf of our teachers in the past couple of months, which we appreciate.</p><p>We will have the Minister with responsibility for tourism in the House and I acknowledge everybody's promotion of their own county this morning.  In my own county, the Boyne Valley is an enormously popular place and I encourage anyone who is looking at coming to Meath to certainly do so.  It is important for us all to recognise that we need to give each other in different counties a dig out.  People are welcome to counties Roscommon, Galway or Kerry.  We have a beautiful island.  I am assured we are getting beautiful weather from next week so we should encourage each other to go to every county.  The suggestion made by Senator McCallion is very important.  We should market our country on an all-island basis.  The Minister will be here next Tuesday and Senators should put their suggestions to her.  </p><p>We will have a July stimulus package debate next Thursday because all the financial provisions that underpin the package announced yesterday have to be passed by both Houses next week.</p><p>Some of the routine issues that have been badly affected do not get the exposure they deserve.  I am particularly concerned about domestic violence, which has really been brought to everybody's attention in the past couple of months.  When we see the increase in cases of domestic violence that have been reported not only to the wonderful organisations that support our women and men who are sufferers but also to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is an issue that needs and deserves more highlighting than it has ever got.  I do not say this disrespectfully, but it is something that falls to the women of this House and the Lower House in the main but I genuinely ask our male colleagues here to start speaking about it more than they have in the past because it is an issue that affects every family in this country in some way, shape or form.  We should talk about it a lot more.</p><p>I welcome the meeting that will talk place with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform next week for our CE supervisors.  As some Senators will be aware, I have enormous respect for the work and the individuals and would love to see a resolution, which was not possible in the previous two D&aacute;ileanna, take place in this D&aacute;il.  I am appreciative of the Minister for meeting them next week.  Hearing them is important but especially so is acting and finding a solution, which exists, and I hope it gets over the line next week.</p><p>I do not believe gender rights require more review.  I say this as the person who had the privilege of being fed the results of the previous review that was done.  As far as I am aware, the legislation is practically drafted to enable us in this House and the D&aacute;il to give the right to 16 and 17-year-olds, with the consent of both of their parents, to change their gender through documentation in this country if they want.  That debate should be had and I will contact the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy O'Gorman, to see where we are, particularly in respect of the new review suggested in the programme for Government because I do not think there is any need to have a new review.  We have done the work and the work that needs to be done now is to publish and to pass the legislation.  </p><p>The single largest investment in the history of the State was announced by the Government yesterday not in the businesses of Ireland but in the people of Ireland.  The money that will be  given to businesses to support wages will support families up and down this country who otherwise may not have a job because the companies would not be able to financially support those people for the next weeks, months and perhaps longer.  I refer to the extensions of the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment for those who are unfortunately out of work temporarily at the moment, all the financial measures that will be put in place for the retraining, reskilling and re-employing of all those people in different and new industries, all the waivers in respect of costs for those businesses and everything else that was announced yesterday.  Some Members commented that it is not perfect but the last thing it is, and I say this with respect, is miserly.</p></speech>

There is an important role for Opposition to point out the flaws, but it would be lovely if just for once, in a sign of solidarity, the Opposition recognised that the State in all of its forms has an obligation to support every citizen in this country and yesterday's significant announcement was an important second step in that role.  We had the first step in March and April, we had the second step yesterday and, hopefully, we will have the final steps before we get back to the new normal in the budget in October.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A simple acknowledgent of the single largest investment ever in Irish people, which was announced yesterday, would go a long way if we are to continue with the mantra that we are all in this together.</p></speech>

It was produced by a local company in Westmeath, Mergon, if anyone wants to acquire one.  I will just plug that company.</p> <p>I am pleased to be in the Seanad as Minister of State with responsibility for trade promotion, digital and company regulation and to have the opportunity to present the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 for the consideration of the House.  The Bill will provide for the first phase of measures intended to mitigate the impact that Covid-19 has had on the normal operation of business in Ireland.  Before proceeding with a summary of the detailed provisions, I will first offer some background and context to the Bill.  </p> <p>As Senators may be aware, there are a number of issues in the area of company law that have come to the fore in light of the pandemic.  From the onset of the Covid-19 business closures, my Department received a significant number of representations, including representations regarding proposed amendments to the Companies Act intended to support companies as they respond to both the operational and economic challenges of the crisis.  Similar issues have arisen in relation to industrial and provident societies, which are mostly co-operatives.  </p> <p>Real practical issues were raised in respect of the ability to hold annual general meetings, AGMs, given the public health guidelines on social distancing.  AGMs are an important forum for members to approve the accounts, appoint auditors and hold the directors accountable for the affairs of the companies and co-operatives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> In addition, general meetings need to be held if a company or co-operative is commencing any of a range of activities, for example, a merger or members' voluntary winding-up.  Indeed, the issue of AGMs has already been subject to litigation.  A company recently found itself before the court where a shareholder brought proceedings to challenge the intention to hold an AGM with restricted attendance.  </p><p>Concerns were also raised with regard to business solvency.  In terms of these concerns, Senators will be all too aware of businesses in their own localities, including hairdressers, caf&eacute;s and so on, which were thriving only a few short months ago but which now find themselves struggling to balance the books and being in fear of closure.  Given that there are approximately 240,000 companies and 950 industrial and provident societies registered in Ireland, even if only a fraction encounter such difficulties, it provides clear evidence that a change is warranted to ensure they can continue to comply with their obligations under the legislation and that measures to alleviate the strain on their finances are required.  </p><p>My Department, in conjunction with the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, a statutory advisory body charged with advising the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on company law, has worked to find practical solutions to these issues as a matter of urgency.  Efforts were focused on matters which could be concluded within a short timeframe and, as such, this Bill deals only with those items which are required immediately and which are capable of being progressed quickly.  </p><p>Extensive consultation took place with the CLRG, membership of which is broad and represents key stakeholders in this area such as the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Revenue Commissioners, insolvency practitioners, legal practitioners, academics and my own Department.  The group is uniquely well positioned to give a balanced view on the need for this legislation.  My Department has also consulted with the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, which is one of the co-operative umbrella organisations.  </p><p>I will now turn to the main provisions of the Bill, which can be broadly summarised as follows.  The Bill provides that the measures will be operative for an interim period up until 31 December 2020, with potential for extension, and provides for a regulation-making power in respect of extending the interim period and amending the operational detail of virtual meetings.  The Bill also provides that general meetings for companies and for industrial and provident societies, which are mainly co-operatives, may be held virtually, as may creditors' meetings.  Documents which are required to be executed under seal may now be executed in counterpart.  The Bill will increase the amount at which a statutory demand can be issued from &euro;10,000 singularly or &euro;20,000 aggregate to &euro;50,000.  It will extend the examinership process to a total of 150 days, in exceptional circumstances and subject to court approval. </p><p>Part 1 of the Bill deals with preliminary and general provisions.  It provides for standard provisions such as the Short Title and commencement.  Sections 3 and 4 deal with the interim period.  The interim period refers to the limited period of time for which the provisions of the Bill will be operational.  This timeframe can be extended by Government order and different provisions may be extended by different times.  This is an important point as it gives us the flexibility to respond to the changing nature of the crisis and its effects on companies.  </p><p>Section 5 of the Bill makes a small but practical amendment to the Companies Act with regard to the sealing of documents.  Under the Companies Act, there are a number of documents which must be executed under seal.  This means they must have the company's official seal affixed to the document and the document must be signed by the company director and secretary.  As more and more people are working from home, this has created situations where the signatories and seal are in separate locations.  Now, documents may be signed and sealed on separate pages, which will be counted as one single document for the purpose of the Act.  This will reduce the administrative burden on companies.</p><p>Sections 6 to 11 make provision for general meetings, including AGMs, to be held wholly by electronic means during the interim period.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Such meetings may now be held by electronic means using online platforms such as Zoom or Webex or allowing people to dial in.  Companies must guarantee the security of the platform used for the meeting, as far as is reasonably possible.</p><p>Provision is made for the details which must be included in the notice of a general meeting held by electronic means.  Such notice must include details of how an attendee can access the platform used for the meeting as well as any measures put in place by the company for security purposes.  For example, some companies may provide attendees with a personal identification number which they must enter to access the meeting.</p><p>Further consequential amendments are made to the Companies Act to ensure those who participate in electronic meetings will be counted as part of the quorum.  Companies will be afforded flexibility to reschedule meetings should this be deemed necessary by the directors in order to comply with public health advice from the Government.  There may be smaller companies that can hold a physical meeting and comply with social distancing guidelines.  This provision is designed with them in mind should they schedule such a meeting and, subsequently, further restrictions are announced.</p><p>New provision is made for the withdrawal or amendment of dividend resolutions.  Where a company has previously proposed to pay a dividend to shareholders but the impact of Covid-19 on the company's finances makes this untenable, directors may withdraw or amend the dividend resolution.  This will ensure that directors are empowered to make decisions for the long-term financial stability of the company.</p><p>Finally, provision is also made for annual general meetings to be deferred until 31 December 2020.  This is in line with measures taken at EU level as per Article 2 of the Council Regulation 2020/699 on temporary measures concerning the general meetings of European companies (SE) and of European cooperative societies (SCE) adopted on 25 May 2020.</p><p>Sections 12 and 13 amend sections 520 and 534 of the Companies Act and provide for an increase of 50 days to examinership, bringing the total period to 150 days.  This is an important amendment intended to give companies additional breathing space to restructure, trade through the crisis and preserve employment.</p><p>Section 15 amends section 570 of the Companies Act which sets out the circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts.  Normally a company is deemed unable to pay its debts when it has failed to pay debts of &euro;10,000 in respect of a single creditor, or &euro;20,000 in the aggregate, within 21 days of a statutory demand being delivered.  It is at this point the company may be wound up by the court.  Section 15 increases the threshold at which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts to &euro;50,000 for one or more creditors.  This amendment is intended to prevent companies which were previously viable from being wound up for relatively low levels of debt.</p><p>Sections 15 to 24 deal with creditors' meetings under the Companies Act.  Parts 9, 10 and 11 of the Act provide for several circumstances in which these meetings must occur.  For example, examiners and liquidators are required to call meetings of creditors at various stages in the respective processes.  This Bill will allow such meetings to take place by electronic means for the duration of the interim period in line with that which is provided for general meetings.  There are a number of consequential amendments made to sections which specifically reference creditors' meetings to include a reference to creditors' meetings held by electronic communications.</p><p>Section 25 makes an amendment to section 1103 of the Companies Act, which provides for additional notice provisions required for general meetings of publicly traded companies.  It includes additional information which must be provided should that meeting be held by electronic communications such as access details for the electronic platform.</p><p>Section 26 makes a minor amendment to section 1106 of the Companies Act with the substitution of the words "provide for" for "guarantee" at subsection 4(a)(i).</p><p>Part 3 of the Act, which consists of three sections, deals with temporary amendments to the industrial and provident societies, the majority of which are co-operatives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The provisions applying to companies were followed closely and adapted where necessary to reflect the unique requirements of industrial and provident societies, mostly co-operatives.</p><p>Section 27 provides that the measures will be operative for an interim period, up until 31 December 2020, with potential for extension by Government order.  Section 28 makes provision in respect of general meetings.  This section is aligned with section 6 of the Bill in relation to general meetings of companies.  It provides that a general meeting, including an AGM, may be held in more than one physical location, by electronic means, or as a hybrid meeting, where some members attend physically, and others join electronically, for the duration of the interim period.  Members attending by electronic means will be counted as part of the quorum.</p><p>Industrial and provident societies may also defer an annual general meeting until 31 December 2020.  Industrial and provident societies will be afforded the flexibility to postpone, relocate and change the means of holding general meetings without the need to have a formal technical meeting to adjourn to another date.</p><p>The notice of the general meeting that includes participation by electronic communications specifies at a minimum the electronic platform and details for access to it; the time and manner by which a member must confirm his or her intention to attend the meeting; any requirements and restrictions put in place by the society to identify the members; the procedure for communicating questions and comments and the procedure for voting on resolutions.  The Minister will have the power to make further provision, if necessary, for the convening and conduct of general meetings held by electronic communications.</p><p>Section 29 inserts additional definitions into the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893 to include a definition of "Covid-19" and the "interim period".  As a result of previous amendments to the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts in 1978 and 2014, the company law proposals on examinership and creditors meetings, will automatically apply to co-operatives.</p><p>I look forward to an informed, positive and constructive debate on the Bill in this House.  The Bill is important legislation for any companies and co-operatives that might be struggling financially and unable to comply with their administrative obligations under the current legislation.  It is an important first phase of work in this area and I am happy to commend it to the House.</p></speech>

It has been a busy period for him and that will continue to be the case.  He indicated that these are short-term measures to give reassurance and support to businesses.  That is exactly what is provided for in the Bill, namely, certain supports and reassurance so that they can survive in the short term.  The Bill sets out how company meetings and meetings of industrial and provident societies can be held in the interim period from the commencement of the Bill until 31 December this year.  Companies will be enabled to convene and hold general meetings, AGMs and EGMs by virtual means such as Zoom and Webex.</p> <p>The Bill also deals with other issues.  Workers will not have to get High Court approval for enforcing employment rights complaints.  There is also an extension of the time period for the presentation of reports by an examiner to the High Court.  In addition, there is an increase in the amount of debt a company can have before a statutory demand can be issued to have it wound up.  Once enacted, these proposals will provide reassurance to companies when organising their AGMs and they will be given extra time to hold such meetings.  That is important.</p> <p>It comes on the back of the short-term measures that were announced yesterday.  It is important to recognise the role the Minister of State and his Department have played in recent weeks in terms of the July stimulus package that was announced yesterday.  It is important to welcome it because many of the measures that are being introduced are along the same lines as the Bill, which is a technical one concerning short-term measures.  The measures announced yesterday are also intended to support businesses.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That support comprises four things: backing Ireland's businesses with 0% interest rates for first-year SME loans; the restart grant expansion; the waiver of commercial rates; and the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, which we were discussing yesterday and which will be hugely vital for businesses.  It will also help people, especially young people, to get back to work.  There will be an expansion in training, skills development and work placement schemes.  We will be building confidence, investing &euro;500 million in local communities, and preparing Ireland for an economy for the future.  This stimulus package may be a short-term one but it will be followed by a national economic plan as part of the budget.  That is a long-term view.  Much of the criticism of yesterday's stimulus package was about it being a short-term measure but it is the second phase of three.  It is important to welcome it, and the amount of work put into the package by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is welcome.  Businesses to which I have been speaking in Tipperary and Clonmel say they need clarity and Bills like this one are bringing that clarity.  Yesterday's announcement is hugely welcome.  I wish the Minister of State well and my party and I will be supporting this Bill. </p></speech>

I will speak to Part 3 of the Bill, which the Minister of State covered very well.  Many co-operative societies have contacted me in the last few weeks with concerns about how they are going to manage their day-to-day affairs and their AGMs.  The clarification on such matters in Part 3 is very important because many agricultural societies, specifically co-operatives, have hundreds if not thousands of members.  This Bill brings clarity on how they can formulate an AGM.  That is a very important point in my part of the world, as Carbery, Dairygold and Kerry are all part of this co-operative society in many ways.  We now have clarity on how they can do their business from now until the end of the year.  There was some worry in the agricultural sphere about how we could have checks and balances in our co-operative societies if we did not have AGMs, which are so important for the day-to-day running of the societies.  Part 3 of the Bill, which the Minister of State explained in detail, is very important and it is what we need in order to go forward in these unfortunate times.  This is probably going to be a template for the future, not only for the end of this year but for a considerable period of time.  It is welcome that this Bill can be amended by ministerial order, because if we need to push this into next year or the year after, we must have that kind of legislation in place.  We are living in new and unusual times, to say the least.</p> <p>The real challenges going forward will be how people can interact with these new forums.  Broadband is going to be a massive issue.  The communication network in some parts of rural Ireland is not currently capable of hosting all these Zoom meetings, so that will be another challenge.  It is very good to have the legislation but we need the technology to tie in to it as well.  Those are the challenges we need to work on in the next few months.  The clarification offered by the Minister of State in Part 3 of this Bill has in many ways sorted out many of the fears the agricultural co-operative societies had about how they could run their businesses for the next six or eight months. </p></speech>

I sincerely congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, on his appointment.  It is well deserved, given his impact on politics throughout his political life, and he is well capable and able.  I wish him the best.  I also thank him for his detailed overview of this welcome legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ollie Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is an onus on all Senators and the entire Government to assist SMEs and companies as we try to recover from this Covid-19 pandemic.  Companies have had to adapt and are finding new methods of responding to challenges.  There has been a huge increase in people working from home, and while that is welcome and is required in the short term until we get back to full working order, it has its challenges.  Increasing the ease with which companies can fulfil their compliance requirements is vital.  Flexibility will be provided to companies in a number of ways and it is important that they still meet the compliance standards.  Working from home is causing difficulties with documents which have been executed under seal and which had to be signed by company directors and company secretaries.  This legislation addresses that difficulty on an interim basis and also allows the company seal and necessary signatures to be on separate documents, which will then be counted as a single document for the purpose of the Companies Act for the duration of the interim period.</p><p>Companies are finding current debt challenging and the increase in the threshold from &euro;10,000 for an individual debt and &euro;20,000 for aggregate debts up to &euro;50,000 is welcome, as companies should not be worried about being compulsorily wound up for relatively small sums.  The extension in the examinership period from 100 days to 150 days is also welcome.  That will help companies and provide greater flexibility for examiners and companies to negotiate with stakeholders and possible investors to put together workable rescue solutions.  The Minister of State outlined the additional time provided for companies to hold AGMs and the Bill clearly empowers them to hold such meetings by electronic means, as was noted by other Members.  That provides clarity for companies.</p><p>I welcome the July stimulus package and the extension of the wage subsidy scheme for all SMEs and business owners, which is paramount because it brings certainty to businesses.  The increase in the restart grant from &euro;10,000 to &euro;25,000 is welcome and the improvement of grants for SMEs is vital, as the Minister of State is well aware.  Having spoken to people throughout Galway city and county in the last 24 hours, I know the 100% commercial rates waiver until the end of September is very welcome as well. </p></speech>

I have known him for a long time and I am quite certain that he will bring the same dynamism and curious mind to his new role as he brings to politics.</p> <p>This is welcome legislation but in many ways it is just catching up with the reality of how businesses had to respond to the Covid-19 crisis.  As his role involves trade promotion, digital matters and company regulation, I would like the Minister of State and his Department to start preparing for the changes that will happen in the business world.  In many ways, this crisis has brought forward the use of new technologies within a very short period.  Companies are holding Zoom meetings and are interacting electronically to a far greater extent, and we have to ensure that we are prepared for that.  In that context, the Department will have to look at a number of issues. For example, virtual and augmented reality will have to be examined as businesses start using them for meeting purposes.  We also need to have a debate around data security.  I am conscious that there has been discussion in this Chamber about having a debate on our relationship with China, which is related to this, but we also need to have a debate on data ownership and data regulation.  The Minister of State mentioned the position in respect of seals.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to look at blockchain platforms and how they might provide us with certainty.  I ask that the Minister of State champion new technology because otherwise in the future companies and everybody else will be going on far ahead and we will be trying to catch up with legislation.  As such it is important that we are prepared for this.</p><p>It is interesting that over the last period we have seen grannies and granddads using Zoom to talk to their grandchildren.  We have been holding parliamentary party meetings by electronic means and businesses are moving their AGMs online.  Even the courts have moved toward a situation where there are online sittings.  In our national Parliament, we do not seem to be able to move to a situation where we can use new technology to hold business.  I was fascinated watching other parliaments.  In the Scottish Parliament, ministers answer questions online.  It is similar in the House of Commons and in the European Parliament.  I believe the constitutional interpretation that the legal advisors to these Houses have made about what constitutes "a place" is very conservative.  We need to look at it.  There can be more innovative ways of using technology to hold Ministers to account by making greater use of this, our national place of parliament, rather than having to zip back and forth across the Liffey.  Part of our role has to be about appreciating the convergence of the technological change going on around us and part of the Minister of State's role, including as part of this legislation, is to ensure citizens and businesses are ahead of the curve.  It should not simply be a case of the Department trying to catch up after the horse has bolted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-24a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072400002#CC00200"><p>I echo the sentiments of welcome and congratulation to the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and the good wishes that have been expressed for the carrying-out of his ministerial functions.</p> <p>I welcome this legislation.  It is very important that the system of company law and indeed co-operative societies should function properly during this period.  Any relaxation of relevant rules or procedures required to make companies function and save them from being stapled to the ground by an overly rigid adherence to what I shall call normal time or peacetime requirements is welcome.</p> <p>I have a single point to make about the way in which the Bill is constructed.  Believe it or not, the CLRG was established on foot of a report prepared by me, and a group I chaired, as far back as 1999.  It was intended to bring about a situation whereby the Companies Act 2014, which would eventually be enacted on foot of the CLRG's work, would be a single document in which one could see all of the law in one place in a convenient format.  It strikes me that these temporary provisions could have been treated slightly differently by the draftspeople.  It could have been phrased such that the temporary provisions we are dealing with here would be stated to have effect during the interim period and would disappear as a matter of law once the interim period comes to an end.  It is slightly unfortunate that the text will make permanent changes to the text of the Act even though most of it will be redundant after the interim period expires, even if it is extended for some time.  I suggest that between now and when this is brought to the D&aacute;il, something along the lines of the amendment I have suggested should be considered so that permanent changes are not made to the Companies Act 2014.  The substance of what the Government is suggesting as temporary provisions should just be stated to have effect during the interim period and thereafter not have to be included in any text whatsoever of the 2014 Act.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I have been looking at precedents in English legislative drafting books over the last 48 hours.  I am reasonably satisfied that it is possible to put in place a provision which says that an Act shall, during a period of time, have effect as though it were amended in this way and not have to make a permanent change to the text itself.  This is just for tidiness, because in reality these amendments will form part of the Companies Act permanently and another Act would have to be passed to take them out of it at some point in the future.  I am trying to be totally constructive.  Could the Government not, between now and when this Bill is brought to the D&aacute;il, adopt some language in Part 1 of the Bill making it clear that these provisions evaporate completely at the end of the interim period and do not have to be taken out by subsequent legislation?  I was assuming that section 26 was a temporary provision and it is not, it is a permanent one.  It was an error on my part.  My amendments, which I will not be pushing on that account, would actually have knocked section 26 on the head as well.  As such, I appreciate that there is a little flaw in what I was proposing but the intention was to keep the Companies Act 2014 and its text easily legible.  The Government could produce a statutory consolidation at the end of it all, in order to not have brackets and references to repealed, ineffective or lapsed provisions littered across the Act.  I very sincerely urge the Minister of State to consider having some provision in the Act which would have the effect that all of those provisions never had to appear again in print after the interim period has expired.  Otherwise it just makes life very complicated for lawyers as they look at sections to discern whether something is still in effect or not.  The same goes for accountants.</p><p>Having made that point, some of the other points which are temporary should be considered for permanent enactment at some later stage.  There is an urgency that makes it difficult to deal with now.  There is however a lot to be said for keeping our company law usable and connected with international practice by allowing people to participate in company general meetings on a distanced basis and to provide properly for what is or is not required in those circumstances.</p><p>I hope I am being constructive.  I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment.  I wish this legislation well but ask the Minister of State to ensure if he can that the 2014 Act remains as legible and as coherent as possible after the interim period is over.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-24a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072400002#DD00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment.  I have gotten to know him reasonably well through the Council of Europe and have no doubt he will be a dedicated Minister of State.  I wish him well before I disagree with many aspects of Government policy.</p> <p>The Bill is broadly to be welcomed.  It is indicative of the extraordinary times we live in.  The purpose of the Bill is to address operational issues in respect of compliance arising under the Companies Act 2014 and the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893 to 2018 as a result of Covid-19.  These changes include the ability to hold meetings, such as general meetings, through video technology, for the use of electronic communication in general during the interim period, increasing the debt threshold at which a company can be wound up and increasing the examinership period.  The elements of the Bill which deal with instances in which companies and small businesses struggle with debt are extremely welcome.  Perhaps the Minister will commit to a report into that &euro;10,000 level of debt figure for a company being wound up and liaising with stakeholders into the future.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The severe pressures on the cashflow and threshold at which businesses are deemed unable to pay their debts for the purposes of being wound up by the court are extremely low in normal times and that is why it is imperative that they are increased during these extraordinary times.  We welcome that measure.</p><p>In that regard, the Bill seeks to support as many businesses as possible to trade through the crisis, thus supporting economic recovery and preserving employment.  Increasing the period of examinership by 50 days provides similar support and will allow businesses additional breathing space within which to formulate a restructuring plan.  Much more needs to be done for businesses, however.  Businesses were waiting weeks for the Government's July stimulus package, but now that it has been announced many are describing it as deeply disappointing.  </p><p>Businesses are struggling to get back up and running and have been calling for liquidity injections through grants.  Instead of a comprehensive and funded grant scheme, however, they are being asked to take on more debt through loans and that is something many simply cannot do.  This July stimulus package has a 4:1 debt-to-grant ratio.  This flies in the face of what the Government has been advocating in Europe.  The Taoiseach spent last weekend preaching about the need for grants in Brussels, but his Government has pushed debt through loans for SMEs at home.  Businesses were calling out an economic lifebuoy and the Government has thrown them an anchor.</p><p>The changes in the Bill regarding the ability to hold remote meetings, such as general meetings, through video technology and the use of electronic communications in general during the interim period will help to streamline proceedings for businesses.  They are also necessary from a health and safety perspective.  The speed at which legislation is rushed through to protect the health and safety of company directors and board members is in stark contrast to the failure of the State to legislate to protect ordinary workers on the shop floor, on the hospital ward or in the meat factory.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has been to the fore in campaigning for a simple change by way of regulation, not even legislation, to make workplace outbreaks of Covid-19 notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  At the stroke of a pen in an office in Government Buildings, workers could have had additional protections for their health and safety.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, refused to do this, however, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Varadkar, is also refusing to make this change.</p><p>Incidents of Covid-19 in workplaces such as meat plants, including in the Minister of State's constituency, were rife during the lockdown and many workers were put in danger because of the rapid development of clusters.  Was emergency legislation rushed through to protect those workers?  No, not a single thing was done for them.  When we hear the phrase, "we are all in it together", perhaps we should ask those meat factory workers about it.  Instead of pulling on their protective safety gear, perhaps they should have gone into work wearing a suit and tie and with a briefcase.  Perhaps then Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il would have thought them worthy of protection.  </p><p>One of the reasons for this situation is that an outbreak of Covid-19 is not a occupational illness notifiable to the HSA owing to a lacuna in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  Sinn F&eacute;in has published legislation to address this issue.  It aims to protect workers in all workplaces, whether in meat plants, in care homes, on building sites or in office blocks in the IFSC.  It is our hope that the Minister will amend the relevant regulations and that this legislation will not be needed.  However, if he does not take the necessary steps to protect workers, Sinn F&eacute;in will move the Bill.</p><p>The failure to properly staff the HSA also exposes the hypocrisy of this Government when it comes to how certain workers are treated differently.  Only 67 HSA inspectors are available to carry out protocol-related inspections.  The Return to Work Safely Protocol was designed to support employers and protect workers as they returned to work and as we moved through the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.  The protocol was developed following high-level dialogue between the Government, trade unions and employer representatives on the best way to ensure the spread of Covid-19 was prevented and workers were kept safe as the economy opens.  The protocol has excellent information and safety recommendations and the HSA was tasked with carrying out Return to Work Safely Protocol inspections.  The role of the HSA, the body responsible for enforcing health and safety law, promoting accident prevention and providing information and advice, is essential in ensuring that workers are kept safe and the protocol is adhered to.  Frustratingly, however, the HSA has not been given sufficient resources to increase the number of dedicated inspectors it has to carry out protocol-related inspections.  Data provided in a reply to a parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, has revealed that the HSA has only 67 inspectors to cover 271,000 businesses in the State.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The situation is a farce and makes a mockery of the protocol by putting workers and public health at risk.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people responded to the Be On Call for Ireland campaign, but only a handful were given jobs.  I am sure that within those thousands of applications there are several people with health and safety qualifications who could be employed to carry out inspections.  We need to get real about workers' rights in the Covid-19 environment and we need to protect workers in the supermarket or meat factory just as much as company directors down in the IFSC.</p><p>I will make one more general point which I will deal with further in my amendments.  This Bill is a missed opportunity.  We could make one more simple change regarding co-operatives to make it much easier to set them up by reducing the number of people required to do so from seven to three.  We know many businesses may not make it back after this crisis, but if we had an option to give workers the opportunity to turn those businesses into workers' co-operatives, we could save jobs and build community wealth.  This issue has come up several times and I have liaised with many people across the co-operative movements regarding it.  Their number one request is to reduce the number of members required to form a co-operative from seven to three.  We could do that very simply now.  </p><p>As the Minister of State will have seen in my amendments, we could also implement the proposals in the Duffy Cahill report and provide in the legislation protection to ensure there is no repeat of what happened to the Debenhams workers.  Given the decision to rush through this emergency legislation, why are the Debenhams workers not being protected in the same way?  Why have we not taken the time today to ensure those workers in Cork, Limerick, Dublin, Waterford and Galway are given the same protections?  We could do this today through my amendments.  This Bill shows a lack of ambition.  If we are in an emergency, let us be real about all of us being in this together by ensuring that workers are protected as well.  It can be done today with the support of the Minister of State.</p></speech>

Like others, we are supportive of the Bill and we accept the need for urgency.  As the Minister of State has pointed out, there is urgency regarding the difficulties being faced by SMEs.  Many companies and co-operatives are considering delaying annual general meetings, AGMs, because of concerns about potential technical breaches of the companies legislation arising from the Covid-19 crisis.  We accept that.</p> <p>We also note that the Bill is largely technical and makes operational changes to the companies legislation to allow for regulatory compliance during what is referred to in the Bill as the "interim period".  That is something of a euphemism and it sounds a little like "The Emergency" because such serious challenges, threats and dangers are being faced by all of us in society.  We accept that and we welcome the provisions regarding, for example, the enabling of general meetings to be held electronically, the extension of examinerships and the increase in the amount a company can owe a creditor before an action to wind up can be taken.</p> <p>I note Senator McDowell's comments on his amendments.  I support the spirit of those amendments, although I know he is not going to press them.  There is an important point, however, in the amendments, in keeping with the spirit of the legislation, regarding this Bill being about reducing administrative burdens on companies at a particularly challenging and difficult time.  As Senator Gavan said, we know there are immense existential threats to the existence of some companies.  We are, therefore, seeking to reduce the administrative burden on companies, yet in this Bill we are putting new provisions into what is already cumbersome and complex companies legislation.  There have been some welcome attempts to codify the legislation and I have spoken on those previously.  I used to teach company law many years ago, so I know how difficult it is, particularly for small companies, to navigate this complex legislation.  </p> <p>From a drafting point of view and from the perspective of those seeking to implement the legislation, it would have been preferable to have included an automatic lapse provision in the Bill.  I say that because from my reading of the Bill, all but two of its 29 sections refer to the "interim period".  I read sections 17 and 26 as both having permanent amending effect, albeit of a technical nature, to the companies code.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There might have been a preferable way of drafting it.  I very much welcome that the Bill is being introduced in the Seanad because it gives time for the Minister of State and his officials to look at whether that would have been possible.  It may be too late to do it.  I accept the huge time constraints under which officials are working to draft all this legislation in such a short timeframe but it might be possible to examine, even in the context of other legislation, whether there are better and less cumbersome ways of providing for measures in this interim period.</p><p>Looking at some of the briefings on the Bill, there was an indication that there would be another permanent provision included, which I do not see in it, which would have codified the directors' duty to creditors as a company approaches insolvency.  This is a duty already existing at common law and its placement on a statutory footing was recommended by the Company Law Review Group in its report on the protection of employees and unsecured creditors.  Can the Minister of State say whether that provision is to be placed in some other legislation or whether I have simply missed its inclusion in this Bill?</p><p>As the Minister of State said, there has been input into the Bill from stakeholders, including the Company Law Review Group, which I welcome.  It is very helpful and important for us to know there has been that level of input, even in such a rushed timeframe.  I see from briefings we have received that the Bill has been welcomed by stakeholders, solicitors' firms and so on.  We are all cognisant that most of the measures in it are temporary, but there is an indication, certainly in some of the commentaries on the Bill, that there might be potential to place some of these measures on a more permanent footing.  As we are all looking at ways in which working from home, for example, can be continued on where it benefits employees, some of the provisions around the holding of electronic meetings, similarly, could well be made more permanent to facilitate the smooth running of small businesses in particular and reduce the administrative burden.</p><p>While I agree with Senator McDowell that an automatic lapse provision would be useful, I can see there could be potential for extending some of these provisions into the future well beyond any interim period in order to facilitate small companies in complying with regulatory requirements through electronic means.  The holding of physical AGMs, for instance, can be very cumbersome for small business.  I was on the justice committee some years ago when it heard representations from the Law Society and others concerning a move to electronic means for conveyancing.  That process had been hugely cumbersome and difficult because it was all paper-based.  When we are seeing moves throughout the legal and political system to a less paper-based model, we should also be looking at moving to that sort of model within the company regulatory network.</p><p>Finally, I want to address some of Senator Gavan's comments and to support him wholeheartedly in what he said about facilitating the creation of co-operatives.  That is an eminently sensible suggestion and we could work on a cross-party basis to produce legislation to address it.  I accept that this is not the Bill in which to do it.  It is much a bigger issue and it certainly should be addressed.  Senator Gavan also referred rightly to real concerns around worker protection and the health and safety of workers in particular sectors.  I support his comments on this point, particularly in regard to the situation at Debenhams.  Like many colleagues in this House, I met and spoke to some of the Debenhams workers when they were outside Leinster House.  They told us that they are, in effect, facing into a Clerys mark 2 situation unless they get a decent redundancy deal.  They have been campaigning for that but, as we have heard, there is no legislation coming before the House in this urgent period to address their predicament.  We are very cognisant of that and I appeal to the Minister of State to look at ways in which we can avoid Clerys mark 3 and mark 4 situations.  Senator Gavan has put in amendments on this issue but I accept that the Bill is not directly relevant to it.  However, it is a really pressing issue for the many individuals who are facing redundancy and job losses.  The difficulty with some of the amendments proposed by Senator Gavan, it seems to me, may be that there is a requirement in them that workers would have to prove fraud before they can get a remedy.  That may be setting the bar too high and there may be other ways of dealing with it.  It is an urgent matter for many people and we should be addressing it.</p><p>I reiterate our support for the Bill and the easing of the regulatory burden that it represents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-24a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1674" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072400002#HH00100"><p>I begin by expressing my sincere good wishes to the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, who has been a good friend in politics for many years and lives not far from me in the Longford-Westmeath constituency.  He has always been a very good worker in the constituency and he did some tremendous work on the Front Bench for Fianna F&aacute;il in recent times.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Bacik and others that this is, in effect, a technical Bill.  We have to remember that we are dealing with the extraordinary situation of a pandemic and, quite rightly in situations like this, we need to get the legislation through.  Earlier this morning, very genuine concerns were expressed in the Chamber about rushing legislation through.  Doing so is not something that I or my colleagues on this side of the House would be happy with at all.  However, there are circumstances we have to deal with in this moment.  The reason this legislation is being dealt with very speedily is the number of people who are unemployed and the threats that remain in terms of getting people back to work.  While Senator Gavan made a very eloquent speech and I agree with him in regard to the Debenhams workers and other points he made, I genuinely do not think this is about company directors.  The Government is worried about people not getting back to work.  If that is going to be frustrated because AGMs cannot be held or things have changed in terms of how companies do their business, then the reality is that if there is no company, there is no work.  No work means that the economy will slide further into recession.</p> <p>As I said, I acknowledge some of the points Senator Gavan made.  I absolutely agree with him in regard to what happened in the meat factories.  There is no doubt that the guard was let down in that case and the right things were not being done.  However, we would all agree that things have improved, as is only proper and right.  We now have officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Health going into the factories and there has been a big improvement in terms of how those factories operate, which is very important.  This Bill is generally dealing with the present crisis and that is often the case when certain legislation is rushed through the Houses.</p> <p>Senator Gavan also made some fine points about co-operatives.  However, from talking to business people in my constituency - mainly small business owners - and talking to my own accountant, it is clear to me that the owners of small businesses are very worried about how their five, six, eight or ten employees will be fixed in the months ahead.  They are desperately trying to reopen and re-establish themselves and a lot of small business directors really and genuinely worry about having the money at the end of the week to pay their workers.  I make that point because it is often misunderstood in the debates we have.  Business directors are very conscious of having the money to pay their five, six, eight or ten employees at the end of the week and how important that is in keeping their businesses going.</p> <p>I acknowledge that the July stimulus package may be disappointing to some, but it is a huge development in terms of trying to rectify some of the appalling situations we are facing as a result of the Covid pandemic.  We had a busy debate here yesterday about the moneys that are being made available.  I accept that some of the provision will be in the form of loans, but several of the small business owners I have spoken to tell me that if the banks co-operate and they can access those loans, they will be very helpful to them.  As we know, if something goes wrong, the banks will take only a 20% hit on these loans, while the State and taxpayers will take an 80% hit.  We also have the &euro;5 billion EU Brexit fund coming down the road.  I accept that not all of it will go to Ireland, but there is no doubt that the bulk of the fund will come to us because we are the member state most affected by Brexit.</p> <p>A very important point was made about broadband provision.  I agree that if we do not get that right for all parts of the country, urban as well as rural, a lot of this legislation will not work.  I am glad to see that the Minister is looking at speeding up the process of broadband provision.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to get the hubs up and running as quickly as possible.

I welcome the amendments proposed in this Bill and wholeheartedly support them.  I particularly welcome the provisions that allow for meetings to be held virtually as it will be a particular relief to companies anxious to fulfil their corporate obligations but constrained by their constitutions and company law heretofore barring the validity of virtually held meetings.</p> <p>When one hears the word "company" an image springs to mind of large multinationals or well known indigenous companies.  That is a natural assumption.  Over the past number of weeks there has been discussion in this House on small and medium enterprises.  The local enterprise offices have provided them with a wealth of support and the programme for Government assures their heightened stature.  However, there is a group of companies and directors that can be overlooked.  It is on their behalf that I would like to address my remarks.</p> <p>Many community organisations and entities within our communities are charities and volunteer groups.  For the procurement of funding purposes they are obligated to establish companies that are run by volunteers who are nonetheless directors for the purposes of company law.  A large number of exceptional outreaches to the community within my own constituency of Dublin South Central are powered by volunteers who are passionate about their community and of necessity their roles have obliged them to become company directors.  The obligations of company directorship, particularly at this time, can be onerous.  We need to give due consideration to their worries and concerns.  My own experience of serving on volunteer boards is that volunteers are conscientious workers who want the best for their organisations and their employees.  I am mindful of the number of volunteer directors who are obligated to make serious decisions, existential decisions on the viability of their organisations.  In some instances, these are organisations that they have founded, nurtured and loved over many years and they are wrestling with the obligations and concern for their employees and dealing with issues such as redundancy and so on.  I am actively supporting a number of organisations within my own constituency in that regard.</p> <p>I welcome the work of The Wheel which has been instrumental in providing training and networking opportunities, particularly for these two groups, which in law, are companies.  I also acknowledge that these groups have been widely funded and supported and partnered by Government.  The excellent changes encompassed in this Bill and entirely in the company law obligations entered into by directors need to be supported by an information campaign specifically targeting these type of volunteer directors.  They need a means of information on their obligations, alleviating their concerns and their conscientious worries and giving them support in simple, non-legalese language.  Going forward, where we to enter into a campaign of information we would be affording that information and support to volunteer directors and, thereby, opening up the opportunity for more people to become involved and volunteer as directors on boards, who would be otherwise put off.  We open the opportunity then for a more diverse representation on boards.</p> <p>We live in a world where the law and the obligations are fast moving.  For example, privacy law - wearing my own hat - brings obligations in respect of personal data and well-meaning people involved in a volunteer capacity, including directors, can inadvertently breach privacy law, deeming a sharing or disclosure of personal data to be harmless in the context of the objectives of the business or organisation.  The provisions in this Bill for virtual meetings have attendant clauses and criteria that obligate the standard of security and privacy in the electronic communications.  In the absence of a large IT budget or the necessary internal expertise, we may need to be providing information supports such as the required ISO standard and so on.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to put those in place.  I ask the Minister of State to consider an information campaign specifically for this cohort of directors.  He has my full support for the Bill.</p></speech>

It is important that the Government supports measures to improve businesses and the outcome for employees who have been losing jobs in recent times.  I come from the Roscommon-Galway area which is lacking in investment.  There are many towns and villages with populations of less than 10,000 and the region is losing jobs due to the current climate globally and in terms of Covid-19.</p> <p>I pay tribute to the Departments that are putting together policies to support businesses.  In regard to the July stimulus, which I know is only one part of a parcel of policies coming forward, I welcome the value placed therein on further and higher education and on encouraging employers to take on apprentices.  The stimulus also provides for upskilling and retraining and provides for an additional 34,000 places in further and higher education to allow people who have recently lost their jobs to reskill and, perhaps, to consider Grow Remote or other types of remote working to allow them to achieve an income for their families.</p> <p>There are other areas I would like to encourage Government to support while acknowledging there are supports provided for in the July stimulus package that will come into effect in October.  We need to encourage people to shop local and spend local.  I welcome the &euro;125 tax credit in respect of spend of over &euro;600 on food and accommodation.  In my own town of Ballinasloe Gullane's Hotel reopened today, which is fantastic.  We need more support for our local accommodation such as hotels, bed and breakfasts and so on.  We also need to encourage support for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and initiatives such as Discover Ireland, the Hidden Heartlands and the Wild Atlantic Way.  We need to examine how we can ensure the policies we are bringing forward will support those agencies and those offerings.  I ask that the Minister of State would encourage greater focus on areas outside of the major urban areas.  I propose to engage with the Departments on how we can support the unique challenges in those areas.</p></speech>

I welcome this Bill which will help business to adapt in the current very difficult circumstances.  I have listened to some of the commentary in this House.  I remind people that there is a big difference between remote working and working from home in the middle of a national crisis.  We are currently doing the latter.  It is not normal that people are trying to juggle home working, home rearing and home schooling, as I have been doing in my family for the last four months.  I know that many of my friends have been doing the same.  Many of us have been getting up at 6 a.m. before the children wake and, when they wake, tag teaming to try to get everything done, often working into the evening to make sure that all obligations are fulfilled.  It has been exhausting.  That is working from home in the middle of a national crisis, not remote working.  Despite that, people still see the opportunities of remote work.  More than half the number of people who have been doing it want to retain it.</p> <p>I also remind people that the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation website provides advice and guidance on working remotely, covering issues such as safety, health, welfare and obligations under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  That is very important.  I know there is a national consultation to improve the situation but I would ask that in terms of the Minister of State's portfolio this be seen as an ambitious project not just for now but embedding flexible and remote work.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Remote working is one part of flexibility and developing communities around it.</p><p>Senator Byrne referred to the remote parliament in the UK.  I certainly have enjoyed watching Claire Hanna MP holding the UK Parliament accountable from her home in Belfast.  Councillors across the country have been working remotely but only have had access to governance and oversight meetings.  They have not had their full powers.  Despite all the work they have been doing, they have not been able to set their own or legally binding motions throughout the crisis.  That needs to be addressed in the Local Government Act.  While it is required for councillors, remote council sessions would make the role of a councillor more accessible to those with jobs, women and parents.  It would allow them to juggle more easily their roles as local representatives and parents, for example.  That is a huge opportunity going forward.</p><p>I recognise the plight of the Debenhams workers.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, along with the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy English, met them during the week to assist them.  We do not want to see such a situation arising again.</p><p>Since phase 1 reopening, an intensive regime for monitoring compliance with the Return to Work Safety Protocol has been in place led by the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, with the assistance from the inspectorate of the Workplace Relations Commission, including 500 HSA inspectors.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.  I know these are temporary measures but it is time to bring the businesses of Ireland and the business of this House into the 21st century.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State on all of this.</p></speech>

It is well deserved.  I know the long hours he has put in as spokesperson and as a councillor in his own area.  Despite being a public representative, it did not stop him from keeping his feet on the ground and minding the post office and the parish at home.  That is all part of public representation.  I wish him every success in his appointment.</p></speech>

I hope they will always be as kind to me when I come before the House in the future.  I will appreciate it for today.</p> <p>Senators Ahearn and Lombard referred to the July stimulus package.  It is an ambitious project and of real substance.  It comes to &euro;5 billion, or &euro;7 billion if one takes into account the credit guarantee scheme.  Some people are disappointed that not everything has been achieved.  It is, however, the singular biggest injection to support business in the history of the State.  There should be no mistake about it.  When one listens to some Members talking about protecting companies, it seems companies and businesses are bad.  Businesses create jobs and wealth.  They ensure taxes are paid and the wealth can be reinvested to ensure the provision of core services.  It is important to recognise that.  I accept there are some rogue businesses.  By and large, however, most businesses are run by good, honest people who are doing good work.  They are captains of industry creating opportunities for the citizens of the State.  We should stop knocking people who are creating jobs and are wealth creators.  We need those people investing in our country.</p> <p>Senators Lombard, Gavan and Bacik referred to co-operatives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A general scheme for the co-operative societies Bill is being prepared by the Department.  It will provide co-operative societies with a distinct legal legislative identity, reflecting their ethos, reduce the number of members required to form a co-operative, revise the provisions of debentures, introduce audit exceptions in line with the approach taken in the Companies Act 2014, as well as strengthening governance provisions and revising the powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I acknowledge it is long overdue.  A large body of work was done with the 2014 Companies Act, which took a long time in the Department.  Attention has now been focused on this area.  I gave a commitment in an oral question a number of weeks ago in the D&aacute;il that, as it falls under my responsibility, I will happily work with all parties to ensure we get proper legislation that will meet all our aspirations.  It is my intention that this will be introduced in the Oireachtas before the end of this year or, at the latest, early in the new year.</p><p>Senator Byrne referred to the accelerated use of technology.  We must acknowledge that Covid-19 has demonstrated how much we can better use technology.  This interim period until the end of December will act as a pilot basis to see how well it works.  I have no doubt it will work very well and efficiently.  It will give us an opportunity to see how it works on a pilot basis and how we can make it more permanent.  There is an interdepartmental group on the digital economy and how it will advance over the next several years.  Digital is the responsibility of many Departments.  I am led to believe that I am going to be the chairman of the interdepartmental group.  There are moves under way on a national digital strategy which will provide an opportunity for all Members, wider society and stakeholders to feed into that digital strategy, which is important.</p><p>I acknowledge Senator McDowell's vast experience in the legal profession and the work he has done in this area.  While I take on board much of what he said, there is an urgency that this Bill is enacted, which he will appreciate.  There is one permanent amendment in this legislation providing for the substitution of the Workplace Relations Commission for the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  We are working to have the co-operative societies legislation brought forward, streamlined and fit for purpose.  A large body of work was done back in 2014.  I will ask my officials if there is any way possible to examine Senator McDowell's proposal.  I am not sure there is, however, given the time constraints with this legislation.</p><p>Senator Gavan and I had a good working relationship on the Council of Europe and we became friends as a result.  I understand that in certain instances that he is coming from a different perspective and different outlook on life.  That is good.  It is important that there is always somebody on that side of the House to challenge and hold people on this side of the House to account.  The Government is only good as its Opposition.  An Opposition has a strong role to play in democracy and holding people to account.</p><p>I disagree fundamentally on Senator Gavan's contention about the July stimulus, however.  We need business.  Just because one is pro-business does not mean one is anti-employee.  One can be supportive of both.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Mention was made of people working in meat plants and other places where, because of the nature of the work, they have ended up in clusters.  Obviously, the protection of employees is very important.  That is why a huge body of work was done, particularly with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the HSA, to bring forward protocols to ensure the protection of employees.  I heard two different figures, 67 and 400, with regard to people working in the HSA.  I will undertake to look at how many are there.  I know when I was on the other side of the House I raised the very same point on the need for more inspectors to be on the ground in the few cases where people do not feel they have to comply with the protocols that have been laid out.  These protocols have been painstakingly gone through with ICTU, IBEC and various stakeholders and it is important they are adhered to.  I will check out exactly how many people there are and will respond to the Senators directly on this.</p><p>I am conscious Senator Bacik, as well as Senator McDowell, has high legal qualifications and expertise and I will be guided somewhat by what they have said.  Senator Bacik raised an issue, and I am glad she did because it gives me an opportunity to clarify, with regard to the codifying of directors' duties.  It is something I would have liked to have seen in the Bill because we need to ensure directors' duties are explicitly stated.  It was intended to progress a third recommendation on the codification of directors' duties to creditors as part of the Bill but constitutional concerns about the provision were raised by the advisory council so further examination is required before it is capable of being progressed further.  Given the fact it was going to be a permanent amendment it was felt to be more prudent to give it further consideration.  Certainly it is something of which I am supportive and I will be looking at how to include it as an amendment in further legislation.</p></speech>

He mentioned the July stimulus package and I will not go back over that again.  Senator Seery Kearney mentioned the good work done by voluntary directors and made a good suggestion on an information campaign so people are aware.  Many people serve on voluntary boards, and I have done so myself in the past, and they are not fully aware of their obligations.  Perhaps an association or organisation such as The Wheel would be able to run such a campaign.  If the Senator has a suggestion I ask her to feel free to come back to me to see whether we can get it implemented.</p> <p>Senator Dolan made a similar point to Senator Murphy on regional development.  It is a key policy of the Government to ensure we have regional development and remote working hubs are important.  As Senator Currie said, there is a huge difference between remote working and working from home, which is why it is important that we get our childcare facilities up and running to the full extent and our schools back in operation in September to give people who need to go back to work the opportunity to do so, and to look at putting in place regional hubs in places where there is not huge investment at present that will support job creation in those regions.  This is music to my ears and I support it.</p> <p>I believe I have replied to everybody who has raised an issue and if it is okay with the House we will move on to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

The sensible thing is not to press amendment No. 1.  To revert to the topic itself, it seems the Minister of State has an opportunity.  He will be bringing the Bill to the D&aacute;il and if he and his officials can think of a formula to include in section 1 or section 2 that will see the temporary provisions evaporate automatically and not have to be repealed at a later stage they should attempt to do so.  There will be only a very tiny delay if the Bill comes back as amended from the D&aacute;il to here.  It would be nodded through, I presume, without further debate.  The time constraints we are under do not really prevent the issue from being addressed.  As I said earlier, I was concerned as to whether we can achieve the effect of a repeal in legislation.  I looked at a number of legislative drafting books and I am convinced it can be done in a way that at the end of this period leaves the text clean.  Obviously, the Minister of State would have to differentiate between the permanent amendments and the non-permanent amendments he is making but it seems that it can be done.</p><p>I want to make a point on the discussion on the threshold of indebtedness for winding up a company.  Generally speaking, the petition to wind up a company for non-payment of a debt is a bit nuclear in its use.  Quite frequently, a petition to wind up a company because a person is owed &euro;5,000, &euro;10,000 or whatever is ultimately a threat to cause serious damage to the company if it does not pay its debts.  Sometimes it is almost blackmail to a company that is going through a cashflow problem.  I appreciate this point very much.  On the other hand, if the thresholds are raised too much it will leave people with no chance of getting their money back.  If small creditors, such as somebody owed &euro;10,000 damages or compensation from a workplace commission, cannot use leverage on the company to get paid, in the end he or she will be left without.  Theoretically the sheriff can be sent out but sending a sheriff to a company in the IFSC is a bit impractical as a solution.  Sometimes people are owed money and sometimes there has to be pressure on debtor companies to actually pay up to small creditors.  The small sums may not mean much to very wealthy people but they can be hugely important to people of very modest means.  If the Minister of State is considering making permanent changes to the thresholds I ask him to bear in mind that small creditors also need to be protected because they can frequently end up with no practical way of extracting money from companies that just keep trading and ignoring their letters and demands.</p></speech>

I only received notification of that at 12.40 p.m.  This shows the difficulties we all have.  While we understand the urgency of the Bill, it is frustrating that this happens.</p> <p>I want to make the point to the Minister of State and I suspect he will agree with me that we urgently need a legislative solution for tactical insolvencies.  The Duffy Cahill report was produced four years ago and, as Senator Bacik mentioned, we had Clerys before that.  To be blunt, there is a stark contrast between the urgency of this legislation, which we support, and the complete absence of urgency about the Duffy Cahill recommendations.  The previous Government had four years to deal with the report's recommendations to stop tactical insolvencies and it did not act on them.  I hope we can see proper legislation in place before Christmas.  It is the least that those workers and all other workers deserve.  As a leading trade unionist said to me this week, Debenhams is the tip of the iceberg.  There is a tsunami of further potential job losses and tactical insolvencies on the way.  Working class people in this country cannot wait any longer for this legislation.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to speak.</p></speech>

I should have mentioned Debenhams workers, since the matter was raised by a couple of speakers.  We cannot introduce legislation today that will deal with the situation retrospectively.  I support the workers.  As a previous speaker said, the Minister of State, Deputy English, the T&aacute;naiste and I have met them.  The workers raised important matters of concern which deserve and are receiving thorough consideration.  It is important that all stakeholders, including political representatives and the Government, do not raise expectations unduly.  I want to ensure that everything that can be done within the confines of the law is being done to ensure a satisfactory outcome for the workers of Debenhams.</p> <p>The Duffy Cahill report has been mentioned.  I certainly think there are proposals in the report that warrant further consideration.  As Minister of State with responsibility for company regulation, it is my intention and a commitment in the programme for Government for those recommendations to be considered to see how and which of them will be implemented.  I agree with what the Senator said.  There is little point in producing reports if we are to ignore their findings and conclusions.  I do not think the implementation of everything in the Duffy Cahill report would have prevented what is happening in Debenhams.  The case is before the High Court and we cannot interfere with that process.  I will not say any more on the matter now.</p></speech>

He said a couple of significant things.  I think I am right in saying he has given a commitment that the numbers required to form a co-operative will be reduced in a Bill that is coming, hopefully, in the near future.  He has also mentioned a legal definition for co-operatives.  I would stress worker co-operatives in particular in that regard.  We all know the potential of worker co-operatives.  Scotland has had significant progress in recent years.  It calls them employee-owned enterprises.  I do not really care what they are called once we can make progress in that regard.</p> <p>We can see in this specific situation, where many businesses are struggling, that if this option was available and people had more confidence in being able to form a co-operative because of the greater legal standing, and if it was easier in that they only needed three members as opposed to seven, we could save employment across Ireland, especially in rural areas and small towns.  I am delighted to hear what the Minister of State said about much work having been done.  I ask him to urgently progress this legislation.</p> <p>We have a significant issue across Europe with business succession when people retire after a lifetime of work.  In many instances, those businesses close.  Worker co-operatives are a route taken across Europe to fill that gap and to maintain employment.  One beauty of worker co-operatives is that the wealth built there is kept within the communities.  It is ideal for a country such as ours.  We have fallen far behind the rest of Europe in this regard.  I am encouraged by what the Minister of State has said.  Sinn F&eacute;in will work constructively on that Bill.  I urge that it come forward as quickly as possible because God knows we need it with this crisis.</p></speech>

Based on the review, a general scheme of a co-operative societies Bill is being prepared which will provide co-operative societies with a distinct legislative identity reflecting their co-operative ethos, reducing the number of members required to form a co-operative, revising the provisions on debentures, introduce audit exemptions in line with the approach taken in the Companies Act 2014, strengthen the governance provisions and revise the powers of the Register of Friendly Societies.  Work is well under way and it is my intention, before the end of this year, or at the very latest early next year, to bring that before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

We spoke about meat factories earlier and we know there are real concerns about health, safety and welfare at work for our workers.  The meat factory problem would be solved if trade union officials were allowed to go in to meat factories.  I was a trade union official with SIPTU for ten years.  With the exception of one factory in Nenagh, I was never allowed into factories.  They would not have a trade union man or woman about the place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When I organised workers in factories in the Minister's constituency, they were sacked, summarily fired, because they joined a trade union.  This is a massive problem.  We are never going to get proper rights and conditions for working people, especially in the meat factory sector, but across a whole range of sectors, including hospitality, until we have a right of trade union officials to access workplaces.  What on earth does any employer have to be afraid of in this respect?  We will never tackle the crisis in employment.  Nothing has changed in meat factories.  How many meat factories recognise trade unions?  I can count them on one hand.  Many such businesses have their offices in the Isle of Man and other overseas locations.  In many cases they are unlimited companies.  They operate in a way that is entirely unacceptable and it needs to be called out.  This was a simple amendment to give a right of access to trade union officials.  I would have thought Senators from all parties should support that right, which is not set out in law currently, and does need to be addressed.</p></speech>

I also support his concerns about the conditions in meat factories in particular.  Clearly, that is a very pressing issue, one of which we are all well aware.  Trade union rights and, in particular, rights of representation for workers is one on which this House has a good record.  We passed legislation on a cross-party basis in the term of the previous Seanad that went on to be passed by the D&aacute;il.  The Bill was initiated as a Labour Party Private Members' Bill, which gave collective bargaining rights and rights of representation to freelance workers who, again, were in a very vulnerable and precarious position, and remain in one, but whose position is greatly strengthened where they have access to trade union representation on their behalf.  We have worked consistently on these issues in the Seanad and I hope we will continue to do so.  I accept the amendment is out of order but I wish to impress upon the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, that we should be seeking to enact such a right of representation and right of access in other legislation.</p></speech>

I hear what both Senators have said about rights of access for trade unions.  In order to introduce such an amendment, stakeholder engagement is required.</p> <p>In response to what was said about meat plants, I accept there was an issue and corrective action was taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In some instances, it has been deemed that the cluster did not originate in the factory but outside of it and was brought in.  I do not in any way wish to diminish the responsibility of employers and businesses in ensuring proper protocols are in place.  Painstaking negotiations were involved with the various stakeholders in drawing up the Return to Work Safely Protocol to make sure adequate protocols were put in place for people returning to work.  A specific point was raised by Senator Gavan about ensuring there are sufficient inspectors from the Health and Safety Authority to monitor the situation in cases where the protocols are being breached.  I have undertaken to examine the issue and I will respond directly to the Senator.  As the Cathaoirleach has said, in any event the amendment has been ruled out of order.</p></speech>

I am sorry that we are all moonlighting in the D&aacute;il Chamber but I am very much looking forward to stepping into the hallowed grounds of Ireland's Upper House at some point.  It is a huge honour and privilege to hold the office and to be here with Senators today to debate this Bill.  Thank you for your good wishes, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  There is quite the task ahead in healthcare in the Covid world.</p> <p>It is my pleasure to introduce the Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Bill 2020 to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I believe it is our obligation as elected representatives to look after those who need it most and I am therefore very pleased that this Bill provides for two key measures that will positively impact children and people over the age of 70.</p> <p>First, the Bill provides for a welcome increase to the gross income limits for medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 or older and, second, for a phased expansion of GP care without charges to all children aged 12 and under.  Sl&aacute;intecare provides a necessary and long-awaited process for reorienting our health system from one that treats only sick people to one that keeps people well.  That is why the measures provided for by this Bill are so important.  They will enable us to take another important step forward towards achieving the health system the people of Ireland need and deserve.</p> <p>A range of measures has already been implemented to expand access to people in receipt of medical cards and GP visit cards.  This includes the provision of medical cards to people in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, which was done in 2017, the provision of GP visit cards to people in receipt of a carer's allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit, in 2018, and in 2019 the increase in the GP visit card income thresholds.  All of this has resulted in 43% of the population now having access to GP care without fees.  However, while these initiatives are very welcome, this Government recognises the need to do more.  That is why we have committed in the programme for Government to implement new measures to expand access to GP care without fees and to wider health services.  As Minister for Health I am delighted to be bringing forward this legislation for debate here today, and affording it the priority that it deserves.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The first key measure in the Bill is a welcome increase to the gross income limits for medical card eligibility for people aged 70 or older.  Everyone should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life, and we all know the world is ageing and we are living longer.  Increased longevity is a welcome indication of improved public health and social and economic development here in Ireland and in many other countries around the world.  As many individuals age, however, they will face the risk of having at least one chronic disease, such as hypertension or diabetes, and we must ensure our health system is designed to meet the consequences of these continued and evolving demographic changes.</p><p>The World Health Organization defines healthy ageing as "the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being in older age".  Functional ability is about having the capabilities that enable all people to be and do what they have reason to value.  This includes a person's ability to access basic needs like healthcare.  Currently, 75% of people over 70 hold a medical card.  Having regard to the prevalence and co-morbidity of chronic diseases in the population of people over 70 and the benefits to be achieved through improved health and well-being, I wish to ensure, therefore, a greater proportion is afforded access to health services at a time when health needs are higher.</p><p>I should also highlight that this is the first increase in the income limits since they were reduced in 2014.  Today's Bill therefore provides a very welcome increase.  If the forecasted numbers of people to benefit from this measure materialise, it will result in approximately 87% of the population who are over 70 having medical card coverage.  The income limits we will discuss are an increase of approximately 10%, although we will get into the detail.  This increase of 10% could see coverage extended to half the number of people who still do not have access to a medical card.  The benefit is beyond what we might think if we just looked at the increase in limits.</p><p>I now turn to the second key measure provided by the Bill, which is the phased expansion of free GP care to primary school children.  Senators will be aware that our programme for Government also includes a commitment to expanding access to GP care without charges to more children.  It is an important deliverable for the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, which commits to expanding eligibility for access to healthcare on a phased basis.  Since 2015, all children under six have been eligible to access general GP services without charges, along with periodic health assessments and the asthma cycle of care programme.  This has been a very successful measure, with more than 250,000 children under six eligible to access GP care without fees.  The most recent Healthy Ireland Survey indicates four in every five children under six had attended a GP in the previous year, which really demonstrates the welcome benefit of increasing access to affordable healthcare, or in this case healthcare free at the point of use.  We must still pay for the service.</p><p>There is a clear rationale and obvious benefits to expanding universal access to GP care to children.  It will bring important lifetime benefits both for our children and society as a whole, ensuring early intervention and healthy behaviour from a young age, as well as reducing long-term healthcare needs and the associated costs that come with this.  Furthermore, evidence points to the importance of introducing policies to promote health and well-being and tackle inequalities in health, as they are likely to be more successful the younger the age groups targeted.  The earlier and more quickly we can get to children, the better off they will be for the rest of their lives.</p><p>We also know the cost of GP visits acts as a barrier to accessing care.  The Growing Up in Ireland study, for example, indicates that those who face out-of-pocket expenses to access GP care make significantly fewer GP visits, and that children from higher income families are more likely to visit the GP than children from lower income families.  The measure being debated today will ensure therefore, that irrespective of the social and economic background of the children and how much money their parents earn, every child up to the age of 12 will have equal access to GP services without charge.  It is a significant milestone and I am proud to welcome this beneficial public health measure.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As well as removing a potentially prohibitive cost barrier to accessing healthcare, the continued provision of the additional services already available to children under six, such as the asthma cycle of care, will help to improve children's health and well-being as they develop through middle childhood.  Moreover, this progressive measure will also ensure continuity of care for children in the under-sixes cohort.  This will now deliver a full continuum of care from birth right to the age of 12 provided by the GP.  It is why I want to extend access to GP care without charges to more children.</p><p>Today's Bill provides a legislative framework to continue on this path of universal expansion.  Already, nearly 200,000 children between ages six and 12 have access to a GP without charges either through the medical card scheme or other schemes.  It is estimated that expanding GP care without charges to children up to the age of 12 will benefit an additional 300,000 children in our society, which would be fantastic.  However, I recognise a move to a universal access system for health coverage is challenging.</p><p>The timing of implementation requires very careful consideration and the initial stage of the phased expansion will therefore be to all children aged six and seven, so as not to overwhelm the health system and general practice, which as we all know is struggling with capacity now.  Specifically, the legislative framework in the Bill provides a roadmap for expansion.  Phase 1 will be for children aged six and seven; phase 2 will be for children aged eight and nine; and phase 3 will be for children aged ten, 11 and 12.</p><p>GPs have been the first port of call for patients in the Covid-19 context and they deserve major recognition for the work they have done under extraordinarily difficult circumstances, so it is imperative that general practice continues to be in a position to provide healthcare to all patients in a sustainable manner.  In that regard and taking account of the forthcoming winter in the context of Covid-19, it is crucial an expansion of GP care does not inhibit general practice from delivering ongoing care in the community for all patients.  The implementation date for the expansion will therefore require careful consideration by officials in my Department and the HSE, as well as input from the Houses.  That said, I firmly believe it is important to bring forward the legislation today as it provides the legal framework to enable expansion to be progressed and implemented when the timing is right.</p><p>The purpose of the Bill is therefore twofold.  It will provide the legislative framework for the further phased expansion of GP care and to increase the gross income limits for medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 and older.  Before I outline the main provisions of the Bill I note a miscellaneous provision in the Bill, which is an amendment to the 1970 Health Act to take account of the new governance structures in the HSE.  Essentially, it is about switching the terms "director general" and "chief executive".</p><p>The main provision provisions are as follows.  Section 2 amends the existing legislation relating to gross income limits for medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 or older under the 1970 Health Act.  The amendment to section 45A of the Health Act 1970 provides for an increase in the gross medical card limits for persons aged 70 or older to &euro;550 per week for a single person, where it is currently &euro;500 per week, and to &euro;1,050 per week for a couple, where it is currently &euro;900 per week.</p><p>Section 3 provides a technical amendment to section 53C of the Health Act 1970 to replace the reference to "director general" of the Health Service Executive, HSE, with "chief executive officer" of the HSE.  This necessary technical amendment ensures section 53C of the Health Act 1970 is consistent with the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019, which amends the references to the director general of the HSE and replaces them with references to the chief executive officer of the HSE.</p><p>Section 4 amends the legislation under the Health Act 1970 that relates to the making available of a general practitioner medical and surgical service, or the GP card, without charges to persons who are ordinarily resident in the State under six years of age.  The amendment of section 58 and 58B of the Health Act 1970 expands the availability of this service to persons ordinarily resident in the State and who have not attained the age of eight years.  This is the first age category being provided with eligibility for free GP care under the phased system.  This is a complicated way of indicating that children aged six and seven will become eligible for the scheme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Sections 5 and 6 provide for making general practitioner medical and surgical services available without charges to persons who are ordinarily resident in the State and have not attained the age of ten years and 13 years, respectively.  These are the second and third age categories being provided with eligibility for free GP care under the remaining two phases of expansion.  In other words, section 5 is for eight and nine year olds and section 6 relates to those aged ten, 11 and 12.  Section 7 provides for the Short Title to the Bill and for the introduction of both GP expansion and an increase in the medical card gross income thresholds by commencement order, as required, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I am personally pleased to bring this progressive measure forward and to debate it in the Seanad today.  I am confident the Bill will bring about real change in our health service.  More importantly, it will bring about real change for patients and members of the public who need access to care and who might not be getting the full access they require at present because of the cost.  This will make a significant difference.  I am sure many Members of the House have been contacted by people over the age of 70 years, the one in four who do not have the medical card, asking them when this change will be introduced.  It will make a difference to them and it will make a world of difference to worried parents who were previously unable to afford to bring their children to the GP.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Senators.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for bringing this welcome and progressive legislation to the House.  I believe it deserves, and will have, broad support from the House.  The Minister has a personal commitment to better access to public healthcare and this allows people to access healthcare at the point of entry with GPs throughout the country.  It is very welcome.  As a mother of two young children who has been fortunate to avail of free GP care since the day they were born, I am happy that this will continue for parents in Ireland.</p> <p>The pandemic has impacted disproportionately on families with young children.  This is a welcome measure for those families and gives them some extra relief.  What used to happen is that parents would perhaps second-guess things and take a chance.  We all know that children's health can deteriorate very quickly and if one takes a chance because one cannot afford &euro;50 or &euro;60 to bring a child to the GP, it can have devastating consequences for the long-term health of the child and the well-being of the family unit.  This provision is therefore very welcome, as is the expansion of the income limits for people over the age of 70 years.  Those people have contributed a great deal to this country and it is a good step to acknowledge that their needs are greater as they get older and to acknowledge the contribution they have made to the country.</p> <p>The GPs of Ireland have played an amazing role over the past few months dealing with queries to their surgeries, assessing whether people need to be tested for Covid-19 and much of the time reassuring people that perhaps they do not require testing.  They have been doing a great deal of work and, hopefully, in conjunction with today's measures, the Minister will be able to give extra support to the GPs who need it.</p> <p>I am glad to support the Minister today and I thank him for the work he has done on this Bill and for the work he will continue to do.  I wish him the best of luck in his role.</p></speech>

I also commend all the healthcare workers and professionals, and everybody who supports them to do their work.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the health portfolio.  I am sure he will do a fantastic job.  It must be a great honour for him to lead such an important Department.</p> <p>I was brought up in a GP's practice as my dad was a GP.  The practice was in our home and for more than 40 years it was a community-based, medical card practice looking after patients from Cabra, Phibsborough, the Navan Road and the north inner city in Dublin 7.  I therefore understand the unique relationship patients have with their GP.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is incredible that although he has been retired for almost ten years people still talk to me about dad and mam every day, so what the Minister is doing here today is very valuable.  It is giving people access to the GP and allowing every child under the age of 12 years to have the opportunity, regardless of who their parents are, to have access to GP care.  I lived and worked in the United States and I was shocked by the commercialisation of it there.  I remember a person collapsing on the street in front of me one day.  Two ambulances pulled up and the first thing the medics did was go through the person's wallet and check for an insurance card.</p><p>I am proud that the Government has committed to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which will bring about universal access to healthcare for people based on their medical need, not their ability to pay.  I commend the Minister on bringing this legislative measure so swiftly to the Houses, and I urge all Members of this House to support and pass it.  It is a step change and a strong signal of how this Government intends to deliver healthcare and make it available to people.</p><p>The Minister mentioned the GPs.  As I said, I grew up in a practice so I know the enormous effort and commitment given by individual GPs, their families and support staff.  GPs are under pressure.  Far too many GP practices are struggling financially, and we do not have enough GPs.  It is important that the Government has recognised this, is taking a phased approach to it and is addressing the issue in a managed way.  We still have to contend with Covid-19 and it is great that the screening services are recommencing, but expanding the healthcare service and expanding access to it are important principles that the Government is not abandoning.  It was not just an election slogan or something to put in the manifesto.  It is real legislation that will be backed by action by the Minister and the Government.  I commend the Minister on that.</p></speech>

Both of us were of the class of 2011 so I got to know him very well in the Houses.  The one thing I always admired, and still admire, him for is his extremely sharp intellect, coupled with his compassion.  He is certainly well qualified for his brief.  I have known his aunt in Clare for practically all my life and I know how proud she is of his appointment.  We all are delighted for him and wish him the best.  We will be happy to give any support we can to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, in this extremely important role.</p> <p>It is fitting that the first Bill he brings to the House is one to open access for young people and old people to healthcare.  That is important.  I believe it is one of the last legislative measures approved by the last Government and the Bill is now before us.  As I said, it is very appropriate that this should be the Minister's first Bill.  As we have seen, the history of medical cards and eligibility over the years has not been pretty.  We saw the controversies that occurred, particularly in 2013 and 2014 when medical cards were taken from children with disabilities.  That should never have happened.  We have learned as a society and as a political system from those terrible experiences.  We are building a system that is fit for purpose and for our healthcare service in the future.</p> <p>Anybody who needs access to healthcare and cannot afford it should automatically get it.  Equally, people with a terminal illness should have access to a medical card straight away and not be put through hoops to get it.  Every Member in our work in constituency offices has dealt with people who were diagnosed with terminal cancer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Every one of us has experienced the challenges in advocating on their behalf to get them the medical card.  This should not happen.  I believe in the principle of universal healthcare.  Even more I believe in the principle of giving immediate access to people who need it immediately.  That is equally important.  I still do not believe our system is foolproof in that regard.</p><p>The Minister may be aware of John Wall, a man with a terminal illness in my county of Clare, who has campaigned tirelessly in recent years to reform and improve the medical care eligibility structure, and how the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, engages with people.  He has had success with some of his initiatives.</p><p>We also need to consider the associated benefits that a medical card brings and the confusion it can create.  Far too often I have dealt with people who have applied for a medical card not because they are ill or may become ill, but because having the medical card will secure other benefits, such as bus tickets for their children going to school.  We need to decouple that system.  Let the medical card stand on its own.  It has its own critically important purpose.  Somebody should not need to have a medical card to qualify for school transport or other benefits.</p><p>I would be shocked if anybody had any problem with passing the legislation.  This House has always come together on matters of important legislation and everyone will recognise the benefits of this legislation.  In summing up, the Minister might outline what will happen when the legislation is passed.  What is the timeline to get it enacted?  When can a couple aged over 70 whose income is &euro;920 expect to have a medical card?  Ultimately, we will pass the legislation, which will be signed by the President.  At that stage it is up to the departmental officials to implement it.</p><p>It is an absolute pleasure to see the Minister in this role in this House.  I look forward to working with him in future. </p></speech>

I thank him even for the clarity and delivery of the content of the Bill.</p> <p>The first time I spoke to the Minister it was not in Ireland.  The first time I met him and had a chat with him was in the company of the current British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, when we were on a trip to the UK.  Boris Johnson came a bit late and offered us some refreshments.  I think he suggested tea and we might have suggested something else.  Anyway, he immediately picked out this red-headed fellow in the back.  It was only a few years ago.  He said that this was one smart guy and that he had worked with him when he was Mayor of London and the Minister was involved in consultancy.  I had forgotten that and while sitting here I looked over at him and remembered that incident.  He was very decent.  He set up a few photographs of that evening in Whitehall.  He said he was a smart guy and I believe he was right.  I would not necessarily have much in common with the key themes and messages the British Prime Minister discusses from time to time.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for his clarity of message.  We are in for an exciting time in health.  From what I have observed of him, from what I have heard about him and from what colleagues inside politics and outside politics have said about him, he is extremely professional and focused.  Some might say he is over-focused, but that is what we want.  This is the person we want in the job as Minister for Health.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I very much welcome the Bill which when fully enacted will extend free GP care to children up to the age of 12 and increase the access of medical cards for persons aged 70 or older.  The expansion of GP care without charge is an important health measure in line with the Government&rsquo;s stated objective.  However, it was the stated objective of the previous Government and we need to remember that Fine Gael has been in government for nine years.  This is another extension of the previous Government, albeit with other parties.  Let us not lose sight of where we have come from and the continuous stated objective and how long it has taken us to get there.  However, it is positive that it is happening now on the Minister&rsquo;s watch for which I thank him.</p><p>It is also a key objective of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan.  Sl&aacute;intecare will be a recurring theme for the duration of the Minister&rsquo;s Ministry and well into the future of our healthcare system.  We should never lose sight of the fact that where there are new reforms in health, we need to keep referencing them back to Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare has support across the House, both inside these Houses and in the greater health community.</p><p>As the Minister has said, the Bill provides a legislative framework; it will not all happen at one time.  He has set out phases 1, 2 and 3 very clearly.  I was going to ask him a question about that, but he has set it out here for me, so I do not have to ask him that question.  It is important that we should say it is a legislative framework to get things done.</p><p>The Bill also provides for the implementation of an increase in the weekly gross medical card income limits for those aged 70 and older to &euro;550 for individuals and to &euro;1,050 for couples, which is currently &euro;900.  That is an increase, albeit moderate, and the Minister has clearly set it out.  That is the sort of clear message without ambiguity we need.  We want to clearly set out where there are benefits and we need to get the message out that these are benefits.</p><p>The legislation will significantly improve access to GP services for children and also increase the number of those aged over 70 who have access to medical cards.  It is a framework, as the Minister has said.  As Senator Fitzpatrick said earlier, it is about access to GPs.  What is the story here?  We know that with Covid, GP services are closed down.  We know people need to make appointments.  We know that people are waiting for up to ten days to get access to their GPs.  We know that many people have left the medical services.  We may have potential access for GPs, but we know that in many areas there are no GPs.  I had contact from people in Blackwater in County Wexford, where the residents were begging a GP to stay because there was no other GP in the public system.</p><p>We have a problem.  On the one hand we are talking about increasing access for different age groups.  As the Minister said, we want to break down barriers for access to the health services for children.  It will take time before we have the full roll-out of phases 1, 2 and 3 up to 12.  Hand in hand with these measures we need to identify why so many GPs are leaving.  Why do so many people find it unattractive to be in general practice?</p><p>How can we embrace new technologies in our health services?  How can we expand the offering of the services?  I had the experience of bringing someone to SwiftCare in south County Dublin.  The person was in, looked at, X-rayed and out in 30 minutes.  The private sector has led in this area.  I do not necessarily like saying that.  I am not an advocate for private medicine over public medicine.  I am an advocate for good medicine.  We need to look at clusters of clinics, shared practice, better supports, better IT services, centralising X-rays, blood tests, etc.  We can speed all this up with technology.  The outdated GP system that many of us are used to and that many of us are exposed to has not served us well.  We need more investment in GP services and make greater efforts to keep GPs in public service.  There are synergies.  It does not necessarily need to be private versus public.  Successful synergies work with private and public medicine.  We want what works best for people.</p><p>I very much welcome this important legislation.  In time the Minister should turn his attention to how we can open up and provide greater accessibility to the services for everybody.  This is really positive legislation.  I have every confidence that the Minister will deliver.  The Bill introduces two important measures which are in the programme for Government, relating to the commitment for access.  Let us keep the pressure on and see how we can improve GP services for everyone.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that he has a mighty task ahead of him but he will have our support in doing his job in the time ahead.  I am not sure whether it is a compliment to be held in such high regard by the current British Prime Minister but I assure the Minister that I will not hold that against him in the time ahead.</p> <p>I would like first to extend appreciation and my party's heartfelt thanks to all of the healthcare workers wherever they worked within the system over the past number of months.  Their dedication and loyalty in saving people's lives and keeping them safe during this pandemic has been outstanding.  We are in awe at the service that they and others have provided for us all at this dangerous time.  Those people deserve more than just our thanks, appreciation and applause once a week.  I, for one, never again want to be on the side and standing with strikers.  In the past, people have rightly had to stand up for better conditions.  We want to see all front-line workers being appreciated by this Government and all governments in the time ahead for not only the sterling work they have done over the past six months but that they do daily.</p> <p>I am approaching this Bill on the basis that I believe that we now need a national health service for all of the people of Ireland.  I want an all-Ireland service and system of universal healthcare, accessed on the basis of need, free at the point of delivery and funded by progressive taxation.  While the increased co-operation with the health services, North and South, has been beneficial, it is now time to move to the full integration of services across the island, taking the best of both systems and maximising the healthcare benefits for all of the citizens across the island.</p> <p>Over recent years, there have been excellent examples of how North-South co-operation has resulted in improvements in services for patients and their families.  An obvious example is the North West Cancer Centre, which has offered a first-class service to the residents of Derry, Donegal and further afield who, until its establishment, had to travel for hours to access treatment at their time of need.  We need more examples like that and begin to think big.  We can no longer afford the duplication of healthcare services across the two states.  It is beyond the time that we looked at healthcare on an all-island basis.</p> <p>People need, deserve and want to know what an all-Ireland health service could look like.  While I appreciate that the Bill will not resolve the fact that this Government needs to wake up to the fact that others are exploring options for an all-Ireland health service while it is not, I assure the Minister and his colleagues that I will, on every occasion, draw to his and others' attention the fact that partition has failed this country and its people.  Partition also fails patients.</p> <p>Primary healthcare and community care should be the cornerstone of our health service throughout the island.  That applies to health services in this State and in the North.  Such an approach will deal with the bulk of the healthcare needs of the population and take the pressure off acute services at times they are under stress.  The strength of this Bill lies in the fact that it aims to help to improve the health and well-being of two very important sectors of society, namely, the young and the elderly.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill but it has one weakness, namely, that there are no specific dates attached to its implementation.  I believe that the Bill has been further weakened by the comments of the Minister yesterday in the D&aacute;il when he said that its implementation was conditional on finance being available, which is totally unacceptable.  I heard the Minister, in this Chamber, talk about a phased approach, suggesting that it was in some way to do with ensuring that we do not overburden the health service.  Let me assure him that parents will continue to take their children to see a GP only when they need to do so.  The phased approach is based on finance and nothing else.</p> <p>This Bill needs certainty in terms of timeframe for implementation and funding from the Government.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Elisha McCallion:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ElishaMcCallion&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While I appreciate negotiations are under way with various stakeholders, that is not an excuse for not attaching a desired timeframe for implementation.  I am calling on the Minister to speedily resolve this omission by attaching a timeline to the negotiations or, once they are completed, attaching an immediate timeline at that point.</p><p>In specific terms, the Bill will expand free GP care to children aged under 12 and for those aged over 70 who are eligible.  Of course that is a good thing.</p><p>The issue of the national health service as a necessity has become a part of the national debate around the provision of healthcare across the entire island.  In last year's alternative to the budget, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed two free GP visits for everyone without a GP or medical card, as well as a medical card entitlement for all of those who are suffering from cancer.  Our manifesto for the February election, which the Minister will remember saw Sinn F&eacute;in become the largest party in the State, committed to delivering free GP care over the term of a Government, commencing with our alternative budget measures.  In the meantime, let the Minister sort out the timeline for funding of this Bill.  These are manageable tasks for him and well within his remit.  I ask the Minister if that is something he will do because that is the question to which people want answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-24a.204" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072400002#KKK00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well in his new role.  This is the first Bill he has brought to this House, and what a Bill it is.  It is welcome to see this Bill before the Seanad and the Labour Party and I will be supporting it.  We will be doing so because the Labour Party has a long-standing commitment to free and accessible healthcare.  We will be supporting it because we believe, as a party, that healthcare is a human right and should not only be expanded to those under the age of eight, 12 or 18, but to the whole population.  We have seen the benefit of universal access to free GP care for those experiencing symptoms at the height of the Covid-19 crisis.  We now know, more than ever, that free GP care is a crucial cornerstone of our health system.  Money should be no barrier to seeing a doctor and nowhere is that more true than in the case of our children.  Parents, regardless of income, should never be faced with a choice of whether to postpone or defer a trip to the doctor for want of cash in hand.</p> <p>It is worth looking to the British National Health Service and its architect, Nye Bevan.  When he founded the health service, he said that no society should call itself civilised if a sick person is denied medical aid for lack of means.  I am sure that all of us in this Chamber would agree with that.</p> <p>It is important to say that this Bill is welcome but must be the first step in rolling out universal access to primary care across this country.  The reality is that this country stands shamefully apart from almost every other country within the developed world in rationing access to primary healthcare.  We have a fully public system and universal access to our hospital or acute system of care.  It does not feel like that at times because of the length of the waiting lists but there is universal access to hospital care.  However, we have a semi-private system of access to primary care in this country.  Over recent months, we have been listening to the pronouncements of the World Health Organization and its recommendations with regard to the pandemic.  It is important to state that one of the WHO's key recommendations to health systems across the world is that there should be equity of access to all parts of health services.  We do not have that.  Ireland is the only country in the European Union that does not offer free primary care at the point of access for all persons, regardless of age.</p> <p>I welcome this long overdue Bill.  It is important to say that this journey began not in the lifetime of the current Government, as has been said, nor in the lifetime of the previous Government, but in that of the Government before that.  At that time, the former Minister of State and my party colleague, Kathleen Lynch, secured access to free GP care for children under the age of six.  It is also important to note and remind Senators that the move was not universally popular.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Members from parties within this Chamber opposed that move.  They said it was unnecessary, that it was not the right use of scarce resources and that it would be too expensive.  However, the then Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, persevered and every family across the country would now say that opening up free access to GP care to under-sixes was an important and good initiative.</p><p>My concern with this Bill is the timing of the implementation and the three phases of the extension of free GP care to children aged eight, ten and then 12 years.  The Minister said that there was good reason for the phased implementation and that it would overwhelm the health system if we were to introduce it in one go.  I judge a policy based on the evidence that is available and I ask the Minister to publish the evidence, which may or may not be available, of how the public health system would be overwhelmed if the Government were to implement this in one go.  It did not seem GPs were overwhelmed in 2015.  In fact, when I talk to GPs now, they tell me that most of the pressure comes when children are about to turn six because parents turn up about a month before that birthday and ask the GPs to look at them while they are still able to access the free GP care.  That is when the point of pressure occurs, not when the care becomes available.  We need to see that evidence because there is no point just saying that this is going to overwhelm the public health system when I and many others believe that it will not.</p><p>I appeal to those of us across the Chamber who have had the benefit of free GP care.  I have three small children who have benefitted from it and there are a number of other young parents in this Chamber who have similarly benefitted.  I appeal to them to ask the Minister to roll this out immediately and to take up Senator Conway's point about immediate implementation.  The Minister has seen, albeit from the Opposition, what can be done in the Department of Health when there is willingness, particularly in the context of the changes that have taken place in recent months.  We were told such changes were too big to happen, that they needed time and careful consideration but they were made happen.  I ask the Minister to give urgent consideration to rolling out the implementation of free GP care to children under 12 years immediately.  He should also do the same for people over 70 because we are facing into a winter of huge uncertainty and we do not need to be adding to the concerns of those over 70 who are currently relying on the free GP visit card, who are worried about being able to pay for prescriptions or accessing nursing homes.  If the Minister were to act now and extend the thresholds, they would benefit from the medical card this winter. </p></speech>

I welcome the Minister to the House.  We in the Civil Engagement Group support this Bill, although we feel it is a little rushed.  I will make some points around the inequalities that still exist when it comes to health in Ireland today.  I hope we will soon see the implementation of other vitally important elements of Sl&aacute;intecare, including mental health and prenatal mental health services.   As a young woman who has just had a baby and who has suffered from postnatal depression, I can categorically tell the Minister that the services for women going through prenatal depression are invisible, especially for women at the very end of Irish society.  Our system continues to underperform around maternity care for women in Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We cannot have anything less than full national implementation of the maternity strategy, which is still chronically underfunded.  We are looking for better services and prenatal supports, including health, better development in midwifery, breastfeeding, parenting, and all the supports that go with having a baby and which are needed after having a child.  </p><p>As a Traveller woman, I note that Traveller women live 12 years less than women in the general population, while Traveller men live 15 years less than men in the general population.  Many chronic issues impact on vulnerable groups in Irish society, not only in the Traveller community but also those at the very end of society, such as working-class people, refugees and migrants.  We are also looking for equal access to these services and ask that every child and community will have equal access to them.  I fully support this Bill.  I hope we will see the Minister in the coming months and that we will be able to tease out some further policies and Bills for those at the very end of Irish society. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-24a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072400002#MMM00200"><p>As my colleague said, it is a pity that we cannot debate this Bill in a bit more detail, not because anybody opposes it but because many of us have ideas about medical cards and how they operate and this would have been a great opportunity to address them.  Having sat on the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I know that people have many concerns and fears around losing their medical card or GP card in respect of different employment.  That is a huge area that could be worked on.  Senator Conway spoke about the medical card being attached to other essential services on which people depend, and the concerns around that.  In the normal course of events, we would have had the opportunity to suggest some additions to the Bill to the Minister.  Nonetheless, we support the Bill.  It is important and does good work.  It is in line with Sl&aacute;intecare, but as Senator Sherlock noted, it also follows what the World Health Organization tells us about equality of access.  It is also in line with the Inter-Parliamentary Union's revolutionary motion last year on universal healthcare as a global commitment from parliaments and the idea of universal access.</p> <p>Primary care in the general sense is one part of universal healthcare but it cannot simply be about an arrangement with GPs or doctors.  It must focus on primary care.  We talk about GPs being overwhelmed but one way we can prevent that is by putting in place more services to which GPs are gateways.  For example, if we had public diagnostic services, not necessarily always within hospitals but public ones that were accessible at a local level, people who were worried about something for a few months and were still having the symptoms three months later would be able to get a diagnosis earlier.  That would relieve pressure on GPs.  If we had related services, such as mental health and physiotherapy supports, in place, people would have another point of contact.  Such primary care is part of the Sl&aacute;intecare picture and that is why we are keen for that to move forward.</p> <p>I share other Senators' concerns about implementing this Bill slowly.  We need to implement it immediately because there is so much else that needs to be done.  We should not make this service conditional on resources.  We know the financial reality of where we are and Ireland can borrow money to do what we need to do to have a healthy population and a new generation that comes up healthy.  We know what we need to do and that we can access the resources to do it.  We certainly do not want this to be an add-on, or for some nine year olds or eight year olds to get the help they need while some do not.</p> <p>Others have focused on the six to eight year old age group, but inclusion of the ten to 13 group in the Bill is important and positive.  That shift from ten to 13 years old is important because that is when children are about to start secondary school and it is a huge transition point where GP care is important.  For example, children with disabilities must plan around and manage their disability or health conditions in a new environment or school and they need to have that GP care.  GPs do not just provide acute care, but handle chronic and ongoing conditions and all other parts of primary care.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why this is really important.  It will be a very difficult return to school for many children this year.  We have all seen those sad primary school graduation ceremonies before the pupils move on to secondary school.  It would be really good if this was ready in September for those children who are facing mental health difficulties and other challenges at this time.  It would be brilliant if in September, October or at some point this autumn, that support was put in place for children facing one of the most difficult transitions in their lives to date.  I urge the Minister to implement it.</p><p>It has been said that some people do not even have geographical access to GPs.  That is particularly the case in respect of reproductive healthcare.  Many GPs around the country still do not provide the reproductive healthcare services women need.  It is really important that is addressed so that women who rely on this card are able to access the services to which they are entitled.</p><p>I praise Ireland for something on which it and the UK have shown leadership, which is the provision of videoconferencing with GPs for those who need to access reproductive healthcare and abortion services.  That was really useful and positive.  I know that other European countries have looked at that when trying to ensure emergency access to GP visits in a time of crisis.  I praise Ireland in respect of that video access.</p><p>I look forward to more engagement with the Minister and congratulate him warmly on his appointment.  I am sure we will talk again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-24a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072400002#NNN00200"><p>I may not need a full eight minutes.  I congratulate the Minister.  He has an onerous task ahead of him so he had better roll up his sleeves.  His role is a poisoned chalice which has been passed around over the years.  Luckily, he has some good connections with Clare so we will do all we can for him.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill.  There are some very interesting and useful things in it.  It will be really good for children in general and the increased threshold for those over 70 is good.  A really important idea which the Department of Health and the new Minister need to consider is that of prevention rather than cure which not only saves the State loads of money but leads to people feeling happier and healthier, both physically and mentally.  We have seen this during the Covid crisis.  Many people discovered nature, walking and cycling and this made them feel happier in themselves.  That has been wanting for a long time.</p> <p>I have worked full-time on behavioural change with respect to sustainable transport with the Green-Schools programme and I have often struggled when working outside of schools because of the lack of access to any safe facilities, even a 500 m stretch of safe road.  I encourage the Minister to work with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Education and Skills in this regard.  It is really important that physical education be maintained in the curriculum right up to the leaving certificate.  People need to be physically active at all ages, no matter how many exams they are doing and how important those exams are.</p> <p>Since I have the Minister's ear, I will also state my deep concerns on the low rate of breastfeeding in this country.  We have the lowest rate of breastfeeding in Europe and the highest rates of caesarean sections.  A caesarean section is a traumatic major surgery.  It is not what one wants to be dealing with having just become a mother, whether for the first time or having had children before.  We really need to look at that.  It is not a great start to life.  Many of my friends and family members have had caesarean sections.  Having been forced into major surgery makes it much more difficult to care for a newborn.  The Minister should look at those figures and try to determine why this is happening and why the rate of breastfeeding is so low.  When we know what is happening, we can look at solutions.</p> <p>I have a 21 year old myself but I do look at the lack of funding for mental health services for secondary school students.  Much of the provision of such services has been left to charities.  I have been raising funds for many causes for years but I sometimes feel we are raising funds for services that should be provided by the State.  There is a family resource centre in my local area which is seriously struggling to meet the demand for mental health services subsidised by the State because private mental health services can often cost &euro;50, &euro;60 or &euro;70 an hour.  That is outrageously exclusive.  I ask the Minister to look at the area of mental health very seriously.  We should move towards including mental health in the curriculum and the induction process into first year of secondary school so that young people, and old people, will have the tools to manage their mental health in a preventative way rather than only being given help when it is nearly too late or sometimes is.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Mental and physical health cannot be separated from one another.  I come from a very rural area and we have serious problems in attracting GPs.  Dr. Gerald Wheeler was my GP for the past 40 years.  He is 71 and wanted to retire but could not.  He would not do it because there was no one to take his place.  He worked all through the Covid crisis.  I have to mention him because he is now finally retiring.  GPs should not, however, be forced into those situations.  Having given more than 50 years of their lives to medicine, they should not be trapped working forever because we have not solved the GP issue, especially in rural areas.  GPs also need supports because more and more people are presenting to them with mental health issues.  GPs cannot always refer them on.  Mental health problems are an acute issue, like a broken arm or a broken leg; one does not put the patient on a waiting list for a year and a half.  He or she needs help urgently.  Mental health problems have to be seen as an emergency issue.  I wish the Minister the best of luck.</p></speech>

There is not much point in repeating much of what has already been said.  First, I give the Minister my sincere good wishes.  He has great enthusiasm for the job.  They say nobody wants the job of Minister for Health.  When in opposition, he was always enthusiastic and listened to people's point of view.  He came up with some very good suggestions.  Every minister for health in the world faces a major challenge at the moment in respect of the pandemic.  We should remember that the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Harris, who I am sure have worries in their own lives, also have to worry about a whole population.  They have had to explain why we need to stay the course and why we need to be careful.  I want to acknowledge that here today.  Being the Minister for Health is a challenging job in ordinary times but it is now very challenging.</p> <p>I very much welcome the Bill.  Section 2 increases the income limits for medical card eligibility for those over 70.  For a couple this limit will be increased to &euro;1,050 and for a single person it will increase from &euro;500 to &euro;550.  I know from experience how often people who are just slightly over the limit will come to a public representative's clinic.  Regardless of what one does, one cannot get their cases over the line.  Staff in the medical card section are good at helping to get people across the line in special circumstances but on so many occasions people who desperately need the card cannot get it.  I welcome this increase very much.  I am sure the public will also welcome it.</p> <p>Sections 4 to 6, inclusive, make changes in respect of free GP care for children.  Again, when parents have to take a child to a doctor and then go to a chemist, &euro;100 can go very quickly.  Our children are teenagers now; they are not babies any more.  We are thankful that we did not have to spend a lot of time running back and forth to doctors but these costs were significant in the past for parents, particularly lone parents, who were not eligible for medical cards.  It is a very good progression and very welcome.</p> <p>There are great challenges in the health sector for the Minister and for all politicians.  The Minister has been very honest in saying that everything will not happen overnight.  Like most people here, however, I hope we will be able to progress some of it pretty quickly and make some changes the public will welcome at a time when they are seriously challenged in many ways.</p> <p>We have an ageing population.  It is great to see people living longer and having a good quality of life.  There is no doubt that, although we often criticise the health service, there is a better quality of life in Ireland in many ways.  That is proven by the fact that people are living longer.  Naturally enough, however, when people live longer, they will develop some ailments and will need more assistance and care.  People's GPs are so important to them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned her father and the GP practice in the house.  Indeed, I can remember in my town of Strokestown one went to the doctor's house and there was a waiting room in the house off the surgery.  That is all changed nowadays but there is that important link between the GP and the patients.  For people, such as my mother and her friends, their visit to the GP when something is wrong is so important to them.  They have such faith and belief in the GP and always feel comforted by him or her when they make that visit.</p><p>I wish the Minister well.  It is great to have him bringing this Bill before the House.  As I stated earlier, I would love to see some of it progressing as quickly as possible but I still acknowledge and admire the fact that he has stated it will be introduced in phases.  I accept that.  The Minister is being honest and upfront about that.  It is very important because sometimes ministerial announcements are made and nothing happens for a long time.  The Minister is pointing out that there will be a phased development and even though we want the legislation implemented as quickly as possible, I acknowledge his honesty in the debate on that.</p></speech>

It is a daunting task to take on at any time, but particularly at this time, and I admire thus far how he has carried out the role and his presentation of the Bill, which I very much welcome.</p> <p>As Senator Murphy said, the GP relationship is such an extraordinary one of trust, and possibly one of the last bastions of our society that is standing and held up in such great esteem.</p> <p>I believe access to GP care is a fundamental right.  That is my position, full stop, from a just society perspective.  I am very excited about the trajectory that we are on with Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is an extraordinary journey and I look forward to a day when we have universal healthcare.</p> <p>I am one of these parents.  I have a five year old.  It has been an extraordinary journey with her that we have always access.  In my experience from constituency work, the feedback is that a floodgate did not open when under sixes were allowed free access to GP care and, consequently, I do not believe that.  However, I accept we are in extraordinary times.  I respect the Minister's position on that but urge him to give us an idea of timelines as quickly as he can.</p> <p>On access, reflecting the Minister's positive words, early intervention and tackling inequality are fundamentally what this is about.  In that regard, we have had a time when doctors and nurses have respond to Ireland's call.  If we could keep them at home, not have them emigrate and create the jobs and the positions for them in the here and now, that would be fantastic.  I urge the Minister to do that.  That would assist in making sure that we have the supply of staff and healthcare professionals for early intervention and tackling inequality.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan referred to facilities for cluster care.  My party has called that the primary care centre and has had great joy in rolling that out.  It is a long-held cherished policy and one that has had support across both Houses.  No doubt the Minister will also support that.  That policy continues to be implemented so that we have primary care centres and we can roll them out as much as possible as the first point of contact with the healthcare service so that it is as close to the community as possible, keeps people out of hospital unnecessarily, can have a diversity and multifaceted response to people's health, and reduce waiting list and hospital waiting times.</p> <p>We have two primary care centres - one planned and one nearly finished - in the constituency of Dublin South-Central.  The first is the Rialto primary care centre on the South Circular Road.  I am delighted that it was designated by the HSE as a Covid-19 triage centre.  It received a special dispensation and works continued throughout the lockdown.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It looks, from the outside, good to go or virtually good to go.  I would welcome an update from the Minister, although not today as I do not mean to catch the Minister on the hop.  At some point, I would welcome an update on when that will be opened.</p><p>The second issue is the primary healthcare centre planned for Drimnagh.  In that regard, I have written to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.  The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, will be on to the Minister on my behalf as well because I am nagging him.  I am seeking an update on that, if at all possible, and whether and to what extent the scheduled commencement of that project has been delayed by the obvious health crisis.  In December last, the then Minister of State, Catherine Byrne, and the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Harris, went out and confirmed the green light on that project that a new primary healthcare centre was going in on the site of the Mother McAuley Centre and the Alzheimer's centre, and it was to go on the same site in Drimnagh.  At the time the HSE capital plan funding was in place to begin it, it was to be a new building on that Catherine McAuley site.  There is fantastic work already ongoing in there for the local community.  The project was supposed to go to final design this year with construction starting in 2021.  I would appreciate the Minister's feedback on that project.</p><p>I wish the Minister the very best and thank him.</p></speech>

Like my colleagues here in the Chamber, I will be supporting the Bill.  There is broad support for this Bill here today.</p> <p>I would like to raise something outside of this Bill.  I appreciate the brief that Deputy Donnelly has got at this time, the humongous task that he has ahead of him and the pandemic times that we are living in but I want him to be remembered as the man who did something with the health services in this country.  I want Deputy Donnelly to take that out of here today.  I want Deputy Donnelly to be the leader that we all need him to be to reform the health services of this country.  I want Deputy Donnelly to be the leader who will not have the terminally-ill people of this country begging for a medical card.  I want him to be the leader who will not have our children with scoliosis waiting for years to have operations.  I want him to be the leader who will not have the elderly dying on trolleys in our hospitals.  I ask Deputy Donnelly to be that leader.  I will do whatever I can to help Deputy Donnelly.  I do not know what it is that I can do to help him but that is what I want from him.  I want Deputy Donnelly to reform that health service.</p> <p>I want Deputy Donnelly to be the leader who will champion women's health.  People cannot get bowel cancer screening and breast screening now until September.  That is wrong on so many levels.  We have not even come out of the cervical cancer crisis.  That has been the biggest scandal in this State.  I ask the Minister to not let that happen to the women of the State.  They are the future mothers of the generations to come.  I ask the Minister to look after them.</p> <p>I wish Deputy Donnelly the very best.  I want him to be the leader who will lead the health service out of the horrible hole that it is in at this time.  There are some fantastic people working in that service and I commend them for that.  I beg Deputy Donnelly to be the best Minister for Health this country has ever seen and I wish him well in his portfolio.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him the very best in his difficult position.  I very much welcome this Bill to the House.  It marks another step in trying to achieve the Sl&aacute;intecare principle of universal access to care at low cost or no cost.</p> <p>It is a great sign of the way this Government is going when one of its first Bills through the House is to extend access to healthcare.  Families all over the country struggle day in and day out.  I know that.  I was glad on a number of occasions over the past number of years that there was free GP care for under fives.  I have four children and there can be situations when they all get sick and drop like dominos and one spends a few weeks or a month in and out of the doctors' waiting rooms.  That can put a family under serious financial pressure.  One could have two or three children in that situation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That would cost &euro;150, and there could be the cost of antibiotics on top of that as well.</p><p>This Bill means that families do not have to take a chance on whether their children will be okay.  They do not need to make the decision on whether to spend less on groceries this week or bring a child to a doctor.  Too many squeezed families make such decisions every week and, therefore, I am glad to welcome this phased extension of free GP care for children, which will ensure that they do not have to make them.  I also welcome the income limit extension for the over 70s.  Many pensioners are struggling with the cost of living, which is on the increase even though their incomes are not.  This will be a welcome respite for many.</p><p>As many Senators have mentioned, GPs are under pressure.  Anyone who attends a GP's surgery knows that it will be an overstretched service and that he or she may need to wait for days just to get an appointment and, after getting one, wait in line for an hour and a half.  I hope that we can work to support GPs in the lifetime of this Government and increase their capacity.</p><p>I welcome the Bill, but I would like its provisions to be implemented sooner rather than later, although that is a bit selfish.  I look forward to seeing how the Minister progresses Sl&aacute;intecare in his term in office and how he works with GPs to ensure we have a functional and effective primary healthcare system.</p></speech>

I wish him the best in his new role in what remains a challenging time for the country in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill, which seeks to expand on a phased basis eligibility for free GP care for children aged under 13 and to increase the income limits for persons aged 70 and over from &euro;500 to &euro;550 for a single person and from &euro;900 to &euro;1,050 for a couple.</p> <p>My party and the Minister's have been strong supporters of the roll-out of free GP care for some time.  As alluded to by my colleague, since 2015 when the current T&aacute;naiste was Minister for Health, all children under six years of age have been automatically entitled to free GP visit cards along with periodic health assessments and access to the asthma cycle of care programme.  In the past, we have received criticism from some quarters for the universal aspect of that provision.  People have said that those who can pay should pay.  I believe the Minister will agree that misses the point.  The whole point of the measure's universal nature is that a family with a sick child can attend a GP without having to fork out &euro;50 or &euro;60 just to see the GP.  It also gives families a return on the taxes they pay.</p> <p>The Minister referenced an interesting statistic, one that not many people will know.  Since 1 June, just shy of 2.1 million people in the State, or 42.6% of the population, have had access to free GP care.  It is a significant number, but I do not remember it being acknowledged in the media or by Opposition parties.  I look forward to that provision being expanded over time.  The changes that we are bringing about with this legislation will benefit an additional 300,000 children in three phases, focusing first on six and seven year olds and then moving to eight and nine year olds before moving to ten, 11 and 12 year olds.  It should be noted that 195,000 children in the six to 12 age bracket already receive free GP care at the point of access.</p> <p>It is estimated that 56,000 persons aged over 70 will be eligible due to the increased medical card income thresholds being introduced in the Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a significant change.  As the Minister rightly stated, many of our older people will face increasing health issues as they get older.  Given that this requires costly medication, a full medical card is more beneficial for them than the GP card.</p><p>I wholeheartedly endorse the Bill.  It will ensure that our parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and neighbours will qualify for full medical cards, but I ask that the Minister keep the income thresholds under review.  We cannot allow another six years to pass before the limits are addressed again.  Perhaps the thresholds could be reviewed on a 12 or 18-month basis.</p><p>I reiterate my best wishes for the Minister.  If the Cathaoirleach allows, I will ask the Minister that, when Covid passes, he take the opportunity to visit my constituency of Waterford to open formally some of the fantastic health facilities that have been completed in recent months - the Dunmore wing in University Hospital Waterford, St. Patrick's community hospital and the primary care centre on the grounds of St. Otteran's Hospital.  He would be more than welcome and we would like the opportunity to speak to him about other health issues, which have already been raised with him, in particular cardiac care for the south east.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-24a.221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072400002#SSS00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  I congratulate him on his role and wish him the best.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Bill, which will achieve two objectives, the first of which is the expansion of GP care without charge to children and young people.  The Bill contains provisions to extend and expand this important benefit to children under eight years of age, under ten years of age and under 13 years of age on a phased basis.  Second, the Bill will fulfil an important budget commitment to increase the weekly income limit for older people when applying for a medical card from &euro;500 to &euro;550 for a single person and from &euro;900 to &euro;1,050 for a couple.  Both commitments were agreed by the previous Government and the decision to continue with them is welcome.  The Bill is an important next step in the introduction of universal GP care, which is a recommendation of the all-party Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p> <p>The briefing notes that I have been provided by officials describe the health system as providing for two categories of eligibility - full eligibility, that being, medical card holders, and limited eligibility, that being, all others.  The description in the Oireachtas Library and Research Service's paper on the Bill that says there are two categories - those with a medical card and those without one - is more appropriate.  Every Oireachtas Member and councillor has spent time on healthcare issues, including medical card and GP visit card applications for constituents.  Each of us has experienced cases where a person or family has been refused one card or the other despite experiencing genuine and evident difficulties.  One goes around the houses trying to get information and letters from doctors and consultants, which are sometimes just one-liners and not appropriate in terms of expressing what the patient or family needs.  These are important issues for people.  As colleagues have stated, additional benefits derive from the medical card, or the miracle card as some people have called it.</p> <p>We all should know that early intervention in medical problems is essential.  It is next only to the pursuit of a healthy lifestyle.  The real challenge for us as legislators and for wider society is deciding how to ensure the provision of timely and appropriate healthcare as and when it is needed.  We made progress in recent years under Fine Gael-led Governments.  This should be recognised.  Free GP care was provided to children under six years of age, to all older people aged 70 years and over and to all children with disabilities and their carers.</p> <p>Free GP care helps to ensure that children, older people and those with disabilities can access healthcare so as to achieve the best outcomes.  Furthermore, it reduces pressure and worry on parents and guardians as well as older people on fixed incomes.  However, we cannot ignore the serious challenges facing us.  These include the cost of free GP care and the capacity of the GP system.  There seem to be different views in the House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That may be geographical.  It may be based on people's real experiences.  While some people may say genuinely they do not feel there are capacity problems in their constituency, town or locality, other people may say there are genuine problems.</p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform last year indicated that the expansion of free GP care to all children under the age of 13 would cost &euro;50 million per year, which is not much in the context of some of the moneys that have been spent recently.  In addition, the increase in income limits for medical card assessments for people aged 70 or older would cost an additional &euro;30 million per annum.  From the additional funding needed for these two measures, the substantial additional investment that will be needed to introduce universal GP care becomes clear.  That is obviously where we want to be able to move to, but the move has to be incremental because the costs are somewhat prohibitive if large leaps are taken on eligibility.</p><p>The primary care reimbursement service, through which medical cards, GP visit cards and other GP services are fulfilled, was allocated &euro;2.9 billion in budget 2020, a substantial portion of the health budget.  The budget for primary care was &euro;1.08 billion.  We need to continue to direct more funding to primary care on the basis that it improves overall outcomes and represents the most sensible expenditure of public money.</p><p>The second major challenge is capacity, as I have said.  While the number of people training to become GPs has increased in recent years, which is very welcome and encouraging, the general GP workforce is getting older, with retirements impacting the level of service, particularly in rural areas.  Our population is increasing and our people are, thankfully, living longer.  However, these facts place additional pressure on GP services across the country.  Moreover, the policy decisions, welcome as they are, to increase free GP care invariably increase the number of people visiting GPs, although, again, I have heard different opinions on that here.  That is certainly what has been relayed to me in my area.</p><p>Finally, the out-of-hours services provided by GPs are also very important and are under pressure.  Westdoc in Galway is an excellent service but is under severe pressure in areas such as Moycullen and Oughterard, for example.  Local doctors work on a rota basis to provide out-of-hours cover but they are doing so more frequently and more regularly.  Westdoc needs additional resources to allow it to expand, something I raised with the Minister's predecessor and which perhaps the Minister may be able to influence over the coming year.</p></speech>

Objectively, and to give credit where credit is due, as an Opposition spokesperson he won the confidence of people on the front line, not only his supporters.  They believe in Stephen Donnelly.  They believe he understands the intricacies and challenges and they are backing the Minister to make a difference.</p> <p>In the past we have had not so much false dawns as perhaps the tying of hands.  Today we are faced with a Bill on free access to universal healthcare.  Who in their right mind would not support that?  I will not engage in repetition where my fellow Senators have covered ground, but in essence we are expanding access to GPs and the healthcare system for more children on a phased basis.  I am just concerned that this is almost like a parallel universe.  As we strive in unanimity to reach that laudable, noble goal, the promised land of Sl&aacute;intecare, access for all, what does the Minister say to the children who cannot afford access and who have been waiting years for vital intervention?  Do we say it is only &euro;50 million to do more?  We would all love to do it, yet children are being left behind as we relentlessly do our best to get to where we would all like to be.  We therefore expand access to GPs.  Is the Minister aware that many of them are overworked, understaffed and swamped with patients they can hardly cope with?  Our brightest and youngest run abroad as soon as they qualify and do not come back.  We cannot bring consultants back into this country.  I put down that warning today.  I am not getting carried away.  I support the Bill.  There is, however, a large bell ringing in the back of the room.  The challenge is how the Minister strikes that balance.  What is his prioritisation for vulnerable children?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P. Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=VincentPMartin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This will give children whose parents are millionaires access.  That is great because perhaps they would not have gone otherwise.  We should get all the sociological studies on that.  Who would not welcome as much access as possible for everyone?  However, this comes at a time when our system is under massive pressure and when many in the profession feel they will not get the commensurate support to deliver and roll out this service.  What does the Minister say to the people who will make this happen, who make the magic happen?  We are the legislators and we can provide for today, but what support does the Minister have for those on the front line?  The support provided in the context of Covid has left a lot to be desired.  These people were on the front line.  The advice was to contact one's GP.  It was several weeks before we were told to phone the GP, not just to rock up to his or her surgery.  We had a minute's silence in this House for the latest healthcare professional to lose his life protecting and caring for us.  Where was the healthcare and personal protective equipment for our doctors?  It came very late for some of them.</p><p>I have hope as the Minister starts on this challenge.  He excelled in opposition, and it is not every Opposition spokesperson who immediately gets the first available opportunity to step into the shoes of the outgoing Minister and translate words into action.  Now the country is looking at the Minister and wishing him well on his journey.  I know that what I have said might not have come as news to him.  I would love to know how he will balance this and square this circle - this major contradiction - as we strive at the pace we are striving.  As Senator Keogan said, and I am glad she did, it is not a pretty picture.  There are children who have been waiting years.  The Minister cannot turn back the clock.  They are being deprived of essential intervention, and they only get one childhood.  There are adults who have been waiting years as well.  As a result, I will be reserved in the context of my welcome for the Bill until such time as the Minister has ensured greater, fairer, more accessible balance and roll-out of the services whereby everyone will be treated equally.</p></speech>

Everyone across the country is wishing him well for the coming months.  It is important to acknowledge the welcome news about Covid-19 and the reduction in the R-nought number.  It might be early stages yet, but this shows that the cautious approach the Minister recommended to Cabinet last week was correct.  That will be judged again come 10 August, but the signs are improving and that brings confidence among the public that the measures and the cautious approach they are taking is working.  There was a growing sense - I am sure the Minister got it in recent weeks - of a little pessimism that a second wave was almost inevitable no matter what we did, but the numbers over the past two days show the impact we can have in fighting this virus.</p> <p>I am not as cautious as my colleague, Senator Martin.  I fully support the Bill.  It is very welcome and continues on from progress that was made before this Government was formed.  I am particularly pleased with section 2, which seeks to increase the limits for those aged 70 and older from &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple.  I think every public representative has come across cases of people being at &euro;920, &euro;925 or just barely over the rate who have totally missed out.  Obviously, that will happen if we increase the rate to &euro;1,050, but it is a large increase.  I agree with some of my colleagues that it should be reviewed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As Senator Cummins said, that should be reviewed more regularly than every six years.  However, it is encouraging to see and it brings a certain level of comfort to people who need it.  </p><p>It is encouraging to note, in sections 4 to 6, inclusive, the extension of free GP care, which is currently available to children under the age of five, to those aged six and seven in the first instance, with a possible phased extension to children under the age of 12.  These measures will bring approximately 300,000 additional children into the system.  That is to be welcomed but the key is to bring that in as quickly as possible.  I know the Minister has challenges in his Department but that one is vital.  Through my experience of the health service since the birth of my first child six months ago, I have witnessed at first hand the talent we have in the health service, from maternity care to aftercare.  The policies we have brought forward for GP care provide reassurance that if anything happens to a child of that age, money is not a barrier to helping the child. </p><p>A week or two ago I was contacted by a mother who was hesitant to bring her daughter who was quite ill to the GP, essentially because of cost.  She did not realise at the time that, because of the age of the child, she was entitled to free GP care.  It subsequently transpired that the child has a long-term illness but it is manageable.  If we are introducing these measures, it is important to get the message out about them as quickly as possible.  I am sure the Department will highlight as much as possible that free GP care is available for these children.</p><p>I fully endorse the legislation.  As the first Bill the Minister has brought to the House, it is very good and I wish him well with it.</p><p>If I may, I will make a point on a local issue in Tipperary, on which I am aware the Minister has spoken previously.  St. Brigid's respite and palliative care facility in Carrick-on-Suir, like many facilities across the country, is being used as a step-down facility for recovering Covid-19 patients.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Harris, gave an assurance that it would return to its original use after the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many people in Carrick-on-Suir are concerned about when that will happen.  I know that question is almost impossible to answer because it depends on the progression of Covid-19.  I have been working closely with a local councillor in the area, Councillor Mark Fitzgerald, to try to give as much reassurance as possible but it would be much appreciated if the Minister could give a reassurance that the facility will return to its original purpose.  Very good people work in the facility.  People in the town and local area understand the need for it.  I would be grateful if the Minister could respond on that.  I support the Bill.</p></speech>

He is no longer the Joe Brolly of Irish politics; he is now the manager.  The punditry is over and I wish him every success.  As a former chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I assure him that the playing field is one he will be well able for.</p> <p>I am struck by the revisionist comments made by some of my colleagues and friends in the House.  I remind Members that it was the former Minister, Dr. James Reilly, under the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, and the two Ministers for Health in the subsequent Government, Deputies Leo Varadkar and Simon Harris, who started us on the trajectory of universal health care.  It was not just one party.  The partitionist approach to politics around health always baffles me.  This is about people, north, south, east and west, and accessibility.  It is not about what is in the p&oacute;ca; it is about what we need to get done.  That is what this Bill is about.  It is about accessibility.</p> <p>Previous speakers referred to the Minister's legacy.  If he tackles the structural problems in the health service rather than taking a short-term, populist approach to trolley numbers or the latest crisis, he will leave an indelible mark on health.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is about what he is doing today, which is long-term prevention.  It is about building capacity and measures that are taking on the vested interests in terms of real reform in our health service.  Unlike others who commentated, at least the Minister had the courage to say that he wanted to be the Minister.  He is now the Minister, and I commend him for that.  Others will take the "We know everything but we will not go into government" approach, but health needs reform.  When he was Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on health, he was cautious about this approach in terms of accessibility.  He needs to continue to bring GPs and the medical community with him because as Senator Martin said, they are faoi bhr&uacute; - under pressure.  Numbers attending GP practices are increasing.  For once and for all, we need to tackle this time immemorial issue of our best and brightest students leaving this country.  I chaired a health committee at a time when the then Minister, James Reilly, had a trajectory in terms of placement and jobs but we must make sure that we can put the structure of that in place.</p><p>I remind the Members in the House that last year's budget contained the highest health budget in the history of the State at &euro;17 billion.  That was put in place by the previous Government prior to the pandemic.  It is now up to approximately &euro;20 million.</p><p>I welcome the intergenerational aspect of this Bill in terms of the amendment that provides for an increase to the medical card income levels for persons aged 70 or older to &euro;550 for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a married couple.  I welcome also the provision for access to GP care for every child under the age of 12.  A Member mentioned earlier the extension of access to children under the age of six.  That is a critical age group, and I welcome that.  Every child needs access to healthcare.  Early intervention is what we should be doing, whether it is in education or in health.</p><p>I have to be honest with the Minister.  Like Senator Martin, I am sceptical about Sl&aacute;intecare.  I ask him to consider a constitutional convention or citizens' assembly to look at that issue away from this political amphitheatre.</p></speech>

I know the D&aacute;il and the Seanad are the people's assembly but as a former member of the Constitutional Convention, I ask the Minister to consider taking a citizens' assembly approach to universal healthcare because we need more GPs.  Senator Kyne referenced the out-of-hours service in Galway.  The Minister needs to look at SouthDoc, in Cork, and we need to ensure that we continue the out-of-hours service.  The principle of universal healthcare is one all of us subscribe to and want.  I am concerned that, in terms of Sl&aacute;intecare, we will not get the buy-in.  It is about capacity, resourcing, costings and timelines.  I will not be parochial but I will talk to the Minister again about the need for the new hospital in Cork.  I wish him every success.</p></speech>

I thank the Senators for their valuable contributions.  I have taken many notes, as have my officials.  It has been a thoughtful and important debate, both on the Bill before us and on the issues surrounding the Bill.  The Senators' keen support and observations are very helpful, and we will keep them in mind.  As Senator Higgins said, it would have been nice to have had input into the Bill as the debate proceeded but we are compressing it.  Nonetheless, the Bill has an implementation aspect to it and the various contributions will be kept in mind during the implementation phase.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The two measures are very important.

I thank Members for their support for the Bill and what it is trying to do.</p> <p>I have taken a lot of notes and I apologise in advance as inevitably, I will not be able to speak to all the points raised.  Some were local.  Myself or the team will revert to Senators with updates.  </p> <p>Regarding Covid, public health officials have been increasingly worried over the past five weeks.  The number of new cases per week was climbing considerably.  A key number they look at is the cumulative number of cases in the previous two weeks per 100,000 population.  Ireland was down to nine and that climbed up to 22 and was continuing to rise.  An R-nought number of less than one means the virus is dying out in society and if it is much over one means that it is growing, while a little over 1 means that we are holding our own.  We had it below one and it began to grow again.  Approximately a week ago, their best estimate was between 1.2 and 1.8.  They calculate this in multiple ways and when the numbers are low in Ireland the range widens because it is harder to calculate given the rate is low.  That is why the Government decision was made to pause on phase four and introduce face masks on public transport and in retail outlets.  It is why we pushed very quickly to get the app launched.</p> <p>I have had long conversations with the acting Chief Medical Officer almost daily, including today and yesterday, about what happened in the past ten days.  NPHET met yesterday.  The good news is that things have stabilised in the last ten days.  Critically, the R-nought number has come down.  The latest estimate is between 0.7 and 1.4, with the best estimate at 1.1.  There were seven new cases yesterday.  Tragically, nine deaths were announced yesterday, which we mourn.  Eight had become unwell during previous weeks and months, while one was more recent.  Every death that can be avoided needs to be avoided.  It is an imperfect science, but the sense is that the improvements we have seen, the stabilisation in the past ten days, the reductions in the R-nought number and the number of new cases, is largely due to the response of the public.  We all remember that two weeks ago, there was a weekend when a relatively small number of people let loose and there was probably a week when people might have relaxed a little in following public health guidelines.  One cannot blame anyone, after everything the entire country has been through.  There was a big, positive response to that and public health officials made another big ask to everyone to wear face masks and comply with social distancing.  People reacted and yet again they are doing the right thing.  Even as we have opened up our society over the past ten days, things have stabilised.  The people who deserve credit for that are the Irish people for stepping back up.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not an easy thing to do.  That is very positive.  There has been much comment recently about travel, which is fair.  It is sorted out now and I hope the messaging is very clear.</p><p>There is something worth reflecting to the House.  I had a fantastic conversation with one of the top advisors at the WHO.  I asked him about Ireland and he could not have been more positive.  He said it was obvious to look at what was happening and what needed to improve but he said that we are doing an incredible job, with one of the lowest rates of the disease anywhere in the world.  He particularly singled out political solidarity.  He said when the WHO looks around the world at the things that are important and working, Ireland is not unique but unusual in the political solidarity that has been shown right from the start in February.  I was in opposition then and I and Deputies O'Reilly and Kelly and many others across the political spectrum got together and got the advice.  We - that is, I and those in Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties - disagreed, we brought things to each other and discussed them.  We had great access to the HSE and officials and things worked.</p><p>I wish to extend the same offer here as I did in the D&aacute;il earlier.  It is fair to say that in the past week or two some of the solidarity has slipped a little.  Some of the responsibility for that lies with me.  It may have been unavoidable with the change of Government but the level of political interaction probably slipped.  The briefings we all had stopped.  No decision was made about that and there was no intention, but I made an offer to the D&aacute;il earlier and say here that we need to get those conversations going again.  That is not to say that there should not be criticism.  The job of Members is to challenge, give ideas and call each other out, but I am making the offer that we should engage as much as possible and maintain the solidarity, because the public looks partly to us to see how we are leading.</p><p>It is important that we remember that, by international standards, we are doing incredibly well.  The Irish people have done and continue to do an extraordinary job.  The healthcare system has been incredible.  Have mistakes been made?  Absolutely, of course mistakes have been made, and we all know that.  However, what our healthcare professionals, the Department, the HSE, section 38 and 39 organisations, and communities throughout the country have done in stepping up and mobilising around this one threat and helping each other has been incredible.  We all remember the scenes in Italy and elsewhere where very sick people were being treated in the car parks of hospitals because their health systems were overwhelmed.  Even though our healthcare system was over capacity before Covid arrived here, it created the capacity and the surge was dealt with.  It is an enormous credit, first and foremost, to the people and families of Ireland, who stepped up, and to our healthcare professionals, some of whom lost their lives.  There was a funeral yesterday of a doctor who was a front-line worker on Covid who passed away.  They literally gave up their lives to keep us safe.  The solidarity from healthcare professionals, the public and across the political spectrum has been fantastic.  Sometimes we miss that we are doing really well.  It is hard and it will be bumpy, there will be more outbreaks and some will almost certainly be bigger than we would like, but we are doing well and need to bear that in mind.</p><p>On the Bill, many Senators have raised the issue of the timing.  I will deal with them separately.   The context of these and other measures outside the Bill which do not require legislation and which were in the budget for this year is that they were contingent on savings.  They had been agreed in the budget for this year but without new money.  They were contingent on the HSE saving money in other areas.  Obviously, that has not happened because of Covid.  Not only has it not happened, but on my second day as Minister, I had to ask the D&aacute;il for an additional &euro;2 billion, and told it I would be back for more.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The savings had not happened.  I need to ask for new money, which is obviously a difficult thing to do.  That is what is required when it comes to the issue of people over 70 years, and it is my intention to do that.  This is a decision of Government, as is any such decision requiring new money, and I will be pushing very hard for it.</p><p>The GP access is different because this is &euro;50 million in a full year, and as Senators Martin and Buttimer have said, there is a philosophical question with all of this, which is what is the best way to spend &euro;50 million?  Senator Keogan referred to scoliosis and various Senators have referred to medical cards for terminally ill people together with many other very important things.  The question for us all in health care is how we spend the money.  There is not, unfortunately, any right answer to that question. We are in a particularly tricky spot where our healthcare system is over capacity.  Before Covid-19 arrived, we had the longest waiting lists in Europe, the lowest number of hospital consultants, and the second lowest number of beds.  I am not attributing that to any political reason but it has happened over many years with different Governments.  What do we do?  Do we deploy the money on the trolley crisis, on scoliosis, on mental health, on maternity care or on free GP access?  There is no right answer to that question.</p><p>We are trying to do both at the same time, which is very difficult and costs a great deal of money.  Senator Buttimer raised the strategic question on the approach to all of this.  My approach is that we have three huge tasks to deal with at the same time.  The first is Covid-19, and we understand broadly what is involved in that.  The second is capacity and the resumption of services coupled with winter planning, and this is a massive task.  We started with the longest waiting list in Europe.  We have had a significant increase in those waiting lists because of the necessary pausing of elective care.  On top of that there is a huge unmet care need within the community.  Due to people not going into healthcare facilities as they normally would, there are many people who are sick and who should be on the waiting lists whom we do not know about and they do not know about it yet either.  They need to be added to the waiting lists.  On top of that, the HSE capacity is significantly reduced because of Covid-19.  I had a briefing from HSE this morning that said that its operating theatre and outpatient capacity will both be down by about 30% and its diagnostics will be down by about 50%.  We are taking a system that already did not have the capacity it needed and significantly reducing that capacity while adding significant demand to that, such as adding Covid-19, winter requirements and a significant domestic and global recession, all at the same time.</p><p>That is the second challenge, therefore, how we put a plan together to get the services back up and running immediately, deal with the waiting lists that are now even longer than they were, deal with the fact that winter is coming, and deal with the reduced capacity.  As soon as I was appointed I sat down with the Department and the HSE and said that we need to put both a winter plan and resumption of service plan together but not like any we have seen before.  This is not a question of looking at what happened last year and doing more or even twice as much of that.  Everything must be on the table.  The plan has been developed at the moment.  It needs to be comprehensive and is going to cost a great deal of money.  The challenge that we are faced with right now is immense.  I sat in this Chamber in December and January decrying the trolley lists.  This year, that simply cannot happen.  We cannot have 85 and 95 year old men and women on trolleys for three days.  We should not have anyway but certainly not in a Covid-19 world.  This is the second task which is a huge challenge, as I am sure all of the Members understand.</p><p>The third task is universal healthcare, which is the long-term vision piece, and it has three tests.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The third task is universal healthcare which is the long-term, vision piece and it has three tests.  Universal healthcare means that people get rapid access to consistently high quality care that is affordable.  We are trying to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and are advancing universal healthcare through this Bill, which is the Sl&aacute;intecare strategy at work.  At the same time we are putting a significant effort, which will require much resources, into dealing with the very serious capacity constraints that men, women and children are facing all over the country.  That is where we are at strategically.</p><p>I will mention maternity care which has been raised by a number of Senators.  This is something that I am going to be pushing very hard.  There is a brilliant maternity care strategy in place since 2016.  The first place I visited as Minister for Health was the Coombe Hospital, which was intentional on my part.  I wanted to visit somewhere which had maternity care and women&rsquo;s healthcare and serves a great many people from disadvantaged areas as well and wanted to make a point of going there first as a demonstration of what is required.  Maternity and women&rsquo;s health is something that is going to be very important to me and which I will prioritise in this Government.</p><p>Scoliosis was also mentioned.  I am going to meet Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland in Crumlin next week and I have been back and forth with the Scoliosis Advocacy Network and will be meeting it at some point after that to see what can be done to help.  There is no hierarchy of needs.  Everyone is as deserving as everyone else but this is an issue that I and many others have been very affected by.  I am going there next week to see what the Government can do to try to help.  The good news is that we have a new surgeon starting in the third quarter of this year which should be fantastic.  </p><p>Finally, on the Bill on GP capacity, the phasing of GP care for children is exactly to this end.  If we already had what was needed in the existing capacity and if general practice was saying to us that we are ready to go, give this to the children as we have the capacity, the ask I would be making then - whether I would get it or not - would be for &euro;50 million to allow us to do it now.  The GPs are very clearly saying now that we need to be careful and that we do not have the capacity.  They have stepped up incredibly during Covid-19, which we are still right in the middle of, and we are going to need our GPs like never before this winter.  What we are looking for to a great extent in the winter plan is how we keep people out of hospital.  Much of this is about giving GPs direct access to diagnostics that they do not have and to other care pathways and direct access for people with respiratory issues and so forth.  I am meeting the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, next week and we will be discussing these very issues.  Our approach is that we need to grow capacity in general practice which we want to do very quickly, and as that capacity grows we expand access at the same time.  That is the broad approach.  I wish that the capacity was there and we could do it all now but the very clear message from general practice is that the capacity is not there now.  Let us get the capacity in place.  We are going to be negotiating a new GP contract and rewiring many care pathways so that GPs have far more options than they have now where, in many cases, they have to refer people to an emergency department.  </p><p>I hope that covers at least some of the issues raised in the Bill and also the wider healthcare aspects.  I thank the Members.</p></speech>

It is a very challenging portfolio.  I am delighted that he has been able to outline that vision here, not just on the Covid-19 issue but on the vision for the future.  Given his experience before politics, he will need it all to take on what is and has always been one of the most challenging portfolios in any Government anywhere in the world.  I wish him all the very best in that and I know that everybody on all sides in this House and all of the Irish people are relying on him to try to deliver that plan and bring that vast experience from the private sector into this system.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">An Cathaoirleach:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is very complex but nonetheless the Irish people deserve a system, as the Minister has outlined, where everybody regardless of their circumstances will be able to access world class healthcare.

The reform of the HSE is going to be critical to his term as a Minister.  Mr. Paul Reid brought a certain dynamism to the role.  In the Minister's reply to us, he spoke about the challenges we face in a post-Covid world in terms of access to outpatients and elective treatment.  This where a constitutional convention or citizens' assembly around our health sector is important.  I do not want to delay the House but for me this is an important issue.  Health politics captures most Ministers.  It captures every person in the Houses.  Back bench Deputies and Senators are lobbied from here to wherever about everything, including big pharma, hospitals, local action groups, GPs or whatever.  I do not know that the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare committee fully grappled with what Sl&aacute;intecare could do.  The Minister might say I would be critical because Members of the Upper House were excluded from the committee but that is not the case.</p> <p>The constitutional convention approach would mean that we gather international experts from at home and abroad, North and South, to tackle the issue of health.  The Minister will find now that with &euro;17 billion divided into different silos, which is now &euro;20 billion because of what unfortunately happened with Covid-19, we will always be chasing.  In his reply he mentioned the different challenges we have to address.  There is universal hope now that because he has come in from the outside, the Minister will be able to tackle this.  Paul Reid has come in from the outside as well and there is a new Secretary General in the Department of Health.  We should congratulate Jim Breslin who I thought was a very good Secretary General in the Department of Health on his new post.</p> <p>The reason I think the citizens' assembly approach could work here is that we saw with some of the social issues and with climate change the perspectives that it brought, away from the heat of the cauldron that is Leinster House and from the microscope being put by the media and others on the trolleys, waiting lists or whatever.  I refer to what is happening at the moment with the NHS and the furore in the United States around the repeal of Obamacare.  I think Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned going to dial one's health insurer in America.  We were lucky in this country that we had the political acceptance in terms of Covid-19 to be able to do things that we would probably have never done in peacetime.  We must look at the other parts of the world where that was not the case.  There were fights over PPE, who got on a ventilator, who was going to pay.  The Minister's legacy will be to bring reform again.  James Reilly did a piece of work that has been criticised.  The former Minister, Deputy Harris, did work, as did the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar.</p> <p>The biggest mistake ever was to get rid of the old health board system because there was accountability at local level.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We were able to argue about our own hospital or medical facility but that became lost in the HSE.  I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to what I am asking.  We actually have a fist-class health system.  Those who criticise our healthcare system fail to recognise the quality of our staff and the positive outcomes we have in terms of heart and stroke care.  I refer to our approach around obesity, smoking and alcohol.  We have been pioneers on certain legislative frameworks around health.  The one thing we are lacking is real accountability in our health service.  Even when putting in a parliamentary question, as the Minister knows, it can take 12 weeks to get an answer to what we would consider a simple request.  I ask the Minister to give that consideration.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for letting me come in.</p></speech>

We need to do a further piece of work on the packages we can bring with that.  I hope that in a further debate on health we may be able to embrace what Senator Conway spoke about in terms of the medical card.  It is that passport.  The Minister spoke about the importance of teenagers and those under six years of age.  Our world has changed since 1970.  Young people and teenagers are at that point now where life has evolved from when we began the medical card system.  I am asking the Minister to look at that age group.  There are myriad issues going on their lives in terms of puberty, new schools, new subjects, sexuality; one could go on.  The passport the medical card provides is something we should develop and put a suite of packages around.  I hope we can do that.</p></speech>
