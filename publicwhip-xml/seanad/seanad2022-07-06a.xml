    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-06a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022070600002#A00600"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter.  It focuses not exclusively on general apprenticeships but on cross-Border apprenticeships.  This follows on from someone in Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast, QUB, sending me a copy of a speech delivered in that university by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris.  It was an impressive speech, which I acknowledge.  The speech was given in the context of the one island approach, which is something the Government has promoted.  The policy is being driven by the Taoiseach and he is very committed to it.</p> <p>This issue centres on how we can use cross-Border connectivity and synergies and relationships in respect of developing an apprenticeship programme that spans the two jurisdictions.  I acknowledge the enormous work that went into the apprenticeship action plan drawn up by the Minister.  When he puts his mind to anything, he is driven, committed and determined.  I acknowledge that as well.  In all his announcements in this context since, and particularly in his speech in QUB, he has talked about his ambition to create an additional 10,000 new apprenticeship places every year up to 2025.</p> <p>I was particularly interested in his reference, and I am particularly interested in hearing more about this detail if it is not available today, to a new funding call under the PEACE PLUS programme to do with collaboration for cross-Border apprenticeships.  He is committed to doing this and to sourcing the funding for this programme.  There is great potential for this type of programme.  We must work together and encourage apprenticeships.  I am old enough to remember when people left the tech with a group certificate and other people laughed at them.  Those people with the group certificate went on, walked around and met construction workers, tilers, electricians, plasterers and stonemasons to beg for an apprenticeship, or to serve their time with them, as it was then called.  Indeed, apprentices then did not get very much money.  Most of them, however, went on to be successful entrepreneurs and businesspeople in the construction sector.  Therefore, I value and respect apprenticeships.  We learn at different levels.  We are not all academic and we can also learn through a hands-on approach on-site, be that in stonemasonry, construction, glazing or whatever.  A noble way to learn a trade and a profession is to serve time with a master of a craft.  It enables people to have a craft and a skill that they can use to bring in an income for themselves and their family.  Equally, it allows people to contribute to meeting a need.</p> <p>In that regard, we are aware that we have a real issue with a shortage of construction workers and, therefore, I wish to examine the issues relating to work-based learning on-site.  We all acknowledge its importance.  I also wish to have a greater focus placed on supporting apprenticeships, as well as on providing greater support for employers in this context and on how we can match apprenticeships with employers.  More important, however, is the question of how we can address the current shortage of skills, particularly in the construction sector and, specifically, in retrofitting.  We need apprenticeships in these areas now.  It is all good news in respect of the apprenticeship programme for the Government.  The PEACE PLUS initiative for cross-Border collaboration on apprenticeships, North and South, is exciting.  This is how we have to build relationships between the North and South.  We must find common needs and common issues and work with them.  I do not doubt the Minister&rsquo;s commitment in this regard.</p> <p>I ask that the Minister of State bring back to the Minister an issue to be reviewed in the context of apprenticeships, which is the green certificate in the context of agricultural training.  There is a great shortage of people in the agricultural sector.  I spoke about Teagasc and agricultural training here some months ago.  I received an email from a woman who had major concerns regarding her apprenticeship with Teagasc, where she was serving her green certificate time.  We have issues in this regard, and we must continuously evaluate apprenticeship programmes.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House, and if he could shed some light on these issues, or perhaps send on some follow-up information, that would be very helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-06a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022070600002#A00700"><p>I thank the Senator for his question on these important issues for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  He mentioned two important words in this contribution, namely that he "values" and "respects" apprentices.  I could not agree more.  We are moving into a space now where we need to value and respect them much more.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Senator's analogy with growing up was very appropriate and I share his view on it.</p><p>As part of the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021 to 2025, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, committed to cross-Border apprenticeship programmes to enhance Ireland's ability to respond to skills needs with an all-island ability in an all-island economy.  Ireland operates as a small, open economy and the ability of our graduate apprentices to operate on an international stage is to be encouraged.  The opportunity for international mobility as a component of apprenticeships programmes will be piloted during the lifetime of this plan, either in the workplace or in education and training institutions.  The Government's commitment to cross-Border apprenticeships is reaffirmed in the revised National Development Plan, NDP, 2021 to 2030, which sets out an enhanced level of ambition for collaborative cross-Border public investment to build a more connected, prosperous and sustainable island for all the communities and traditions that share the island.</p><p>Under the NDP, the Government, through the Department, will work with our Northern Ireland and UK counterparts and other education and research stakeholders to support more strategic co-operation, realise more opportunities and shape further and higher education and research sectors that will meet the needs and capacity of this shared island into the future.  This will include enhanced co-operation on higher and further education through collaborative approaches to programmes such as developing cross-Border apprenticeships.</p><p>A programme area skills development strategy is being developed as part of the PEACE PLUS programme strategy.  This is aimed at delivering economic regeneration and transformation and identifying areas for investment.  It will help to address evident skills gaps and result in increased productivity and employment as well as cross-Border labour mobility.  It will also enable cross-Border collaboration between education and training-based providers to address existing and emerging skills gaps and opportunities for reskilling in key disciplines such as ICT and digital, science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics, or STEAM, the green economy, entrepreneurship, leadership and management, among other key areas, and promote uptake of apprentices in key areas such as ICT.</p><p>We will shortly launch a new funding call for PEACE PLUS, with collaboration on cross-Border apprenticeships as part of that.  Working together, we have already identified one area, construction, where we can look to collaborate.  We will explore this in detail in 2023.</p><p>Apprenticeships are a demand-driven, employer-led offering based on a contract of employment between the apprentice and the employer.  The number of apprenticeships in any specific sector is, therefore, determined directly by employer provision.  The Department is working with SOLAS examining the demand for construction workers between now and 2030.</p><p>The Senator spoke about difficulties with green certificates for agricultural training days.  I will raise that matter with the Minister.</p><p>In recent years, the annual intake in construction-related apprenticeships has been steadily increasing.  In 2020, there was a total of 3,370 construction apprenticeship registrations.  This rose by 60% to 5,400 construction apprenticeship registrations in 2021 and to date in 2022, there have been 2,137 such registrations.  As I said, when I visit community training centres they have useful trades.  I hope they make plenty of money because they are providing a great resource to an ever-growing Irish economy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-06a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022070600002#B00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed response.  The takeaway from that is that the funding call for PEACE PLUS is about to be announced.  I welcome that.  The PEACE PLUS cross-Border initiative is amazing and fantastic and we need to tap into it.  We can mutually benefit from that cross-Border relationship.  I also acknowledge the ongoing work with SOLAS.  That is important and I am delighted to hear it.</p> <p>The Minister of State also mentioned healthcare assistant practitioners, of which we have a shortage.  That is a noble profession with skills and we need to acknowledge and support them with respect to training and pay.</p> <p>Before coming to the House, I had a call from a person in the construction education sector who told me there were now approximately 9,000 students doing leaving certificate construction studies.  I do not want to hold the individual in question to that exact number.  These students chose to do construction studies at secondary level, which indicates there is an interest.  I ask that we ascertain whether students leaving secondary school having taken construction studies are being matched up to apprenticeships.  It is not a question of it being a job.  We want people who are motivated and keen.  I ask that synergy or connectivity between the Department and the secondary school sector be explored further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-06a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022070600002#B00300"><p>I thank the Senator.  I take on board his views on those leaving secondary school.  He said there were up to 9,000 students taking construction studies and it is great that they are considering the trades.  The Senator also noted how hospitality and healthcare are.</p> <p>Education and training relevant to the skills needed in the construction sector and the green economy is delivered across the full remit of the tertiary system and through mainstream education and training, as well through specific programmes such as Springboard, the human capital initiative and Skillnet.</p> <p>In the area of healthcare, the advanced assistant practitioner is managed by an apprenticeship consortium, which includes representatives from the private, home and community care sectors and currently has an active population of 45.  There are also discussions between officials at the Department and counterparts in the Department of Health, the HSE and Tusla on the development of other apprenticeship programmes in the healthcare sector.  Among the 65 apprenticeships currently available, 25 are craft-related and, more specifically, include housing, retrofitting-related programmes, green skills activities relating to a range of construction and engineering-related programmes, including plumbing, carpentry and joinery, and the recently launched wind turbine maintenance technician programme.  There are, therefore, many different apprenticeships and that is very much to be welcomed.</p></speech>

I have always been a passionate advocate for people with disabilities.  I firmly believe that society has a responsibility to ensure every person is supported to reach his or her full potential.  As legislators, we have even more of responsibility in that regard.</p> <p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party stood before the people at the previous two general elections on a manifesto of An Ireland for All.  People with disabilities deserve the same opportunities and have absolutely the same right to reach their full potential as any other member of society.  We need to deliver for them and we are failing them badly.  Access to adequate and appropriate medical and therapeutic supports is a vital necessity for many people living with disabilities.  Without adequate access many people will simply not achieve their potential.  We all know the importance of all early intervention in helping children learn the very basic skills many take for granted, such as crawling, walking and speaking.  The first four years of life are so important and when children do not automatically develop those skills, they need help and support through State intervention to ensure they do.  There is nothing more heartwarming than a parent or a sibling seeing a child taking a step or putting a few words together for the first time.  In my experience families will go to the ends of the earth to do what they can but they cannot do it alone.  They need help and support and they must be provided by the State.</p> <p>I am regularly contacted by people in my area of south Kildare who have been waiting up to 18 months to gain access to the Kildare and West Wicklow children's disability network team, CDNT.  These delays are detrimental to the development of children in our area and often cause serious stress and strain for families.  We talk about a postcode lottery.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The CDNT of area 11, which takes in Kildare, is the Cinderella in this regard.</p><p>I am dealing with one case of a local child due to start primary school in September.  Let us call the child John.  John's mother noticed as early as his first birthday that he was missing milestones, was concerned about this and raised the matter with her doctor.  Due to Covid-19, nothing was done.  She continued to monitor him and raised the red flag periodically.  It was only when she was in with her doctor for a routine pregnancy check-up on her next child that she mentioned it again.  At that point John was referred to a new paediatric doctor.  The child was accepted by the CDNT but there is currently an 18-month waiting list.  In subsequent conversations with the staff on the CDNT, however, who bear no fault in this scenario and are going over and above their duties in supporting families, the mother was informed there is no guarantee the child would be accepted.</p><p>To this day, at more than four years old, John is still non-verbal.  He has had no proper assessment or help.  He is to enter his second year of preschool in September and his family will need to begin the process of primary school applications from October 2022.  His mother has been informed he will not be accepted in mainstream classes if he is non-verbal and she cannot apply for a school place in an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, class without a full report to state he requires it.</p><p>What is John or his mother meant to do?  This is not an isolated case and I have plenty of other examples.  We must tackle the problem and I ask the Minister of State what he can do to help ease this pressure and support people with disabilities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-06a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022070600002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter for discussion.  I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability matters, Deputy Anne Rabbitte.</p> <p>The Government remains firmly committed to ensuring the provision of the best possible health and social care services for both children and adults with special needs, whether they are therapy supports, respite, residential care or day services.  The Government recognises that children's disability services face significant challenges to provide services in a timely and effective manner.  The Minister of State is fully committed to the development and enhancement of children's disability services through the implementation of the progressing disability services, PDS, programme.  She recognises this change programme has been challenging for many stakeholders and, in particular, the families of children who require these services urgently.  As the Senator will be aware, the Minister of State has met many families and listened to their concerns first-hand to ascertain the issues and drive solutions.</p> <p>I assure the Senator significant efforts are being made by the HSE to reduce waiting times for children who require all therapy supports, and that objective is a key component of the PDS programme.  The full reconfiguration of children's disability services in the children's disability network teams, with a total of 91 CDNTs across nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, is a positive step.  It allows CDNTs to move towards the family-centred practice at the heart of phase 2.</p> <p>It must be acknowledged that there have been significant challenges in certain parts of the country with the implementation of the PDS programme.  There is a challenging environment related to recruitment and retention of staff working in CDNTs, which is affecting the level of service provided in a significant number of teams across the country.  However, this is not a resource issue and the Government has provided funding since 2019 to allow the HSE to employ an additional 475 whole-time equivalent posts to increase the capacity of all 91 CDNTs.</p> <p>The HSE is proactively pursuing a range of options regarding the recruitment of additional staff for the CDNTs and in the first instance this comprised national and international recruitment campaigns to attract those health professionals currently in short supply.  In addition, the HSE is exploring options such as sponsorship and expanded use of assistant grades.</p> <p>I assure the Senator that both the Government and the HSE remains committed to the delivery of appropriate services for children with disabilities and they will work with families and staff to develop services that meet their needs.  Having regard to the issue she raised, the HSE has advised that local disability services have allocated development posts for this year to each of the three Kildare CDNTs.  In addition, in conjunction with lead agencies, it has commenced a consortium-based recruitment initiative to explore UK and overseas recruitment, if necessary, to fill all development, vacant and maternity posts that it has until now been unsuccessful in filling from recent domestic recruitment campaigns.</p> <p>The Senator spoke about parents waiting for 18 months and this is seemingly far too long.  I will bring those views to the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-06a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022070600002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State and welcome the fact that three development posts have been allocated.  I have spoken about a postcode lottery and there is even a stark difference within the county of Kildare.  I spoke recently to a mum whose family relocated from north Kildare to south Kildare.  In north Kildare, her daughter was receiving all the different therapies she needed but following the move to south Kildare, she has not received anything in the space of 12 months.  That is simply not good enough.  Of course, these are not isolated cases.</p> <p>In CHO 7, which covers south Kildare, there are 752 children waiting six to 12 months for initial contact.  According to the statistics, 1,484 children are waiting more than 12 months, which is shocking.  These are damning statistics.  These are children with complex additional needs in their formative years and they and their parents will never get that time back.  We must deal with this and ease the pressure on services so we can support these children and their families.</p></speech>

It is a concern shared by all Members.  It is imperative we work together to tackle the recruitment challenge and, in that regard, the HSE has continued to make every effort to support the recruitment of essential staff to expand the capacity of CDNTs.  It is imperative teams are staffed to their maximum capacity if we are to provide the best possible service for all children with complex needs, regardless of the county in which they live, or as the Senator mentioned, what part of a county they live in.</p> <p>It is understood that delays in accessing health services of any kind can have a devastating effect, and this is all the more so when it involves a child who cannot access services.  I assure the House that the Government and the HSE remains fully committed to the delivery of high-quality child and family-centred services for children with disabilities.  We will work with families and staff to develop services to meet those needs.</p></speech>

The aquaculture legislation, as amended, goes back to the 1997 Act, and I would like to discern where we are in the process of examining the legislation and putting more definitive timelines in place to help applicants and communities affected by proposals.</p> <p>This is a significant issue.  Aquaculture licences are controversial in some locations because a body of water is taken for industrial use.  It can have a major impact on a community and because of this, a public consultation period and many reports, particularly environmental reports, are required for the licences.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will refer to a particular application to give a sense of where we are.  In 2019, an application was made for an aquaculture licence in the heart of Kinsale Harbour, just off Charles Fort.  It is a significant part of Kinsale Harbour.  The application has been going through the process for the past three and a half years.  It was necessary to re-advertise in May 2021 due to a mistake in the wording of the first advertisement in 2019.  Three and a half years later, the vacuum of information is a significant issue for the community.</p><p>We are trying to make sure that communities can be informed of what is happening in the process, the stage it is at and when a decision will be made.  That is necessary in order that objectors and applicants have a more definitive timeline so that they can move on with their lives and the proposals for the harbour.  We are very much aware that these are significant developments but the 1997 Act - I spent the weekend reading it and it is exceptionally boring legislation - never put a definitive timeline on when a decision on these applications would be made.  I am aware of cases where it was seven, eight or nine years after the application was first made that a decision was issued.  There is a need to review the Act in order to put more definitive timelines in place and to strengthen the line of communications between the community and the Department so that everyone can be part of the process and we can have a strong aquaculture network.  We need to make sure that the impacted communities can access the information in respect of how the process works.</p></speech>

I know it is of great importance to those in coastal regions.  As he will be aware, the Department considers applications for aquaculture licences in accordance with the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, to which he referred, the Foreshore Act 1933 and applicable national and EU legislation.  There are a number of statutory timeframes set out in the legislation in respect of aquaculture.  The licensing process involves consultations with a wide range of scientific and technical advisers as well as various statutory consultees.  The legislation also provides for a period of public consultation.</p><p>The statutory timeframes in respect of the public and statutory consultation processes are set out in SI 236/1998, as amended.  In the case of shellfish or seaweed licensing, the legislation provides for a period of 30 days in which the public may make written submissions on the application, and for a six-week period in which the statutory consultees may make written submissions.  In the case of fin fish, the timeframe for public and statutory consultation is eight weeks.  Following the closing date of the public and statutory consultations, all submissions are sent to the applicant, who has the opportunity to submit written comments in respect of the submissions within three weeks of the date of issue.</p><p>The average time for processing an aquaculture licence varies, depending on location, species, scale and intensity of production, statutory status of sites, potential visual impact, etc.  The Department takes full account of all scientific and technical advice, as well as all issues identified during the public and statutory consultation phases.  Further factors that can impact the time taken to process an application include the requirement for an appropriate assessment if the application is within a Natura 2000 area; whether the application is required to be accompanied by an environmental impact statement or environmental impact assessment report; consideration of any submissions or observations raised during the public consultation period; and the need for additional underwater or archaeological assessments and the likes.</p><p>Once the Minister has made a determination in respect of an application, the legislation requires that the decision be published within 28 days.  The Department places the reasons for the determination on the website of the Department and places a notice in the newspaper in which the applicant placed the application notice.  Notice of the foreshore licensing determination is also placed in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.</p><p>The legislation provides for an appeals mechanism.  Within one month of the date of publication of the decision, interested parties can lodge an appeal to the aquaculture licences appeals board, ALAB, which is an independent statutory body.  The timelines relating to the appeals process are a matter for ALAB.  Foreshore licenses may also be appealed by way of judicial review.</p><p>It is important that the Senator is aware of the complex nature of the licensing process and the various statutory steps that must be adhered to.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, recently launched phase 1 of the new state-of-the-art aquaculture information management system.  The online viewer was developed in collaboration with the Marine Institute as part of phase 1 of this project which will develop an overall aquaculture management information system for aquaculture licences in Ireland.  This delivers on the Government's commitment to the further implementation of the recommendations of the aquaculture licence review group.  It is the first step in digitising the aquaculture licensing application process.  The Department continually monitors all its services, including the licensing of aquaculture activities, to ensure we provide an efficient service to our customers while ensuring our environmental and legal obligations are adhered to.</p></speech>

It is important that it has moved to a more digital age and documents can be uploaded online.  That is a positive step forward because, previously, those making submissions had to post them to Clonakilty.  The digitisation of the system is very important.</p> <p>The core of the problem, however, is that there is no definitive timeline for when applications will be adjudicated on.  In the case of an application in respect of an industrial or housing development, for example, the local authority has to go through the same issues but there are definitive timelines in place in respect of making a decision.  For example, the local authority is obliged to have corresponded with the public and the applicant within six months of the application.  There is not the same type of timeline tied into these aquaculture applications.  If anything, they are so open-ended that the general public may forget about them because so many years have passed since the application was made.  The public may be of the view that the applicants have withdrawn the application or moved on to other things.  The 1997 Act needs to be considered in the context of tightening the timelines so that communities can have a definitive timeline in respect of when these applications will be adjudicated upon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-06a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022070600002#D00400"><p>I thank the Senator for highlighting those specific points.  He makes a valid point.  Notwithstanding all the timelines I outlined, he pointed to an understandable concern among local communities.  If a process is taking as long to come through as the one in Kinsale to which he referred, the community would be justified in feeling frustrated.  As he stated, it is important to keep the focus on that.  It is a complex process.  I outlined clearly in my initial response the challenges that are involved.  As a State and a State body, we have to ensure we do that right.  I take on board the points raised by the Senator and I will bring them back to the Department.</p> <p>As regards the review group, it identified as a key priority the backlog that existed in aquaculture licence applications at the time.  That backlog fed into some of the time delays referred to by the Senator.  The backlog in shellfish aquaculture licence applications has effectively been eliminated as an issue affecting the industry and work is being prioritised to address outstanding renewal applications in fin fish aquaculture.  The further implementation of the licensing review group report forms an important part of the programme for Government.  </p> <p>With the indulgence of the Acting Chairperson, I will refer to phase 2.  Our focus and attention is now on phase 2, which has been developed in 24 months.  It involved the development of a fully online system through which applicants for licences can submit all documents and supporting data electronically.  The system will be fully integrated with other systems.  Its delivery will create a one-stop shop for aquaculture licence applications, a process that will significantly reduce the administrative burden.  That is at the nub of the problem raised by the Senator.  Phase 2 can deliver a much more streamlined process.  It is a key step in delivering on our commitments under the programme for Government to further implement the recommendations of the independent aquaculture licensing review group.</p></speech>

I am pleased to share my time this morning with Senator Burke.  The issue we are raising is the ongoing campaign by T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme to make changes to how they operate.  On Monday night, Senator Burke and I attended a meeting in the TF Royal Hotel in Castlebar.  It was attended by more than 450 members of schemes from throughout County Mayo, local councillors and Oireachtas Members from the county.  The changes announced in recent weeks, in particular the abolition of the six-year rule, have been very much welcomed by scheme operators and those on the schemes.  There is still some way to go.  We are looking for an expansion of or flexibility in the eligibility criteria.  I will give an example.  Only one person can access a scheme under a herd number.  If a niece or nephew is working with a farmer he or she cannot access the scheme.  This does not make sense.  We need to get people onto these schemes.</p> <p>Another key issue is the top-up payment.  It may come as a shock to many people that they only receive &euro;22.50 as a top-up to their social welfare payment.  By any standard this is a very low level of pay for the work that is done.  What has been requested by T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme is that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, engage with and meet them to discuss the outstanding issues and matters to be resolved.  This includes increasing the top-up payment, particularly as we head towards budget 2023.  There is extra money in the budget package to cater for requests such as this.  We ask that the eligibility criteria be expanded and that greater flexibility be allowed in the operation of the schemes.</p> <p>The Minister of State is from a rural area and knows these schemes are vital.  They are part of the fabric of rural Ireland.  There are jobs in communities that simply would not get done were it not for these schemes.  As the saying goes, we do not know what we have until it is gone.  If people were not operating on these schemes many jobs would not get done.  They mow the local GAA pitches.  They keep them ready for the under-fives teams up to the senior teams.  They keep the local community halls open.  They look after the graveyards.  These are all jobs that local authorities do not have the resources or the manpower and womanpower to do.  The local schemes pick up the slack and bridge the gap the State does not fill.  It is vital that we ensure the long-term sustainability and viability of the schemes.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Senator Chambers has outlined in detail the case and what took place at the very large meeting in Castlebar last Monday.  There is no need to go over the case that Senator Chambers made.  The Minister of State is only too well aware of the work carried out by the schemes on football, hurling and soccer fields and graveyards.  Even at funerals we can see that participants in the schemes regulate traffic.  It is great when we go to a funeral and we can see it is taking place in an orderly fashion and drivers are told where to park.  They also assist Tidy Towns to keep towns and villages clean.</p> <p>At the meeting we were presented with a leaflet on what was being sought.  In particular, people want to engage with the Minister and the Department on what they need.  I will give the Minister of State a copy of what they gave us on the night.  The top-up payment of &euro;22.50 for the rural social scheme is very little for 19.5 hours work and the great work people do in the community.  Who would go out to work for &euro;22.50 for 19.5 hours other than those who love what they do and love helping the community?  That is what these people do and it is what they are about.  I ask the Minister of State consider their demands and engage with the Department and the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-06a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022070600002#E00300"><p>I acknowledge the excellent work done on the full range of community employment, T&uacute;s and rural social schemes, supported by the Department of Social Protection, and the contributions these schemes and their workers make to communities throughout the country.  At present there are some 27,000 people and 1,649 supervisors employed on the three main schemes.  Overall, these schemes have a budget allocation of &euro;540 million in 2022.</p> <p>Work schemes such as T&uacute;s and community employment are positive initiatives that enable the long-term unemployed to make a contribution to their communities while upskilling for prospective future employment.  The rural social scheme provides farmers and fishers with income support while they also make a contribution to their community.  At present, there are more than 10,000 places supported on T&uacute;s and rural social schemes, with a budget of more than &euro;160 million available to support the schemes in 2022.</p> <p>I agree with the Senators and we are all hugely impressed with the range and value of the work undertaken by the participants on these schemes, whether with Tidy Towns or the GAA or in childcare.  We would all notice a sizeable difference to our communities were these schemes and their participants not working.  Recognising the work and acknowledging the challenges that face these schemes, on 21 December, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, announced reforms to the rural social scheme and the community employment scheme to improve the operation and further support these schemes that maintain vital services to communities.  These changes included a provision to allow community employment and rural social scheme participants who reach 60 years of age to remain on both schemes until they reach State pension age, along with a number of other changes to reduce the numbers exiting schemes while improving the referral process.</p> <p>While these changes have helped, recruitment to schemes to fill all vacancies remains a challenge with vacancies in schemes at present.  Recent positive employment trends, with the reduction in unemployment and in the number of long-term unemployed, are having an impact on recruitment to these schemes.  It means there is a smaller pool of candidates to fill available places.  These challenges are similar to those facing employers in the open labour market.  To further assist schemes to maintain services in this tight labour market, last week the Minister and Minister of State announced additional measures.  These will improve recruitment and remove the six-year time limit on the rural social scheme for all participants, while continuing the practice whereby placements can be extended until suitable replacements are available to fill vacancies.  These reforms will ensure that schemes have sufficient participants to continue to deliver services throughout the county in urban and rural areas.</p> <p>The Department recently reviewed the means assessment disregards for farm assist, which is the main qualifying payment for the rural social scheme.  As part of this review process, it was recommended to provide for extensive expansion of the list of agri-environmental schemes that qualify towards income disregards.  These measures have been implemented from June 2022.</p> <p>I understand that last year, the Minister and Minister of State introduced the employment support services operation forum where they, along with departmental officials, meet representatives from community employment, the job initiative scheme, the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s.  This forum now meets three to four times a year, with the next meeting due to be held very shortly.  The operational forum provides a valuable opportunity to discuss operational issues that arise on the schemes and impact on service delivery in the communities.  The Minister and Minister of State find the meetings to be extremely informative and a very worthwhile opportunity for constructive exchanges of views and ideas.  They also interact regularly with schemes at ground level by visiting and engaging with them throughout the country.</p> <p>The funding of any potential payment increases for rural social scheme and T&uacute;s participants is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic and budgetary context.  I assure both Senators that I will ensure the points raised this morning will be relayed to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and, with regard to the top-up payment, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.</p></speech>

It might be of assistance to the two Ministers and Minister of State concerned if he were to let them know there is a briefing in the audiovisual room today at 12.30 p.m.  They would be most welcome to attend and meet directly with rural social scheme and T&uacute;s supervisors and hear directly from those affected.</p> <p>When these schemes were first set up they were seen as job activation measures that dealt with income support and rural isolation.  They have evolved over time to become essential services in rural areas.  This was not factored in at the outset.  There needs to be a change of mindset in the Department as regards how we view these schemes.  We must recognise that it suits many people to be on a scheme while doing some work on their farms or in the fishing community.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It just works well for the local community.  We want to acknowledge that and not to try to force people off these schemes when there is really no need to do that.</p><p>The second point relates to the eligibility criteria.  The pool of people who qualify to get on these schemes is getting smaller.  When we match that with the way the economy is currently, the jobs market and the fact we are close to full employment, it is becoming next to impossible to get people onto the schemes as they just are not available.  We need to expand the eligibility criteria or we will see these schemes getting smaller and closing down eventually.  Those are my two points.</p></speech>

We again ask him to seriously consider what we are looking for.  They are not big demands in the great scheme of events.  The money that is involved is in the region of &euro;2.5 million, which is very little in the overall budget of the Department of Social Protection.  I again thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to hear our views.  We hope he will take them on board.</p></speech>

The success of Government policies is a challenge to the schemes, given we now have 2.5 million people in employment.  When we have so many people in employment, fewer people are available to work on the schemes.  To be fair to both the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, they have been listening and responding, and they have made a number of changes.  However, as Senator Chambers said, they could go a little further.  I undertake to ensure the points raised by both Senators will be relayed to the Minister.  These schemes are an integral part of our communities, which would not function as well as they do if the schemes were not in operation.  However, it is becoming more and more challenging to retain people on the schemes.  No one wants to see the schemes disappear.  I do not believe the Minister or the Minister of State want the schemes to disappear; on the contrary, they are supportive of them.  I will relay the points raised this morning to them.</p></speech>

He has been doing tremendous work since taking office in building trade relations and expanding Ireland's trade opportunities, which bring employment.  I want to discuss the Intreo office on the Navan Road, which served people in the Dublin 7 area who find themselves without employment.  While I welcome the Minister of State's presence, it is disappointing that neither the Minister for Social Protection nor the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works found time to come to the House to address this issue.</p> <p>The Intreo office for Dublin 7 was an important office for those who need it, for those who find themselves having to turn to the State in a time of need.  That office was closed unannounced and unceremoniously back in April.  There were 40 or 50 people working there, which reflects how busy the office was, and there were no fewer than ten community welfare officers.  That shows the type of need for that office in that area.  The staff have been relocated to Parnell Street in the centre of town.</p> <p>The clients who went to that office on a daily and weekly basis have been left with the option of going into town, dealing with queries online or dialling a phone number that just goes unanswered.  We have a large elderly community in Dublin 7 and many of them are not online.  It is not reasonable for them to be expected to either hang on a phone all day for no answer, to be told to go online as they do not have access and they are not digitally literate, or to truck into town to Parnell Street.  There is very little parking on Parnell Street.  The Dublin 7 Intreo office on the Navan Road had parking and could accommodate people who have limited mobility and who depend on a car or on a loved one to bring them to the office.</p> <p>What I am hoping to get today for the people of Dublin 7 is an answer from either the Minister for Social Protection or the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, which manages the building, on a date for a reopening of that office.  I hope they have sent the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, with some good news for the people of the area.  I know from hearing from people on a daily basis that it is creating great inconvenience for them.  On top of the great inconvenience and upset, it is also a huge waste of State resources.  That office is in a brand new building and it is lying vacant.  I do not understand why any Department would leave an office like that lying vacant, with no date for putting it back into productive use.  I hope they have sent the Minister of State with some good news for the people of Dublin 7 and I look forward to his reply.</p></speech>

The Minister for Social Protection sends her apologies as she could not be here today.</p> <p>Significant maintenance and upgrade work to the Intreo centre on the Navan Road, Cabra, Dublin 7, had been scheduled for 2022.  Plans were put in place for staff to transfer to other Intreo centres for the duration of the work, with arrangements made for customers to be served by King&rsquo;s Inns Intreo centre, Parnell Street.  The work originally planned was premised on no significant changes being made to the services being provided by the Navan Road Intreo centre, the way those services are delivered and the layout of the building.  The Senator, like all of us, will be aware of the significant increase in construction and maintenance costs in recent months, including in building supplies.  It was decided, therefore, before finalising the works contract, to review the future use of the building at Navan Road to ensure efficient and effective use of resources.</p> <p>As has been the case with other organisations and services, many customers of the Department of Social Protection have moved to accessing departmental services online over the past two years.  This has largely been in response to the social distancing implications brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, despite the fact Intreo centres remained open to the public throughout the pandemic.  This had reduced the footfall into the Navan Road centre, including a significant decrease in the attendance of casual customers.</p> <p>A comprehensive review was undertaken in 2021 of all services and activities delivered by the Department's network of local offices with the purpose of determining the best future operating models for delivering these services and activities.  The review identified that significant portions of work that had previously taken place in Intreo centres had been moved to alternative work streams, with the most significant being the processing of payments by the national processing team and the handling of phone and electronic contacts by the national Intreo contact centre.  The review also identified substantial benefits for standardising and streamlining work previously replicated across the different local divisions.</p> <p>As a result of this review, dedicated work streams have been created for control operations, the community welfare service and the employment operations, which includes activation, community employment, T&uacute;s and employer engagement.  The impact of these changes and the new redistribution of work has given an opportunity for the division of staff working in Intreo offices to focus on vital customer-facing services, front-office services, information services, client identity services, claims maintenance, front-office control, day-to-day branch office interactions and facilities management.  With regard to the layout of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo centres, this means that instead of large waiting areas with rows of seats and multiple hatches, the Department will be providing self-service zones with interactive touchscreens, child-friendly spaces and autism-supportive sensory rooms.  The layout will reflect the fact many customers will be there by appointment and, therefore, will not need to queue.  The work in the Navan Road Intreo centre had been planned some time ago and it was considered appropriate to pause the works while further consideration was given to the optimal use of the building.</p> <p>That is the reply I have been asked to share with the Senator today.  I understand her frustration regarding the ten community welfare officers who had been working in the area and to phones not being answered.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I assure the Senator I will bring back to the Minister and Minister of State the points she has forcefully raised on behalf of the members of her community who depend on Intreo offices.

I appreciate what the Minister of State has said and I am not going to shoot the messenger in this instance.  I must say, however, that his reply is revealing.  It reveals that this had been in planning for a long time and that planning did not include any form of consultation with the clients of the Dublin 7 Intreo office.  In fact, it demonstrates a complete disregard for those clients and the area.</p> <p>The reply referred to a review.  Will that review be published and can we have sight of it?  Who does it benefit?  I do not see any benefit for people who are in need and require some human understanding.  That is what people who are in need require.  They do not need online self-service portals.  They need a bit of human compassion and that is what they go to their community welfare officer for.  The day the State forgets what its role is for people in need is the day it is finished.</p> <p>I ask that the Minister of State to go back to the Minister for Social Protection and ask her to meet me and a delegation from the Dublin 7 area to address this issue.  I also ask that he go back to the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office Public Works and suggest that he stop wasting public infrastructure and money by having perfectly good and functioning buildings mothballed.  It is a disgrace.</p></speech>

With face-to-face interaction, they are often there to reassure people when they are in a state of despair and in need.  It is important that the service is maintained.</p> <p>It is also fair to recognise that more and more people are moving away towards interacting with State services online.  That is just a matter of fact.  For those who are unable to interact online, it is important that they should be able to access the services when they need them, a point which the Senator has made very forcefully.  I will, as the Senator requested, raise with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, the points she has raised. </p></speech>

As we know, artificial intelligence and machine learning are transformative technologies and are about solving very complex issues.  We are already seeing it happening in everything from legal contracts being checked to identifying pieces of music or of birdsong, and it is being used in drone and machine delivery of food.  Even yesterday, the most recent announcement about the Dublin MetroLink referred to it being an automated train system with trains driven by artificial intelligence, AI, machine learning.</p> <p>I have no doubt we will see robots using AI machine learning and 3-D printers to deliver homes.  It is interesting that while some of this new world fills us with fear, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs reported two weeks ago that the deployment of AI will not result in any job losses but that we need to adapt and change as a society to avail of the opportunities it presents. </p> <p>I was very happy to see the publication in July last year of the strategy, AI - Here for Good: A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland.  The concern when a strategy is published is that it will be left on a shelf and no progress will be made.  I am aware, however, that the Minister of State has appointed a national AI ambassador and set up the enterprise digital advisory forum.  In addition, in a very welcome step, he set up the digital transition fund which will support business in adapting and using AI.  I know that there also are plans to engage with young people.</p> <p>Key in terms of Government strategy, and this was signalled in the AI strategy, has to be the building of trust among people.  We have seen in recent years fears, unfounded in many cases, being built up by small groups around science and technology.  I am speaking here about anti-vaxxers and anti-5G groups.  It is essential, therefore, that the Government take an active role in ensuring that people understand the potential of AI and the opportunities it presents.  That is not just a challenge for Government.  Business, higher education and others also have a responsibility to inform the public debate on this.</p> <p>I note the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs recommended two weeks ago that we should have a new AI apprenticeship.  I would certainly like to see that.  The expert group also recommended that a free AI course be made available for all citizens so that they can learn how to more effectively use and deploy AI and also simply understand how it operates.</p> <p>The Government approach in the AI strategy, which I welcome, is very much based on human rights and ethics.  This has to be a whole-of-government approach.  We can deploy AI in a clever way, for instance, in meeting some of our climate change targets in agriculture.  If we use AI effectively, we could ensure the effective use of agricultural resources and monitor soil and animals.</p> <p>I am concerned about moves to introduce facial recognition technology, even in these Houses.  Facial recognition technology can be used for good.  For instance, in India up to 10,000 children who were missing were identified using facial recognition technology.  In contrast, however, we have China, which has effectively become a surveillance society through the use of facial recognition technology.  It is important that if we deploy this technology, it is done with full public consultation and informed by human rights and ethics.</p> <p>I am a little concerned that the Department of Justice intends to roll out its own AI strategy.  The use of AI or facial recognition technology could be welcome in fighting crime but it is essential that it adhere to the terms of the Government strategy, with a particular emphasis, obviously, on ethics and the protection of human rights.</p></speech>

I know he has a great interest in this area and all new and emerging technologies.  As alluded to by the Senator, in July last year, the Taoiseach and I launched AI - Here for Good: A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland.  The strategy sets out how Ireland can be an international leader in using Al to benefit our economy and society, through a people-centred, ethical approach to its development, adoption and use, as the Senator said.   It presents an integrated framework to manage the expected beneficial socioeconomic opportunities that Al presents.  We have paid particular attention to the ethical and societal aspects of Al, highlighting both the benefits and possible risks of Al technologies.</p> <p>The national strategy is aligned with the evolving EU and OECD policy direction of ensuring both an ecosystem of excellence and an ecosystem of trust.  The strategy is in favour of a governance and regulatory framework that avoids setting unnecessary barriers to responsible innovation.  At the same time, the governance and regulatory framework needs to be robust enough that it can build trust in the ethical use of Al. </p> <p>On a regulatory front, work is under way at European level on an Al Act, which will set harmonised rules for the development, placement on the market and use of Al systems.  Crucial to this is a proportionate risk-based approach.  Certain particularly harmful Al practices are prohibited as contravening European Union values, while specific restrictions and safeguards are proposed on certain uses in areas such as recruitment, health, welfare and law enforcement, including remote biometric identification systems.</p> <p>Al applications, such as facial recognition technology, may have a role to play, for example, in some specific cases of law enforcement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, it is my firm belief we need to have regulatory structures in place to ensure its safe deployment.</p><p>As the transformative potential of artificial intelligence, AI, becomes clearer, so too do the risks posed by the use of unethical, unsafe or insecure AI systems.  That is why we need to have clear direction with safeguards and ethical governance in place to make sure AI is used and deployed securely and in a manner that is fair, transparent and builds public trust.</p><p>My Department and I continue to engage across Government, including with the Department of Justice and with our European counterparts, to ensure a risk-based approach is adopted for the adoption, deployment and use of AI and to ensure the commitment of ethical and trustworthy AI is upheld.</p><p>From my Department's perspective, I would like to highlight some of the deliverables in the strategy that have been implemented since the launch.  As AI becomes more and more part of our daily lives, it is important public trust, knowledge and engagement with AI is built and maintained.  To that end, I appointed an AI ambassador who will lead a national conversation to ensure we demystify AI but also to make sure everybody is aware and understands the great opportunities and benefits AI can bring to society and to the economy. </p><p>I also appointed an Enterprise Digital Advisory Forum, which will support and advise Government in driving the digitalisation of enterprise across Ireland, including the uptake of AI by businesses.  The Senator mentioned the digital fund we announced a few weeks ago.  Officials in my Department are working with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Inclusion and Youth and planning a national youth assembly on AI to ensure our youth have an input in the future direction of AI.  </p><p>Last month CeADAR, the centre for AI and applied data analytics, took another step closer to becoming a designated European digital innovation hub, which will serve as the national first-stop shop for AI transformation in SMEs and public organisations.  Last month, the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, and I welcomed the publication of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, to which the Senator alluded.  Much good work is being done to ensure the strategy does not stay on the shelf, that we implement it and take the full benefits of the opportunities this transformative technology presents.</p></speech>

I certainly welcome many of the moves.  The engagement with Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and with young people will be particularly welcomed.  It is important it would be as inclusive as possible to ensure young people understand AI and avail of its opportunities.  This is a challenge for wider society.  It will transform all of our lives.  For anybody involved in driving or delivery of goods or persons, there is a risk a significant element of their tasks will be replaced over the next decade.  We must consider how we can upskill all those individuals.  </p> <p>It is important some of the suggestions of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs on specific apprenticeships and for an online course to be made available for all citizens would be implemented.  We need to build public trust in this technology.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s approach has been correct to date but I worry that this, as is the case with many technologies, is frequently discussed within a bubble.  I suggest that in the roll-out of new technologies perhaps briefings for Members of the Oireachtas could be useful.  It is a challenge for Deputies, Senators and others to understand the scope and opportunity of what is coming down the line.  It would be of benefit for us to be able to understand the full detail of how AI operates and the potential challenges and opportunities it presents.</p></speech>

We have to build trust.  One of the ways to do that is to ensure we have the proportionate regulatory framework in place.  That is why Ireland, from our perspective, is working at a European level and feeding into the work being done there on the AI Act, which will set a harmonised set of rules for the development, placement on the market and use of AI systems, which will be proportionate and risk-based.  As a small open economy, there are no boundaries to the use of technology.  It is in that context it is right and proper for us to engage in the regulatory framework from a European perspective.</p> <p>Regarding having wider engagement, that is why we appointed Dr. Patricia Scanlon who is an expert in this field.  She will lead a national conversation in this area and regarding the whole area of skills.  That report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs was published only two weeks ago.  We will be implementing its recommendations.  There will be job displacement but there will also be new job opportunities because of the use of AI.  It is important we provide the necessary training in order that people can avail of the new opportunities this will present.</p></speech>

It is always good to see people who want to see democracy in action.  I support the Order of Business as outlined by the Deputy Leader but there are a few things I want to bring up.  First, it was a very good announcement last night regarding the extra &euro;100 towards back-to-school costs.  We all know the implications to parents of an impending September and it is a very difficult time of the year.  Barnardos and the Irish League of Credit Unions have done excellent work in that regard through their surveys.  Added to this is free transport, which is another great development, and the extra hot meals for 60,000 children - an investment of &euro;67 million.  There is still more to go and I appeal to the Ministers for Education, Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, when they are speaking about back to school costs, to look at raising the capitation allowance for students and finally get rid of the dreaded voluntary contribution.</p> <p>That brings to mind the parent and student school charter legislation, which went through both Houses in 2019 and has not been implemented yet.  This is excellent legislation that will give parents and students the opportunity to discuss costs in schools with school authorities and the management board.  I ask the Deputy Leader if she could put pressure on the Minister in terms of getting this implemented and finding out the delay in it.</p> <p>I also raise the issue of pension abatements.  This policy was originally designed to stop highly paid civil servants and politicians from retiring during the financial crises in 2011 with sizeable pensions and lumps sums and then returning the public sector.  I appreciate my colleague, Senator Craughwell, has also raised this many times.  However, it is negatively affecting those who are not so highly paid, particularly those from the Army who have left and gone back into other jobs.  Ex-Defence Forces personnel, who would never have earned a lot in the first place and would not have a big pension, are getting caught in this system.  We need to look at it and make sure there is equity there.  If people wish to work and continue working, we should be able to support them without them being financially penalised.</p> <p>A tweet from Dr. Mary Wingfield caught my eye yesterday.  Dr. Wingfield was in Milan at the European Atlas of Fertility Treatment Policies.  Ireland is practically at the very bottom of the list.  We are 40th out of 43 countries, which is absolutely shocking.  We know according to data that one in every six couples has fertility problems.  We absolutely need to help to support them.  I acknowledge the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, has opened five out of six fertility hubs promised and the remaining one will be open in Nenagh at the end of this year, but the elephant in the room is IVF.  There has to be an absolute commitment from this Government to support financially IVF for couples and that should be made in the budget.  I echo that call.</p></speech>

The reason I am proposing this will be obvious to all.  It was interesting to hear Senator O'Loughlin welcoming people to the Visitors Gallery, as indeed do I, and commenting on how desirable it is that people see democracy in action, when this very day we have a Government using its two thirds majority in the Seanad to spit in the face of our democracy by proposing, yet again, the disgraceful use of the tactic of the guillotine to prevent the full discussion of legislation in this House.</p></speech>

Today, we have the launch of a report from the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy.  My colleague, Senator Keogan, who wanted to present a minority report but was not facilitated in doing so, points out that none of the potential witnesses who had valid dissenting views and questions about commercial surrogacy to put to the committee was allowed to participate.  They were purposely and tactically excluded.  It seems to me that surrogacy is one of those issues where we increasingly have government by media.  There is a one-sided, soft-focused presentation on radio, but one would expect the national Parliament, Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann, to make sure there would be thorough and fair scrutiny in its Chamber debates and in its committee.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Chambers and I had our disagreements on the Oireachtas all-party committee on the eighth amendment.  I had concerns about the lack of fairness accorded to different sides of the argument.  We fought and succeeded in making sure there was a certain hearing of different sides of the issue.  That has not happened with the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy.  In fact, the only public thing we have seen from it so far was the disgraceful treatment of my colleague, Senator Keogan, by fellow Senators and by Deputies.  She was effectively bullied for having a different view and communicating it respectfully.  That is a stain on our democracy.  The Oireachtas must rise to the challenge we face in these times.  We cannot be the place where dissenting voices get cancelled.  We have to be the remedy to that problem in our society by insisting that people who have mandates of various kinds get to represent the views of their electorate fully and thoroughly.  That starts with not guillotining legislation and continues with committees being ready to hear different points of view instead of just coming with one-sided reports and recommendations.</p></speech>

It seems to happen every year as if we did not know the summer recess was going to come and we suddenly have to hurtle through business.</p> <p>Today at 12 noon outside the gates of Leinster House, Equality for Children and a number of other organisations including the National Infertility Support Information Network, LGBT Ireland, and the Independent Living Movement Ireland are calling on us to stand with their families.  Currently, in Ireland, thousands of children are being denied the right to have their families legally recognised.  I am sure many of us will be in the Chamber at that time but if anyone is not, those groups will be outside the gates.</p> <p>The majority of LGBTQI+ couples and approximately one in six Irish heterosexual couples require assisted human reproduction, AHR, treatment to be able to conceive a child.  However, most children born through this treatment are left in an uncertain legal position without any functioning legal framework to establish a legal parent-child relationship with both of their parents.  This has many practical impacts for the children of these families in areas such as birth registration, citizenship provisions, childcare, education provision, access to social welfare, succession and inheritance rights among other things.  The Government has published a report on children's rights and best interests in the context of AHR.  It was written by the Special Rapporteur for Child Protection, Professor Conor O'Mahony, who recently said he will not seek another term.  I acknowledge the work he has done on this.  If adopted, the recommendations contained in this report would address numerous legislative gaps that prevent children conceived through AHR from having a legal parent-child relationship with both the parents who love and care for them on a daily basis.  The groups outside the gates are calling on the Government and the Minister for Health to immediately adopt and implement these recommendations.</p> <p>The report provides clear, practical solutions that uphold the rights and best interests of children, including their right to family life, identity and non-discrimination.  It recognises the reality of AHR treatment.  It also addresses the need to take into account the circumstances of individual children, including those who have been born, in order that they can establish a legal parental relationship to the parents who love and care for them daily.  It highlights the need to provide comprehensive legislation in a wide range of areas, including addressing the gaps left in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022.</p> <p>The report acknowledges the distress caused to children born through AHR and their families due to the absence of appropriate legislation.  Children have been left in a vulnerable legal position for lengthy periods due to the failure of the Oireachtas to legislate and address their status.  Significantly, the report recognises the uneven impact this has had on children conceived outside clinical settings and born to LGBT parents who cannot rely on the presumption of paternity and maternity as opposite-sex couples can.  This goes against a significant pillar of our campaign for and belief in equality for children.  I draw Senators' attention to the protest outside Leinster House today and request that we get a move on that legislation.</p></speech>

It is shocking in our democracy and should not be allowed.  I want to raise the progress of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 progress through this House.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, stated that he now believes it will be impossible to progress the Bill through all Stages in the Seanad before the recess.  It is hard to express how I feel about this development.  I welcome his commitment to examine the points raised by Deputies Ward, Cairns and others during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il.  As they have pointed out, the Bill is deeply flawed in several crucial ways.  Its exclusion of people formerly detained under the Mental Health Act is deeply discriminatory, as is the exclusion of 16- and 17-year-olds who are allowed to make decisions about their physical health but not their mental health.  I hope that these issues are addressed by Government amendments or that Opposition amendments are accepted.  However, I am crucially aware of the harm that this delay will cause.  The legislation is supposed to replace the deeply flawed wardship system.  While it is delayed people are being taken into wardship and are being denied this opportunity of supported decision-making that will better vindicate their rights and autonomy.  If the Bill is to be delayed until after the recess, then we need a commitment that it will be passed before the budget.</p> <p>I want to make a broader point about the legislative process.  This Government has taken on responsibility for delivering legislation on legacy issues and other important, emotionally charged topics.  That is a difficult task and much of it has been led by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, who undoubtedly has a difficult job, but whether it is the records Bill, the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 or the Institutional Burials Bill 2022, there seems to be a pattern of inconsistent and inadequate engagement with stakeholders.  These are issues of tremendous significance, and many courageous and dedicated individuals and organisations have spent significant time and effort campaigning on these issues.  Our legislative process is supposed to ensure they feel included and understood, yet they continuously experience disappointment and dissatisfaction with the process.  This failure needs to be addressed.</p> <p>As legislators, we should be led by the people who are affected by the decisions we make.  There are many reasons this is not the case such as the complexity of legislation, the opacity of the drafting process and the uneven rhythm of the legislative process.  Mostly it feels like very little is happening on a given issue and then the process unfolds so quickly that it is difficult to make one&rsquo;s voice heard.  I do not have the answer to this problem but it is an issue that degrades our democracy and dilutes the wealth of knowledge, experience and insight that campaigners and civil society share with us.  Will the Minister address the House to outline his new timeline for the passage and enactment of this much-needed legislation?</p></speech>

I was very proud to be a member of that committee along with some very dedicated Oireachtas Member.  It is unfortunate that Senator Mullen is not present to hear my comments.  He raised the issue of the surrogacy report.  We all came into it with an open mind and listened to the evidence from leading academic experts, legal experts, medics, surrogates, children born through surrogacy and families who have gone through that process.  We all had the opportunity to input on witness lists, table amendments and call votes on amendments.  To say that anybody was sidelined is completely inaccurate.  To say anybody was bullied by any member of the committee or the committee as a whole is completely inaccurate.  We are all Members of this House or the Lower House.  We all have a platform to voice our opinions and we are all well able to put forward our opinions.  I take personal offence to any suggestion that there was anything other than people working diligently within a tight timeframe, dealing with a difficult topic.  I strongly refute any suggestion that was done in any way in bad faith or that there was a position decided beforehand.  We came through a whole journey and I certainly learned an awful lot and acted in good faith.  I am disappointed that such a good, positive day is brought down into the mire by some comments here.</p> <p>We are moving towards a more inclusive society, lifting taboos around reproduction and women's health.  The families that have gone through surrogacy, before they got to that point went through an awful lot of trauma.  Quite often there was illness and other difficult issues for them to deal with in their lives.  They have triumphed and provided a home for their children.  These children are loved and wanted.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to be very mindful not to use issues such as these, which are very sensitive but very important, to engage in some sort of culture war that we do not have in this country.  If one person on the committee disagreed with the report, it is not because anybody was bullied.  Maybe that person is just in the minority.  Maybe Ireland has moved on and is an inclusive society.  We all came from different parties and perspectives but we listened to the expert evidence.  It is very unfortunate that this report is not widely welcomed.  I wish all parties would accept the report and the recommendations.  I hope the Government will act speedily to enact this legislation because families are crying out for it.</p></speech>

I will be moving my own amendment, that No. 3 be amended by the deletion of the second paragraph and the substitution of the following: "to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 and that the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be adjourned after four hours."  That leaves the same amount of time for discussion today, but it means that the guillotine will not come down.  I formally protest the manner in which these three guillotines have been put before the House today.  We have Leaders and Whips meetings and a consultation process which is supposed to warn the Members of this House of what is planned by the Leader of the House and the Government for the business of the House.  No warning whatsoever was given to us that these matters would be guillotined.  That is an abuse of the customs and conventions of this House.  More than that, it is a deliberate insult to those people who want to discuss the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 and the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022, and amendments to them, at length, which is very important for our democracy.</p> <p>When the Minister, Deputy Harris, came to this House, I asked that the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022 would not be rushed through.  He nodded his head as if he agreed with me but, a week later, he is trying to guillotine this legislation through.  It is highly important legislation and it has considerable implications for the control, direction and independence of higher education institutions for the next half a century.  For it to be guillotined through this House in order to meet what the Government considers to be the deadline of the summer vacation of this House, for its convenience, is disgraceful.  I will make it very clear that we will not agree to that and we will not agree to the implementation of the Order of Business to bring it about.</p></speech>

We all have very privileged positions.  We talk about free speech and our responsibility, but for some reason we are talking about the mistreatment of individuals with power, privilege, voice and space on a committee, instead of talking about witnesses who had to leave committee rooms in tears.  Who protects them?  Where does the Oireachtas protect them and their experiences as laypeople coming in to our Houses, invited in to give us an insight into their very personal and private lives?  There is something seriously skewed in this Chamber if we will allow accusations of bullying to be thrown out unchallenged.</p> <p>Anyone who studies and understands the law knows there is an objective test to meet to understand bullying.  It is not a once-off clash between two politicians.  It is not someone asserting his or her free speech or opinion.  Bullying exists over time.  It is an assessment, undermining and bullying of a person on a constant basis and it is very dangerous.  People see through the dangerous language being used.  I would much prefer to focus on the mistreatment of witnesses who came before our committees in the past few weeks and on how they were goaded and inflammatory language was used to insult them and their families.  They were our guests in this House and if anything, they should be the ones with complaints of bullying in this room.</p></speech>

It was a very welcome initiative to see both the social and the environmental organisations come together to call for a true just transition.  We know that 29% of Irish households are currently living in energy poverty.  That is the highest number that has ever been recorded.  Average household energy Bills have increased by &euro;1,100 in one year and the rising costs of energy continue to disproportionately impact households in the bottom 20% of the income distribution, who spend a higher percentage of their income on energy.</p> <p>We had an issue with energy poverty in this country long before the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis.  We heard today from civil society groups such as Age Action, Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation, Disability Federation Ireland, the European Anti-Poverty Network, Friends of the Earth, Irish Rural Link, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, Social Justice Ireland, the Think-tank for Action on Social Change and Threshold that the current system of addressing climate change and energy poverty is deeply unfair and that unless we have a system whereby we reduce our carbon emissions through a retrofitting programme that will also reduce energy poverty, all we are doing is transferring wealth up in society to those who can afford to retrofit their homes and put in heat pumps while the rest of society is left behind.  It is a very important message and I thank the colleagues who came to hear it.</p> <p>The energy poverty strategy lapsed in 2019, which shows that it is not a priority for this Government.  I do not know how many times I have raised it in this House.  A report by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said that we did not have the data to see what sort of social impact our retrofitting scheme was having on households.  I encourage everybody, especially coming up to the early budget, to read this document and the joint statement and to look very closely at the solutions they are putting forward.  Nobody is saying we do not have to meet our climate targets, but we have to do it in a fair way.  We have to bring society along with us and it has to be about a just transition.</p></speech>

I wonder if we forget those Irishmen and Irishwomen who travelled, particularly to the UK, during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s with shovels and nothing else.  Quite a number of them live a very lonely existence today.  Is it terrible to ask RT&Eacute; to maintain the long-wave channel?  I have seen the arguments.  People ask why do they not log-on to their mobile phones and why do they not go onto the Internet.  These are simple people who went to the UK, many of them sending home fivers, tenners and &pound;15 a week to educate those of us who stayed at home or to keep those of us who lived in Ireland in body and soul.  I would like this House to use all of its powers to ask RT&Eacute; to maintain that channel for a period of time and I would ask the Cathaoirleach to row in behind that.</p><p>There has been some discussion this morning on the surrogacy report published.  I have one thing to say on it: we live in a democracy and in a democracy everybody has a right to be heard.  If my colleague wanted to publish a minority report, nobody had a right to prevent that from happening.  I do not know exactly what took place and I am not interested.  I disagree with many people in this House but I defend every person in this House's right to say what he or she wants, when he or she wants, and how he or she wants.  If one wishes to argue with them, do it through debate and win through debate.  There is no other way to win or lose.</p></speech>

We met with the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland.  One common theme that has come up over the past couple of meetings in particular is the issue of the summer provision.  We have a situation at present where a significant number of special schools in the country are not providing the summer provision.  In fact, the children whom the summer provision was set up for in the first instance three-to-four years ago are the ones who are not getting it and they are the children who are most in need.</p> <p>There are parents struggling to get teachers and special needs assistants to do the home provision.  The reason we set it up was to look after those children with high needs and they are now not getting the provision.  We need to look at it, if it is not too late, for the last two weeks of July.  Every special school in the country should be compelled to provide the provision.  We need to look at what they have done in Newbridge about which I spoke to Senator Wall yesterday where the four schools in the town have come together and each year at least one of the schools will provide that provision to make sure that the children in that area get what they are entitled to, what they need and what they deserve.</p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA.  It is an issue I have raised regularly here over the past 12 months.  The governance review report was published following the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, of which I am a member, asking the IABA to come in to the committee to tell us that there as was nothing wrong with the association.  The report has 64 recommendations, none of which refer to the people who are in charge of the sport who have been in the public domain for a long number of years.</p> <p>If we are to move on with the sport and with the IABA, we need to do it by removing those who are in charge of the association.  We saw 30 volunteers suspended last year in the middle of elections, the results of which still have not been announced despite the vote having taken place.  All 30 of those won their case when they had to go at their own expense to defend themselves through Sport Dispute Solutions Ireland.  That result has never been published because the IABA does not want it published.</p> <p>We had the situation in the past three weeks where the issue with regard to the Bernard Dunne case and two directors was put before the IABA internal disciplinary committee of three independent solicitors.  It has been in the media over the past 12 to 18 months.  That result has never been published but the result is that unanimously those two individuals won their case and it was thrown out.  There is a vote this weekend in relation to this review and I believe, for boxing to move forward, we need to remove those who have been at the helm of this organisation for the past eight or nine years and have been at the root of many of the problems within the association.</p></speech>

It is an issue that has been in the media for the past few weeks.  The issue of senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having to retire at 60 is an issue that we have to look at.  We have civilians working in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have the option to stay in the service up until 70 years of age but a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's retirement age is 60 years of age.  Sixty is an exceptionally young age.  Sixty years of age now compared with 20 years ago is a completely different game.  These are young, capable, active individuals who have so much knowledge.  To have them leave the force at this stage is something that we need to look at.</p> <p>We should have a genuine debate in the autumn with the Minister for Justice about the future of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na retirement age.  I personally believe we should extend it because there is a brain drain.  We are losing real knowledge from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I note that there are three members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to retire from senior posts in the next few months and it will be a significant drain on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's resources to have them replaced.  We need to have a real decent look at this issue.  I suggest we should have a debate in the autumn with the Minister.  We need radical change to ensure we keep these valuable personnel serving, if possible.</p></speech>

Last week, with only a week's notice, a private company, Dublin Coach, announced it would suspend its 307-308 bus service, which goes from Limerick city centre to the University of Limerick and on to Annacotty.  To explain, Castletroy, which this bus service serves, is one of the fastest growing areas, not only in Munster but in the country.  This is shocking news because students and families depend on these services.</p> <p>Here is the point.  I am making a clear call this morning to Bus &Eacute;ireann to step in and expand its services to include Newtown and the route from Monaleen school to Supervalu.  The difficult is that when one raises issues with Bus &Eacute;ireann, it immediately refers one on to the National Transport Authority.  Everybody here knows there is no comeback from the National Transport Authority.  It is literally throwing a request into a black hole.  It is not good enough.</p> <p>People want accountability.  I want Bus &Eacute;ireann to respond to the need that people in Castletroy have and the service gap there is now to increase services for families and students to ensure that people do not have to take their cars when going to university and when going into Limerick city centre.  I also want to see an expansion of services to the greater Castleconnell area, which makes perfect sense as well.  We could take hundreds of cars off the road each morning if we had a regular service in Castleconnell instead of the three-hourly service that we have at present.</p> <p>My problem, frankly, is how do we get the attention, not only of Bus &Eacute;ireann but of the National Transport Authority.  I have heard other Senators complain about this in the past.  I want a debate about it.  Right now, the National Transport Authority is simply not accountable in terms of reasonable requests about expansion of services.  We cannot wait for years.  What we need is a guarantee from Bus &Eacute;ireann that before September comes we will see an expansion of its services to take up the gaps in the market that now exist and ensure that we have decent bus services so that people in Castletroy and the wider Limerick area do not have to rely on private car transport.</p></speech>

There are serious questions to be answered around governance in the IABA.  I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, is meeting with them this week.  The people who I am worried about are the volunteers in the clubs on the ground and the athletes.  There are particularly serious issues.  There is an extraordinary general meeting this week but the organisation needs to sort out its governance issues.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has said that he will withhold funding if the organisation essentially does not cop itself on.  I am in agreement with Senator Carrigy that many of the current management and governance structures are not meeting the purposes of the sport.</p> <p>I want to raise the question of the Ahare River in north Wexford which I have raised previously and to look for support from the Office of Public Works.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The river frequently floods and blocks access to a significant part of the Castletown area of north Wexford.  Wexford County Council recently commissioned an independent flood risk assessment report that made several recommendations, including for a flood warning system, along with other actions.  We need the system to be sensitive to nature in the local area but it is also important that roads are not being continually blocked every time there is heavy rainfall.  I ask the Deputy Leader to request that the Office of Public Works provide the necessary support to ensure this issue is addressed.</p><p>In the context of the public sector pay report, I am aware that many public servants rely on the travel and subsistence allowance.  I am also thinking of carers and so on.  As a result of the increased cost of fuel, the cost of travel is significant.  This impacts across the public service in a big way, but there are also many in the private sector who use the public sector rates to determine mileage.  I ask that the issue of travel and subsistence allowances be addressed in the context of the debate on public sector pay.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming to Leinster House to see the Seanad in action.</p></speech>

It is great that young women are coming in to visit the House.  I hope they will be representatives in future.</p> <p>I wish to acknowledge the work of Maria Walsh, MEP, on mental health.  I am a member of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health.  We know the impact the past couple of years have had, particularly on young people in towns across Ireland.  We hear it from parents, teachers and everyone else.  Ms Walsh is doing a significant amount of work at European level to make 2023 the European year of mental health.  She has set up a petition and I ask colleagues to consider supporting it.  It is important that we support mental health in the time ahead.  She is also seeking the establishment of a comprehensive EU mental health strategy and for minimum requirements for teleworking across the EU to be defined.  This is crucial because, while we want to discuss well-being, the impact of working online has to be considered.  In many cases, it is non-stop and 24-7.  When it comes to mental health and the digital world of work, we want to support people being able to work from home.  We in the regions know how important it is that people do not have to commute for several hours to get to work.  If they are working non-stop, however, that will be a major issue in terms of their well-being.  I ask colleagues to support the call of Maria Walsh.  It is important to support campaigns relating to mental health in rural areas.</p></speech>

I do so because I am extremely disappointed with the manner in which the Minister gave a commitment regarding the Higher Education Authority Bill.  It is an important Bill and I had hoped to discuss several issues relating to it today.  One of those issues relates to city and county councillors.  I have a schedule in front of me listing the councillors, their party affiliations and the universities they serve.  I will speak about it later if I have time.  Frankly, I do not think we will have time for that if the Bill is guillotined.  I have given a commitment to these people.  I contacted these councillors around the country and I have a definitive list in front of me.  These are the same people to whose doors we went, seeking a mandate to represent them.</p> <p>I never shy away from representing city and county councillors.  This is a game in which councillors will be stripped from the boards of all these universities.  We have seen it with the harbour companies.  We did not get an opportunity in this regard in the context of the Land Development Agency Act.  We should stand together and make a strong case for city and county councillors who are on these boards.  A 12-month transitional period will apply if the Bill is passed but I will not go into that now.  It would not be right to use my time on the Order of Business to tease out issues.</p> <p>Let us be careful.  Let us not agree to a guillotine on a debate that affects loads of people but, in particular, the very people who have given us a mandate to represent them in this House.  That is an important point.  Each Senator makes his or her own decision; that is grand.  We have to make our decisions.  I will respect whatever decision is made.  Let us be clear that if the discussion on this legislation is guillotined, we may not have an opportunity to discuss this critically important issue because of this House and certain of its Members.  I ask colleagues to support the proposed amendments to the Order of Business and to stand in solidarity with the broader Higher Education Authority family and group, as well as the city and county councillors who have a rightful place on these boards and are put there by votes, not by favouritism.</p></speech>

We had a similar situation last year.  I am concerned about the pressure that is placing on the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.  The Bills Office is dealing with a large volume of amendments due to the scheduling, turnaround time, lists of amendments, republishing of Bills and the whole process.  The staff dealing with amendments left the Bills Office at 7.30 a.m. this morning.</p></speech>

I thank all Senators for their contributions on the Order of Business.  In taking the Order of Business on behalf of the Leader, I am relaying information of which Members are already aware.  I am not in a position to accept any of the amendments.  I apologise to Senators for the obvious disappointment that will bring.  I concur with many of the remarks in respect of the pressure that is put on this House to pass legislation before certain deadlines that are imposed by various Ministers.</p> <p>As regards the Higher Education Authority Bill, the Minister, Deputy Harris, was asked for more time on this.  We were told that it had to be passed by the recess and, in order for amendments to be taken and potentially debated in the D&aacute;il, we were under time pressure to get those back next week.</p></speech>

I hear what was said and I know that Senator Ruane read out the comments of the Minister.  I can only relay to the House that the Minister was asked.  The request was made.  If we were to sit beyond next Thursday, going into Friday or the following week, the amendments would not be taken in the D&aacute;il.  That is the response I have been given.  I am being honest and open with Members.  I am sure they are aware of this anyway.  There is a significant amount of business and we have tried to accommodate it.  This morning, I had sight of the proposed schedule for next week.  It is jam-packed.  There is a lot of legislation coming through and it is putting pressure on staff in the Bills Office and other staff.  I acknowledge that.</p> <p>There is a point that Ministers could reflect on how the business is being run in both Houses.  The same pressures are being felt in the D&aacute;il.  That puts pressure on the offices.  This deadline of the summer recess is imposed but I am not sure if that is always essential.  Yes, some Bills need to be passed before the recess but other Bills could probably wait until the autumn session to give more time.  I am not a Minister or at Cabinet, however.  I am not making these decisions.  I ask that Ministers bringing legislation through consider whether there is a need to set that absolute deadline of the summer recess.</p> <p>In terms of the Higher Education Authority Bill and the Electoral Reform Bill, if amendments that are tabled now are to be discussed in the D&aacute;il, the Bills have to go back next week.  Otherwise, the amendments will not be discussed.  That is the reality of the two weeks that we are in.  I know Senator Doherty spoke to Senators last night and again this morning to try to find changes that could be made.  Some changes were made on foot of speaking to Senator Ruane, as well as Senator Higgins, who is not here but who was speaking to the Leader.  Changes were made to the schedule but I accept that not all the changes that were requested were made.  Out of respect for Members, I wanted to be honest about where things were at and what we were dealing with.</p> <p>On the contributions on the Oder of Business, Senator O'Loughlin welcomed the significant investment announced yesterday by the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, in respect of the cost of going back to school.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a particular pinch point for many families.  Those costs are accruing and being incurred now by families.  There will be an additional &euro;100 payment under the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  An extra &euro;67 million has been allocated for that scheme.  Some 60,000 children will also benefit from extra school meals.</p><p>I take on board the Senator's comments around the need to increase the capitation grant and to remove the voluntary contribution which, as we know, is not voluntary in many schools.  Anecdotally, we hear evidence that some schools put pressure on parents to pay that voluntary contribution in the full knowledge they cannot afford it.  We ask schools to be mindful of that, particularly in the context of the situation with which we are dealing.</p><p>I also take on board the Senator's comments about pension abatements.  It is an issue Senator Craughwell has raised on many occasions.  That would be an appropriate Commencement matter if the Senator would like to raise it.</p><p>The Senator also raised the issue of funding for IVF, which is a matter many Senators have raised, and the need to provide funding in budget 2023 to assist families that require IVF treatment.  We know that the World Health Organization classifies infertility as a disease.  It is one of the only diseases that we do not financially support individuals to deal with and get the treatment they need.</p><p>Senator Mullen asked for an amendment to No. 2, which I will not be able to accept.  I do, however, take on board his comments.  He spoke in particular about the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy, as did Senators Clifford-Lee and Craughwell.  Senator Craughwell referenced Senator Keogan in his contribution.  I was not present at the proceedings to which the Senators referred.  I know there have been some difficulties at the committee.  I agree with the points made by Senator Craughwell, albeit we were not a party to those proceedings.  It is important that all views are accommodated in both Houses and at committee meetings.  Senator Mullen spoke about the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of which he and I were members.  We had many debates that were quite fiery and where we disagreed.  We were on completely opposite sides.  It is important that all views are accommodated and listened to and that all debate is respectful.  I take on board Senator Ruane's comments that we should never seek to upset individuals, committee members or witnesses.  All debate should be respectful.  I am always mindful that if we were to go back 40 years, the views that I hold on the eighth amendment and abortion services would probably not have been facilitated to the extent they are today.  It is important that we accommodate people's views.  Even though I am in the majority today, that may not be the case at a time in the future so it is important that we ensure a balance.  We do not know at what stage things might change.</p></speech>

I know there are different views involved.  All Senators who have made points on the issue believe what they are saying even if others strongly disagree.  I know there are ongoing issues in that regard.  I will move on.</p> <p>Senator Hoey spoke about the demonstration relating to inequality for children outside today.  There are families still awaiting support.  I know Senator Clifford-Lee also spoke those issues.  Many of us are tied up today but perhaps as many Senators as possible could get out there, wish the protestors well and thank them for making the time to come to Leinster House and make us aware of those issues.</p> <p>Senator Black asked about the timeline for a Bill.  I suggest she submits a Commencement matter on the topic to see what the Minister is doing with the Bill and what stage it is at.  I do not have an answer and cannot provide a proposed timeline.  A Commencement matter might be best because that is quite a specific question.</p> <p>Senator Clifford-Lee welcomed the report of the surrogacy committee, which I have dealt with.</p> <p>Senator McDowell has proposed an amendment to No. 3.  I apologise but I am not in a position to accept it.  I take on board the comments that were made.  I have dealt with that issue.</p> <p>Senator Ruane made comments about witnesses at the surrogacy committee.  I acknowledge the points she has made and agree with her.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about RT&Eacute; long wave.  He has asked RT&Eacute; to maintain or extend the service for a little longer.  I take on board his comments.</p> <p>Senator Carrigy spoke as a member of the newly formed Joint Committee on Autism.  He spoke about the issue of summer provision which has come up on many occasions.  I suggest he submits a Commencement matter in that regard as it is quite a specific issue.</p> <p>Senator Lombard spoke about the retirement age for senior garda&iacute; and the brain drain that happens when we lose senior personnel.  He has requested a debate, which we will try to arrange for the autumn session.</p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke about the local issue of bus services in Limerick.  I have not been briefed about Dublin Coach, the private bus operator that has removed services.  I suggest the Senator contacts the Minister for Transport directly or submits a Commencement matter to seek further detail on that specific local issue.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about the Ahare River in north Wexford.  He has asked for the support and assistance of the Office of Public Works because there is a flooding issue.  I suggest he submits a Commencement matter on the topic, which is quite specific.  I have not been briefed on the details of the issue.  I take on board his comments about the Irish Athletic Boxing Association.  There are ongoing issues in respect of that organisation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, is doing a lot of work in that space.  </p> <p>Travel costs for public sector workers are becoming a serious issue.  As Members will be aware, approximately 80 cent is paid for a certain number of kilometres but that payment falls if somebody travels further.  The travel and subsistence allowance is not even covering the costs of public workers who are on the road as part of their jobs.  The costs of getting to work and doing the job are not covered.  Fuel prices have doubled.  For example, staff who are doing inspections for the Health and Safety Authority are on the road three to five days a week.  Their travel costs are not covering the cost of doing their jobs.  That needs to be addressed.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is mindful that any response cannot relate only to pay and that there are other areas where pressures on workers can be alleviated and the Government can assist with cost-of-living issues.</p> <p>Senator Dolan spoke about mental health and the work being done in the European Parliament.  It is not a competency of the European Parliament but at the same time, it is important that it is mindful of that important overarching work.  We have a lot of work to do domestically on mental health.  We are in a far better place than we were ten years ago and have come a long way.  I commend Maria Walsh MEP on her work in that area.  It is an important area of work to continue to highlight and to give a voice to those people.</p> <p>I am not in a position to accept Senator Boyhan's amendment to No. 4.  I take on board his comments about city and county councillors and the removal of those councillors from the boards of educational institutions.  They will be in a position to apply for those positions but it is not the same as having a set place for those councillors.  I have yet to hear the rationale or logic behind that decision.  Local elected members have a mandate to represent their local areas.  That is an important perspective to have on the board of a university or college that is operating in a municipal district or local authority area.  Members are representing the views of the locality and the people in the area in which the college is operating.  Theirs are important voices and I am not sure that has been properly considered by the Minister.  The Senator's views are agreed with across the House.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State back to the Chamber.  I had spoken to the majority of the amendments when we finished last week on this section.  I had not elaborated on amendment No. 62 so I will now speak briefly to that.  Amendment No. 62 seeks to include the provision that a registration authority may enter the name of a person on the pending elector list for the register of electors of a constituency of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in the scenario where the franchise is extended.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Again, this seeks to incorporate the reform we are hoping for into this Bill and to ensure that voters for the Seanad are offered the same opportunities to register to vote early as they are for the D&aacute;il.  A few weeks ago, we had young people in Leinster House talking about climate action.  I hope that by the time some of them are reaching the age at which they can vote, they will be entitled to vote in the Seanad elections and that they can preregister before they reach that age.</p><p>This amendment is perfectly sensible in that it prepares for the scenario where the Seanad is reformed.  To be honest, there is no reason that the Government should not accept this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-06a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022070600002#W00200"><p>I want to speak to the set of amendments that relate to Seanad reform.  Again, because time is unnecessarily constrained, I will be brief.  On the very first day of the last Oireachtas, we moved a Bill for Seanad reform.  That was back in 2016.  We were asked by the then Government, which included one of the parties still currently in government, to suspend our Bill so we would have a cross-party group who would work together in a committee to come up with cross-party legislation.</p> <p>A number of us who are here in this House, from all parties, including Senators Warfield, McDowell, Cassells, me and others, worked for hours and hours over eight months to develop legislation which was then voted on and agreed as cross-party legislation.  We delivered that to the Government, which promptly parked it.</p> <p>Coming into this Oireachtas, we were told again that progress would be made.  When we brought back that cross-party, agreed legislation on Seanad reform, we were told that these issues would be addressed as part of the Electoral Reform Bill - that was where it would be coming through, that is where action would be taken, that is where progress would be made.  Again, we have been disappointed and despite the fact there are a vast number of last-minute amendments on all kinds of issues that have been added into this Electoral Reform Bill, there is nothing about Seanad reform.</p> <p>I will not go through each of the amendments in turn because my colleague has done so.  These amendments would at least start preparing the ground for some of the measures in that agreed Seanad reform legislation, including things like preparing the register and preparing measures around nominations.  At a very minimum, amendment No. 54 simply asks that we would have, within 12 months, a report outlining exactly how long-promised Seanad reform was going to come about.</p> <p>I sometimes get tired of people saying the Seanad will not reform because it cannot reform.  The Seanad is very willing to reform itself and Members of this Seanad have been passionate about driving through reform.  Let us be very clear that it is the Government that has been blocking it systematically all the way.  Will the Minister of State at least agree to amendment No. 54, which makes a commitment that, within 12 months, clear measures would be put forward on how to deliver the promise from two different Governments to implement the Manning report?  If not, will the Minister of State support the Seanad reform Bill, if we bring it forward collectively together, since the Government has not chosen to take action on this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-06a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022070600002#W00300"><p>This is a subject which is very close to my heart.  When Members rise on the business of the House, they have some small amount of time, some three to six minutes or thereabouts, to express themselves on the issue.  It is well worthwhile to elaborate on what Senator Higgins has just said.</p> <p>The history of this is as follows, and let it be stitched into the record of this House.  At a time when his leadership of the Fine Gael Party was under strong pressure, the then leader of the party, Enda Kenny, fearing a heave, decided to come up with a gimmick.  The gimmick he decided to come up with was to announce, without any internal discussion whatsoever in the party, at a party dinner - I think it was in Citywest - that he was going to propose the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Many people in Fine Gael were astonished and shocked at this stunt, which it was, but that was his proposal.</p> <p>When he got into government, he duly prepared legislation to mutilate our Constitution, to leave large holes in it, to take away the supervisory role of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to scrap completely the idea of a second House and to amend the present Constitution, which at least gives this House a right of veto over any proposal to abandon our veto in the European Union.  All of that was to be swept away in order to satisfy the gimmicky stunt of abolition, which he had come up with without any pre-thought or pre-discussion.</p> <p>Let us remember what happened then.  The people of Ireland were told it was important to get rid of this House because it would save &euro;25 million per annum.  Of course, that was an inflated figure but it does not matter as that was what was run up on lampposts all over the country.  A cynical campaign was then launched to abolish Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I participated, with other people, in its defence on television, and I was at that stage not a Member of the Oireachtas at all.  I recall that the late Senator Feargal Quinn asked me to come and speak to Senators from right across the political spectrum in this House at a meeting he convened to discuss the proposal.  We had a discussion and many of the people who were Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann came along and expressed complete horror at the consequences of abolishing Seanad &Eacute;ireann as proposed.  Feargal Quinn, Katherine Zappone, who was then a Member of the House, Noel Whelan, former Senator Joe O'Toole and myself all got together to establish a group called Democracy Matters.  It successfully contested a referendum, in combination with the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, which opposed the proposal.</p> <p>The people of Ireland rejected the proposal to abolish Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The Taoiseach at the time, Enda Kenny, referred to the result as "a wallop".  It was a well-deserved smack across the face for the cynicism that had brought him to that point.  Let us be clear about what happened after that.  I should say that in the course of the campaign, he had said that if the people voted to retain it, he would not reform it at all.  He did not want the people to have that option of thinking it could be reformed.  However, he then did yet another U-turn and decided that he was going to institute a reform process.  He invited former Senator Maurice Manning to examine the whole process of reform without a further constitutional amendment, which he did.  I was very honoured to be asked by Joe O'Toole and Maurice Manning to assist them with the drafting of their report and to show what could be done within the terms of the present Constitution to make the election of this House more democratic.</p> <p>Having established this group, Mr. Kenny then went on to have another election, where he said that implementation of the Manning report would be part of the Government programme, and this was in combination with the Labour Party.  Having done that, he did precisely nothing - he did not lift a finger to bring that about.  Katherine Zappone, who was then a Government Minister in that Administration, pressed strongly at Cabinet that something should be done about this.  Eventually, there was a change of leader in Fine Gael and Deputy Leo Varadkar succeeded Enda Kenny.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the meantime, Senator Feargal Quinn had asked me to stand for the NUI constituency because he wanted to retire from politics.  To progress the Seanad reform project, it was agreed that an implementation group would be established.  The group was established and, as Senator Higgins said, it was all-party.  We set for ourselves, and we were given, terms of reference that were demanding.  Within eight months, we had to produce the legislation to give effect to the Manning report and to make any recommendations for its amendment to make it more acceptable.  We did all that work, and we went through every aspect of electing the Seanad.  Due to other things, there was quite a controversy about who should chair the group, but eventually it chose me as its chairperson.  I will not go into what the then Minister, former Deputy Shane Ross, did or did not attempt to do in respect of that matter.  </p><p>In the end, however, we produced our report.  More important than that, though, we decided that we would not just produce a report that could lie on some politician&rsquo;s table.  We asked for, and we were given, a professional parliamentary draftsman to embody our proposals in draft legislation.  The cost of doing that was borne by the Taoiseach's Department, with the agreement of the then Taoiseach, and present T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar.  We worked might and main to meet our deadlines.  It was a thoroughly democratic and inclusive process.  We listened to everybody and everybody participated.  Nobody was excluded or stigmatised as a minority person.  Everyone was free to participate in the production of the report.  We presented it, and I duly sent it to the Taoiseach in time and with the draft Bill attached to it.</p><p>Nothing happened for a couple of months.  Disturbed by that, I went to see the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, in his office to ask him what he intended to do in respect of the whole process of Seanad reform.  I want this House to know that he told me that he had no intention whatsoever of moving the legislation in the D&aacute;il, that he himself had supported the abolition of the Seanad and that the most he would do for the legislation, which was, of course, a sentence of death, was to allow a free vote on it if it was put forward by somebody else.  That is what the then Taoiseach said.  It was pretty cynical stuff.  As Senator Higgins said, we had worked for eight months.  We had done our level best to bring about a situation which I will describe as follows.</p><p>This House now has 43 Members elected by approximately 1,200 people, that is, county and city councillors, incoming Members of the Oireachtas and outgoing Senators.  In the Constitution, there is already provision for the franchise for the higher education seats in the Seanad, one of which I am honoured to occupy for the time being, to be widened to include other institutions apart from just the NUI colleges and Trinity College Dublin.  By the way, the Supreme Court has also accepted for consideration an appeal in litigation to consider whether there is a constitutional obligation to do something about the change in the Constitution that was made to allow for the extension of this higher education franchise.  Whether that litigation succeeds or not, and I doubt whether it is likely to do so in the courts, if we were to go down the road of allowing every higher education graduate in this country to have a vote, including those from the technological universities, the institutes of technology and all the established universities, the situation then, depending on what criteria were selected, would be that we would have an electorate of approximately 900,000 to perhaps 1,100,000 people.  They would be entitled to vote for six seats in this House, based on the increasing rate of participation in third level education.</p><p>Of course, that situation would leave out everybody without a university or third-level degree, including those people who are being encouraged by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and others, to take up apprenticeships.  It would exclude people who have never gone to university, people who have gone to work in businesses and people who have never been employed.  It would leave out a huge range of people.  People who came to Ireland with foreign university degrees would also have no say in the election of this House in such a situation, even if they became Irish citizens.  Of the 5.5 million people in the country now, or whatever the figure is, the situation I have described would leave about 80% of Irish people with no vote for these six higher education seats in the Seanad.  As time goes on, about 10% to 20% of people might have a vote on that panel.  Such a situation would also mean, however, that the other 43 seats would continue to be elected by roughly one thousandth of the electorate who would be voting for the six higher education seats.  If we were to say that there are approximately 1.2 million people eligible to vote for the six seats and then 1,200 councillors voting for the other 43 seats in this House, we get to that rough ratio of one in 1,000.  It would mean that a county councillor's vote would be worth 1,000 times any other citizen's vote to establish this House.</p><p>Our group came up with the simple proposal that, without changing the Constitution, it was quite lawful to extend the franchise to citizens who wished to be registered to vote in areas such as agriculture and the environment, culture and education, administration or industrial and commercial matters, if they were qualified on the higher education panels, however extended.  That proposal would ensure that everybody would be able to opt to have a vote in an area of interest to constitute Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  That is a radical proposal, but it is not all that radical when we think about it.  In fact, it is worthy of a republic that every one of its citizens should be regarded as equally entitled, in some respect, to participate in the selection of the Upper House.</p><p>People who vote for Senator Higgins and for me, who are a small minority, should not be a privileged few.  Everybody should have the right to vote in this context, if they chose to do so.  Many university graduates never even register to vote and those registers are hopelessly out of date and messy to function with.  In the context of our group's proposal, however, everybody was to have an opportunity to have some input into the constitution of this House.</p><p>This is the situation embodied in the legislation we brought before this House.  It was drafted at the Government&rsquo;s expense.  Despite the cynical game playing that went on to leave it on the shelf as soon as it was drafted, the legislation was drafted with the intention I spoke of and to bring all that about.  It was presented in this House by its proponents.  This Government, which had flooded the House with its own appointees and that had scrapped the idea that people from Northern Ireland or the diaspora would be included among the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees, was so anxious to fill up available candidacies in marginal seats that it simply was not even willing to allow the Bill that we put before this House to progress.  The Government put down an amendment to the proposal for the Second Stage reading of the Bill to postpone it for 12 months.  That period has now well and truly elapsed.  It elapsed during the Covid-19 period.</p><p>I will record what happened then.  I have the greatest respect for the Minister of State, and I know he is sincere in this matter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It became clear he proposed to stall the legislative process for the Bill, with the Government having paid for its drafting.  Let us remember exactly what happened then.  He made it clear to this House he would come back with his own proposals, and the deadline passed more than a year ago.  It may have passed 14 months ago now and it was a deadline he set for himself to formulate proposals for reform.  I spoke to him about the matter because he contacted me and wanted to explain his position.  He told me he would do the following.  He said he would not consult everybody again but would set up a committee of Members of the Oireachtas from the Government parties, which are Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, to come up with their variant of the Manning report and associated proposals.  He told me the committee would meet in rapid order and have its conclusions ready by the early autumn of last year.</p><p>I have duly inquired of all Government parties whether anybody has ever heard of a proposal to do that or have such a group or meetings.  It has not happened.  Of course, I was sold a pup, having meekly made an assumption.  I indicated to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, at the time that I took in good faith what he said to the House were his instructions as to the Minister's intention.  I still believe the Minister of State acted in good faith and he believed the undertakings his senior Minister made to this House.</p><p>The Minister has not delivered, however, and he has never even bothered to lift the phone to explain why he has not delivered.  He never established that group and, as cynically as the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, simply ignored the matter and come up with the notion that, somehow, this legislation had to be prioritised over it.  There is no reason they should not proceed in tandem or this legislation could not have paved the way for Seanad reform.  There is not even a hint of Seanad reform in the legislation, and from this I draw the fair deduction, in fairness to the Government parties, that they do not intend to lift a finger to reform this House during this session.</p><p>I know the Green Party asked for Seanad reform to be included in the negotiations for the formation of the current Government and it was pl&aacute;m&aacute;sed too.  It seems to have fallen for the idea that something would be done but we would not have the recommendations of the Manning report brought into law in the form proposed in the legislation.</p><p>I put on record that what the Government has contrived to do is keep this House exactly as it was and offer no reform of any kind whatever.  It will continue the position where 1,200 people will elect 43 Members of this House and toy around with that process.  Senator Malcolm Byrne has toyed with legislation to extend the university franchise.  I realise the generosity of his spirit but I wonder how it is he could not think about expanding his own electorate in an equal way.  As I have said, the result is a two-tier society where on an entirely artificial basis people who hold certain diplomas from certain educational bodies would be given the opportunity to elect Members to six seats.  In any view of the matter, for the foreseeable future they are a small minority of the total population of the country.</p><p>I am a university Senator and the legislation we put forward respected that referendum result, doing its best to implement the outcome by putting up two models for consideration, both a majority and minority perspective.  The former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, recently spoke about the idea of directly elected mayors and his comments made much sense.  From what I can see is happening in Limerick, a job specification is being prepared that for a five-year term will make no difference at all.  The chief executive of Limerick City and County Council is to be redesignated the director general so the Custom House rule will continue to exist no matter what.</p><p>Mr. Ahern criticised the directly elected mayor proposal, making the point very simply that people would be elected as personality or single-issue candidates etc. and they would have to carry out a very complex function.  He implied the whole thing would be a sham.  He told the citizens' assembly that was his view and, God bless him, there is much to be said for the views he expressed.  If there are 1.2 million people addressing one ballot paper, or even if that is divided into two or three ballot papers, in order to elect six Senators, it would have the same effect.  One would have to be a household name to the power of n to have any chance to get elected in a single national constituency of 1.2 million people.  I do not know who would be elected but the process would certainly not be in the tradition of Garrett FitzGerald, John Kelly, Feargal Quinn and the others of the same ilk, such as James Dooge.  These were people who came from the university sector and brought that third level education perspective to debates.</p><p>I will not comment on the Order of Business that we had the dispute about today.  It now appears the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, having come here to say he would not guillotine anything and that he would give us as much time as we wanted, has told the Leader that his Bill to reform the third level sector must be rushed through effectively today and in one more day in four hours.  That is the kind of attitude we have, although it is a slightly irrelevant point.</p><p>The history of Fine Gael in particular with regard to Seanad reform has been shameful and cynical.  First, the party proposed to abolish the Seanad without any internal party discussion.  It sought to set up the Manning committee and the implementation group before, in private, saying there was no intention to do anything about it.  It is cynical and the public is entitled to know about it.  I could be given two or three minutes on the Order of Business to make these comments but I needed a bit more time.  The only time I am getting is through the amendments of Senator Higgins.  She would concur with me that the picture I have painted is a fair and reasonable one and not overly dramatised.  The depth of cynicism I have encountered on this is shocking.</p><p>A party that does this deserves bad luck and the way opinion polls are going, it will get that bad luck.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-06a.123" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022070600002#Z00200"><p>I thank all the Senators for their contributions.  I will make a general point on the discussion we have had.  I wholeheartedly support the notion of Seanad reform.  There was not a commitment to it in the programme for the Government.  It is a three-party programme for Government negotiated with three parties in good faith.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, gave a commitment to examine the issue further and I will be happy to take up that matter with my colleague.</p> <p>Our imperative here is to get this legislation passed.  It is critically important we establish the electoral commission from which will stem significant political reform and wider participation of the public and minority groups, in particular, in our democratic processes and system, about which Senator McDowell has spoken so eloquently.  I appreciate the frustration he expressed but, from the Government&rsquo;s perspective, it is critically important to get the commission established and have the legislation passed.</p> <p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 25, 36, 40, 53, 54 and 62 tabled by Senators Higgins, Ruane, Flynn and Black, which are in respect of the franchise for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Amendments Nos. 25, 36 and 40 propose to give an coimisi&uacute;n new additional functions in reviewing the electoral system, constituencies and franchise for Seanad &Eacute;ireann as well as the criteria by which the Taoiseach may nominate a person as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  While I understand the motivations for these amendments, I cannot accept them.</p> <p>The approach to the initial functions of an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in is balanced.  It brings in established functions that are relatively self-contained from the outset, as well as a significant suite of new functions, namely, the new research, advisory and public education function, online political advertising and oversight of the electoral register.  These initial functions give an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in a solid foundation and allow it to build up its organisational and operational capacity gradually.  In addition, we will benefit from having an coimisi&uacute;n up and running, while at the same time making the preparations for new additional functions to be transferred.  I am of the view that an coimisi&uacute;n is taking on a significant number of both new and existing electoral functions from the outset.  I am mindful of the need for an coimisi&uacute;n to get established and build up organisational capacity.  I do not intend to add to these functions at the present time.</p> <p>Amendment No. 53 seeks to establish an electoral register for Seanad &Eacute;ireann, which would be maintained by an coimisi&uacute;n, and proposes to extend the franchise for the Seanad to Irish citizens who are resident in Ireland, citizens residing outside the State who hold a current and valid passport, to those entitled to Irish citizenship in Northern Ireland and to citizens holding a requisite qualification and who are graduates of an institution of higher education in this State as well as serving Members of the D&aacute;il, Members of the outgoing Seanad and serving members of local authorities.  This would mean the Seanad would have a significantly wider franchise than is in place for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  At a D&aacute;il election, only Irish and British citizens ordinarily resident in a constituency who are aged 18 or over can vote.  This amendment would create dual registers, one held by an coimisi&uacute;n and the other held by local authorities.  This is unnecessary duplication and would require careful consideration.</p> <p>As the Senators are aware, Part 3 provides for significant modernisation of the electoral registration process.  It would be prudent to allow this modernisation work to be completed.  For the foregoing reasons, I must oppose amendment No. 53.</p> <p>Amendment No. 54 requires the Minister to submit a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas within 12 months of the passing of the Act outlining measures taken to reform the electoral franchise for the vocational panels and for universities constituencies of the Seanad as well as the criteria applied to the nomination of Members for Seanad &Eacute;ireann under Article 18 of the Constitution.  The Bill does not provide that the Minister would have a role in reporting to the Oireachtas on electoral matters.  In fact, with the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in, we will now have an independent statutory body which can made recommendations and provide advice regarding electoral matters.  This is specifically provided for in Chapter 9 of Part 2 of the Bill, which sets out in detail the research, advisory and voter education functions of an coimisi&uacute;n.  I do not propose to depart from the general principles set out in the Bill regarding research and advice on electoral matters and I am therefore not in a position to accept the amendment.</p> <p>Amendment No. 62 seeks to amend section 94 of the existing Bill and to allow a registration authority to enter the name of a person on the pending electoral list in the register of electors of a constituency of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in the scenario where the franchise for such elections is extended.  Section 94 provides for the preregistration of 16- and 17-year-olds on the pending electors list and the inclusion of these persons on the register when they turn 18 years.  Currently, registration authorities do not manage the electoral register for Seanad &Eacute;ireann elections.  I note this proposed amendment is framed on a conditional basis to provide for a circumstance in which the franchise for such elections has been extended.  The extension of the franchise in elections for Seanad &Eacute;ireann would in itself require legislation to have effect.  That would be the appropriate time for this type of arrangement or similar to be considered.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

There is not even a promise that the commission will engage with this issue.  Rather, we are being told the reform of the Seanad franchise is not even being considered as part of the agenda for the electoral commission.  That completely contradicts much of what we have heard.</p> <p>I will not reiterate everything we have heard about the pretty shameful timeline and various obfuscations in regard to this but I will make one point.  When we had the first referendum in 1979, people voted to extend the franchise of the university electorate.  We have now had two referendums.  When people voted to retain the Seanad, we had people who did not have a vote in the Seanad voting to maintain it because they recognised the crucial role it plays in dealing with legislation in this State.  It was an expression of choice by the public, every voter in this country, in a referendum indicating they wanted the Seanad and to have a say in it.  The title of that campaign was "Open it, Don't close it".  Every Seanad since has been in place on sufferance of the fact that the public gave a mandate for reform.  To move past that, glibly dismiss it, put it on the long finger and say the Government has loads of issues to deal with when all kinds of other issues have been added to the electoral commission&rsquo;s work, including the running of lotteries, is unacceptable.  To say that one half of the legislative process in the Oireachtas and making sure every person in Ireland has a vote and say in who represents them in these crucial discussions is not a priority and should not even be on the agenda for the new electoral commission is unacceptable.</p> <p>I urge the Minister of State to look to the other amendments to the section.  He has brought forward amendments.  There would be no delay to the passage of the legislation if, for example, he were to bring forward an amendment at least setting out a pathway to Seanad reform.  If this Bill passes without any reference to Seanad reform, that will be a mark on the Government and one to be remembered and noted.  I am very disappointed we do not have progress on this.  I may seek to change the functions I would give to the electoral commission on Report Stage, and I will reserve that right.  The functions, as I have set them out, are constructive.  I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

I note that I think there is considerable detail.  I do not know if we will get to the amendments on it.  There are many technical issues in the amendments that have been brought forward around online disinformation, transparency in advertising and so forth, which I may seek to amend on Report Stage.  I am concerned about whether the information around demonstrating who is purchasing and paying for advertisements will be visible enough.  I am concerned as well about measures being brought forward in this Bill which we were told could not be brought forward in the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 because they relate to the EU services directive.  All kinds of definitions which were ruled out of order in the context of that Bill are being brought forward here.  I am very concerned at the lack of conversation about the fact that this Bill is failing to address the political purposes concerned, as highlighted already by my colleague, Senator Ruane.  The Minister has acknowledged a fact and anomaly that the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, acknowledged as a major problem as recently as a couple of months ago.  The failure to address that in this Bill has been used as a justification for allowing the same mistake to be made again in the brand new legislation that is the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022.  I deplore the fact that there has been such a lack of communication between the two Departments on those matters.</p></speech>

Without making any judgment about all of them, important amendments are being made to legislation which concerns everybody in this country.  Some of them relate to very important issues, such as media manipulation and the use of social media.  However, the Leader of this House stood up to propose, without any notice to the Opposition Whips, Leaders or anybody else, that a two-hour period was being provided for a discussion of all of the amendments, both Opposition and Government.  It means that we are now in a position that even as planned, without the voting on the Order of Business, there was less than two minutes provided for many of the amendments.</p> <p>I could call a vote on this section to express further disgust at what has been done to this House.  I am not denying that this is urgent legislation which should be enacted quickly, but I see no reason an Order of Business should have been proposed to effectively guarantee that vast swathes of this legislation go through the Committee Stage without anybody having any opportunity to comment on it one way or the other, or to ask any questions about it.  To do that is to trample on the democratic function of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is unconstitutional, in concept, to bring in a series of Government amendments, fling them at us in this House and then say to us that at 2.45 p.m., they are all deemed to have been passed without one of them having been discussed.  That is totally wrong.</p> <p>One can sympathise with the notion of keeping Seanad &Eacute;ireann in existence, but if a Government comes in here and uses a majority on the Order of Business to say that a vast number of amendments to our law will become part of the legislation that goes back to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann - where one can be absolutely certain the guillotine will be used - for rubber-stamping before that Chamber rises for the summer, these important parts of our electoral law will be just changed and amended with no real discussion or examination in either House.  That is what this Government is doing.  I protest it very strongly.</p> <p>I could ask for a vote on this to waste a few more minutes and mark my sense of disgust and revulsion at what is being done to this important legislation.  I could do it but I will not because I honour the Minister of State, whom I consider a decent man.  I know he is trying to do his best.  However, what is being done to this House, not merely by doing nothing about Seanad reform but by treating this House as if it is some kind of ATM into which the Government puts its card and gets out a Bill without anyone discussing the great majority of the amendments that it is putting before the House, is wrong and I protest it.</p></speech>

The point was made by Senator Higgins that the possibility is there.  Yes, it is tasked with quite an amount of work.  We have already spent five and a half hours on this.  We will have had seven and a half hours in total.  I absolutely respect the points made by Senator McDowell but there has been considerable time given, quite rightly.  At the last session, we discussed quite extensively the reduction of the voting age which is considerably important.  There are young people in the Public Gallery this afternoon.  It was quite right that we had such an extensive discussion.  We have given extensive time to this.  I agree with the Senator that it is vitally important.</p></speech>

It is important that we ensure we are expanding our democracy and expanding access to, awareness of and participation in our democracy.  I should note that we have other amendments which I will bring forward on Report Stage and I hope to get to discuss today.  They look to strengthen some of the measures in terms of gender equality in both representation and participation in electoral processes.  Of course I strongly support the amendments put forward earlier in this debate with regard to voting at 16.  As part of an expansion of the franchise, and given the immense significance of the decisions that are being made which affect their lives, young people should be supported to begin voting at 16.</p><p>These amendments address a few more specific issues in terms of access to and participation in information around referendums and elections.  Amendment No. 29 is a plain language requirement which says that when the commission publishes information on materials about a referendum, there should be a plain language version of such information campaigns.  Many people in the community can sometimes be dissuaded from engaging by complex or inaccessible language.  If a decision affects people's lives, it should be communicated to them in plain English and in a way that is clear and understandable to them, in terms of access and inclusion.</p><p>Amendment No. 31 is similar.  It proposes to delete the phrase, &quot;as far as practicable&quot;, from the section of the Bill which provides &quot;as far as practicable that the means employed enable those with a sight or hearing disability to read or hear the statements concerned&quot;.  In fact, it is important that people have the right to hear and have access to these statements.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A limit of practicability is not appropriate in something so significant.  It should be borne in mind that Irish Sign Language, for example, is a recognised language in this State and indeed Article 9 the UNCRPD refers to persons with a disability being able to participate fully in all aspects of public life, including electoral ones.  Again, the baseline is full participation and not an aspiration towards participation and, therefore, amendment No. 31 is important.</p><p>Amendment No. 30 is minor in that sense.  It simply clarifies material should be published, including by the use of television, radio and other electronic media to ensure again that we have as wide a reach as possible and that we are not just technically publishing information but are, in fact, seeking to ensure the information reaches as wide a swathe of the population as possible.  Again, all these amendments are in the spirit of strengthening access to key information.  It is also important to note that online measures are certainly not sufficient given Ireland has one of the highest rates of digital illiteracy in the EU, according to the Digital Economy and Society Index.  That we have 40% of people in this State who do not necessarily have digital skills is something that gets forgotten.  Having information online will not be sufficient for them and that is why they must be supported to ensure they can participate fully in decision-making and electoral processes via full access to information.</p></speech>

It is important and something we all want to achieve.  These amendments seek to amend existing provisions in order that, first, as part of an coimisi&uacute;n's referendum functions, the statement it prepares and publishes to explain the subject matter of referendums be published in plain language; that is amendment No. 29.  Second, amendment No. 30 proposes that print media be explicitly mentioned in the forms of media to which an coimisi&uacute;n has regard to and the distribution of these statements.  Third, amendment No. 31 proposes that the phrase "as far as practicable" be removed from the section's requirement that the means employed for the distribution of an coimisi&uacute;n's statements explaining the subject matter of referendums enable those with a sight or hearing disability to read or hear the statements concerned.</p> <p>On amendment No. 29, the matter of an coimisi&uacute;n's public information material explaining referendums is an issue of best practice and an administrative matter for it rather than a matter to be addressed in primary legislation.  Notwithstanding this, the referendum commissions from which this function is transferring have regard to a strong blueprint for ensuring the accessibility and ease of comprehension of such material.  For example, in respect of previous referendums, versions of the referendum guide were produced in Braille, Irish Sign Language, video, audio, large print format and easy-to-read format for people with intellectual disabilities.  I am confident these practices will be carried over and developed by an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in when it takes up its role.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 relate to the publication and distribution of an coimisi&uacute;n's statements, which explain the subject matter of referendums, and are a direct transposition of section 3(1)(b) of the Referendum Act 1998.  It is not proposed to accept the amendments as the general approach has been taken of avoiding the amendment of transposed legislation, save where necessary to take account of a transferring function or new organisational context, and the section as it stands provided that an coimisi&uacute;n may publish and distribute statements relating to a referendum in such a manner and by such means, including the use of television, radio or other electronic media.  As such, it is not limiting an coimisi&uacute;n to particular formats.  It provides flexibility for an coimisi&uacute;n to publish statements by any forms of media it considers appropriate, and this includes print media.</p></speech>

The Bill has been amended by the Government and, therefore, it is going back to the D&aacute;il.  It is not clear to me why the amendments are not being accepted.</p> <p>I am thinking in particular of amendment No. 31 because the legislation stating "as far as practicable" is a problem.  That is not sufficient with respect to the UNCRPD.  The fact the commission may exceed that and may indeed ensure everybody has access to the information in all the different ways is by the by.  The fact is the Government is bound by the UNCRPD and its legislation, including this legislation, should reflect the convention.  It is not simply enough for the Minister of State to pass the buck and say he is sure a future electoral commission will consider it.  The fact is he has something in this legislation that simply says that kind of access should be as far as practicable rather than that kind of access to information being a right.  Again, after we ratified the UNCRPD, the Government should not have legislation that equivocates about full participation and full access to information.  It should not be in the legislation.</p> <p>I am probably not going to press these now because I urge the Minister of State to think between today and tomorrow, review this, look back and ask why exactly these amendments are not being accepted.  I do not see any good reason they would not be accepted and see a number of problems with the fact they are not being accepted.  I will bring these back on Report Stage and will press them at that point.</p></speech>

Thus, we are already doing that.  The referendum commission ethos in that regard will transfer to the electoral commission as well.  Importantly, we have throughout this had strong engagement with various organisation, including the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, on accessibility and inclusion, especially at polling stations, etc.  We, therefore, have a strong drive to ensure full inclusivity for all members of society.

This seems an unnecessarily restrictive and bureaucratic approach to the register of political parties.  Part of the purpose of the Bill is to instil greater confidence among the public in our electoral processes and, by extension, our political system.  In this context, having the register easily accessible and published on the website is a very simple and straightforward ask.  It would be important in ensuring access to the register as opposed to something that may be permitted by the registrar at a point in time.</p><p>Amendment No. 33 seeks to extend the call to publish the register on the commission's website.  It asks that details relating to individual parties also be published.  These could include the constitution or written rules of a party.  It is very simple and straightforward.  Almost every political party has a constitution or set of rules.  Publishing these would be important to bring greater transparency and increase confidence in, and understanding of, how parties operate.  Most of us here are members of political parties.  If we want people to join parties, this information should be freely accessible.  It is freely accessible from some parties and less so from others.  It is a very simple ask that we have the rules of a party published on the website.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this amendment.</p></speech>

They are very basic.  This is about transparency and openness.  Surely no one has a difficulty with this.  The amendments are worthy of support.  I would like to think the Minister of State has given them consideration.  With no disrespect to the Minister of State, for any Minister to read a piece of paper and tell us something is not possible is not good parliamentary engagement.  I am challenging the Minister of State on this.  These are very obvious basic asks.  I am sure the Minister of State will stand up with a pink or white note in his hand and read it.  I ask him to dump it and tell us he has listened to the debate.  The Minister of State is not here just to give messages from the public servants and I mean no disrespect to them.  I know he is someone who thinks outside the box and I respect him for it.  He cannot argue with these two very basic asks.  I hope he will use his functions and the powers vested in him to support them.</p></speech>

In order to register as a political party it is necessary to come up with a constitution or memorandum.  It has to be given to the registrar under this regime.  It seems the public is entitled to know how a party is constituted.  There are questions such as whether a certain class of membership has a veto over decisions.  If a party is going to have a public profile, the public is entitled to see exactly who in it rules the roost and who elects its leader.  People are entitled to know whether all votes in a party are the same.  I do not need to elaborate.  I believe there is no harm in allowing in that little bit of daylight.  I have knowledge in a professional capacity and I will not elaborate any further-----</p></speech>

It might be closer to the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s home than to mine.  Nobody could get the rules for the purposes of deciding the case.  They could not go to the head office and obtain a copy of the rules.  I know this situation has obtained for some time.  It is bad enough for a member of the party not to be able to know the rules.  If I am voting for a group of people who are organised in a particular way, surely I am entitled to know how they are organised and who calls the shots in the party.</p> <p>Given that existing political parties will be deemed to be registered in any event, what we are doing is introducing a requirement that newly registered political parties will have to prove that the organisation and direction of the party are governed by a constitution, memorandum of association, other documents or written rules adopted by the party that provide for what is set out in section 44.  Given this is the case, why can we not know?  What possible reason could there be?  If a party&rsquo;s rules are changed, with different people in it having different powers, it should be made public.  I cannot see any good reason it should not be done.  No case can be made for privacy with regard to a party's rules.</p></speech>

It is a variation of amendment No. 32, with a slight change as it mentions an annual basis and an accessible format.  If the Minister of State will not accept my amendment, I urge him to accept the amendments tabled by the Labour Party.  They are both very reasonable and based on the same principle.  The register of political parties should not have arcane knowledge for reference, for officials or for those who know how to exercise freedom of information requests.  It should be a matter of public information.  This is the public's decision-making process.  It is about electoral processes.  It should be public.  Moreover, it should be accessible on the website.</p> <p>With regard to the point made on a party&rsquo;s constitution and memorandum of understanding, the Minister of State&rsquo;s response will be a sign as to whether there is any willingness to engage.  The amendment is so obviously clear and it is a good idea that the information would be made available.  This is important for a number of reasons.  It is important so that if a candidate from a party is presenting as a single issue candidate the public can look to the party&rsquo;s constitution and see what its wider perspective might be.  This is very important.  We have been speaking about disinformation.  We need to speak about information being clear and available.</p> <p>On the other side, it is also very important because if people see the constitution and rules of a party and how it works, they might see themselves being involved in politics.  They would be able to see some of the democracy in parties.  They could imagine, for example, what they might be able to do or how they might be able to influence the party for change.  This is also very important.</p> <p>The electoral commission has a function in information and education, and later I will discuss amendments in this regard.  There is a function for the electoral commission in civics, social and political education in our schools.  Every classroom in Ireland should be able to look at the register of political parties, practise reading the rules and constitutions of the parties and gain an understanding of the decisions people might be making.</p> <p>Amendment No. 33 is incredibly sensible.  I urge the Minister of State to support it and to support either amendment No. 32 tabled by the Labour Party or my amendment No. 34 to ensure the register of political parties is published and made available to the public.</p></speech>

These amendments were previously tabled by Deputy Nash on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Currently, the maintenance of the register of political parties is the responsibility of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  In terms of the register being available for inspection, section 25C(2) of the Electoral Act 1992, as amended by section 11 the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, requires that the register be made available for inspection at the registrar's office.  However, in practice, the registrar publishes it on the Oireachtas website.</p> <p>When bringing existing electoral functions over to an coimisi&uacute;n in this Bill, I have taken a general approach of endeavouring to bring them over intact.  However, in this instance I have removed the 1992 Act stipulation that the register be made available for inspection at the offices of the registrar, making the text in section 51 of this Bill more general so that it does not contain an implication that the register is a physical document which must be inspected at the registrar's office.  I am satisfied that this empowers an coimisi&uacute;n to publish the register on its website, as intended in amendments Nos. 32 and 34.</p> <p>In respect of amendment No. 33, while I support transparency in how political parties are governed, I am conscious of the burdens on an coimisi&uacute;n in getting established and building up experience and organisational capacity.  This is consistent with what we have been stated in response to a number of amendments.  On balance, I am of the view that this is not the time to make a change to the content of the register.  I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-06a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022070600002#DD00400"><p>I have to say I am disappointed by that response.  If a political party is organised on the basis that a small group of people effectively determine everything, even who can or cannot be a candidate, who can be selected or deselected, who can join the party or be booted out of the party, or whatever, the public is entitled to know that.  The scheme of the legislation at present is that the public is not entitled to know that.  The only person who is entitled to know what goes on within a party's rules is the registrar, who has to satisfy himself or herself that there is an annual conference and some kind of executive body elected by the members in whatever way the party chooses, which means there can be different classes of members electing.  I have no problem with parties giving more weight to some people in some contexts, such as leadership votes, but the people are entitled to know that.  If people are to be obliged to satisfy the registrar that they have rules for some purposes, I cannot see any reason that the public should not be able to see what the rules of a party are.</p> <p>If the rules of a party were to change in a dramatically undemocratic direction so as to give one person, for example, the leader of a party or the chairman of its national executive of a party, the right to veto A, B and C or to decide who will or will not be candidates, or whatever, the public is entitled to know all of that.  I plead with the Minister of State to take this matter seriously before Report Stage.  If he has a quibble with the phraseology of the amendment, so be it.  The principle is simple.  A party has to come along with its rules to get registered.  Presumably, there is something to be said for having a party that has amended its rules inform somebody that the rules under which it originally registered are no longer the rules.  The public is entitled to know that.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this matter before Report Stage, allow the public to see exactly how every political party is organised, for example, whether there is an ard comhairle, a national executive or whatever, and let people work out where the power exists in any party.</p></speech>

It is worthy of note by Seanad &Eacute;ireann in view of the tragic consequences of that epidemic.  I would like also to recognise and thank my colleague, the vice-chancellor of University of Dublin, Dr. Se&aacute;n Barrett, who is with us today in the Visitors Gallery.  He is a distinguished former Member of this House and has provided me with a considerable number of amendments, not all of which I imagine we will reach today.</p> <p>The Bill is all about accountability and responsibility, giving people explanations and allowing them to know what is happening.  I am sure the Minister, who is a decent and open-hearted man, will agree with this.  The Seanad, as a review Chamber, is absolutely vital to us today in our democracy.</p></speech>

This is about autonomy.  Trinity College Dublin, TCD, in particular, has a very distinguished historical background, as, of course, has Maynooth University, which was founded in the days before Catholic Emancipation.  The Bill is a power grab of the permanent Government in Ireland - the powerful, senior bureaucracy.  What started as a review of the first 50 years of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has today become an attack on the university sector, which is 430 years old.  It is a sector that has served Ireland well and should not be under attack in this Bill.  I remind the House that the TCD features in the list of the most distinguished universities in the world.  It is compiled every year or so.  The Bill has not been widely debated in either the universities or wider society because of a democratic deficit.  Debate in our universities has been prevented for two and a half years because of Covid-19 restrictions.  In the fullness of debate for which the Irish universities are famed, this legislation, if needed at all, would have been improved by debate on every campus in the country.  Again, this is about openness and accountability.  Recently, the Taoiseach called for a controversial appointment at TCD to be paused.  This Bill should also be paused, as in the words of the Taoiseach.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Far too few people have been involved in its preparation.  The Bill proposes layers of extra bureaucracy in the HEA and in the colleges on the assumption that Irish universities underperform and that the Bill offers a cure in this regard.  Irish universities and colleges do not underperform.  The Bill&rsquo;s prescriptions are so badly grounded that they are likely to harm a sector that has served the island of Ireland and the world of learning so well.  I speak as a representative of a college that has provided three Nobel prize winners in recent decades, namely, Samuel Beckett, Ernest Walton and William Campbell.  We are very proud of them.</p><p>Let me add to the cheeriness of this debate.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, reported on 29 November 2021 that Irish participation in third-level education, at 63%, is higher than the EU average.  This, again, is something of which we can be proud.  We have always been known as the island of saints and scholars.  In the dark days of the early 19th century, when there were hedge schools, people showed their devotion to learning.  In fact, many people, including ragged children in the ditches, were able to understand and read Latin and Greek, which was a remarkable achievement.</p><p>In its 2019 education report, the OECD reported that young Irish people have the fourth highest standard of education in the world.  Ireland is now a full-employment economy with, as IDA Ireland companies report, a strong pool of skilled and diverse talent.  Year after year, the IDA reports that the skilled and talented Irish labour force is the main reason Ireland attracts so much foreign direct investment and so successfully serves the European Single Market.  In recent days, the T&aacute;naiste has announced a review of industrial policy.  Perhaps he and the Minister, who are rumoured to be rivals within the Government should-----</p></speech>

IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland firms employ some 475,000 people.  The agencies do not appoint people to the boards of the enterprises they finance.  The reward to Irish society is the employment they create, rather than seats on these companies' boards.  Should the reward to Irish society from successful universities, such as TCD and others, be the graduates they produce rather than a handful of seats on governing bodies?</p><p>On the international stage, Irish degrees and qualifications are eagerly sought after.  Irish graduates are welcome entrants to the great graduate schools of the world as they pursue postgraduate qualifications of the highest rank.  Irish third-level education is decentralised, diverse and serves its students and society well.  It is flexible, student-centred, international and, heretofore, reasonably bureaucrat-free.  This Bill is bureaucratically intense and based on quangos.  It sits uneasily in this parliamentary democracy.  It proposes to reduce the number of people democratically elected to the governing bodies of universities and asks our democratic Parliament to support reducing the role of the ballot box.  Elected academics, elected non-academic staff and elected students are to be reduced in numbers, to be replaced by others whose route to the governing bodies is not specified by this legislation.  Why should the Oireachtas agree to this?</p><p>The Bill seeks to amend charters and letters patent which predate the foundation of the State.  The Ceann Comhairle's request that these documents be lodged in the Oireachtas Library to be consulted by Members was rejected by the Minister.  Why?  The Minister is looking puzzled, so perhaps there is an explanation.  Perhaps he does not know, or perhaps there is somebody lower down the chain who refused to put those documents in the library.  It would be interesting if the Minister were to be able to get an answer to this for me.</p><p>Respect for the Chair is a bulwark of our democracy.  There is a total disparity between the position of the Minister, who has advised that charters and letters patent can be readily emended, and those who believe that charters and letters patent are binding on both parties in perpetuity.  The latter viewpoint was strongly expressed in the US Supreme Court judgment in the Dartmouth College case in 1819, which overturned state intervention in the governance of that college.  Members should have been allowed to peruse these documents.</p><p>My amendment seeks to delete these lines on pages 11 and 12 of the Bill: &quot;This Act, other than <i>sections 85</i>, <i>86</i>,<i>87</i>,<i>95</i>,<i>97</i>,<i>98</i>,<i>99</i>,<i>100</i>,<i>101</i>,<i>102</i>,<i>103 </i>and <i>105</i>, shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may by order or orders appoint either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so appointed for different purposes or different provisions&quot;.</p></speech>

I qualify that welcome, however, with the following.  When we were on Second Stage of this Bill, I and Senator Craughwell drew to the Minister&rsquo;s attention that this was an important Bill, far-reaching in its consequences, and that it could not be rushed through.  To be particular about what was said, I said: </p> <blockquote> 	This Bill needs very serious further consideration.  It should not be guillotined and it should not be rushed through. </blockquote> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the fact that even the Minister&rsquo;s own speech was reduced to 15 minutes.  He continued by saying that he sincerely hoped:</p> <blockquote> 	...we do not go down the silly route of guillotining the Bill at some stage before the end of the session.  We can always come back to it in September. </blockquote> <p>It might be thought that those were reasonable requests.  In reply, the Minister said:</p> <blockquote> 	Unlike in the other House, I am not a Member here.  The Seanad orders its business as the Members wish to order its business.  I am here to genuinely engage in good faith.  We genuinely engaged on the issue in the D&aacute;il.  We did not just come in and use our D&aacute;il majority to say, &quot;Thanks very much, good night and good luck.&quot;  We brought forward 179 amendments.  While they were all brought forward in my name, bar one, many of them arose from Opposition contributions </blockquote> <p>Later, the Minister said:</p> <blockquote> 	... as I mentioned earlier.  I am here to engage in good faith.  It will take the time that it takes, and we will work our way through it.  I would not be so rude, as a Member of the Lower House, to try to tell the Upper House how to do its business. </blockquote> <p>The Minister then stated, &quot;We took steps in the D&aacute;il, which I am sure we will be able to tease through on Committee and Report Stages, to further strengthen the importance of autonomy&quot;.  This is what the Minister said in this House.</p></speech>

She indicated that she had asked for time on this legislation.  I believe the Minister is right to come back on this.  If we go back to look over the comments, it will be clear.  She did indicate that there is a significant amount of legislation to be dealt with and the Bills Office is under pressure.  The Cathaoirleach also spoke to that issue.</p></speech>

This House reached out to my office today.  My office said I would make myself available tomorrow but I was told that would not work for the Seanad.  My office told the Seanad that I would make myself available on Friday but I was told that would not work for the Seanad.

With respect to colleagues, the Act dates from 1971.  We are dealing with the higher education system of 2022 and into to the future, not that of 1971 or, with respect, 1592.  This is not a question in respect of the academic autonomy of institutions.  These are questions relating to governance, particularly with regard to financial accountability.  It is important that is the case.  We have already had Second Stage of the Bill, when there is an opportunity to make general statements.  If we are going to debate the amendments that have been tabled, let us do so.  I hope colleagues will ensure that eloquence replaces verbosity when it comes to dealing with the amendments.

Senator Malcolm Byrne pointed out that it has been 50 years since there was last a Bill on this matter.  That is all the more reason that, in dealing with an important Bill of this kind, we should not confine the Committee Stage, with so many amendments having been tabled, to four hours.  By the way, what happened this morning on the Order of Business has not in the slightest bit trespassed on those four hours.  The four hours started at 3 p.m. and will expire whenever they are due to expire.  The Senator is not going to get away with that trick.  This is disgraceful.  This is important legislation and it is being railroaded through.  Most of the amendments will never be discussed, for obvious reasons.

This was the first item placed on the Order Paper this year.  The Bill has been on the Order Paper, ready to move, for months but it has been chosen to progress it in the past two to three weeks of this Seanad term.  This is about this decision and future ones.  My memory in respect of a request having been made and to whom it was made is the same.  I concur in that regard.</p> <p>There is an opportunity.  Let us move to the next Stage.  There will be opportunities, for example, for the Government and the Leader to give a guarantee that Report Stage will not be guillotined.  Perhaps the Minister will state on the record if it is his preference that Report Stage not be guillotined.  If that means that Report Stage needs to be continued in autumn, so be it.  While the Minister may be available tomorrow or the next day, the fact is that he is not the only Minister in play.  There are several other pieces of legislation that are also under time pressure.  If the Bill was an urgent matter, it could have been brought forward two or three months ago.  It could have been brought forward-----</p></speech>

The Minister is bringing it forward before the summer recess and framing it as emergency legislation while at the same time we have been told it is foundational legislation that will change the agenda for the next 50 years.  If it is significant legislation that has significant repercussions and we should be allowed to debate it for as long as is required, with that debate to continue in autumn if necessary.  I ask the Minister to be clear on whether he is opposing the introduction of a guillotine on Report Stage of the Bill when it comes through next week.  I say that as a Member who has put forward more than 100 amendments in good faith, each of which would strengthen and improve the Bill if given the prosper consideration.  I do not make apologies for that.  For the Minister to say he is available on Friday or we can catch him on Saturday morning is not sufficient.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I recognise the Minister did not say that.

This piece of legislation has not been rushed.  It has not been described as emergency legislation.  Consultation first began on the reform of this legislation in July 2018.  The outcome of that was published in July 2019.  There was then a further round of consultation.  The general scheme to replace the 1971 Bill was published by the Government in May 2021.  Pre-legislative scrutiny took place at the Oireachtas committee.  It began on 5 July and ran until September 2021.  Many of the 17 recommendations arising from pre-legislative scrutiny have now been accepted.  The full and final Bill was approved by the Government on 14 December and was published on 7 January.</p> <p>A total of 179 amendments were made on Committee and Report Stages, with 97 made on Committee Stage and 82 on Report Stage.  The Bill passed the D&aacute;il on 22 June.  The Bill then came directly from the D&aacute;il to the Seanad.  It could not have come to the Seanad any earlier because we have a bicameral system.  Legislation has to pass through one House before it comes to the other.  There were no weasel words involved and there is no need for somebody I have respect for, namely, Senator McDowell, to use provocative or offensive language.</p> <p>I am in the hands of the Seanad as to how it wishes to do its business.  All I said was a simple statement of fact and the record of this House should be corrected if anyone is suggesting anything to the contrary.  I did not seek the curtailment of this debate.  I was available to continue this debate tomorrow and was available on Friday but I was told Seanad &Eacute;ireann was not available.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 1 is in the names of Senators Norris and Boyhan.  I thank Senator Norris for his opening contribution which I will get to as we go through the various stages of the amendments.</p> <p>The Senator will not be surprised that I am not in a position to accept this amendment because it proposes to remove section 1(2) of the Bill.  That is the section which provides for the commencement of the Act by ministerial order with the exemption of certain sections relating to the incorporation of higher education institutions into technological universities.  The Senator, as a very long-serving Member of the Oireachtas, knows that this is a standard provision in any piece of legislation.  It is necessary to provide for the commencement of different sections of the Act and, therefore, removing it would prevent me from commencing various sections of the Act at various times.  That may have been the Senators intention.</p></speech>

It is perfectly obvious that academics are the people who know the situation from the inside so they are the best qualified people to hold this position.</p></speech>

It is very useful in that it is providing a definition in the Act of an academic member.  It is important we be very clear there are academics who are manifestly part of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s, who are academics doing the work of academics - teaching or carrying out research - and who have held such posts at the time of their appointment.  It is a useful clarification.  We will come later to some of the further substantive amendments in respect of the constitution of the board and the level to which academics, students, staff and unions are properly represented either on the board of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s or on the boards of institutions of higher education.  However, this definition is useful and makes all of our subsequent amendments much clearer.  I commend the amendment.</p></speech>

As Senator Higgins rightly points out, this amendment needs to be seen in the context of more substantive amendments that come up later in the Bill in respect of the constitution and composition of the board of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I believe these new definitions are not necessary as it is not specified in respect of the membership of the board of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s whether a member is an academic member.  The board is a competency-based board and the competencies required are set out in section 16(2)(a).  It is not a requirement to hold an academic post to be a member of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I think that is probably an area where we have a disagreement that comes up later in the Bill.  Considering we intend for the HEA board to be a competency-based board and not to define its membership as an academic or trade union member or the likes, I therefore do not see why I would define "academic member" in section 2.</p></speech>
