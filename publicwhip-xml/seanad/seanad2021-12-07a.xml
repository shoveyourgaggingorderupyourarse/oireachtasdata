This has had a significant affect on families who worked there and the local businesses.  As I have said previously, the shortfall in rates has been made up and I am glad that we recently got a commitment that there will be a process in this regard from 2023 onwards.</p> <p>A fund was made available in 2020 to support communities' transition to a low-carbon economy.  The fund is a key pillar of the Government's plan for the midlands region.  The focus is on retraining workers and generating sustainable employment in the green enterprise throughout the region.  The objective of the fund is to facilitate innovative projects that contribute to the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the region.  It supports projects that take a whole-of-midlands strategic approach and complement each other.  I welcome the supports heretofore and the need for a just transition in the midlands.  Some &euro;108 million was allocated for the bog rehabilitation scheme.  This is extremely welcome in my area because following the closure of both power plants, there is a great opportunity for us to turn these places into an asset such as the mid-Shannon wilderness park, a 20,000-acre national park that will be a fantastic tourism asset.</p> <p>Other projects have been funded, including Lough Ree and Lanesborough food hub, which was immediately repurposed with funding from Enterprise Ireland, following Bord na M&oacute;na pulling out of the project, Lough Ree Access For All, Lough Ree Distillery, and the Yard Hub, just to name a few.  This funding is crucial as it will support communities in the midlands that have been impacted by the just transition and make this region a location for green and sustainable investment.  </p> <p>However we are here to seek the commitment from ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na to provide funding of &euro;500,000 to develop a community facility in the Lanesborough and Ballyleague area, following the closure of the plant.  I had a meeting recently with Kieran Mulvey, the just transition commissioner, who has put these proposals to provide that funding for both Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.  As yet the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na have not made a commitment to do so.  I ask for a commitment from the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications that either the ESB or Bord na M&oacute;na provide this funding proposed by the commissioner to develop a community facility in Lanesborough, County Longford.</p></speech>

The transition from brown to green is happening.  I want to mention north-east Roscommon because Lanesborough and Ballyleague in Longford, as the Minister of State knows, are separated from the area by the River Shannon.  The people of that region are prepared to make that change but, as Senator Carrigy has eloquently pointed out, commitments were made by Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB, two semi-State bodies, to help society.  I acknowledge the Minister for funding we already received.  Senator Carrigy mentioned Lough Ree Access For All, the food hub, the distillery and other projects in the area, which are very important, but the point we are making is that it would appear that Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB are pulling back.  They do not seem to be prepared to live up to their word.  It is crucial for our communities in the region that those semi-State bodies stick to their word.  We need assistance.  The people of the region, with their politicians, will implement the programmes and make the changes.  The Minister of State will understand this very well.  It has been a core argument of Government that society and communities have to be helped to get over the line.  I will not labour the point.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will not labour the point.  The Minister of State knows what Senator Carrigy and I are saying.  We need those semi-State bodies to deliver that money for the Lanesborough-Ballyleague area.  In general, the ESB has committed &euro;6 million to community projects, so it needs to live up to that, as does Bord na M&oacute;na.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-07a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021120700002#C00200"><p>I will reply on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Government.  I welcome the opportunity to set out the actions being taken by the Government in response to the announcement of the closure of the peat-fuelled power stations and the end of peat harvesting by Bord na M&oacute;na.</p> <p>The work of Kieran Mulvey, as just transition commissioner in the midlands over the past year, has seen a comprehensive engagement with relevant stakeholders, including the ESB, to address the challenges facing the region, Bord na M&oacute;na workers and their families and communities arising from an accelerated exit from peat harvesting.  The commissioner has produced three progress reports to date and a further progress report is expected by the end of this year.  The Department has responded to his recommendations with the development of the midlands implementation plan and associated actions, which are detailed in the recently published climate action plan.</p> <p>It has been agreed the just transition commissioner's work will reach its natural conclusion at the end of 2021.  However, given the broad nature of the challenges associated with the transition to a climate neutral economy and society, the climate action plan 2021 commits the Government to the establishment of a just transition commission to provide strategic advice to the Government, building on research and engagement through the national dialogue on climate action and the annual review of the Climate Change Advisory Council, on how Government policy can further a just transition.  I will develop proposals on the mandate for this in 2022 in advance of drafting legislation.</p> <p>The ESB provided &euro;5 million to the just transition fund in 2020 to support the just transition in the midlands, and I understand it is continuing to explore the development of infrastructure in the midlands for use by local community groups.  The just transition commissioner has facilitated ongoing discussion with the ESB and key stakeholders such as the midlands regional transition team and local authorities to develop, mobilise and deliver opportunities for the midlands, for both the workers directly affected and the wider community.  The ESB is also developing planning applications for both station sites as renewable energy centres to facilitate growth in the green technology sector.  This is in anticipation of future competitive tenders to be held by EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  The proposed technology includes synchronous condensers and energy storage capabilities at both locations.</p> <p>I also understand the ESB provided an update on its plans for both sites to the most recent meeting of the midlands regional transition team, on 1 December.  The ESB remains committed to the midlands through the development of these projects, its &euro;5 million contribution to the just transition fund and its network operations, which employ more than 400 highly skilled engineers, technicians and office workers in the region, as well as its national training centre for network technicians in Portlaoise.</p> <p>The Government is committed to a just transition in the midlands and has dedicated significant funding to supporting workers, companies and communities affected by the transition to a carbon-neutral society.  Through the national just transition fund, the Department has finalised grant agreements with 47 just transition fund projects, with the total value of projects in delivery mode standing at approximately &euro;19.3 million, with &euro;15.5 million in grant funding.</p> <p>Looking ahead to future just transition supports, the EU just transition fund, which is part of the European Green Deal, will allocate &euro;84 million to Ireland to alleviate the socioeconomic impacts of the just transition in the most affected regions.  The Department is preparing a territorial just transition plan for approval by the European Commission and this will define the regions and activities for support under the new fund.  A total of &euro;108 million has been secured for the enhanced decommissioning, rehabilitation and restoration scheme, EDRRS, which has created a total of 350 jobs.  A further &euro;14 million has been provided in 2021 to the National Parks and Wildlife Service to fund peatlands restoration and protect raised bogs in the midlands.</p></speech>

We acknowledge the ESB is still involved in negotiations, although there was little mention of Bord na M&oacute;na.  We are anxious it should play its part in this as well.  The communities have been fantastic to Bord na M&oacute;na over the years and it has been good to the communities as well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On the environmental change from brown to green, we must remember the just transition.  It is important to recognise that it was to be an eight-year process, which was brought down to two and was then even shortened below two.  We accepted that but we need the same response from those organisations, from the ESB and from Bord na M&oacute;na, to act swiftly and as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I want to highlight that the contract for a just transition commissioner is due to end shortly.  Kieran Mulvey is well known to us and for the work he has done.  He is very well experienced in this role and knows the communities and people involved.  I ask the Department to reappoint him for a further two years.  As I have said, he knows the communities and projects and these projects have been slow in getting off the ground, so we need that continuity to ensure they are delivered.</p></speech>

The Senator is correct in that the just transition commission was meant to be wound down at the end of this month, and it was decided at the time of the climate action plan that it will be put on a permanent footing.  I cannot comment on who will be the person who will be appointed and, to be honest, I do not know.  I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s support for Kieran Mulvey to the senior Minister.</p> <p>The roles of Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB have been critical in the midlands.  They have been very significant employers and have provided pensions for many people.  Many people I have met when I was travelling the midlands have been involved in energy infrastructure.  My feeling is the ESB and Bord the M&oacute;na will continue to fulfil that role, to be large and significant employers, but in green energy projects.  That is why I see renewable energy applications on both of the sites of those power stations to produce jobs that will last into the future.  A very important part of this is the retraining element.  The ESB Portlaoise training centre is critical to that.  I have spoken to the chief executive of the ESB about ensuring that is properly funded.  If Senators are having any difficulty in dealing with those agencies or through the just transition commission, which is meant to be there to facilitate those communications, do contact my office and I will try to help.</p></speech>

I would like to tease out today some of the issues around the news that the Government is going to install 2,000 MW of thermal generation capacity.  The International Energy Agency have forecast that if governments are serious about achieving the climate targets, then there can be no new oil, gas or coal development.  Here we are, however, a few months later and the Government are proposing to build several new gas-fired power plants.</p> <p>My first concern, and I would like to hear assurances from the Minister of State on this, is the proposal to open up these gas-powered plants and how it leaves citizens liable to compensation claims under the Energy Charter Treaty.  These generation facilities will have the protection of the investor-state dispute mechanism within the Energy Charter Treaty, which allows the companies to sue governments for taking climate action and to claim very significant compensation in special corporate courts with little oversight.  That is compensation money that could be spent on a just transition and will make decarbonisation much more expensive for citizens.</p> <p>There are concerning parallels between the situation we find ourselves in currently around energy security and that of the Dutch in 2007 and 2009.  In 2007 the Dutch found they were over-reliant on gas and were facing rising energy prices.  In a bid to bring down the cost of energy for households, they invited coal-powered plants to set up in the Netherlands.  There was the successful Urgenda climate court case, with which I am sure, as a Green Party member, the Minister of State would be very familiar.  The Dutch Government was told it had to do more to be compliant with the Paris Agreement and to bring down its emissions.  The easiest thing for it to do was, of course, to tackle the dirtiest industry, which is the coal-fired power plants.  The Dutch Government said it was going to phase out those coal-fired power plants by 2030 and is now facing a &euro;2.4 billion compensation claim from RWE - which, interestingly, is investing in our offshore wind in Ireland - and Uniper.</p> <p>What risk analysis has the Government carried out on these gas-fired power plants?   If these are temporary gas-fired power plants, how are we going to ensure we are not then liable for compensation claims when we choose to phase out these gas companies?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like assurances from the Minister of State as to the duration of the contract they are being offered in the public procurement process.  We are being told that these generators will be used as little as possible and that they are there as an emergency backup.  What sort of commitment are we giving to investors and those in the business of making profits in terms of their income?  We are telling them that we want them to set up here but the gas-fired power plants may never be powered up.  What sort of financial incentives are the investors being offered?  That does not seem like a very good investment.  If we are serious about decarbonisation, will there be a stipulation in the public procurement contract that the infrastructure will be capable of taking hydrogen and that it should be mandated to transition to the use of green hydrogen?</p><p>Finally, as with waste, the key issue is reducing demand for energy.  That should be our starting point in respect of renewable energy and all of that.  It should be about reducing the amount of energy we need in the first place.  We all know that the reason we have the gas-fired power plants is data centres.  The EirGrid CEO left us in no doubt because he said the quiet bit out loud when he was speaking at an event for the data centre lobby.  He said that the reason this proposition has come out is EirGrid cannot its customers connected with sufficient electricity in the near term.  It is as simple as that.  He said that the proposition is designed fundamentally to try to give clients and critical FDI coming into the country a way to continue to grow their business.  That contradicts completely the hierarchy of energy use.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

To contribute to the achievement of these targets, the Government has committed that up to 80% of electricity consumption will come from renewable sources by 2030 on a pathway to net-zero emissions.  It is vital that as Ireland transitions to a low- and then a zero-carbon electricity system, security of electricity supply is also maintained.  Much of the existing high-emitting conventional generation is expected to cease operation over the coming years.  This capacity will need to be replaced by generation that provides the same support and backup capability, but is also flexible, thus enabling it to support high levels of generation from wind and solar.  For instance, such generation may need to increase and decrease output quickly in response to changes in output from renewable generation.</p> <p>The national development plan, NDP, and the Climate Action Plan 2021 set out the need to develop approximately 2,000 MW of new gas-fired generation to ensure security of supply and underpin Ireland's increased target of up to 80% of electricity demand to come from renewable sources by 2030.  Last week, the Government approved and published a policy statement on the security of electricity supply that sets out that the development of new conventional generation is a national priority and should be permitted and supported to ensure security of electricity supply and support the growth of renewable electricity generation.</p> <p>The second point that the Senator raised relates to the Energy Charter Treaty.  The treaty is a political declaration on international energy co-operation with 53 signatories and contracting parties that entered into legal force in 1998.  The treaty's provisions focus on four broad areas: the protection of foreign investments and the protection against key non-commercial risks; non-discriminatory conditions for trade in energy materials, products and energy-related equipment based on WTO rules and provisions to ensure reliable cross-border energy transit flows through pipelines, grids and other means of transportation; the resolution of disputes between the participating states, and in the case of investments, between investors and host states; and the promotion of energy efficiency and attempts to minimise the environmental impact of energy production and use.</p> <p>The treaty is designed to promote energy security through the operation of more open and competitive energy markets while respecting the principles of sustainable development and sovereignty over energy resources.  Negotiations to modernise the treaty are under way, led by the European Commission, reforming the protections to carbon-intensive energy infrastructure.  I look forward to the discussion.</p></speech>

What financial guarantees have they been given that this is going to be a secure investment if we are being told that we might not actually need them to switch on at all?</p><p>On the modernisation of the treaty, would the Minister of State tell us if a deadline has been set for the modernisation process?  Currently it is going nowhere, or so it seems from all reports.  Unanimity is required for changes, but Japan has said it does not want any changes.  Six EU countries are calling for the EU to leave as a bloc because the treaty is unreformable and cannot be reformed.  It is not compliant with the Paris Agreement.  The EU's proposals as part of the modernisation process would not make it Paris-compliant.  Is there a deadline for the modernisation process by which we just cut our losses and get out?  What commitments have been given to these gas-fired power plants about the timeframe and how often they would be used?</p></speech>

Those contracts have not been agreed or specified, so the terms are not known.  I take the Senator's point on how long it is going to last.  We need 2 GW of power by 2030, but they are long-lasting pieces of infrastructure.  Of course, as the Senator will understand, they are not designed to run all of the time.  They are not for base load, they are for peaking power and for emergency times when power is needed, so there may be more capacity but less gas actually being burned.</p> <p>Of course risk assessments will be carried out.  The chance of being sued by an investor will be considered as part of the risk assessment when the contracts are drawn up under procurement.</p></speech>

Such a decision must raise questions around the level of understanding of how theatres operate.  Many productions cannot survive unless they operate at 70% to 80% capacity.</p> <p>Theatres are safe and controlled venues.  I was fortunate to be at the all-Ireland one act drama finals in Ennis on Sunday night.  I was in Gorey Little Theatre on Friday night.  I was in the Bord G&aacute;is Energy Theatre on Thursday night of last week.  In all of those cases, Covid certificates and identifications were checked.  I have been in venues where my temperature was taken as I went in.  They are responsible and safe venues.</p> <p>This announcement, out of the blue, that they are going to 50% capacity from now has left groups scrambling.  A lot of shows are pre-sold well in advance.  First of all, the groups have to decide whether they are going to go ahead, and then decide which 50% will be allowed to attend some of the shows and which 50% will have to be refunded.  Then there are the obvious financial implications of that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While much of the focus will be on professional theatres and professional performers, and that is important, what Senator Cummins and I are concerned about is that, in addition to looking after those groups, we have to look after our amateur community and semiprofessional productions around the country.  </p><p>We are looking for is a commitment to put a financial support package in place for those groups that have lost out, ideally administered through the local authorities.  Post 9 January, a commitment should also be given to provide support because groups planning pantomimes and so on for January do not know what to do.  Finally, if it is discovered the Omicron variant is not as big of a risk as being talked about, in those circumstances can we look at lifting restrictions to give some clarity and certainty to the sector as soon as possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-07a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021120700002#G00200"><p>It is not an understatement that the live theatre and events sector is in disarray since last Friday's announcement by Government to cut the capacity to 50%.  I do not envy the Minister or her Cabinet colleagues who have faced unprecedented decisions over the past 18 months, but I have to question the logic that sees public transport being able to operate at 100%, while safe venues, such as theatres, can only operate at 50%, despite the use of masks and vaccination certificates, as Senator Byrne said.  Broadway will operate at 100% tonight.  West End theatres, despite government advice to the contrary, will operate with a mask mandate in place, yet our theatres in Ireland, which are in the middle of sold-out runs of pantomimes and concerts, will only be able to operate at 50%.</p><p>I am exceptionally concerned about the producers and the not-for-profit organisations.  The costs involved in putting on productions such as pantomimes are immeasurable.  They involve venue hire, lighting, sound engineers, set design, transport, technical crew, musicians, costume hire and PR; the list is endless.  They do it because of their love for theatre and the ability to make their audience smile.  For example, the Waterford Panto Society, which started its run last week, and <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which started at Garter Lane Arts Centre last week, decided that the show must go on.  However, they face financial losses of up to &euro;47,000 and &euro;25,000, respectively, as a result of the 50% capacity limit on venues.  This is replicated across this country.  </p><p>They have to be supported urgently because decisions are being made today that have an impact going forward through January.  I would urge the Minister of State to relay back to the Minster the urgency of making a decision on this and to amend strand 2 of the live performance grant scheme to cater for these smaller productions.  It is all well and good to support the big professional productions, but we also need to look after the community and non-for-profit groups.</p></speech>

The Government fully appreciates that the live performance sector, including pantomimes, is among the hardest hit by these latest restrictions.  Indeed, these sectors were the first to close and the last to reopen, only as recently as 22 October.  Unfortunately, the epidemiological situation is such that we are not where we expected to be and, as a result, last Friday, the Government had to announce further restrictions on the live performance sector, with capacities limited to 50% of seated capacity as of today, 7 December, and the closure of night clubs.</p> <p>My colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, along with the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste, met with the live performance stakeholders yesterday morning to discuss the impact of these additional restrictions.  The Minister acknowledged that the sector had remained closed for longer, and reopened fully for shorter, than any other part of the economy.  </p> <p>The Government is clear introducing these restrictions, and to do it in the run up to Christmas, the most economically important time of the year for live performance and pantomimes, is deeply difficult and it is a grave disappointment to have arrived at this point.  We had hoped not to have to take a backwards step in the lengthy process of reopening all parts of society and the economy.  However, the path of the pandemic is not predictably linear and, therefore, we find ourselves imposing restrictions once again for the wider public health benefit.  </p> <p>The night-time arts and live performance sectors are bearing the brunt of these restrictions.  This is not because of any misbehaviour within them.  Indeed, many who work in the live events sector are health and safety experts, and compliance with guidelines has been very high.  These restrictions are being reintroduced because of the need to reduce levels of social contact in the coming weeks as we try to manage the risk of high Covid-19 case numbers, plus the uncertain impacts of the Omicron variant and the return of more typical winter respiratory pressures on our health system.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=JoeOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We hope this phase will be short and that we will get safely through Christmas and the year end.</p><p>I know this will be of little comfort to those trying to stage live performances in December and January.  To this end, last Friday the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, agreed with her colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, an increase of &euro;25 million in the funding for live performances.  This will bring the fund for live performance, including pantomime, to &euro;50 million.  In addition, the Minister recently announced a scheme specifically to support seasonal musical theatre and pantomime that will provide funding of up to 50% of costs up to a maximum grant of &euro;500,000.  She allocated more than &euro;60 million in 2021 for the live entertainment industry and the additional funding will continue those supports.  Grants have been provided to musicians, venues, promoters and those involved in the staging of events and pantomimes and this has provided thousands of hours of employment.  The Minister and her Department are currently examining the supports that were in place and have been engaging with stakeholders to determine what would work best to support the live entertainment industry going forward.  She hopes to make an announcement shortly on what schemes will be made available.  All of her support schemes, including the scheme for pantomimes, are currently under review.  I know she will be as flexible and responsive as possible in supports for the sector.</p><p>In addition, the Government will provide support through an adjusted Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, to the sectors, while commercial rates for the sector will not be payable for quarter 1 of 2022.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, is finalising details of a targeted reopening of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, scheme for workers temporarily laid off due to the impact of these restrictions.  I will bring forward the specific concerns raised by the Senators.</p></speech>

There has been significant, much-needed support for the professional sector.  The Minister of State should be clear that if support is not provided now for amateur theatre, amateur pantomimes, Christmas shows and others, those community organisations will die.  That is the reality.  Decisions and financial investments are currently being made in respect of pantomimes, three-act festival plays and so on for the new year.  There is no certainty provided in that regard.  There is an urgency to this issue and a support package needs to be put in place.</p></speech>

The scheme mentioned by the Minister of State in his reply stipulates that a group must have a turnover of &euro;300,000 in two of the past three years and must have a minimum production value of &euro;150,000.  That will not cater for the very people who need to be supported.  I cannot emphasise enough the importance of this issue to local groups right across the nation.  They need support and they need it now.</p></speech>

I particularly take the Senators' point regarding amateur, community and semi-professional groups and non-profit organisations.  I have a particular interest in the area.

B&iacute;onn s&eacute; an-fhlaithi&uacute;lach.  He is very generous with his time in the Seanad.  He is always willing to come in and take our questions.  This Commencement matter is on the need for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make a statement on the progress of the taking over of national water services by Irish Water in line with the key performance indicators used by the water advisory body in reporting on the performance of Irish Water, with particular regard to infrastructure delivery.</p> <p>This is not the first time I have raised the issue of water in this House.  I will keep going with it because I firmly believe it is a basic human right.  We have very significant issues in that regard.  I acknowledge that there has been some good progress.  Irish Water has halved the number of places from which raw sewage runs into our waterways.  That is good.  It is a disgrace that we ever had twice the current number but it is good that some work is being done and that we are getting raw sewage treatment plants in a few places in my own county including Kilrush, Kilkee, Liscannor and Clarecastle.  There is also one on its way to Ballyvaughan.</p> <p>We hear a lot about the town centres first approach, rejuvenating rural areas, rural development and regional balance but these objectives cannot be achieved without proper water infrastructure.  There are villages and towns that are really suffering as a result of the lack of such infrastructure.  The issue is hindering the building of new houses.  There is a shovel-ready project in Broadford.  The funds are there to build that housing estate but there is no water infrastructure.  We talk about housing but I always bring it back to the basic fact that if there is no water infrastructure, there cannot be housing.  It is a very significant issue.</p> <p>I am raising this issue in respect of Irish Water today for a few different reasons.  There is concern about the people in local authorities who work in the area of water and who will be reassigned to Irish Water.  They have many fears about that.  There have been fears about Irish Water from the get-go, when it was set up.  It is time that we, as a House, ask for a referendum on water.  The Green Party fought for this to be included in the programme for Government.  We have been asking for it for years.  Until we are sure that Irish Water will remain in public ownership and will not become a private entity, there will always be a lack of trust in it among the people of our country.  We are here to give people hope and faith and to represent them.  There is this vagueness around Irish Water and the ownership of water.  It is not mentioned in our Constitution.  I have written the wording for a referendum if anybody wants to take it from me.  We need to affirm public ownership of water in our Constitution.  That will alleviate the fears of those whose jobs are to be taken over by Irish Water and of people on the ground.  It is a very simple matter.</p> <p>I have another minute.  That is not too bad.  There is another matter I wanted to raise.  I know that nothing is as simple as you think.  People ask why we do not just do X, Y or Z but matters are complicated, as I have learnt over the last year and a half.  Even though we know things should be done, it takes longer to do them than we think it should.  I will give the Minister of State an example.  I spent two and a half years trying to get a water bottle refilling station in one of our lovely local towns, Ennistymon.  It is insane that it takes two and a half years to get something as simple as a place to fill a water bottle.  I was a councillor so I was able to source some funding but community groups often seek these water bottle refilling stations and the first wall they face is that, when they go to the local authority, they are told that Irish Water charges &euro;2,500 to make the little connection from the pipe below the ground to the device above the ground.  I purposely picked a site in the square in Ennistymon that was right beside a water hydrant so that there would be no cost involved because I had heard these crazy rumours that Irish Water was charging domestic households &euro;1,000 per metre of pipe.  I tried to remove all the obstacles from the beginning because the first answer you get is often "No."  </p> <p>One arm of the State, Irish Water, charges the local authority &euro;2,500 for a water connection for the public good and for the community, which pays its taxes, and both of these arms of the State actually come under the same Department.  We have a water crisis and a plastics crisis.  This is a no-brainer.  It should not take a two-and-a-half-year campaign.  These stations should be popping up in every single town and village in Ireland.  We are using more than 1 million plastic bottles a day.  I know we have a plan to move away from plastic bottles but we should do that now.</p> <p>I call on the Minister of State to outline whether the key performance indicators for Irish Water have been looked at and how Irish Water is doing in that regard.  We need to give people assurance about water.  We definitely need a referendum on water and we need to remove that stumbling block whereby one arm of the State, Irish Water, charges another &euro;2,500 for a connection for a water refill station.</p></speech>

It is one Commencement matter but I will try to address a number of points raised by the Senator.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has responsibility for the overall policy relating to water services and Irish Water but the Water Advisory Board is independently tasked under the Water Services Act 2017 with reviewing Irish Water's performance on a number of key measures.  These include measures needed to improve the transparency, accountability and confidence relating to Irish Water and to report, on a quarterly basis, to an Oireachtas committee on the performance by Irish Water in the implementation of its business plan.</p> <p>The Water Advisory Board submitted its third quarterly review report of 2021 to the Oireachtas on 16 November 2021 and I have a copy for the Senator.  This report, which the Minister also received and is currently considering, has been published on the Water Advisory Board's website.  The review is focused on a set of performance indicators selected to represent the activities of Irish Water against which conclusions and recommendations have been drawn.  The Water Advisory Board report must be seen in the wider context of the significant institutional reform achieved over the past decade, which has seen Irish Water and local authorities making real progress working together since 2014 in delivering a unified and coherent approach to managing our public water systems nationwide.</p> <p>Clearly, significant and complex challenges remain.  With a view to building on these important institutional reforms, in February 2021 the Government published a policy paper entitled Irish Water - Towards a National, Publicly Owned, Regulated Water Services Utility setting out clearly the approach planned by the Government to proceed with the full integration of public water services within Irish Water's organisation structure.  This will deliver a publicly owned, stand-alone, regulated, national water utility tasked with modernising and transforming the delivery of water services in Ireland.</p> <p>In setting out its views and expectations on the next phase of the water sector transformation programme in this way, the Government is enabling water sector stakeholders, including water sector unions and workers and the management representatives of the local government sector and Irish Water, to engage together, facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to identify a framework for the future delivery of water services in keeping with the policy objectives set by the Government.  The Government believes it will be possible to achieve a framework for the future delivery of water services which will be in keeping with the key concerns of all stakeholders.</p> <p>It is the case that there has been significant progress made with that transfer with respect to local authority staff and Irish Water.  Those conversations are ongoing but it is a critical part of delivering the single publicly owned utility with respect to Irish Water.</p> <p>The Senator raised a number of points on water ownership and there is a commitment in the programme for Government to refer the issue of environment, including water, and its place in the Constitution to a relevant Oireachtas joint committee for consideration.  That commitment is there, although a number of possible referendums are outlined in the programme for Government as well.</p> <p>The policy paper on water sector transformation agreed by the Government further commits the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government to consult with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the local authority group of unions on the proposed referendum.  There were concerns around that and the commitment is there as well.  Engagement on this matter is under way and will continue in tandem with discussions on employment and staffing matters within the framework support of the WRC.</p> <p>I will try to address the other points raised in my closing remarks.</p></speech>

That is if there is a recommendation in the programme for Government in that respect.  Irish Water is the water services authority for the country and all the legislative powers required to provide and maintain water services infrastructure now lies solely with Irish Water.  It is totally unsatisfactory that the authority created to deliver such infrastructure has no funding capacity for developments with no existing public wastewater infrastructure, according to Clare County Council.</p> <p>I spoke to that council about Doolin and although Clare is the most beautiful county in Ireland, we are almost punished because tourists are coming to the likes of Doolin and other great places in Clare but we do not have the required infrastructure.  With tourism comes spending, which is good for the economy of the country, so I do not know why we have no treatment plant for Doolin or any sign of funding for one.  There are thousands of people going to Doolin and the Minister of State knows it is great.  If it is music one wants, go to Clare, and Doolin was the start of all that.</p> <p>There are major issues.  I thank the Minister of State for his response but we have work to do.</p></speech>

That is why the Government has committed a record capital funding in budget 2022 to support Irish Water's capital investment programme.  There is significant investment.  It will take time for projects once they are brought forward to go through tendering and so on.  Once local authorities are working with Irish Water and show ambition around delivering those projects, it is critically important that we do get that infrastructure in place.  I have the water quality in Ireland report 2020.  There are significant challenges, no doubt, concerning wastewater still discharging into water courses.  We want to address them as a matter of priority.</p> <p>Specifically in respect of the water refill stations, I agree with the Senator.  It is very important.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government around the roll-out of water refill stations.  I commend the Senator for the work she has done in County Clare to highlight that.  It is part of our circular economy and part of reducing plastic waste.  For young people who use our towns regularly, it gives them an opportunity not to be having to buy bottled water.  This infrastructure should be installed and we will certainly make inquiries about that issue.  We need refill stations installed as a matter of priority around all of our towns across the country.</p></speech>

He is very concerned about something that is happening and that perhaps does not have a direct bearing on the business of the House, but I think he has found a link.  It is apparently proposed to destroy a notable beautiful green space in the heart of the city of Dublin.  We are very lucky to have the likes of St. Stephen's Green, Merrion Square, Mountjoy Square and so on, but green space is at a premium in this city.  Apparently, the authorities in Trinity College intend to develop on College Park.  They intend to dig it up.  A notable historic green space in the centre of Dublin, it is proposed by the college to be the temporary - question mark - location for a gallery and souvenir shop.  These things have a habit of getting lodged in and then becoming permanent by accretion.  The gallery and shop are supposed to be in place for three years while the Long Room is refitted.  However, this business in College Park was never mentioned once at the fellows' meetings at which the Long Room project was discussed.  It seems extraordinary it was left out of those discussions.  It seems to have been a last-minute addition after a Government grant was secured.</p> <p>I would like to know whether the Government was told that digging up College Park was part of the deal.  This is a political angle, but did the Green Party support digging up College Park?  Could the Comptroller and Auditor General investigate before the bulldozers move in?  Is this another case of understating the cost of a project, getting it going and then saying, "Oh, it is too late to stop it now as there will be a huge overrun", as with the children's hospital?  Could the Government lodge papers in the House stating what precisely it is funding?  Was the loss of College Park a later add-on?  We in this House are entitled to answers to these questions.</p></speech>

The country's Data Protection Commission works on behalf of 447 million EU citizens to defend their data from Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. ... Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. and roughly a dozen other tech giants &mdash; and it's been too lax on the job. </blockquote> <p>On Sunday, in the <i>Business Post</i>, in an excellent story by Aaron Rogan, the Data Protection Commission, DPC, itself acknowledged that it needed a radical reassessment of its structure as it is.  This is what the commission said: &quot;unsustainable and unfit for purpose&quot;.  Yesterday we saw MEPs from all groups in the European Parliament whose members sit on the Parliament's committee on justice and home affairs write to the relevant European Commissioner and copy our Minister for Justice expressing concern about how the general data protection regulation, GDPR, is applied and enforced in Ireland and the operation of the Data Protection Commission.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This has also been raised at the justice committee by its Chair, my friend and colleague Deputy Lawless.  Last year, on 23 September and 18 November, I tabled Commencement matters in the House on the functioning of the DPC and the significant reputational risk to Ireland if we do not ensure it is properly structured and adequately resourced.  Frankly, I do not believe the Government is taking this issue seriously enough.  We need a debate on the role and function of the data protection commissioner.  We need the appointment of three data protection commissioners.  Given how important and serious this issue is, and given that it is increasingly being brought to global attention, it is time for the Government to wake up and take the issue of the proper resourcing and function of the DPC more seriously.</p><p>I also note we had a very good debate on China last week.  At the time I raised the question, as I know colleagues have, of a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games.  We have seen that President Biden's White House has announced it will engage with a diplomatic boycott in line with many other Governments to show their opposition to the human rights abuses of the Chinese Communist Party.  How long more do we have to wait before the Department of Foreign Affairs finally makes up its mind?</p><p>I compliment RT&Eacute; on the series "The Case I Can't Forget".  Last night it showed the Don Tidey case.  Next week will mark the anniversary of the murders of Private Patrick Kelly and Garda Gary Sheehan.  We should always remember them.  Their families are still entitled to justice for their murders.</p></speech>

We have yet to see the publication of its report, which sits with the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the Taoiseach.  The Future of Media Commission is not to be confused with the future media commission, whoever came up with that.  It is an independent panel set up under the programme for Government.  It had its inaugural meeting on 29 October 2020.  It was required to report within nine months, which brought us to 29 July.  I have learned, in an article by Pat Leahy in <i>The Irish Times</i>, that it has given its final report to the Government.  We learned much more though the leaks that led to the article by Pat Leahy.</p><p>The report has been considered by the Government for the past five months.  Why is it taking the Government so long to publish it?  Why are we reading leaks in <i>The Irish Times</i>about the content of the report, specifically with regard to the licence fee?  We should not be reading in this way about the contents of a report that cost the Government the considerable amount of &euro;420,000 to publish.  It contains a range of measures, not only with regard to the licence fee.  It deals with how media should be funded, how the licence fee should be collected and split and conditions attached to funding.  These are all critical issues that need to be addressed with media.  The Government is still sitting on the report.  We have yet to see its publication after five months.  We are learning about it through leaks.  I feel it will be buried at Christmas.  When will we see the publication of the report?</p></speech>

I have received a series of calls and emails in recent days from teachers in the main.  The message was the same in all of the correspondence I received.  The conditions in which they are working and in which our children are attending school are totally unacceptable.  There are stories of windows being left open with the heating turned up to the last but the temperature in the classroom reading just 6&deg;C.  I am sure other colleagues in the Chamber are also hearing this.  Searching clothing shops for outdoor clothing with a high protective body warmth content is the norm for many teachers in order for them to teach indoors.  All the time our children, particularly our younger children, are trying to learn to read and write.  In some cases they are unable to hold a pen or pencil due to the cold conditions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Following these worrying contacts, I tuned into the six o'clock RT&Eacute; news yesterday to listen to Professor Orla Hegarty, who said she believed that all schools should be given HEPA filters.  Ms Hegarty is an assistant professor of architecture in University College Dublin and a former member of the special National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, group on ventilation.  She stated that if we can control the conditions of infected air, which can be done by measuring it in a building, we can drastically reduce transmissions.  She went on to say that if a classroom manages its ventilation and filtration, we can make every school low-risk.  The Department of Education tells schools that HEPA filters are available where needed.  The problem, schools tell me and as was mentioned in the RT&Eacute; report, is that the process of applying for the HEPA filters and undergoing a risk assessment is too slow.  We need to take care of our children.  We need to take the red tape out of this process.  We are in the middle of a crisis that is affecting both our children and, indeed, our teachers.</p><p>The second item I want to raise with the Leader is colour blindness and the case of an apprenticeship for a young person from my home town of Athy, County Kildare.  The young person has found a job they enjoy.  More important, they have an employer who values them and their work and wants that young person to begin an apprenticeship.  The problem is the course involves a colour blindness test that, unfortunately, this young person has failed.  However, with corrective lenses they would pass this test every time.  I have tried to raise this with the two different Departments with responsibility for education but continue to be passed from one office to another.  It seems to me, at a time when we need more and more apprenticeships, we are stopping this young person from following their dream because of an outdated test.</p></speech>

I would appreciate it if the Leader would support this person's young dream by way of a follow-up letter to the Department.</p></speech>

I recently met with members of the Collins committee in Clonakilty which is apolitical.  They are doing a lot of research on history, and their wish and hope is that somewhere in the capital, which is very important in the context of the treaty etc., in the time that is in it, a life-sized statue of Michael Collins would be erected.  It is not a big request.  As I said to a former Lord Mayor, ideally it should be in the precincts of Leinster House, which is the political armpit and the basis of our Parliament, but if that is not possible, perhaps Merrion Square or somewhere adjacent to this historic building would be considered.</p> <p>My second issue is, perhaps, something which I should put down by way of notice of motion.  I heard this morning that my home town of Bantry has again been flooded.  Last year it was flooded three times.  Many of the businesses, because of the annual or biannual flooding, will not get insurance for the property because insurance companies say they will not do it again.  The cost to the Bantry Business Association and many traders is severe.</p> <p>There is a simple reason for this situation.  I served in the Bantry Town Commissioners before it was abolished, for whatever reason.  The proper flood relief programme was never put in place.  If you marry a lot of heavy rain that flows through the rivers and what we call a spring tide or a very high tide, it is inevitable there will be flooding because the water cannot get out, and seawater is clashing with freshwater.  This will continue unless serious action is taken by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  This is going on for some time.  I have raised this issue since 1989, in this House, of which I have been a Member most of the time, and in the other House.  It is unfortunate it is falling on deaf ears.  I and the people from that area whom I represent are very frustrated.  Perhaps the Leader would raise this issue to see whether a response is forthcoming.  If it is not, I will be knocking on the door of the Cathaoirleach to table a Commencement matter early in the new year.</p></speech>

It is about supports for the pantomime and theatre industry following the announcement on Friday.  A significant number of these groups are already booked out for the Christmas period and into January.  A concert organised by Longford County Council under the live and local fund took place last night.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Tickets had to be returned to people to make sure that the 50% limit was reached.  Many pantos are run by voluntary organisations.  A fund relating to operating costs was brought in a number of weeks ago but the minimum cost had to be &euro;150,000, which only relates to professional productions.  The vast majority of productions are run by local people, including a production in my home town.  Longford Traditional Panto has organised a production of <i>Snow White</i>this year and the people involved are Paul and Tracey and their Evolution Stage School.  The first panto in the county of Longford was in 2019 and that production was sold out for its ten nights and was attended by 4,500 people.  I am involved on the county tourism committee, which sponsors the panto as it is a significant event in the town of Longford and brings people in from around the midlands.  The reality is that these groups cannot be sustained.  The scheme that was put in place must be extended to cover all groups and theatres over the next four-week period.<br/><br/>I bought tickets to the panto for myself and my children.  I was looking forward to going but I do not know whether I will get there now.  The organisers are looking to add extra dates to accommodate people or they will have to refund tickets.  I ask the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to encompass all groups in the funding.</p></speech>

That is the motion regarding the establishment of a special committee on gender equality.  This summer, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth launched a consultation seeking the public's view on a review of the Equality Acts.  The deadline for submissions is 5 p.m, tomorrow and everyone should make their voices heard.</p><p>There is significant concern among parents as to the presence of harmful ideological beliefs being taught in our schools, having been introduced by political lobby groups.  The Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, LGBT+ Teachers' Group has resources that introduce trans ideology to junior infants - children as young as four years old.  The training video shows a teacher telling a class that a boy can change into a girl and that a girl can change into a boy.  At any level of biological reality this is simply not true.  Teaching this to young children who lack the critical thinking ability to assess the claim is the textbook definition of &quot;indoctrination&quot; and disrupts a critical developmental stage when children need certainty and consistency in their lives.  It is intellectual abuse <i>en masse</i>of a captive and impressionable audience who trust the adults in charge of them.</p><p>The INTO LGBT+ Teachers' Group, BeLonG To and ShoutOut have been allowed to bring harmful and inappropriate resources, interventions and programmes into school.  The fruits of such activities were readily seen last month when an Educate Together secondary school displayed a poster that stated lesbians are non-men attracted to non-men.  Why are we so afraid of the word &quot;woman&quot;?  I fear for our children, particularly  young girls who are the future women of this country and who have been given the short end of the stick by these organisations achieving their political goals.  This is a very important issue for debate in this House and we would welcome it.</p></speech>

It was a very brave decision to campaign for this because many of these people live in very vulnerable situations where if they get sick, they are frightened to ask for help or if they are victims of crime, they are reluctant to go to the Garda or any authority figure.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I commend the Government and everybody who campaigned for this.

There is a clear commitment for this in the programme for Government.  It has been discussed in the climate action plan.  It is due to be rolled out in the new year.  I would like context in regard to how are they actually going to work, how they will be funded by the Government and where they will be provided.  For example, will staff in local authorities provide them?  The concept is quite simple.  There are so many people in Irish society today who are climate conscious and want to be able to make improvements to their own homes to make a contribution to counteract the climate crisis, whether that is retrofitting their homes, getting solar panels on their roofs or making the transition to electric vehicles.  The problem is that it can be difficult and daunting for people to get that information, and get the right information.  The concept of these one-stop climate shops is that you can rock in and meet somebody who knows this area inside-out and can give you the proper advice, direct you towards the proper funding applications and tell you about the pros and cons of various initiatives.  These one-stop climate shops would be rolled out through our local authorities, meaning that somebody could walk into Louth County Council or any local authority in the country, set out the key things he or she wants to try to do to retrofit his or home or to make a contribution towards climate action and ask how to go about it.  The sooner we have them rolled out throughout the country, the better as they will be very useful.  I would appreciate an outline from the Minister in the new year about how they intend to work, when they will be rolled out and how much Government funding will be put behind them.</p></speech>

Frankly, many communities believe there is an overconcentration of wind turbines in their areas.  The latest wind energy guidelines have not yetf been published and that is unfortunate.  I would like to see a more advanced strategy from the Government to look at the potential for offshore wind energy generation.  There have been some developments in recent weeks about proposals on the east coast of Ireland but there is an abundance of wind off our west coast.  The technologies are developing and it is a bit more complicated because similar to oil rigs, the wind turbines will need to float.  We should and could be at the cutting edge of this development.  There are real opportunities for us to be part of the beginning of something, to capture the ideas at the start and ultimately to export the technologies that will be developed to secure this kind of electricity.  There are real opportunities and I hope we can have a debate on that particular strategy.</p></speech>

They are doing so to save lives and to keep our communities safe.  On 4 January 2014, the west coast of Clare, including my parish and Lahinch, was ravaged by the sea.  Damage to both public and private property amounted to millions of euro, but thankfully we rebuilt.  We have one of the best rock armoury systems available, after millions of euro of Government investment following the damage of 2014.  As a country, we need to spend billions on flood defences.  We are an island nation.  We are subjected to major climatic change.  We have seen many storms in recent times.  In the past decade we have seen more storms and severe weather situations than in the previous two decades.  We need to invest in our coastal communities, which do so much for us from a tourism, sporting and a quality of life perspective, and ensure the type of investment made in Lahinch is matched for them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I call on videographers and social media people who want to get the best photos over the next 24 hours, in addition to those who want to be adventurous and go out and risk their lives without heeding the red warning, to realise this is serious.  Lives will be lost.  The emergency services in this country have enough to be doing without going out to rescue clowns who believe they are braver than the storm, the sea and the weather.  I call on all those types of people, who have been very prevalent in our recent weather experiences, not to go out and to respect the people who are risking their lives to keep our communities safe.</p></speech>

First, I join Senator Fitzpatrick in respect of the undocumented.  I compliment the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and all involved in the launch of the campaign that will allow people to register in January.  I met constituents over the weekend who fall into the category in question.  They have been studying and doing everything under the radar and want to make a contribution here in Ireland.  The opportunity is very welcome.  I encourage all who qualify or who are able to apply to become a resident to avail of the opportunity to do so and regularise their circumstances.</p> <p>I thank all the front-line staff who are outdoors today restoring power and picking up fallen trees.  I include the staff in the county councils and OPW and volunteers all across society who are working today to make sure we are all kept safe.

This is at a time when we are celebrating the 100 year anniversary of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.  It is 23 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  Society and Members of both Houses have an opportunity to finally put to rest grievances and differences in this country and have a final peace settlement.  It behoves us all to work in that direction and to avail of what is a fantastic opportunity under the Taoiseach's model of a shared island.  Given the funds that will be behind the unit over the next five to ten years &mdash; &euro;500 million between now and 2025 and another &euro;500 million beyond that &mdash; in conjunction with other cross-Border funds, totalling &euro;3.5 billion to 2030, it behoves us as politicians to finally grasp the model of peace, say "No" to sectarian division, and create trust and a way forward to ensure that future generations will recall the difficult times in this country over the past century and that the next century will be one that we all desire.</p></speech>

This is absolutely phenomenal.  Members might remember that, at the start of this year, we were asking everyone to support submissions calling for Ballinasloe to be on the route.  Its inclusion will really transform the town.  The route that has been selected is red route No. 5.  We received notice from the cycleway project team this morning.  I would like to thank all the groups who made submissions.  It just shows the difference that making a submission and taking part makes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There were more than 1,600 submissions regarding route No. 3 to Mountbellew, and a further 800 submissions regarding route No. 1.  It was incredible to see people getting involved, whether families, community groups or businesses.  The real challenge is that we need to seek further funding from, I hope, active travel to develop these cycleways and connect these towns.  It is wonderful news today, at the end of a long campaign that ran all year.  We are looking forward to what it will mean for people in our area.</p></speech>

I gave the examples of Waterford Panto Society, which had a sold-out run of 26 shows at the Theatre Royal, and the producers of <i>A Christmas Carol </i>at Garter Lane Arts Centre.  Those groups have bravely decided the show must go on and they are continuing with their productions.  Even so, aside from the logistical nightmare the 50% capacity presents to them in having to decide which 50% gets to see the show, they face substantial losses of &euro;47,000 and &euro;25,000, respectively, as a direct result of the 50% capacity limit.</p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange an urgent debate with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on this sector.  I am cognisant of the supports that have been, and will be, put in place for the professional sector.  That is right and proper and it is all well and good, but the local community, not-for-profit, voluntary organisations that are the lifeblood of theatre throughout the country also need to be supported and need urgent clarity from the Government.  It would be appropriate to fit such a debate in to the schedule of the House as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

The schedule is very busy this week but I will do my best to organise something next week.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, met representatives of the industry yesterday, so I hope to hear some fruitful announcements arising from that.  I will keep the Senators posted.</p> <p>I congratulate Senator Dolan.  The inclusion of Ballinasloe will make a massive difference to the town and I know she is very pleased about it.</p> <p>Senator Blaney raised the shared island unit.  He is correct about the milestones we have reached and commemorate and in regard to how it is about looking to the future and the opportunities to do things co-operatively and respectfully.  Sometimes we lose something in the debate from the politicking around it.  People may say they want a particular outcome but all their actions ensure that outcome cannot be achieved.  I commended the Taoiseach when he appeared before the House a number of weeks ago, because it is a wonderful initiative.  In particular, in his commitment to Northern Ireland and the united Ireland project, the greatest contribution he makes is to listen.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne and Fitzpatrick talked about the campaign announced by the Minister for Justice last week.  It is a really generous campaign and the announcement is very welcome, not least when we see how some of our migrant cousins, for want of a better word, are being treated across the EU by certain countries.  It is a very generous scheme.  When we opened the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, scheme last year in what was an unprecedented time, 16,000 people who did not have PPS numbers came to our Intreo offices because they had no other way of earning money than by coming to the State and taking that big step of declaring themselves as not supposed to be here.  We welcomed them and gave them PPS numbers, and that is exactly how human beings and a just society should treat other human beings.</p> <p>Senators Conway and Maria Byrne commended our outdoor staff and local government workers, the ESB and the OPW.  We are in the grips of a storm and some counties are experiencing far worse conditions than we are in Dublin.  I commend our staff and thank them for what they do and for keeping us safe.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Dooley asked for a debate on wind energy generation.  At a time when we see very large organisations and companies pulling out of wind energy generation in Ireland because of the bureaucratic red tape they have to go through, the timing for a debate is apt.  I probably will not get it in next week but I will make sure that we do it very early in January for him and I will come back to him.</p><p>Senator McGahon asked when the one-stop climate shops will be established.  To be frank, I do not know but I will find out and come back to him on that.</p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick also talked about immigration and the history of Ireland and the welcome for a debate on this topic.</p><p>Senator Keogan asked for an amendment to the Order of Business.  I am sorry to say that I cannot because I do not have the facility to have a debate on that particular topic.  Just to inform the Senator, the topic that she has raised and the committee that is being established do not have any relevance to each other today.  The debates and the concerns that she has raised are probably best-placed to be brought to that committee and seven Members of the Seanad will be represented on it.  We are still establishing the committee today and the Senator can bring her topics and ideas to the committee there.</p><p>Senator Carrigy talk about pantomimes.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan brought the very thoughtful suggestion forward of the people of Clonakilty and of the Michael Collins committee down there for a statue.  It is a wonderful idea.  He has been a long-time hero of mine and of many others but I certainly will ask the Minister as to what the status and expectation is on that suggestion.</p><p>Senator Wall raised two matters.  I am aware that he is not in the Chamber at the moment but the case of the young person he raised, who failed the application for the apprenticeship is completely ludicrous and crazy.  It is one of those idiosyncrasies that we have in Ireland.  I will contact the Senator&rsquo;s office, get the name of the young person and I certainly will make sure that both the Secretary General of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Minister take care of that application.  I wish that young person well in their studies.</p><p>One thing I do have to raise is the point on which Senator Wall spoke this morning, namely, the welcome announcement finally made by the Minister for Education that &euro;30 million is being allocated for HEPA filters in our primary and secondary schools in order that children do not have to sit in the freezing cold with four jumpers on them any more.  The one thing that does concern me is what was reported in the newspapers this morning, which is that the filters are available but that the schools had to choose if they want the filters or some other urgent works that are required in their schools like broken windows or leaky roofs.  If that is true - not everything we read in the newspapers is true - it would be outrageous.  I wrote to the Minister this morning asking that she clarify that this is not true and that all of our schools, both primary and secondary, will have equal access to HEPA filters, regardless of what other works are required.  </p><p>Senator Warfield asked for the date of the publication of The Future of Media Commission&rsquo;s report.  I do not know but I will contact the Minister today to find out.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about a report in the newspapers yesterday that the Data Protection Commission is under-resourced and underfunded.  This is not the first time that the organisation has suggested this.  I know from my own days in the Cabinet that the Department of Justice has an annual review with the commission and given the fact that this is a concern that the Data Protection Commissioner has on a recurring and annual basis, perhaps such a review needs to be a little bit more frequent.</p><p>Finally, Senator Norris spoke this morning about a green space at the heart of Dublin that he feels is going to be developed unnecessarily.  Again, I do not have any details but I will find out and I will get back to the Senator and let him know what is the story.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-07a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021120700002#FF00300"><p>I am grateful to have the opportunity to bring the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021 before the Seanad.  This Bill is the most significant legislative reform of maritime governance since the foundation of the State.  It seeks to establish a coherent and comprehensive marine planning system to manage development and other activities in Ireland's seas, which is one of the largest maritime areas in the European Union and seven times larger than our land mass.  It covers an area of almost 500,000 square miles.</p> <p>This once-in-a-generation piece of legislation is a cross-government initiative, led by my Department, and is another key commitment set out in our programme for Government.  In preparing this ambitious Bill, we have listened to all stakeholders and balanced their needs in a fair and equitable manner that has the citizen at the heart of the process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The Bill provides for the long-term protection and sustainable development of the maritime area for the next generation, including the envisaged expansion of the offshore renewable energy sector, which is crucially required to meet Ireland's 2030 climate goals in an integrated and sustainable way.  The Bill will largely replace the Foreshore Act 1933, which was designed for very different Ireland where relatively little marine activity took place.  This Bill will put in place a modern marine planning system for a 21st century Ireland.  It has been developed to cater for all types of development that range from small slipways to the largest offshore renewable energy project in a way that, most importantly, protects oceans through rigorous environmental assessment.</p><p>The new system is based around four key pillars: inclusive forward planning through the national marine planning framework with comprehensive subnational planning; the establishment of a new maritime regulatory agency to be called the maritime area regulatory authority or, as it will be known, MARA, which I have announced will be located in Wexford; development management through a structured sequential consenting system; and robust provisions for investigation, enforcement action and penalties.  The Bill provides the necessary legislative tool to set for participatory forward planning, well-regulated development, streamlined consenting and a comprehensive environmental assessment of proposals.</p><p>The Bill is part of an extensive range of long overdue marine reform to which this Government is committed.  That includes the following: the State's first marine spatial plan called the national marine planning framework, which, following approval from both Houses of the Oireachtas, I established in June of this year and is the existing plan in our plan-led approach; the enactment of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2021 earlier in the year, which confirms the extent of our maritime area; and the development or separate legislation for marine protected areas, MPAs.</p><p>Following on from the independent expert advisory group report, which was published in January of this year, and in tandem with the review and analysis of submissions received through the subsequent public consultation process from February to July, we have now commenced work on developing a general scheme for new MPA legislation.  The development of this legislation will continue into 2022.</p><p>I shall briefly summarise the main elements and key features of this very large and complex piece of legislation.  The Bill is comprised of nine Parts, 190 sections and 12 Schedules.  Further specific detail on each section can be found in the explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Bill.</p><p>Parts 1 and 2, which are comprised of sections 1 to 39, inclusive, restate and augment the marine forward-planning provisions of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018.  A high-level marine planning policy statement will guide all marine policies.  The first marine planning policy statement was published in November 2019, which outlined the vision for the future development of marine planning and the marine planning system that we are legislating for here today.  The policy statement sets out the Government's priorities and informs any reviews of marine spatial plans.  I plan on developing a new marine planning statement following the enactment of this Bill to which all future marine policies and plans must have regard.</p><p>Ireland's first marine spatial plan, MSP, is the national marine planning framework, NMPF, which we published on 30 June of this year.  It is the State's primary response to commitments under the MSP directive and provides a holistic, overarching policy framework for how we want to use, protect and enjoy our seas while incorporating ecological, economic and social priorities.</p><p>The NMPF brings together all marine-based human activities.  It presents our vision, objectives and planning framework policies for each activity while recognising that our biodiversity-rich marine environment requires and needs robust protection.</p><p>The NMPF includes the designated maritime area plans, DMAPs, which are a series of interconnected subnational plans.  The DMAPS will augment the NMPF.  DMAPS are prepared by a designated competent authority and underpinned by a mandatory public participation statement.  DMAPs may be prepared in respect of specific activities for one or more designated groups.</p><p>Part 3, which is comprised of sections 40 to 73, inclusive, establishes a new agency to be called the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->MARA will administer and enforce marine property consents and licences and ensure compliance with offshore development consents.  The establishment of MARA is the physical embodiment of this Government's maritime ambitions.  It will be transformational in Ireland's marine governance, creating a centre of excellence, independent decision-making and proactive enforcement.  MARA will be one of the fulcrums of inter-agency collaboration needed to properly harness and protect our ocean wealth.  Once established, it will grant maritime area consents, MACs, and maritime usage licences for specified activities.  It will ensure compliance and enforcement of MACs, licences and offshore development consents and assume responsibility for the management and enforcement of the existing State foreshore portfolio of leases and licences.  MARA will change the landscape of marine and maritime regulation in Ireland and provide a nexus for inter-agency co-operation and collaboration.  It will be the vehicle to ensure we can harness the offshore renewable energy, ORE, potential we have and ensure the long overdue overhauling of the foreshore licence system that has been in place for decades.  As I stated, it will be located in Wexford, the constituency of Senator Malcolm Byrne, which I had the pleasure of visiting earlier this year when I made that announcement in respect of Trinity Wharf and the wider Wexford area.</p><p>In the short amount of time I have left, I point out that a new property consenting regime is established under Part 4 of the Bill, comprising sections 74 to 109, inclusive.  In effect, the maritime area consent considers the person applying and the financial terms of occupation.  Granted MACs will govern the relationship between the State and the holder, place necessary obligations on the holder and ensure appropriate returns to the State.  MAC holders will have no right to occupy or develop until the public has had its say, the project detail is fully assessed and planning permission is granted.  The MAC is merely the gateway to planning and the project assessment and, as such, if appropriate planning permission is not achieved, the MAC terminates.</p><p>The next Parts of the Bill are concerned with the permitting of development and activity and the enforcement of same and I will speak on those Parts together.  Consent for development and other activities in the maritime area is dealt with in two ways.  First, the terrestrial planning permission regime, augmented by marine-specific considerations, will be extended to the entire maritime area.  This is done in Part 8 of the Bill.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la and local authorities will carry out the required planning and environmental assessments of projects in a manner familiar to the public, with all the associated opportunities for submissions and observations.  The national marine planning framework will sit at the top of the decision-making hierarchy and all decisions will have regard to the framework.  The granting of a MAC is conditional on receipt of planning permission.  In short, no one can occupy the maritime space until the project has been fully assessed and the public has had its say, both at plan-making and project stages.</p><p>Part 5, comprising sections 110 to 133, inclusive, introduces a new centralised licensing regime operated by MARA.</p><p>As regards enforcement, the Bill recognises Ireland's maritime area as a precious and irreplaceable resource and we will ensure that our seas are adequately protected from those who would do them harm.  Part 6 of the Bill, comprising sections 134 to 166, inclusive, provides MARA with strong powers of investigation, enforcement and prosecution and allows for collaboration with other public bodies that manage our seas.  MARA will be a real force for the State into the future.  The Bill ensures that MARA and local authorities have significant teeth when it comes to enforcement in the maritime area.  The enforcement provisions set out in the Bill are the first line of defence in this regard.</p><p>In conclusion, I cannot understate the importance of this legislation.  It is once-in-a-generation legislation that for the first time will properly regulate and protect our maritime area and allow us to harness its value in a sustainable way, creating energy from it and protecting its biodiversity.  It will ensure a streamlined approach to planning and enforcement in this regard.  I particularly thank the joint Oireachtas committee, of which Senators Cummins and Fitzpatrick are members, as well as others who have put a significant amount of time into this.  I look forward to the contributions on Second Stage and the remaining Stages of the Bill.  To have the Bill passed through the Houses by the end of the year would be incredibly significant for the Government.</p></speech>

I feel we are standing very close so I apologise.  I do not want to crowd him but this is my allocated seat.</p> <p>It is a coincidence that the Minister is coming to the Seanad with this legislation today considering the storm that is attacking our island.  Our thoughts are with all the coastal communities that are being battered by Storm Barra.  Thankfully, we seem to be getting away with it so far here in Dublin.  I thank all the emergency services under the command of the Minister&rsquo;s Department for the work they have done and will do.</p> <p>This legislation is important.  As the Minister said, it is game changing in respect of the State&rsquo;s role not only in the protection of our maritime area but also in planning for and developing activities in the maritime area.  There has not really been legislation to deal with this issue since the 1930s.  We will not be too critical of those who have gone before us but we will certainly adopt a much greater sense of urgency in our business.  We are firmly committed to having this legislation passed before Christmas.  It is imperative that this House and the D&aacute;il pass it.  It is needed urgently.  We have huge potential in our maritime area, which is 500,000 km in length or seven times our landmass.  The Minister said this himself.</p> <p>The Bill has more than 250 pages.  It has nine Parts and 190 sections.  We spent a lot of time at the joint the Oireachtas committee engaged in pre-legislative scrutiny.  We appreciate that the Minister and his Department have taken on several of our recommendations.  The recommendations strengthen the legislation and do so in a way that will ensure our maritime area is not only protected but also developed to meet its full potential.</p> <p>I started by alluding to climate change.  We all recognise in this House, and it is increasingly recognised outside the House, that we must achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  Ireland is already doing very well in respect of its production of renewable energy from wind sources.  Those sources have largely been onshore to date; we have only one offshore farm, off Wicklow.  The Government is committed to net neutrality by 2050, but 80% of our electricity is to come from renewable sources by 2030.  Considering that it takes about ten years to develop offshore wind farms, we really do need to have a sense of urgency in our work.  We need to be very critical but also constructive in our contributions to the Minister so we can enable him to pass this legislation sooner rather than later.  The legislation will establish MARA, which is important.  It will put in place the framework for the issuing of maritime area consents, protect those consents and ensure enforcement.  These are all planning functions that we take for granted on land, but we are only playing catch-up with our maritime area.</p> <p>The Government and industry see great potential in the development of offshore capacity.  It is our job to ensure the legislation maximises this potential.  We need to ensure the State deals with issues concerning infrastructure on land, including quays, so the energy can be delivered for use.  The infrastructure must also be developed for other green energy sources.  Green hydrogen comes to mind.  Who knows what the future will bring?</p> <p>I commend the Minister on bringing this legislation to the House and on the work he has done.  I congratulate everybody in his Department who has contributed and all the external stakeholders who have contributed at the various public consultations.  We look forward to the debate and to having this legislation passed before the Christmas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-07a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021120700002#KK00100"><p>I welcome the Minister.  This is a large body of work and complex legislation, as he outlined.  I took the time in recent days to look back over the D&aacute;il debates in preparation of some amendments.  One might ask why someone would consider amendments before he had heard the Minister speak but the great advantage is we can read the report of the debates in the D&aacute;il and read the various amendments that were proposed.  I followed the trajectory of those amendments and saw that most of them were rejected, but listening to the debates and the engagement was an important exercise for me.</p> <p>I live near D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, one of the finest harbours in Europe, and the Minister lives in Malahide, where there is a wonderful marina.  Senator Cummins lives in Waterford, where there is great potential around the coast.  I recognise the enormous potential of the marine, the water base and the fact we live on an island.  As someone who sat on the board of a harbour company for two terms, I recognise the great difficulties we had in bringing people with us and developing the fantastic resource of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  There are now no ferry operations in it and it has, effectively, been wound down.  There has been so much leisure, recreation and energy, with the dichotomy and the challenges between planning on land and planning at sea and what comes between the two.</p> <p>I recall a major dispute over drilling near Dalkey Island that amassed thousands of people coming to public meetings.  The issue was rallied around and taken advantage of by certain political activists in the community.  I am, therefore, cognisant of the fact we have to bring people with us.  People are precious, certainly along the coast.  I can speak only of the east coast, because I have more experience of it, but we value this beautiful part of the world, as I am sure the people on the west coast value theirs.  There is a great attachment to the sea and to the potential of it, but it is done in a sensitive way.</p> <p>The only people who have contacted me with concerns about this are the Irish Environmental Network and An Taisce.  People involved in the environmental area are very supportive of alternative energy such as wind energy.  We need to consider that as well as ensure there will be adequate public consultation and participation, as required by the Aarhus Convention.  Everybody seems to be roaring about the Aarhus Convention but when they are asked what it is, they do not seem to know any more than the fact it sounds good.  In fairness to these organisations, they have a genuine concern about engagement, the strategic environmental assessment directive and the obligations of the Aarhus Convention, of which we are signatories.</p> <p>The Bill needs to provide for reviews of the MAC, which the Minister touched on, and emphasise and ensure the public consultation.  That is important and we need to be mindful of it.  I will not go over what he said about the new scheme and the four key pillars, which he set out well.  It is important we have regard to that.  He referred to the introduction of public participation statements, a wholly new development that will go some way to address that issue.</p> <p>Two issues have been brought to my attention by the Irish Environmental Network and An Taisce.  They relate to the issue of judicial review.  I have always said, including last week in the Chamber in the context of something else related to planning, that judicial review should be the last resort for anybody.  It is prolonged and expensive and, at the end of the day, it does not always serve the engagement in the way in which it should.  Nevertheless, it is a right and an exercise people should be entitled to pursue.  As the Minister will know from his neck of the woods in Fingal and as I know from mine, in many cases judicial reviews have been successful and have delivered the necessary result.  Sometimes they have delayed developments.  I am not in the business of supporting judicial reviews all the time, standing in the way or in any way seeking to frustrate proper, sustainable development, which is important to our economy, but people have a right to have a say and to engage.  The earlier we can get people into the public consultation process about planning, whether at sea, on land or in between, the better.</p> <p>It was put to me, in the context of judicial review and MACs, which is covered in Part 4, Chapter 13, that the Government contended throughout the pre-legislative scrutiny and in recent D&aacute;il Stages of the Bill that the consent is not an environmental decision.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It therefore does not attract cross protection under the Aarhus Convention from prohibitively expensive costs if litigants lose in court and the automatic right of standing to pursue judicial review for environmental non-government organisations, ENGOs.  The ENGO sector is very concerned here as this also flows from the Aarhus Convention.  I am advised that the Bill has only provided for standard judicial review loser-pays rules for maritime area consent decisions on the Bill with no automatic local standing for ENGOs.  Can the Minister please tease this point out, not necessarily here and now, but perhaps someone might drop me a note as I would like to have some clarification?  These ENGOs have asked me about it and I undertook to raise that issue.</p><p>They also say that there is a major lacuna in the Bill in respect of providing for the type of key characteristics required by the Aarhus Convention for judicial review of a range of decisions and actions under the Bill.  Given the implications of recent rulings in the national courts, there is a risk of uncertainty on costs protection and for those who may seek to challenge such decisions and actions.  When they do challenge such decisions, the court cases will be made more complex as, on top of the basic issues in the case, there will be additional layers of argument around costs and protections.  This is all around the issue of potential judicial reviews and their protection.  I know from the Minister&rsquo;s political party, from the Green Party and others that many people involved in this environmental sector became politicised and joined political groupings because they were activists about their environment, their community and about participation in the first place.  That is a legitimate right to engage.</p><p>On the whole I support the legislation.  We have an amazing resource out here.  It is greatly underdeveloped.  I have been to ports all over the world and have seen what can be done, not only in developing amenities but also residential development along this wonderful resource.  There is a need for the protection of the environment and it is a win-win situation if we get it right and bring people with us.  </p><p>I have some concerns on two issues.  We had 29 recommendations in our pre-legislative report.  I noted in the response of the Department and the Minister to Deputy &Oacute; Broin&rsquo;s concerns, they said they had endeavoured to incorporate some of them into the legislation.  It would be helpful if we can see a graph of the 29 recommendations from the committee and which or how many of those were incorporated into the Bill.  The Minister has acknowledged the important work done by the committee on this legislation and I thank the Minister as one of its members.  I know there are other members present.  I ask that the Minister might do that in the next day or two as it would be helpful.  </p><p>On resources, we have planning authorities which are currently struggling, at best, to fulfil their obligations.  Many of them do not have the depth, breadth, experience or expertise in maritime engineering issues.  We are going to have to tap into and have a pool of resources that planning authorities on the fringes of the coast could utilise.  This may not be the case for every local authority.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

I join with Members in welcoming the Minister to the House and thank him for bringing forward a once-in-a-generation piece of legislation.  It is a very comprehensive and complex Bill that runs to 259 pages.  It is only right and proper that we acknowledge all of the officials in the Minister&rsquo;s Department who have worked exceptionally hard on it, not only over the past number of months but in the previous number of years to get us to the point we are at now.</p> <p>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, together with Senators Fitzpatrick, Boyhan, Moynihan and others.  We did a substantial body of work and consultation across this Bill at pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  We engaged with as many stakeholders as we possibly could in the context of the time-sensitive nature we were facing with this Bill.  I know from reading through large sections of the Bill that many of our recommendations have been incorporated in it.  I acknowledge the Minister and his officials for that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As regards the potential of our coastline and marine ocean economy that Senator Boyhan referred to, in 2019, Ireland's ocean economy had a turnover of &euro;5.8 billion, supporting 31,000 full-time jobs.  Marine-related industries directly contributed &euro;2 billion in added value.  There is no question that our diverse maritime resources have the potential to expand over the coming years with the passage of this legislation, not only in the area of seafood, fishing and ocean tourism, but in particular, in our offshore renewable energy capacity.  In that context, I ask the Minister, in his concluding remarks, to speak to the limited number of MAC applications pertaining to the seven relevant projects, which currently have the potential to provide 3,000 MW of energy.  The industry would argue that there may potentially be a drop-off in terms of what can be provided with those seven relevant projects.  Others that have progressed along the various stages thus far may be able to step in to fill that void if that occurs.  I am wondering, in terms of that transitional period, if the Minister plans to make provision for some other projects over and above those seven relevant projects.</p><p>I think it is important, as the Minister acknowledged himself, that the system is based on four key pillars: inclusive forward planning through the national maritime planning framework; the establishment of a new entity in MARA; development management through a structured sequential consenting system; and robust provisions for investigation, enforcement, action and penalties.  With all four of those pillars working in tandem with one another, we can get the best result for everyone in terms of our whole ecosystem, the protection of the diverse ocean area that we have, and also in providing for the enhanced harnessing of that vast resource.</p><p>The Minister stated that our ocean is seven times larger than our landmass, amassing 5,000 sq. km.  It is enormous.  For the very first time, we are going to have a fully comprehensive piece of legislation to deal with everything within that area.  It is vast.  When we were dealing with our planning strategies for Ireland in terms of the national spatial strategy and the national planning framework, we were only talking about what was on this island.  What we are talking about here is a vast swathe of the ocean.  </p><p>I am not going to labour the point any more.  I commend the Minister for bringing in the legislation.  In his response, I ask him to talk about projects over and above those seven relevant projects, and to clarify if there is capacity to expand our offshore renewable energy in the transitional period.  I am very conscious that it will take time to establish all of the processes.  There is a fear that we will not reach our renewable energy targets out to 2030 if we cannot enhance that.</p></speech>

I think it is about 90 years in the making, but it is historic to get it to this stage.  I thank the Minister for his work and my colleagues in the Seanad who sat on the committee chaired by Deputy Matthews.  Deputy Matthews has been working night and day on this Bill.  We have not seen him because he has been working so hard.  He has met with every NGO in the country a ridiculous number of times.  The NGOs have played a huge part in this Bill.  Many of the NGOs have expertise that we do not have as politicians.  I wish to thank the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, Coastwatch, the Sustainable Water Network and the Irish Wildlife Trust.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is very important.  The Bill makes me very happy.  We have worked with everybody, including officials and the NGO sector.  This is a good Bill.  It is very complex and this is why so much work went into it.  We fought for this in the negotiations for the programme for Government.  People often challenge us by asking why we went into government, or they say that we should not have done this or that.  This makes me proud to be in the Green Party and proud of being part of this coalition Government.</p><p>This Bill was so needed because now we can look at our waters which, as previous Members said, cover seven times the amount of land we have.  We really had no idea what was going on in it.  Apart from great people such as Dr. Simon Berrow and Mr. Ken O'Sullivan who made have made amazing documentaries about our sea creatures, we had very little clue as to what was going on.  Now we will have to find out properly because if we do not know that, then we cannot decide where our offshore renewables can go.  This is important legislation because up to now we have been fumbling around in the dark and we have not moved fast enough on renewables because we have not had this legislation, the research or the expertise.  I believe we should give more money to the NGOs, especially if they have very good marine biologists.  These are the experts we need.  Sometimes the NGOs are put under a lot of pressure to contribute to this debate but there may only be four or five people working in an NGO.  That can be difficult and, therefore, we should value it.  If we have experts in ecology working in the NGO sector we should fund them and hire them to help us with this research.  There is a great deal of work to be done with regard to the Bill so that we know what we are dealing with.</p><p>Separately, there is the marine protected areas Bill, which will be amazing.  People will be relieved, because who does not love a dolphin?  Everybody wants to get this right, from a teenage girl to the older man who has watched dolphins all of his life.  We all care about the oceans.  This 90 years-a-coming Bill, and the next one to follow, will finally enable people to have trust that we are doing it right and that we are doing the right things in the right place.</p><p>I thank the Minister.  The Bill sets out how we are going to meet difficult targets on emissions reductions and the transition to clean energy.  The biodiversity of our oceans is so amazing and gives so much as well as enabling carbon sequestration.  One whale can take in 5,000 tonnes of CO2 in its lifetime when the whale dies it still holds onto it.  They have huge part to play and we have been undervaluing them as just lovely things, but we were not taking them seriously and the value they bring.</p><p>I thank the departmental officials, some of whom I see here today, for the significant work they have put into this and the briefings they gave to the committee.  The committee did a very good job and listened to lots of submissions.  There was a suggestion that the committee would recommend that marine protected areas should be part of the Bill.  This is partially true.  The committee did suggest that marine protected areas should be part of the Bill and the same recommendation also provided that the marine protected areas provisions should continue in the parallel legislative process, which is under way at the moment as the Minister outlined.  It is good that they are separate because marine protected areas is such an important issue it would be wrong to put it under this Bill, which is already quite complex.  If we are to take marine protected areas seriously, we would want a separate Bill.  It is good that this decision was made.</p><p>The Bill before us is large and complex.  It comprises a series of provisions in the marine and maritime area.  In recent months there has been the national marine planning framework, a document that went through extensive public consultation and a large stakeholder involvement group.  This was not something we turned out overnight.  If we clock up all the hours, it was thousands of hours, and not just by civil servants and politicians; the NGO sector and the public at large engaged on a daily basis.  This has been grassroots fed.</p><p>The recent Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2021 sets out the boundary of our marine area.  This is massive and comprises seven times the land area at 500,000 km.  There have been concerns around marine protected areas and I share some of those concerns.  Why would someone not be concerned?  We would be mad not to be concerned about marine protected areas because currently we do not have any.  It is great now because we have come such a long way in one and half years.  Let us look at where we are now.  We are getting our Maritime Area Planning Bill, we are getting our marine protected areas Bill next year and finally we will be able to move safely to knowing where the right places are to put the renewables.  When I think of offshore wind, I think that it is great for our carbon emissions, but that we had better put it into the right place.  Those concerns can now be alleviated with this Bill and the future Bills we bring.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are also special areas of conservation, special protected areas and natural heritage areas in our waters.  These are not generally designated under planning but are designated under EU directives such as the habitats directive and the birds directive, as enacted through the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended.  We do not designate these.  Through the legislation on marine protected areas, we will designate marine protected areas.  That is really important and it is why it is so important that it be a separate Bill.</p><p>There will be a consenting process before we see many of these developments in the sea.  That is key.  We have a fear of the big oil and petrol companies switching to renewables, coming in and taking over our seas and putting developments wherever they want.  That is the concern people in the NGO sector have because we have had experiences like that in the past.  That is why this is a historic day.  We should celebrate this Bill.  Of course, people will always give out, moan and complain but today is a very positive day for this Government.  I am proud to be part of it and I am proud of this Bill.</p></speech>

While Senator Garvey was speaking, I was reminded of looking over the edge at Loop Head in her home county of Clare.  I looked down at the Atlantic and watched the whales for hours.  That is a nice thought on this day.</p> <p>I commend everyone in the Department who worked to prepare this mammoth Bill.  I have never held a Bill so big.  I commend the Oireachtas joint committee for all of its work, which I have been briefed on.  I will start, as others have done, by acknowledging that the Bill is very complex.  It will define all planning applications for an area seven times that of the State for 30, 40 or 50 years.  This legislation has to ensure that the competing demands of biodiversity, our coastal communities and our fishing communities are balanced in a way that protects biodiversity and the interests of our coastal communities and fishermen and fisherwomen.  It must ensure the greatest level of public participation in all aspects of planning.  If we strike that balance correctly, the desire we all have to see significant progress in this area can be fulfilled.  </p> <p>On that point, we need robust consultation with our fishermen and fisherwomen.  They are not opposed to offshore wind turbines or offshore energy generation but we all understand the historic failures they have had to endure and put up with.  There is distrust there, as we all can appreciate.</p> <p>I will turn to section 6, which relates to the marine planning policy statement.  It says "the Minister shall from time to time prepare and publish in accordance with this section a statement [...] in relation to maritime planning by the State in the maritime area".  Am I right in saying there is to be no public participation or input from sectoral organisations in the preparation of that policy statement?  In his speech, the Minister said that he plans on developing a new marine planning policy statement following the enactment of this Bill.  Will he address that concern?  It was also raised by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, on Second Stage.  He suggested that this could be in conflict with Article 15(2) of the Constitution and our obligations under the Aarhus Convention.</p> <p>I will now turn to section 7(1), which states "the Minister may, at any time, prepare and issue marine planning guidelines to public bodies".  Will any such guidelines be mandatory?  Are they essentially directives?  Does the Minister accept that there is a dire need for consultation and Oireachtas involvement in the issuing of such ministerial planning guidelines?</p> <p>I will now turn to section 17, which relates to the requirements of maritime spatial planning.  This section states "The Minister shall, not later than six years after the existing [national maritime planning framework] was first published, carry out a review thereof".  Six years seems a very long way down the tracks.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The best practice is that a review would take place within a year or shortly thereafter so why is the national marine planning framework review taking place six years afterwards and not much sooner?</p><p>Part 3 deals with the establishment of the marine area regulatory authority.  The Minister in his comments indicates MARA is the physical embodiment of this Government's maritime ambitions and it will be transformational in Ireland's marine governance, creating a centre of excellence, independent decision-making and proactive enforcement.  Will the Minister give us assurances about the level of staffing needed in MARA and how that full independence that he mentioned can be assured?  This was mentioned by Senator Boyhan.</p><p>I know my colleague, Senator Boylan, will touch on the lag between the planning regime and marine protected areas legislation.  I thank the Minister and his officials.  This is a balancing act in protecting biodiversity and the interests of our coastal and fishing communities, as well as the need for the greatest level of public participation and consultation.</p></speech>

As many Government Members have said, this Bill is 90 years in the making, particularly with regard to the pressing need to stop delaying the development of large-scale renewable energy capacity such as wind farms.  It is also about protecting our biodiversity.</p> <p>Green Party Members have a motion tomorrow night relating to the Antarctic.  I never thought I would end up having to read so much about the Antarctic but what is coming through very clearly in the research I have been doing is the ability of marine protected areas to absorb carbon and how important it is to be able to protect biodiversity within oceans in not just meeting our renewable energy targets but our natural carbon sequestration targets.</p> <p>In the past year and a half or so we have been in this Chamber on many occasions discussing how land could be best used and protected.  Our maritime area is significantly larger and it is very welcome we are now giving proper consideration to the importance of our maritime area as a means for transport, industry and, most important, the critical area of meeting climate action targets and decarbonising our economy.  On that I pay tribute to the members of the Oireachtas joint committee and particularly the officials in the Department and interested parties, who have produced such a comprehensive technical Bill such as this.  It is important.</p> <p>The Bill provides a groundbreaking legislative framework for a new streamlined development consent process for activities in the maritime area, including offshore renewable projects.  This is a welcome development when there is ever-increasing interest in the development of our sea areas.  It is certainly necessary when our sea area is seven times the size of our land mass.  This Bill is vital to develop a clear strategy for marine areas long into the future.  We are, of course, an island and we have one of the largest seabed territories in Europe.</p> <p>We could also not continue to put off the required legislative and planning changes to provide for the development of renewable energy sources, including offshore wind.  For us to have the ability to upscale our renewable energy production, particularly in the area of wind, we must have properly equipped planning authorities and a clear framework.  This will allow us to scale up while protecting our coastal communities and marine habitats.  We can only achieve our climate action targets and protect the future of everyone coming after us by taking drastic action.  Central to this is a dramatic increase in our reliance on renewable energies and we have the potential to become one of the world's leaders in this area, particularly in wind energy.  The potential for this is enormous and we can all agree that it is likely to be integral to the future of both our economy and our life in the country itself.</p> <p>A fit-for-purpose regulatory and legal framework is the only way we can achieve these ambitious goals while ensuring the protection of our maritime biodiversity and the future of our coastal communities, both in terms of jobs and community benefit.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is vital that this is done correctly.  Every time land-related legislation comes before this House, we see how important the Planning and Development Act 2000 is and how integral it remains.  The same will be true of this legislation.  Much like the 2000 Act for land, this Bill will determine how we treat maritime planning long after most of us will have left this building.  Like any area of planning, public participation is key.  One of the areas that has come up in pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill has been public participation and how the public is engaged with the Bill and with planning our maritime areas, particularly around marine protected areas.  We must ensure that areas due to be designated as MPAs are protected in the interim period between the passing of each Bill.  We must strike a balance between the development and protection of biodiversity and of communities while also acknowledging the need to be able to use our seabed.  That is the same whether on land or at sea.  We support the Bill and appreciate the work done by the Department on very complicated legislation.  I pay tribute to everybody who has succeeded in getting this comprehensive Bill this far.  We want to engage progressively to ensure that we get the best legislation for our coastal communities and for the future of our country.</p></speech>

The legislation is long awaited.  It is really important for our coastal communities.  It is important for the protection and achieving the potential of our oceans and seas and for the roll-out of wind energy.  It is particularly important, as Senator Casey and I have raised with the Minister previously, to develop wind energy along the east coast in consultation with coastal communities.  I particularly welcome the decision to establish MARA in Wexford.  It is an appropriate location at Trinity Wharf, Wexford.  The acronym MARA is quite apt given the association with the sea.  However, I have occasionally pictured the Minister in the Customs House exclaiming, "Mara" from time to time as he looked to set this up.  It is key that we have an authority that has the necessary powers in place.  He mentioned that the enforcement provisions would be strong.  I echo some of Senator Boyhan's concerns, however.  It is essential that we have the necessary expertise and staff to ensure a strong regulatory agency.</p> <p>I will make a couple of general observations on the Bill.  This is replacing the Foreshore Act 1933, which was steered through the Oireachtas by a similarly visionary Minister, Se&aacute;n Lemass.  One of the key themes of that Act was the prevention of coastal erosion.  Coastal erosion continues to be a major problem around the country and it will be important for this new authority that regard will be had in respect of any activity that happens at sea for the impact it will have on our coasts.</p> <p>A number of colleagues spoke about the importance of research and education in this area.  Some excellent work has been done by the Marine Institute.  We need to invest a lot more in education on the importance of biodiversity in our seas and on their potential.  On the ecological, economic and social priorities to which the Minister referred, there has to be a role for MARA working perhaps in partnership with the Marine Institute in educating the wider public.  Whether that is built into the purposes of MARA is another matter but somebody needs to take that on board.</p> <p>I welcome section 114, which provides that decisions will be made with on licences normally within 30 days or receipt of all required information.  Regardless of the decision, being able to ensure that it is made within a fixed period provides certainty.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will be essential we have the necessary staff to do that.  I hope the maritime area regulatory authority will have a preplanning process similar to the local authorities, where its staff will work with those applying for licences to ensure the process remains as streamlined as possible.  </p><p>I wish to raise a specific issue regarding membership of the authority.  I note section 48(1)(d) excludes members of local authorities.  Similarly, under section 62(d), if one is elected or co-opted as a local authority member, one cannot become the chief executive.  That is discriminatory.  It is wrong that local councillors are excluded from membership.  If they have a particular expertise in the area and all other things being equal, for example, if a person is a marine biologist and happens to be a councillor, there is no reason that person should be excluded.  I can understand Members of the Oireachtas being excluded from membership because of the direct impact on legislation.  There seems to be a habit of excluding local authority members from membership, which is wrong.  Under section 54, certain individuals who are licence holders and so on are correctly excluded from membership of the authority.  Interestingly, even though councillors are excluded from membership of the authority, the Bill provides for a member of the City and County Management Association to be nominated.  As reflected in the word used, the person is not a nominee but a "representative" of that body.  If one is a member of an authority, one should be on it not as a representative.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the constitution of the board.  I do not believe local authority members should be excluded from it.</p></speech>

Coming from a coastal community and having seen the potential for offshore wind energy, I appreciate the enactment of this legislation will be extremely important.</p> <p>The Minister mentioned the Foreshore Act 1933.  Is it being replaced in its entirety or only sections of it?  That Act would have dealt with issues such as foreshore acquisition and an issue that may or may not have crossed the Minister&rsquo;s desk, that is, seaweed rights and harvesting.  Seaweed is an important asset to coastal communities in my area and, in terms of research, it may have the potential to gain even more prominence as a food additive for cattle.  </p> <p>The first national maritime planning framework was published in 2019 and it will be renewed every six years thereafter.  I welcome that and also the establishment of the maritime area regulatory authority.  Senior planners in a local authority would always have dealt with the most complex and more important planning applications.  It is important that experienced people are recruited to MARA.</p> <p>Will the requirement to have designated maritime area plans over-complicate the process?  Will they delay the delivery of projects?  For example, if an application is submitted before a designated maritime area plan has been prepared or is under consideration, will that plan have to be enacted first?  </p> <p>N&iacute;l a fhios agam ach b'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil deiseanna anseo d'eagra&iacute;ocht St&aacute;it cos&uacute;il le h&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta mar go mbeadh s&eacute; in ann plean a ullmh&uacute; do Chuan Chasla i gConamara, mar shampla, agus go bhfuil deiseanna ansin &oacute; thaobh fuinnimh in-athnuaite i gceantar Chonamara ansin.   </p> <p>It is stated local authorities will examine all other applications within their own designated nearshore area extending a maximum of 3 nautical miles from the shore.  In terms of islands, which may be further than 3 miles from shore, is it 3 miles from the island?  The Minister might provide clarification on that and that local authorities will ensure compliance with planning permission conditions within their nearshore areas.  Local authorities will still have roles for some of the work but the larger projects and those outside the nearshore area will be under the jurisdiction of MARA.  </p> <p>Section 78 deals with fees to be paid to MARA.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In terms of clarity and projects awarded a maritime area consent or the equivalent planning permission, will the maritime area regulatory authority be collecting development contributions under a local authority-type scheme or will a local authority be able to collect those development contributions, which would be very valuable to certain local authorities?  Are rates payable on these projects?  They are multimillion euro projects and I imagine rates would be levied.  Again, they would be very important as a long-term source of funding for local authorities.  Where a project is delivered off the coast of Galway, will Galway County Council be able to collect rates on that?  Of course, there is engagement.  Sometimes the cable might be coming on shore in another local authority.  For example, a project off Galway could see a cable being brought on shore at Moneypoint.  Could we get clarity on that?</p><p>The next issue concerns projects that have been granted relevant status prior to this.  About seven projects were granted relevant status in May or June of 2020.  I received correspondence that there are some concerns about the lack of flexibility for projects that were planned a decade or more ago.  This relates to section 101(1) regarding relevant maritime usages.  It had been interpreted as permitting the Minister to permit a MAC for the usage originally applied for as part of the foreshore lease application process.  However, it now seems there is a geographical limit on the area in respect of which a MAC can be provided that is restricted to the area in respect of which a foreshore lease was granted or where an application was made.  There are issues here with regard to projects that received relevant status but had not applied for a cable route pending confirmation of their connection status.  Will they be covered under this?  Perhaps the Minister can look at this area.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that many of the contributions are about the potential for development at sea, we must understand that the purpose of this Bill is the preservation and protection of our seas.  This State has been somewhat lethargic in reaching this point in terms of setting out a very clear plan, and the Minister has identified the other instruments that are proposed, to protect the ecological and biodiverse systems that are such a part of our ecology.  This must be the core of this.</p> <p>Married to the necessity of protecting and preserving our aquatic life and the tremendous resource our seas provide not just to our country but to the climate and globe generally are the opportunities for development we hope can be done in synergy and in sync with the necessity of protecting and preserving those resources.  I am very conscious of the potential for offshore wind energy capture and, in particular, the potential for floating offshore wind energy, which is well recognised notwithstanding the climatic conditions of today.  There is real potential for the capture of offshore wind energy off the west of Ireland - Galway, Clare and Kerry to name just three where there is real potential.  I am hopeful the provisions of this Bill will streamline the capacity of those who seek to invest and capture that wind energy and that the process by which permissions and licences are granted is relatively straightforward.</p> <p>I thumbed through the Bill in some detail and attempted to understand all the provisions.  Because of the complexity of the Bill and its size and scale, I am somewhat concerned.  I think those who propose to capture wind off our shores are also somewhat concerned.  The Minister knows the difficulties we have in terms of advancing large-scale infrastructural projects and the unwieldy nature of our planning system.  I am very much a believer in a robust planning system.  I believe there are things that should not be granted planning permission but I recognise there should be a relatively straightforward process for critical and key infrastructure.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There should be a relatively straightforward process for that.  There are on occasion some disingenuous objections that do not benefit anybody.  We need to ensure that where the greater good of the country is concerned, we should be in a position to move forward without getting it tied up at EU level or through continual iterations of cases through the courts.  I would be mindful of that and hopeful it will not emerge in the passage of this Bill or in putting in place the infrastructure and the structures behind it.</p><p>The next phase will be for the Department with responsibility for energy to take a much more proactive approach to capturing wind off the west coast of Ireland.  There are proposals to look at the east coast in some of the bids that are under way.  There is not only real potential for the capture of wind off our western seaboard on those floating systems but, because this is relatively nascent technology, there are also opportunities for us to develop hubs of activity here that will be in the early stages of this sector.  If we can be the pioneers of this floating offshore wind capture, there will be opportunities far beyond just the capture of wind.  There are opportunities for job creation, the development of skill sets and the production of some of the technology that can be exported from there.  It is a matter of acting as a counterpoint to the shift we have seen over a number of generations away from the west and towards the east because of the changes in the way in which people live their lives.  There are real opportunities there.  I am hopeful the Bill sets out a clear pathway - I think it does, from my reading of it, but I am not an expert in this area - for those who have ideas and the capacity to put in place this large-scale electricity generation infrastructure and that, where it is not appropriate, they will not waste their time or be dragged into an ever-decreasing circle that gets us nowhere.</p></speech>

I know the relevant committee has spent a lot of time getting into the details of the 245 pages and 181 sections of the Bill.  I wish to focus on just a number of key areas I am concerned about.</p> <p>First and foremost is the progression of the Bill while we do not have legislation on protected areas.  Sinn F&eacute;in has always argued - some would say "moaned"; it is called the democratic process - that legislation should have been done in parallel with this legislation.  We cannot have a situation in which our marine habitats and biodiversity are left with the scraps after the offshore wind projects.  I have seen presentations and heard commentary outside of this House by environmental organisations and people who are interested in wind about how Ireland could be exporting wind at a level that would see us as the Saudi Arabia of wind generation.  While I absolutely want Ireland to be ambitious with our renewable energy targets, we also cannot forget that there is a hierarchy when it comes to climate action.  At the top of that is to reduce the demand for energy in the first place.  We cannot continue to grow exponentially in a finite world, and it is essential we address both crises at the same time, that is, the biodiversity crisis alongside the climate crisis.  Biodiversity should not be the sacrificial lamb to climate action.</p> <p>In addition, as Senator Moynihan said, some of the most important carbon sinks we have are in our marine environment.  Apart from them warranting protection in their own right as species that share this planet with us, cetaceans, especially whales like baleen whales and sperm whales are enormous stores of carbon and a fundamental part of the marine ecosystem, and we know that exploration for offshore wind impacts on those species.  In addition, 40% of all CO2 produced is absorbed by marine phytoplankton.  That is four times what the Amazon does.</p> <p>Section 21 addresses protected marine sites but only the existing sites, which are a minuscule part of what needs to be designated in Ireland's marine.  I would like to hear from the Minister what interim protections there are in the Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Could we not include at least the proposed protected areas also?</p><p>I want to raise concerns regarding section 6 and the marine planning policy statement.  It seems this will happen without any public participation from sectoral organisations, academic experts or the wider public.  I question whether it is in compliance with the Constitution and the Aarhus Convention.  I am sure the Minister does not need reminding of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention.  It includes the right to participate in certain environmental decisions and the right to challenge certain environmental decisions.  My concerns regarding the Bill's compliance with the Aarhus Convention are not limited to section 6 but also section 7 and the references to judicial review in sections 105 and 107 to 109, inclusive, of the Bill.</p><p>Access to justice is a core pillar of any democracy.  We are seeing an increasing narrative that people are seeking judicial review from a vexatious point of view.  Let us not beat around the bush.  A total of 68% of judicial reviews are rejected.  This means 32% are accepted by the courts as having merit to be heard.  While the courts are not the best place to be making complex planning decisions, people's access to justice should not be restricted.  We are on dangerous ground if we are questioning those accepted for judicial review.  It strays into the grounds of questioning the independence of the Judiciary.  The best way to reduce challenges and delays is to transpose EU directives correctly and to be in full compliance with the Aarhus Convention.  All the evidence shows that if we involve the greatest possible participation of public and sectoral interest at the earliest point in the process, we will speed up delivery and encourage people to feel they have ownership and are part of the process.  What is the Minister's rationale for a six-year interim review?  International best practice is to have a review after one year.</p></speech>

I welcome the support of all parties and none in the House.  It is very important legislation.  I will deal with some of the issues on Committee Stage.  We might be able to deal with them in a little bit more detail then.  I have taken notes of all comments made.</p> <p>Section 6 of the Bill has been amended to reflect public participation and to allow for it, which is very important.  Senator Boyhan participated in the committee, along with Senators Moynihan, Fitzpatrick and Cummins.  I will provide a grid of the suggestions that were taken on board during pre-legislative scrutiny and that are now part of the Bill.</p> <p>Let us be clear about this.  We have to move on with the legislation.  If people want to find or create an issue that does not exist and use it as a reason not to proceed that is fine but it is for them to reflect on in eight, nine or ten years' time when we have not met the climate targets we have set.  I profoundly disagree with the comment that biodiversity is being sacrificed at the table of climate action.  That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  The Bill is about protecting our marine environment.  Effectively, it creates one big marine protected area first because it will regulate what happens in our maritime area.  If people watching this debate did not already know, they will now know exactly the size of it and that it is seven times our own land mass.  Everyone has alluded to it.</p> <p>Protecting marine areas is very important.  We are doing this and the legislation is happening.  Some in the Opposition, and this happened in the D&aacute;il also, try to use this - if the House will excuse the maritime analogy - as a red herring to delay this really important legislation.  With the passing of the Bill and the establishment of MARA, we will ensure that our total maritime area is regulated.  Let us not lose sight of this and let us not tell coastal communities or stakeholders that it is any different because it is not.  I speak as someone who represents a coastal constituency where I have lived my whole life.  I have immense regard for it, as do all of us.  We want to ensure our maritime area is protected and enhanced, the loss of biodiversity we have seen in our maritime area is reversed and the valuable resource is harnessed in a structured and sustainable way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We will be able to generate energy for our people into the future in a sustainable way to reduce our reliance on renewables.  If anything, people should have been asking why this was not done sooner.  I genuinely commend my officials on the work they have done with the Oireachtas joint committee and all Opposition and Government members of the committee on their input into this.  Now is the time to pass this Bill, to establish MARA and to put in train the regulatory authorities.</p><p>I will deal with some of the issues raised, including the idea that we should wait.  We had detailed public consultation on MPAs, and we needed to do that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and I were heavily involved in getting that done.  We are moving through with that legislation.  The idea that we should wait for a designation has been raised.  The Government is responsible for committing to the MPAs covering 30% of our maritime area.  This was not sought by, as far as I could tell, any members of the Opposition parties in that space.  We are doing it.</p></speech>

That is what this is about.</p><p>I will deal with a couple of the issues that were raised.  Public participation is really important.  Section 6 of the Bill has been amended to reflect that.</p><p>On the resourcing of MARA, I updated the Cabinet today on the establishment of the regulatory authority.  An implementation committee will start in my Department in January.  We have a budget of &euro;2 million.  We intend to move ahead with the appointment of a chairperson and an interim board, and to advertise for a CEO as well.  I want MARA to be established in a skeletal form so that we can build upon it by the middle of 2022.  That is what we are moving towards.  I refer to the advertisements of those posts and the expertise required because it is very specialised, particularly on the planning side.  It will take some time to get the right people, frankly, so we need to move on that and it will grow organically.</p><p>I take on board the points raised by Senators.  We will deal with them on Committee Stage and Report Stages, which I expect to be taken on Thursday and Friday of this week.</p><p>Senator Kyne asked about the elements of the foreshore licensing regime currently operating that will be left.  This Bill will effectively replace the Foreshore Act 1933 by taking everything out of it and putting it into MARA.  The only exception to this is the piece relating to aquaculture, which is with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  My view is that this piece should be under the remit of MARA.  That is being worked through with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at present.  In the short term, so as not to cause any difficulties in the area of aquaculture, it will be retained within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I believe that having one licensing authority for the marine is what we need.  Effectively, about 90% to 95% of all the other functions under the 1933 Act will come under the remit of MARA, with that sole exception.</p><p>We are providing in the short term for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to be able to approve MAC applications in the interim period.  Therefore, we can potentially move some of the applications that are already in the planning process along because it will probably take until January 2023 before the agency is fully incorporated, but it will be set up next year.  We will have a CEO, a board and a chairperson.</p><p>I understand Senator Malcolm Byrne's point about the exclusion of certain groups of individuals from being part of MARA.  I will take that point back.  One can consider how local authorities will interact with MARA and that elected representatives will not be involved in planning decisions <i>per se</i>.  I know the Senator has asked why we would pick on councillors, in that sense.  We are not really, but I take his point and we will explain it in a bit more detail-----</p></speech>

It will be for new applications coming through.</p><p>It is important for our coastal communities and the country as a whole that they know they have a Government that is prioritising the maritime area and reversing the decrease in the richness of the biodiversity of our seas and oceans and they can see that we are serious about doing all that.  We are going to have one streamlined regulatory authority to do that.  We are going to do what all generations in this country want, which is to make sure we have the secure, sustainable, clean and green energy that we need.  We do not have the luxury of waiting around and having continuous debate in that regard.  That is why we must move forward to get MARA established.  It will send a very clear signal to those who wish to invest in offshore renewables, be that offshore floating wind energy off the west coast, as mentioned by Senator Dooley, and the other options that will be there.  It will be very clear where people need to go because the current process is complex and difficult to get through.  It can be difficult for potential investors, in some instances, to figure out exactly what they need to do.  Now it has been very well received that there will be a streamlined regulatory and planning system in place in Ireland.  There is vast potential for this country to be a world leader in this space and I think that is what we all want.</p><p>In conclusion, I thank every Senator who contributed here.  There were a number of other queries, which I will get to later in the week.  I will supply additional information as best I can in advance of those debates.  I thank everyone for their support for this legislation.  I look forward to Committee and Remaining Stages later in the week.</p></speech>

This is only my second time to address the Twenty-sixth Seanad.  I am pleased to do so, and look forward to doing so again soon.</p> <p>When I spoke here last, in April, we were reopening the economy after a very difficult start to the year following the very severe Alpha wave.  I said at the time that we wanted to avoid a fourth wave later in 2021 and that, this time, we wanted construction, retail, hospitality and tourism to reopen and stay open.  Eight months on, the picture of progress is quite mixed.  Despite the successful vaccination programme and what seemed like a gradual normalisation of society, the virus is still very much with us and we are now experiencing a serious fourth wave.</p> <p>The new restrictions announced on Friday, which apply today, were a bitter pill and a bitter disappointment to all of us.  They were a body blow in particular for sectors like hospitality, the arts, events entertainment and leisure.  For the first time in the pandemic, we are tightening restrictions when the epidemiological situation appears to be improving, when numbers in hospital and ICU have peaked and are falling - or at least it appears that way - and deaths are at a relatively low level, thankfully.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are now outperforming even the most optimistic models presented to us only a few weeks ago.  This is due to the success of the third dose vaccine programme.  We expect that 1 million people will have received their third dose by the end of this week.  We have a robust test and isolate programme.  More tests are being carried out every day than at any time since the pandemic began.  We also have effective non-pharmaceutical interventions, NPIs, such as the wearing of masks.<br/><br/>When making decisions we did so based on strong public health advice and three concerns in particular: first, the certainty of increased social mixing as we approach Christmas and the impact that might have; a flu season that we did not experience last year but expect to experience this year and, of course, our immunity to the flu has waned as a consequence of social distancing; and, particularly, uncertainty about the Omicron variant.  The public continues to play a really positive role in the fight against Covid-19 by embracing the vaccination programme and responding to public health advice.  That resolve will be crucial in getting through the winter ahead.<br/><br/>Since the outbreak of Covid-19 here in March 2020, the Government has sought to save as many lives and as many livelihoods as possible.  The evidence indicates that we are doing well on both counts.  Our number of deaths per million is among the lowest in the EU while our vaccination rate is among the highest.  That is not a coincidence.<br/><br/>We have sought to keep workers connected to their employers and on the payroll.  We have sought to help businesses survive through a robust and sustained programme of financial support from the Government.  The Department of Finance estimates that we will have spent &euro;48 billion to support businesses and workers by the end of 2022.  This is the largest intervention by the State in the economy since the bank guarantee but it is a much better one.<br/><br/>The main schemes such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, compare very well internationally.  We have extended these schemes well beyond their original end dates.  We will continue to provide assistance where and when it is needed.  This was evident on Friday when we announced a package of financial interventions for the hospitality, events and entertainment sectors.  The package includes three options: an enhanced CRSS scheme for the affected sectors to supplement existing EWSS payments - and I anticipate that the Minister for Finance will be able to announced the details tomorrow; an extension of the targeted commercial rates waiver at least until the end of March next year; and an extra &euro;25 million from the Covid contingency fund applied to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, in particular to assist the live entertainment, arts and performance sectors.  As Senators will be aware, the PUP has also been reopened for workers who lose their jobs or have lost their jobs as a result of the newly announced restrictions.<br/><br/>As I said, the Government will step in to assist when and where it is necessary but we must do so in a targeted way.  Some parts of the economy and, indeed, the economy in the round are performing extremely well.  It is our responsibility to help those sectors that are not.  Thankfully, we can afford to do so and I would argue that we cannot afford not to.<br/><br/>From the point of view of my Department, more than 100,000 restart grants have been paid out to businesses during the course of 2021.  Where existing schemes did not reach certain businesses, we designed new ones to fill the gaps with <i>ad hoc</i>programmes such as the small business assistance scheme for Covid, SBASC, and the events sector Covid support scheme.  There will need to be another round of the latter scheme given the most recent announcement and the impact that will have on the events sector.  Other Departments acted similarly with special schemes for transport, aviation, the arts and sports among others.<br/><br/>Although they are not as well known and are not talked about much, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, InterTradeIreland, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and local enterprise offices, LEOs, have all provided funding to businesses since March 2020.  For example, the not so well known sustaining enterprise fund has approved &euro;206 million in non-repayable grants and loans thus helping to sustain approximately 30,000 jobs in businesses ranging from engineering to construction, to food and to consumer retail.  We also introduced a range of new loans to help businesses respond to Covid-19 and Brexit.  For example, 7,700 loans have been drawn down under the State's largest ever loan facility, the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, totalling more than &euro;500 million.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are extending the scheme for at least another six months by way of an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill due to be enacted this month.  I am sure the Seanad will be happy to support this.  The Department is also carrying out a review of our most popular and oversubscribed loan scheme, that is, the future growth loan scheme, with a view to a new loan product to replace it in 2022.  It is a little-known fact that almost one third of all lending to business is now Government-backed in some way.</p><p>Many people predicted a tsunami of business closures when the pandemic first hit in early 2020.  Thankfully, that has not transpired, at least not yet.  In the meantime, we have reformed the law in this area to help as many businesses as possible to survive.  Earlier today, I signed an order commencing the new small companies administrative rescue process, SCARP, legislation.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, for spearheading this initiative and the Senators present for their speedy consideration of the Bill earlier in the year.  From today, small and micro companies have access to a new restructuring and rescue process mirroring examinership but in an administrative form.  It is designed to be cheaper and faster than the court-sponsored examinership system and, taken together with the range of grants and loans available, should save viable businesses and jobs that would otherwise have been lost.</p><p>When the Government published the economic recovery plan in June, I stated that we were going to go for broke by backing business to ensure our economy could recover lost ground quickly and exceed pre-crisis employment levels by 2024.  Five months on, the strategy is working.  The economy is rebounding strongly.  Employment figures released last week show that more than 110,000 people returned to work in the third quarter of the year.  Encouragingly, employment is up in every region and every sector.  A smooth recovery, however, is certainly not guaranteed, and the announcement last Friday of the reimposition of some restrictions is a reminder to us all in that regard.  It is a setback and we need to acknowledge that, but the economic recovery plan is not just about recovery.  It is also about the future, enabling workers and businesses to make the green and digital transition.</p><p>Later this week, I will launch the climate toolkit for business with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  It will provide businesses with a tailored assessment of their carbon footprint.  This complements initiatives such as the new green for micro scheme and the lean for micro scheme which benefit businesses through cost savings, improving resource efficiency, reducing environmental impacts and enhancing competitiveness and productivity.</p><p>We will be doing our best to help businesses to adapt and plan for the next decade, especially the digital transition.  This will include a new &euro;10 million digital transition fund to increase digitalisation of all businesses across products, processes, supply chains and business models and initiatives to help to upskill workers.</p><p>The economic recovery plan is also about building a more inclusive economy, with fewer barriers to employment and better conditions for employees.  We have already seen the benefits of remote and flexible working. It opens up a range of possibilities for rural Ireland, with less commuting and fewer barriers to employment, particularly for people with caring responsibilities - including, but not exclusively, many women - and those with disabilities.</p><p>In the near future, I will be publishing draft legislation on the right to request remote work.  This complements the work already done under the national remote work strategy, such as the introduction of the new code of practice on the right to disconnect.  The legislation on the right to request remote work has taken longer than I anticipated, but there is good reason for this.  New rights are being created for the first time in Ireland and our extensive stakeholder consultation has illustrated the breadth of issues on which we must strike a delicate balance.</p><p>The House is aware of the actions I am taking to improve workers&rsquo; terms and conditions, including a further increase in the minimum wage, due in January; the introduction of statutory sick pay, which is currently under consideration by the committee; the move to a living wage; the protection of tips; and a review of collective bargaining and the industrial relations landscape in Ireland.</p><p>At the moment, we are finalising legislation giving effect to Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory sick pay scheme.  The Oireachtas committee&rsquo;s pre-legislative scrutiny report is awaited and we will progress the Bill as soon as the report is received.</p><p>Earlier this year, I asked the Low Pay Commission to examine how Ireland could move towards a living wage and to make recommendations on the best and most suitable approach in an Irish context.  I am awaiting that report and hope to bring proposals to the Cabinet in the new year.</p><p>In October, I received Government approval for draft legislation to protect employees&rsquo; tips and give customers transparency in respect of how tips are distributed and what happens to the service charge they pay.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">The T&aacute;naiste:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We should be able to enact that legislation in the first half of next year.  I aim to do so before the summer recess.  I do not have time to mention all the reforms we are pursuing in the Department and across government but I am confident they will lead to a substantial improvement in the terms and conditions of workers, without damaging business or the wider competitiveness of society.  </p><p>I am conscious that many businesses are really struggling and that some will be struggling for some time to come.  Therefore, we will sequence these reforms appropriately over the next few years.  The most important workers' right is the right to work, and I do not want to do anything that might cause businesses to fail or workers to have their hours reduced or to lose their jobs.  I look forward to hearing Senators' contributions and to responding to their questions later.</p></speech>

I am conscious that as we speak, there are businesses right across the country that are closed not because of Covid measures but because of Storm Barra.  It is a really difficult time for businesses today.  This will possibly be the case tomorrow.  They are extremely worried about that.  In that context, about a year ago the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State responsible for the OPW, Deputy O'Donovan, set up a humanitarian support scheme for businesses that were not able to secure insurance at the time.  Will there be such a measure after the current storm?  The Minister responsible for housing was speaking in this Chamber some hours ago about this matter.  There is a case for another scheme, depending on how it goes over the next 24 hours.</p> <p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's contribution.  The number of measures introduced in the past year and a half is phenomenal.  There are two sectors on which I want to focus: hospitality and tourism.  Over recent weeks, and certainly in the past two months, businesses in the hospitality sector, such as pubs, restaurants and hotels, have been really worried about what will happen at Christmas.  There was almost a feeling that it was inevitable that they would be closed over the winter months.  When the announcement came last week, many of the people I have spoken to were reassured that they would be able to continue and keep staff employed over Christmas.  The sense I get from employers, in particular, is that they really appreciate the support that has been given to the sector over the past 18 months.  The EWSS, the CRSS, the online trading voucher, the rates waiver, which has been welcomed for the first quarter of next year also, and the restart grants are among many measures put in place to support businesses.  Businesses say that if it had not been for those supports, they would not be operating.</p> <p>Many hoteliers, including those from Minella Hotel in Clonmel and the Anner Hotel in Thurles, have got on to me to outline their concerns.  They say their occupancy rate over Christmas will drop to approximately 27%.  This is a huge reduction.  The hoteliers expect an occupancy rate of 5% to 8% in January and February.  Therefore, there will be considerable worry over the coming months.  While hoteliers welcome the announcement made last week, they have some requests.  It will take time for them to see the results of the new measures that are being introduced, particularly under CRSS, to support them in keeping on their employees.  Some of their requests relate to the EWSS and the qualification criteria.  It has been requested that businesses that are eligible in December be allowed to requalify for EWSS supports in January.  On the CRSS supports, hospitality businesses have requested that the criteria include automatic qualification for CRSS supports if they qualify for the EWSS.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many hotels have asked me to argue that the weekly cap on CRSS payments should be set at &euro;25,000 to ensure that large hospitality businesses will not be disadvantaged by the scheme.  The hotel sector is the lifeblood of many rural towns.  It is the heartbeat of everything that happens and there is a strong knock-on economic effect when hotels are performing well.</p><p>On tourism, there many tour operators, including golf tour operators and other small businesses throughout the country - I am thinking of one I know in Cahir, Tourwise - that create two, three or four jobs.  They get the EWSS, which is very beneficial to keeping people employed.  During 2021, however, a scheme was set up through the European Union, namely, the Ireland-based inbound agents, IBIA, business continuity scheme, to support businesses when it was clear that few or no tourists were going to be coming into the country.  A total of &euro;10 million in funding was provided by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  As I think we are going to be in the same position next year, perhaps that scheme could be used again next year for these businesses.  Their base has reduced by 99.6% and 93%, and a scheme like that would be very beneficial to keep them going.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-07a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1695" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021120700002#PPP00200"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to this very important debate.  I thank him and the Government for not being found wanting over the past 18 months with their support for businesses.  As I hear every day from businesses in my neck of woods in Limerick, many of them would not have survived if not for the supports that have been put in place.  As the T&aacute;naiste said on Friday last, while we do not yet know the full extent of the Omicron variant and what people face, the correct decisions had to be taken by the Government even if they will have a knock-on effect on hospitality and tourism.</p> <p>Another sector that has had a knock-back in terms of its revenue falling is that of travel agents.  They have had a tough time over the past 18 months.  My understanding, and I have heard it from people in the industry, is there was a very positive meeting as late as yesterday relating to the supports.  I spoke to one small business owner who employs 45 people.  They said there is talk that they will have to be down by 50%.  When I talked to them and colleagues of theirs, they said many of them are down by 46% or 47%, not quite 50%, but that is because they have driven their own businesses by taking steps such as offering takeaway or selling vouchers, which has helped to increase their revenue.  Could the 50% figure be examined?  It is crucial.  While 50% seems a lot for a small business, if they were down by 46% or 47%, many of them would not be open if not for the supports.  In the example of a small business I gave, that would be 45 jobs lost.  </p> <p>Finally, it is very positive that people who lost their jobs will be supported.  These supports are to be welcomed and the announcement relating to rates will be of great benefit.  Costs are increasing, not least because of the change to the minimum wage, which I welcome, as are costs relating to insurance and so on.  The pause in the collection of rates for the first three months is certainly the correct message.</p></speech>

The Government's reaction to the Omicron variant makes a mockery of the idea of living with Covid.  It slapped restrictions into place based on zero data, when the ink on the newspapers reporting the variant&rsquo;s mere existence was not even dry, and the panic machine swung into overdrive.  Common sense and critical thinking have not made their way into decision-making either.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Covid-19 certificates have been required for indoor dining since their inception.  If additional restrictions are being reintroduced for these settings with the return of table service-only in bars with a maximum of six people to a table, with no multi-table bookings, that means that the Covid-19 certificate is not preventing the spread of the virus in them.</p><p>What does the Government do with these certificates?  It expands them to gyms and leisure centres.  Because we have developed the system we might as well use it.  Does it work?  Who knows?  Who cares?  We do not have the data on its effectiveness as a measure or on the effectiveness of practically any Covid-19 measure that the Government has introduced, no matter how often it is asked for this in this House or the other House.  </p><p>It is goodbye to nightclubs again with 50% capacity for events which I am sure will make them uneconomic the unfeasible for many venues and artists to actually host or perform.  Of course, since these venues are technically allowed, full supports do not have to be given to them.  </p><p>The panic machine slapped tests back on to the menu for travellers in order to be seen to be doing something when it has been known for more than a year that community transmission is where effective protection begins and ends and no level of border policing will prevent the presence of Omicron in the country.  This has been based upon, well, nothing really.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has described the new measures as precautionary in nature saying that they will be lifted if the Omicron variant does not meet our worst fears.  Is that really where the Government is at?  Blanket restrictions have been imposed on the country based on our worst fears, which, of course, will never be realised.  </p><p>The worst fears of NPHET has never been realised over the entire course of its time in the spotlight, despite the worst-case scenario depictions being the ones given all of the media attention.  In fact, many times we did slightly better than the scenarios labelled as "optimistic", not that many media figures point that out.  Those fears will be shown to be falsely based yet again with Omicron.  Dr. Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association attested to this even as she identified the variant.  She said that it was unfortunate that Omicron had been hyped as: &ldquo;this extremely dangerous virus variant with multiple mutations&rdquo; and that even unvaccinated patients with it &ldquo;had only shown mild symptoms and recovered fully without hospitalisation&rdquo;.  Even as the science on the ground explicitly stated Omicron's presence was no reason for panicking, NPHET, the Government and the media decided, as they always do, to collectively lose their heads.  I hope to God that the words of the Minister, Deputy McGrath, are true and that these restrictions will be lifted swiftly once we gain an accurate depiction of Omicron's profile.  </p><p>The White House chief medical officer, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the signs of Omicron are encouraging regarding its severity based on the data that suggests that it may not be as bad as initially feared.  A report from the South African Medical Research Council released last Saturday suggests that the strain could cause a milder infection.  The main observation in the report was that most patients were not oxygen-dependent and most patients in Covid-19 wards were incidental Covid-19 patients having had another medical or surgical reason for admission to the hospital.  A young fella, for example, breaks his leg, pops into the hospital after three days and develops a bit of a scratchy throat.  Just like that, he is another young person hospitalised with Covid-19.</p><p>I digress as  we are here to focus on trade and employment.  It is very simple.  Impacted businesses should be given the full supports they were ever given and this should not be seen as a case that lockdown by any other name should lead to this not happening.  I would rather that those supports were not needed and that the businesses in our sectors that have been hit the hardest were not being asked again to take one for the team.  </p><p>Finally, on the reintroduction of the PUP, this payment has been a lifesaver for so many workers who have been precluded from earning a living.  It is also the case that there have been problems with the system even though that has been unpopular to point out.  It cannot be the case that the Government is incentivising unemployment.  I would appreciate if the Minister could address the systems that are in place to avoid situations whereby an individual may choose the PUP over employment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Surely the T&aacute;naiste can recognise that these restrictions in no way reflect any semblance of living with Covid?  Instant recourse to economically-stifling measures is a blatantly unsustainable practice.  Deputy McNamara put it best in the Lower House last week when he asked when is the end.  Covid is not going to disappear overnight.  If one cannot vaccinate 100% of the population, we will still have Covid in this country.  What is the solution?  Where is the plan?  What we have now is no plan at all.  The constant uncertainty for business and the cost of these restrictions is real money for SMEs.  There is an uneven distribution of responsibility in the economy.  Companies and businesses have huge HR issues and face mixed messaging and a lack of leadership.  There is a massive gap between employees who are fearful and those who are revelling in further restrictions.  It is okay for our bin men to empty our bins or for others to stack our shelves, but it is not okay to attend places of work.  This creates massive inequality between people in different types of employment.  We must get serious about living with Covid because we have put living on hold for long enough.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste is the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The current restrictions are in place until 9 January.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to give a commitment here today that both Houses will be recalled should Omicron prove not to be as serious as initially thought, so that the restrictions can be lifted during recess.  Recess runs from 17 December until mid-January.  I would like the T&aacute;naiste to make that commitment today.  If we are needed back in the Chamber, we should be brought back.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-07a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1646" speakername="Ollie Crowe" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021120700002#RRR00200"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House.  I wish to welcome the comments from the Government in general that these new restrictions can be removed quickly if we gather more information and data on Omicron and it emerges that it is not as threatening as originally feared.  The T&aacute;naiste, in his contribution, set that out.</p> <p>We are all aware that the hospitality and live entertainment sectors have been hit harder than most throughout the pandemic.  Unfortunately, that continues with the introduction of further restrictions today.  Even prior to the restrictions being introduced, the public health messaging was having a severe impact on the sectors.  I am sure all Members have been made aware by local business owners of how many events and Christmas parties have been cancelled and the general reluctance among people to go out and socialise.  This is traditionally the busiest period of the year for businesses in the hospitality sector.  It is this month that allows businesses to survive the quiet January and February period when very little happens.  What is most important now is that effective supports are implemented as the sector seeks to get through this.  As has been outlined, the Covid recovery support scheme, CRSS, currently requires a 50% fall in the income from 2019 levels for businesses to be eligible.  This leaves the vast majority of businesses incapable of claiming support at a time when they desperately need to do so.  For example, the owners of the Pilot Bar and restaurant in County Sligo stated yesterday that their income is down 40% compared with 2019 levels.  With the changes to the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, their wage bill now makes up 58% of turnover.  Naturally, anyone who has ever run a business knows that a wage bill of 58% of turnover is not sustainable.  The situation is not good.</p> <p>I say to the T&aacute;naiste that the situation of the owners of that business is not unique.  There are businesses up and down the country that are operating under similar pressures and facing uncertain futures due to the crisis that are not of their own making.  If we want these businesses to survive and if we want to offer them the chance they deserve to rebuild, we must provide them with the supports to do so.  When the decision was made to reduce the EWSS at the specific point in time last week, it was done on the assumption that there would be no restrictions in place.  Unfortunately, the situation has altered since then and there are restrictions in place now.  I think there is a broad understanding of the need for the Government to respond appropriately to changes during the pandemic, but when that is done, we must counter restrictions by providing supports for businesses that are impacted.  The Government has stated that it will provide specific support measures for impacted sectors.  In that respect, the criteria for the CRSS should be reduced.  We must allow more businesses to claim support.  The current criteria, which requires a 50% reduction in income from 2019 levels, should be altered to 25%.  This would allow a greater number of businesses to claim the support they require.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ollie Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> One aspect that has not received much attention, or perhaps as much as it deserves, is the impact the pandemic has had on the loss of experienced staff, again particularly in terms of the hospitality and live events sector.  Certainly in Galway city and county, a very large number of businesses have told me how many experienced and knowledgeable staff they have lost since March 2020.  This is understandable because staff want certainty in employment.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that more than 250,000 people are working in the hospitality sector, as he is well aware. </p><p>I have also raised the mortgage issue with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  There is an issue when it comes to couples drawing down mortgages if one of them is an employee working in the hospitality sector and if that business is receiving the wage subsidy scheme.  This causes significant concern for people applying for a mortgage to try to get onto the ladder for the first time.  We need to look at this.</p><p>People may not want to work for business where, due to external events, they may have to reduce their hours at short notice.  In this context, I am referring to chefs, managers and front of house staff.  Employees who are essential to the business are not easily replaced.  During a pandemic these skilled and capable people are being offered greater certainty in other industries and, understandably, they are moving to those sectors.  In Galway city, the medical device industry is employing a huge number of staff.  While this is welcome, it is leaving the hospitality sector really struggling for chefs, managers, and front of house staff.  There is an issue there and we need to take it on board.  When such staff leave, these businesses are losing years of experience and know-how, and any new employee, no matter how capable, simply cannot replace this.  It is not an issue for today or tomorrow but it has a long-term impact on the businesses.  I suggest to the T&aacute;naiste that we would look at a long-term task force for the sustainability of the hospitality sector.  In Galway city, the hotels, restaurants and bars are under enormous pressure.</p><p>Members will be aware that at the start of 2021 the Government launched two free programmes that aimed to upskill employees in the hospitality sector.  This was welcome and needed, but it needs to be expanded with a broader range of courses to provide employees across the hospitality and live events sector the opportunity to upskill and learn.</p><p>Again, as with other Members of the House, I welcome the reintroduction of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  I am aware from those I meet every day that nobody wants to go back on this payment again, but it is a welcome step given the introduction of the restrictions.  Those who must go onto the payment obviously are doing so at the worst time of year with Christmas just a few weeks away.  It is positive the Government has restored the full rate.</p><p>I note those places with live entertainment events planned over the next month are in a very difficult position.  The sector was just beginning to get back on its feet after an extraordinarily difficult 18 months.  As with the hospitality sector, the Christmas period is also the busiest for them throughout the year.  I have been contacted by the organisers of shows, concerts and pantos who advise us they have already fully sold out many shows over the Christmas period.  They have stated it is not economically viable for them to do shows at half capacity as they would be losing money.  The announcement of an additional &euro;25 million is very welcome for this sector.  It certainly shows the Government's support.</p><p>I have a couple of brief questions for the T&aacute;naiste on the wage subsidy scheme.  As a person who operates a business, I am not fully clear about the reduction of 40% from &euro;350 down to &euro;203.  I do not understand why it is not sector specific.  I believe it defeats the logic of trying to keep people within the sector who have the skill set required and to link the employee to the employer.  Can this be looked at again?  It would help people to remain in the industry and it would also help people not to go onto the pandemic unemployment payment.</p><p>I referred to the problems around mortgage applications.  It is relevant because young couples have contacted me where one of the partners is working in the sector.  The couple certainly have the ability to get the mortgage, but over the past 18 months it has become an issue.  For how much longer will this go on?</p><p>I would also ask for a response on the task force to look at the long-term viability of the hospitality sector.</p></speech>

It is nice to see Deputy Varadkar in the House again.  The Irish people care and worry a lot about Covid.  They want to protect each other, as can be seen from our high vaccination rate.  They are smart people.  They do not need to be forced to do anything.  They have embraced most of the public health advice.  It is very important that we are very clear as to what we are asking them to do and why.  That is one thing that we, as a Government, have failed to do.  Our communications have left much to be desired.  We have a three-party coalition but we need to speak with one voice on anything we are bringing to the public because the media and the Opposition love to tear us to shreds and divert attention from the important things we are asking people to do.  It is important that we have one unified voice because there is sometimes some confusion.  This is not necessarily always the Government's fault but, when we see leaks from people in NPHET or Cabinet, it is no wonder that people get confused.  That is one thing I wanted to raise while the Minister is in the House.  We need our communications to be much clearer and to speak with one voice as a coalition Government.</p> <p>I also have a suggestion with regard to the entertainment sector.  Millions of euro have been promised to support this sector, which has been shut down only a few weeks after being opened.  As Senator Crowe has pointed out, businesses in this sector must operate at 50% capacity.  As I suggested to the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, we should consider paying performers to perform twice.  That way, the two 50% capacity audiences get to go to the event while the performer gets paid twice.  I know that, in some instances, it is hoped the performer will do two performances for the price of one but that does not really cut the mustard if these performance fees are their bread and butter.  That might be something to do.  I do not know if the Minister has fully decided what to do with that money but those performers deserve to get paid twice to perform twice so that the whole audience can be embraced because we all need to be entertained nearly two years into this morbid situation in which nobody has wanted to be.</p> <p>The Government has done pretty well overall.  Loads of money has been thrown at every single sector while trying to figure out the best way to support them.  We are a new Government and have never had a pandemic to deal with before so, all things considered, we are doing okay.  The mixed messaging does not help.  That is not all our fault but the people of Ireland are good at following public health advice.  It is also good that we have good figures from the hospitals which show that half of Covid cases in those hospitals are among the unvaccinated 3%.  That proves that the vaccinations are having an effect.  That is definitely food for thought.  Of course, we originally hoped the vaccinations would just stop us getting Covid but, from looking at the figures from the hospitals that feed into the advice from NPHET, it seems that the levels of ill health among those vaccinated, if they do get Covid, are much less than those among those who have not received the vaccine.  That is also something we should be very clear about with people.</p> <p>I keep hearing that Covid is our fault or that we do not care about people.  Everybody in here really cares about the public and public health and wants the economy to recover.  However, we are damned if we do open the economy and we are damned if we do not.  It is quite difficult.  Someone was harassing me on a radio station the other day and demanding to be told whether the schools would be closed in January.  I do not have a crystal ball.  None of us do.  Hindsight is 20/20.  Perhaps we could have done things differently.  We definitely made some mistakes but, as a Government, we have not done too badly overall.  We are a new three-party coalition.  Perhaps that is why we need to look at our communications.  If one communicates clearly with people, people will understand and do what is being asked of them.  </p> <p>The public health advisers base all of their decisions on physical health.  We need to have some psychologists feeding into NPHET's advice as well because mental and physical health cannot be separated.  We have to be able to convince people that these measures are the best thing for the nation's physical and mental health.  We all know that the incidence of mental health issues has increased greatly as a result of Covid.  As I said earlier, that is not the Government's fault but Covid's fault.  However, at the same time, we need to consider the balance between mental and physical health.  They are not separate things.  </p> <p>Every time the Government makes a decision, even on very simple things like asking children to wear masks in schools, we have to defend that decision.  It was a pity they were told to wear masks only a day before they had to do it.  Everybody needs time to adjust.  That was a mistake.  We should have given people a bit more time.  If we are asking people to do things like this, we have to immediately tell them why.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Is it because so many cases are coming in that age group?  If it is that serious an issue that we are making children aged nine to 12 wear masks, should we not consider closing the schools two and a half days early on Friday week?  That would give the schools three full weeks without students in them.  If it really is that big an issue in schools, instead of them all working to the half-day on the Wednesday, which is 22 December, perhaps we should consider not sending them to school for those two and a half days.  I know they have missed many days already but if it is so serious in schools that we are making children aged nine to 12 wear masks, perhaps we should give schools three weeks off altogether.  I might be killed for asking this question, but if it is so serious that we must make kids wear masks, should schools close so we can get three weeks to stop the rise in numbers?  Clear communication is so important.  The only way we will succeed is if we up our game as a unified voice on what we are doing and why we are asking people to do it.  Sometimes I have to go searching for the reasons we are doing something and if I have to look for them, it cannot be easy for the public to find them either.</p><p>On a final note, I know we are talking about enterprise, trade and employment.  There have been great supports for small to medium enterprises and the T&aacute;naiste has done very well in that respect.  I know in the budget there was a promise of good funding for the green for micro programme and for the digitalisation of businesses.  I know local enterprise offices have done huge work in getting small businesses online.  There has never been a more important time for everybody in the country and all of us as a Seanad and as a people to try, if at all possible, to support local businesses.  We might not be able to afford everything locally but we should at least try to make some conscious effort because small businesses support local clubs and sponsor events.  They need our money more than any big multinational that makes millions of euro.</p><p>I am repeating myself.  This time last year I was saying we should not worry about Mr. Bezos getting enough money for his kids to go to Irish dancing classes or whatever but we must worry about our small businesses.  It has never been more important for all of us as consumers to buy local.  It has been said we will spend &euro;5 billion this Christmas so could we please put as much of that as possible into the tills of small businesses?  We should buy green as well because we are in a climate emergency as well as a health emergency.</p><p>This has not been an easy time for the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach or the leader of the Green Party, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  At the same time, it is up to the three of them to be really professional and clear in their communication, with one voice.  It is a really important message that I wanted to get across today.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his time in coming to the House today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-07a.165" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021120700002#UUU00200"><p>It is nice to see the T&aacute;naiste.  He is very welcome.  To begin I will deal with those new restrictions announced on Friday.  I will not play politics with Covid-19 and we should follow the science.  I appreciate the fact the Cabinet has moved to provide supports that are very badly needed.</p> <p>I have a couple of examples for the T&aacute;naiste.  I spoke to somebody in one of the major hotels in Limerick who told me ten big nights had been planned over Christmas and that has now been reduced to two.  It is a huge impact and we all know many of these businesses are depending on Christmas trade in order to keep going and buy time, effectively, as we head into the new year.  I also had the pleasure of being in west Cork a week and a half ago and saw an event there drop from 100 people to 30 people because of uncertainty.  We can understand why the uncertainty occurs but it demonstrates again the impact on businesses.  There has been a fair degree of frustration because of mixed messaging from the Government but I am not saying anything new in that regard.  It was interesting to hear it put to me so strongly by somebody very much of a different political persuasion.  It is important we put controls in place.</p> <p>If people are on the PUP but did not manage to get back into the hospitality business, they would be on a lower payment.  Now, if people lose a job because of the most recent announcements, they are on a higher rate of payment.  The higher rate is correct but it is fundamentally unfair that one worker would have a reduced payment while another has the higher payment.  Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for some time, as the T&aacute;naiste knows, that we should maintain the PUP because of the degree of uncertainty out there.  I would like to see the T&aacute;naiste address that matter as it strikes me as extremely unfair that one worker could be on significantly less of a payment because he or she was not able to win back a job in the hospitality sector.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste gave quite a thoughtful speech so I want to be constructive and work through some of the key points he raised.  I will hone in on the theme of an economic recovery plan and building a more inclusive economy with better conditions for workers.  It is a theme I would certainly warm to.  I will hit on some of the topics raised by the T&aacute;naiste.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The first is the issue of sick pay.  It is something that we were promised a year ago.  We saw it in the joint committee on enterprise, trade and employment two weeks ago.  It was a hell of a long time coming.  Given the great crises we have seen across workplaces this year we really should have acted sooner.  I am just worried about how much longer it is going to take us to get this Bill onto the floor of the Oireachtas and into law.  The T&aacute;naiste might let me know what his timeline is.  I can assure him that our committee will not be a delaying factor.  </p><p>I am concerned that the Bill as currently structured does not specify that move to ten days' leave over a number of years.  It basically leaves it up to statutory instruments to bring that into being.  I am concerned because that allows wriggle room to row back on the ten days.  We have been an outlier on sick pay for an awful long time as the T&aacute;naiste knows, in terms of our European colleagues.  It is really important that we get that legislation in place, that it specifies a move to ten days' leave and that we see it implemented, rather than the next time we have a recession some Minister saying we cannot move ahead with it because it would be too risky.  Every worker deserves a decent rate of sick pay.  It is not something we should have to wait this long for.  I would like to get a timeline from the T&aacute;naiste on that point.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste's point about the living wage is welcome.  However, so far this Government has moved the minimum wage up by just 40 cent in the first two budgets.  It is on schedule to make an increase of just &euro;1 over the lifetime of the Government if it continues at the rate it is going.  In actual fact we are falling further behind the living wage, which has moved up to &euro;12.90.  The gap has increased under the current Government.  What concrete steps is it going to take?  We need a step change to ensure that people who work for a living are able to earn a living.  That is not happening for too many workers at the moment.  If we are going to build back better, and we often use that phrase, we need to see concrete actions to deliver that.  One of those concrete actions is a step change in respect of the minimum wage moving to a living wage.  If the T&aacute;naiste has a timeline or plans for how he is going to change matters in that regard, I would really like to hear about them.</p><p>I am pleased to hear about the protection of tips Bill.  I have been following it.  The T&aacute;naiste may be aware that my own Bill is still live.  It cleared all Stages in the last Seanad.  We really need to make sure the Government gets this right.  There is a massive issue with tips in the hospitality sector.  One in three workers were not getting their tips in the most recent research.  Is the Government going to establish a legal right to tips for employees?  That is what needs to happen.  That is what my Bill will do.  Is the T&aacute;naiste going to deal with the scam that is service charges?  There was a lot of research done on this and we know that far too many hotels and restaurants were charging service charges and not passing them on to employees.  I need to understand what the legal consequences of the T&aacute;naiste's proposed legislation will be to deal with that issue.  </p><p>More fundamentally we have an issue in respect of low pay.  We have one of the largest proportions of workers on low pay of any state in Europe.  Figures ICTU referenced just after the budget indicated that 750,000 employees earned less than &euro;400 per week in 2019, representing 31% of total class A PRSI employees.  The budget did nothing in respect of that issue of low pay.  If the T&aacute;naiste is talking about better conditions for workers, he must be talking about better pay for workers.  I want to understand the steps the Government is going to take to ensure that happens.  There is one simple step it could take.  I know the social partners, my colleagues in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and my own union, SIPTU, have stressed the need to establish a statutory right to collective bargaining.  If we allow workers to bargain for their pay they will bargain better pay and it will be better for everybody concerned and will be a much more equal and egalitarian society.  It was very disappointing to note earlier this year that the T&aacute;naiste wrote to the European Commission asking that the EU directive on minimum wages would not be binding.  That directive contains a lot of proposals for increasing collective bargaining across the State.  Has the T&aacute;naiste changed his mind in that regard?  There seems to be a growing wind of support for that minimum wage directive and I would like to know where the T&aacute;naiste stands on it now.  The best way to increase working conditions is to give workers a right to collective bargaining.  </p><p>My last point has been raised a number of times by me and others.  It falls under the enterprise category.  We know that no one is safe until everyone is safe in respect of vaccines.  We know that we need to see a waiver of intellectual property rights for these vaccines in order to let developing countries develop their own generic versions of those vaccines and get their populations vaccinated.  In Africa at the moment just 4% of the population is vaccinated.  To be frank, we have heard consistently that the T&aacute;naiste is one of the key people in the Cabinet blocking the waiving of intellectual property rights which in turn is denying people vaccines.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The most recent horrifying figure is that we have had 5 million deaths in the developing world because of a lack of vaccines.  I repeat that figure, 5 million deaths.</p><p>I respectfully ask the T&aacute;naiste to change the Government's stance on dropping intellectual properties rights, allowing those rights to be waived in order that people in developing countries can get access to those vaccines and, hopefully, then we can move to a better stage.  Otherwise we will go from variant to variant.  It is extremely disappointing to see the Government aligned with big pharma and against the people of the world.  Let us be clear, that is what the T&aacute;naiste and his Government have been doing.  I would like a positive response in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-07a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1632" speakername="Frances Black" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021120700002#WWW00200"><p>The T&aacute;naiste is welcome to the House.  It is hard to believe but here we are again, speaking about the reintroduction of restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19.  As we have seen on too many occasions throughout this pandemic, the road ahead is full of twists and turns.  It is very upsetting.  I recognise the need for the public health guidance and guidelines to help us in preventing the spread of Covid-19 in our communities.  I know how important it is particularly as we head into the winter months.  We need to move from reactive to proactive decision-making to ultimately provide a greater level of certainty and predictability to Irish society than has been seen throughout the pandemic so far.</p> <p>As my Seanad colleagues will be aware, I came to politics later in my working life.  My true professional background is in music and live entertainment.  This is a trade that took me a long time to learn.  I dedicated most of my life to it.  Like my friends, colleagues and family in the industry, I possess a unique insight about the impact of the pandemic on the lives and livelihoods of people working in music and entertainment.  As I noted in the Chamber many times, the music and live entertainment industries have shouldered a greater burden during this pandemic than have most others.  There is no denying that.  The industry is literally on its knees.  If we do not assist the industry in getting back on its feet to provide the support to ensure a long-term vitality and vibrancy, it will be a true loss to Irish society, culture and identity.</p> <p>Last Friday evening we received word of the latest public health restrictions, many of which are likely to disproportionately impact the music and entertainment industry.  Prior to that announcement, however, the situation for musicians and the entertainment sector had already been deteriorating for some time.  On 22 October, after 589 days of closure, the music and entertainment sector reopened, albeit with restrictive measures in place.  Reopening the industry was not a matter of just flicking a switch.  For many people employed in music and entertainment it was a cautious and very measured process.  Within a few weeks of the reopening public health advice was updated, encouraging people to reduce their social contacts.  The midnight curfew was introduced soon after.  Although this did not explicitly affect gigs and shows taking place before midnight, it did have an impact on the public's attitude and awareness and ticket sales reduced immediately and cancellations followed shortly after that.  As the weeks progressed, the public health advice became more explicit, in that Christmas parties might be a bad idea, children should not attend seasonal activities such as the pantomime outside school and people ought to spend less time in high-risk environments.  The general public headed the public health advice, and rightly so.  However, audiences reduced to a point where gigs simply were not viable.  At the beginning of last week, gigs, shows, concerts and events were being cancelled across the board.  Musicians had their December diaries completely wiped out.  The restrictions announced last Friday then formally sealed the fate of this industry for the foreseeable future with the repercussions to be felt well into 2022.  </p> <p>The pandemic unemployment payment has thankfully reopened for applications and workers in this sector who had returned to work in the interim should now be able to avail of this lifeline but the industry and the people working in it need more than a lifeline.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to show the industry the respect it deserves instead of consistently asking it to take one for the team.  Musicians and entertainers have sacrificed their livelihoods for the greater good of the country but the sentiment within the industry now is that musicians and entertainers feel the need to beg to ensure access to the basic supports they have been promised by the Government.  This is what really upsets me.  The phrase &quot;they will not be found wanting&quot; has been used <i>ad nauseam</i>but the lived reality for musicians and entertainers tells a completely different story.  I am inundated with stories from musicians and entertainers contacting me along with other people working in the industry.  It is really upsetting.<br/><br/>A young man contacted me yesterday who has a young family and a mortgage to pay and is panicking about Santa Claus and getting presents.  He got a phone call to say that his gigs were cancelled coming up to Christmas.  One can imagine the anxiety, stress and impact of that from a financial point of view along with the impact on mental health.  He went to ask about the PUP.  It is degrading.  This is a man who is highly qualified and has spent years training to be a musician - more so than college.  He had to go in yesterday and ask whether he was entitled to the PUP.  He was told to prove that his gigs were cancelled and had to walk back out, go back to his employer, who is also a musician, and ask for a letter proving his gigs were cancelled.  It is horrendous.  It is so degrading.  I remember many years ago when I was a separated mother with two very small children and had to walk in to ask for supports.  It is degrading to walk in there.  I never went back because I was treated like dirt.  That is what is happening to musicians today who are trying to get a few bob to pay their bills.  It is shocking.  The culture relating to the arts and entertainment industry needs to change from a policy perspective.  <br/><br/>In addition to those signed off on the PUP, there are others who have been subject to PUP cuts.  Other workers were taken off the PUP and advised to seek jobseeker's allowance or PTSE.  Those same workers, who were forced off the PUP, cannot reapply for it.  Those who are in receipt of the lower rates and have no work because of the restrictions and the public health advice will not receive the higher rate.  The PUP has been the only constant source of income for workers in this sector over the past 20 months, but now even those who adhered to the rules while on the PUP feel they are being punished further.  I hear from people in the industry that the anxiety is as bad as it was when restrictions were introduced in March 2020, but the climate today is really different.  The pandemic has taken its toll emotionally, financially and mentally and people's resilience is at an all-time low.<br/><br/>The Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, which does a phenomenal job of being the voice for those who have no voice, warned in August that a reopening plan had to find a balance between employment opportunities and financial support.  The reopening plan was too optimistic and did not make provisions for the situation in which we now find ourselves.  Workers find themselves within three weeks of Christmas with no work and, in many cases, no support so it is imperative that the full rate of the PUP at &euro;350 per week is restored for all workers in the music and entertainment industry who have been affected by these latest restrictions and recent public health messaging.  We cannot continue to ask musicians and entertainers to take one for the team.  It is time to demonstrate to our musicians and entertainers that we value the contributions they make to Irish life and our culture and identity.  They deserve this respect and so much more.<br/><br/>When the T&aacute;naiste was Taoiseach, he attended a corporate event attended by a young musician with whom I worked very closely.  The then Taoiseach spoke to musicians for 20 minutes.  They could not believe that he went up to talk to them.  They could not believe that he took time out of his busy schedule to do this.  There were 200 or 300 people at that event.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He was the only one to approach them.

I share the concerns of others about the impact of the new measures on the tourism and hospitality sector.  In Wexford an estimated 9,700 people are directly employed by the sector.  Those who run businesses have made it very clear that they are very appreciative of the supports the Government has put in place to ensure that businesses are kept afloat and that people continue to be employed.  However, I have been talking to owners and managers of hotels and bars, as have my colleagues here, and they tell me that restaurant bookings, particularly group bookings, are being cancelled, that all Christmas parties and other such occasions have been cancelled and that hotel occupancy is down, partially because there is a fear on the part of consumers of travelling and attending such events.  People are rightly being cautious, but that has serious implications for those businesses.  Everyone has spoken about how they have played their part.  I encourage the T&aacute;naiste to ensure that the EWSS is restored in order to allow those businesses to survive over December, January and February.  I hope that we will start to see in the spring a recovery and that the Omicron variant will not be as serious as had been feared.</p> <p>I strongly endorse Senator Black's comments.  There has been enormous sacrifice on the part of those who are involved in the arts and entertainment sector.  I will add to her comments by referring to the impact on theatres, specifically amateur and community theatres, and the announcements that were made last Friday.  Senator Cummins and I raised this as a Commencement matter this morning.  I know that Senator Carrigy and other colleagues have also raised it.  I refer to the decision on Friday to reduce capacity to 50% in theatres.  People were given literally a couple of days' notice to plan for this change.  How can you suddenly decide, for pre-sold shows over the coming months, which 50% will get to attend the show and which 50% will not?  Theatres are faced with the financial challenge of either determining that the show will go ahead, thereby losing all the money that has to be refunded to people, or deciding to cancel the show and losing probably an even greater sum.  Theatres and venues, for the most part, and pantos and other productions cannot operate at less than 70% to 80% capacity.  Anyone here who has been to a theatre recently will know they are among the safest venues you can go to.  Your Covid certificate and ID are checked and there is sanitation everywhere.  I have had my temperature checked on occasion going into them.  It is just completely unfair.  It shows a lack of understanding on the part of the Cabinet to simply announce that on Tuesday those decisions have to be made.</p> <p>I wish to talk about the amateur and community sector.  There are also people employed there.  We are talking about professional choreographers, directors, set designers and musicians who are employed for all these productions.  There are the pre-Christmas productions, which are now in chaos and are trying to do what they can.  Equally, as we all know, particularly for panto season, people are looking into January.  People are now making financial commitments and they do not know what the situation will be.  Certainty has to be provided.  In addition, we must have support for those community organisations and sole traders working in our communities.  A lot of those community organisations will die if the current regime continues without the necessary financial supports put in place.</p> <p>Finally, during this period we have seen a technological revolution.  There has been a lot more use of digital.  It is important we learn from that and the impact it has had on business and trading.  I will make two points in that regard.  Bank of Ireland published a very interesting survey two weeks ago.  It pointed out that, year on year, the increase in online expenditure by teenagers was 184% and by those aged 18 to 25 years of age was 40%.  We know there is a lot more use of cards and so on, but there has been a dramatic shift to online expenditure.  We have to ensure that our businesses are equipped to be able to avail of that business.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The other big concern I have, and I am not convinced the Government is facing up to it sufficiently, is the area of cybercrime.

I know there is a commitment in the national development plan to increase staff in the National Cyber Security Centre from 25 to 70.  We know cybercrime is on the rise.  Coming out of the pandemic it is essential that we have a national targeted strategy to address it.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the level of spending that is estimated by the Department of Finance that will be spent by the end of 2022, which is &euro;48 billion.  This is an astounding amount but absolutely necessary to support these businesses.  We must remember of course that it is businesses, workers, entrepreneurs, corporations and everybody who has contributed to them.  We are able to borrow this from the European institutions on the basis of our good name and reputation and the work we have done to balance the books in recent years.</p> <p>As we all have, I have been approached in recent days since the announcements were made in the middle of last week, and even after the supports were announced last Friday, by hoteliers, restaurateurs and those involved in the hospitality sector in particular.  They are considerable supports through the enhanced CRSS, the very welcome waiver of commercial rates until the end of March and the Covid contingency fund.  We understand the reason behind the decision not to restore the EWSS payments to pre-November rates but there is concern.  I am sure the Government would have preferred a sectoral approach because it would have been simpler.  It would certainly be easier to explain and would provide the certainty necessary for these very important sectors.  Businesses in Galway city, Connemara and elsewhere in Galway knew where they were prior to this and they expected to have a good Christmas period.  This has been taken away from them because of the omicron variant.  The Government will be continuously reviewing these and I ask the Minister to keep it under review when examining the possibility of changes to the EWSS.</p></speech>

I have spoken to retail businesses in counties Roscommon and Galway.  They have welcomed the supports over the past year and eight months, particularly the restart grant.  It is good to hear about the commercial rates waiver for local authorities until March 2022.  Everywhere we see people looking to shop local.  There has been an investment of more than &euro;9 million in Roscommon town.  A team has been cleaning the brand-new civic square in recent weeks getting ready for Christmas.  We need to make the towns in Roscommon and Galway places to live and work with a great quality of life.  Today we have had the announcement of Ballinasloe as the first stop in the west on the Galway to Athlone, if not the Moscow to Galway, cycleway.  Ballinasloe will be up there on a global setting.  At a very basic level, this type of investment in our towns and villages means safe places to walk and cycle in towns with no parks or footpaths.  I hope many people are listening to us today.  I ask them why not consider moving west and working remotely and having a great quality of life.</p> <p>Last weekend, Grow Remote in Ballinasloe held a festive heritage walking tour of the town to showcase the region.  A local pub, An T&aacute;in, was willing to provide hotspots to customers to be grow remote friendly.  It is good to hear about the legislation on right to request remote working.  Our towns are working hard to attract people to work remotely in their areas.  I thank the Minister and we will speak again on some of these points.</p></speech>

I keep using the word time and again.  On occasions, perspective is lost in the whole debate.  The perspective is that we are performing at the most optimistic levels of where NPHET said we would be a number of weeks ago.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The perspective is that this time last year, we did not have the use of vaccines, antigen tests or boosters.  I refer to the communication strategy of the Government in recent days.  It is perfectly acceptable, and it is the intelligent and smart thing to do, to make sure that those who are in scientific positions in this country are on the same pages as the Ministers and politicians of this country and that there is no confusion.  I take this opportunity to say, from a personal point of view, that the irony was certainly not lost on me when elements of the media were criticising the Government for a mix-up in communications, when elements of the media played fastest finger first on Twitter in the past year and a half, which definitely added to the miscommunication and confusion.</p></speech>

Despite what a colleague said earlier, there has been absolutely no lack of leadership in relation to the Government.  Many difficult decisions had to be made and will continue to be made.  The emphasis from the Government and Government parties at all times has been about saving lives and livelihoods.</p> <p>I spoke to many business owners in south Kildare in the aftermath of last Friday's announcement.  While many of them absolutely appreciate the importance and intent of the measure, there is no doubt that they are incredibly disappointed, as of course we all are.  I refer, in particular, to the local county hotels that mean so much in our provincial towns, such as The Keadeen Hotel, Newbridge and Clanard Court Hotel, Athy, that are a lifeline and provide employment and tremendous services to the communities within which they serve.  This is a complete body blow to such hotels.  There is no doubt that Covid is continuing to cause a significant disruption to all our lives but we are as dependent on each other's actions and personal responsibilities now as we were in March 2020.</p> <p>I am concerned with how divisive and combative the debate and chatter around Covid has become.  The Government is doing its utmost to keep Irish people safe while trying to balance economic, social and educational liberties.  I know it is a difficult job for the Government to find that balance.  The NPHET advice does not leave much room for manoeuvring.  No politician wants to be the bearer of bad news but, unfortunately, the Government cannot control the transmission or mutation of the virus and therefore must react swiftly when a new variant, such as Omicron, comes to light.  Covid is the enemy; not those who come up with policies and regulations and who try to enforce them.  We need to do everything we can to reunite our families, friend and communities behind the implementation of public health advice, be that in terms of vaccination, social distancing or mask wearing.  The combative narratives we see and hear and the negative framing of issues are sowing the seeds of division within our society.  We do not need that and it must be tackled.  There is a responsibility on all public representatives to do that.</p> <p>Many years ago, I worked really hard with others to get a county arts centre in Kildare, based in Newbridge and we were lucky enough to have Riverbank Arts Centre established in Newbridge, which is in a central part of our town.  It has been devastating, over the past 20 months, to see the lights off and to see it closed.  Last Friday night, I was lucky to visit it to see our local amateur drama group.  It was a pleasure to see so many people enjoying being on stage and behind the scenes, in addition to many punters like me who were there to support the arts.  I know the reintroduction of restrictions is absolutely devastating for this sector.  They will need many sectoral supports to remain viable; of that I have no doubt.  Senator Black spoke eloquently about the issues and challenges faced, as did my colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne.  The arts have been severely impacted by the pandemic and they represent a fundamental section of our culture.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are proud in Ireland to be home to such a thriving and internationally acclaimed arts sector ranging from singers to dancers, actors, the orchestra and the opera.  These people are devastated to see their livelihoods dwindle away once again.  Unfortunately, we have heard ignorant comments such as "get another job" or "get a real job".  I want to be clear in the House that we appreciate their phenomenal contribution to Irish society.  We are proud that our artistes have chosen to showcase their talents within this country.  I, for one, will do everything in my power to represent the arts sector and ensure that adequate supports are made available, thus ensuring there is no brain drain from our arts and culture sector.  I speak also about the smaller youth theatres, performing arts schools and local amateur groups.</p><p>I commend my Government colleagues, including the T&aacute;naiste, for the swift action they have taken to reinstate financial supports, especially the pandemic unemployment payment.  I am glad the PUP is more targeted than it was.  I appreciate the adjustments to the Covid restrictions support scheme to support businesses whose trade is significantly impacted.  I also welcome the extension of the rates waiver.</p><p>Tomorrow is the big shopping day of 8 December.  I ask people to shop local because every &euro;10 spent locally is worth &euro;40 in one's local community.</p></speech>

Exceptional times call for exceptional measures.  There is no question that this Government and its predecessor, which the T&aacute;naiste led, have put unprecedented supports in place since the onset of this pandemic.  Schemes like the temporary wage subsidy scheme, the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Covid restrictions support scheme, rates waivers, restart grants, the pandemic unemployment payment, tailored schemes like the small business assistance scheme for Covid and the events sector Covid support scheme have been critical lifelines to businesses.  They have sustained hundreds of thousands of jobs across the State.</p><p>I want to focus on the live theatre and events sector, which some colleagues have referenced.  I note the comments made by the T&aacute;naiste in his contribution that further supports will be required in this space.  I probably sound like a broken record given that I tabled a Commencement matter to which the Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, Deputy Joe O'Brien, responded this morning and raised this matter during the Order of Business.</p><p>I am very concerned about local producers, not-for-profit organisations and community groups.  This morning I referenced the Waterford Panto Society, which has a sold out run of 26 shows at the Theatre Royal, and the producers of <i>A Christmas Carol</i>at Garter Lane Arts Centre.  These groups have bravely decided to continue with their productions even in the face of a 50% reduction in capacity.  Not only do they face a logistical nightmare of choosing which 50% of their audience get to see their shows, they face the substantial losses of &euro;47,000 and &euro;25,000, respectively, as a direct result of the capacity limit.  This situation is replicated across the country.  I am fearful that if we do not support these local community organisations now they will not exist next year to put on much-loved productions at this time of year.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to engage with his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, as I know that he has done already, in terms of supporting these sectors.  I am not for one second saying that we should not support the professional sector.  Yes, we should but we must support the local community organisations if they are to exist this time next year.</p></speech>

He said:</p> <blockquote> 	Since the outbreak of Covid-19 here in March 2020, the Government has sought to save as many lives and as many livelihoods as possible. ...  We have sought to keep workers connected to their employers and on the payroll.  We have sought to help businesses survive through a robust and sustained programme of financial support from the Government. </blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->After 18 months going through Covid, that is what this Government and the previous Government have done.  On behalf of the businesspeople in my home county of Longford, I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his leadership, the support those business have received through the past 18 months and the proposed support for the coming months.</p><p>In the past week, there have been many discussions regarding the hospitality sector, including hotels, and the new restrictions that are being proposed.  I welcome the supports that have been put in place.  On the tourism end of things, the advent of Omicron has led to cancellations by many inbound visitors who had planned to travel here in the coming months.  A significant number of schemes were in place to provide financial assistance for strategic tourism businesses such as visitor attractions, outdoor activity providers, coach operators and golf courses.  All those schemes are now closed and I ask that the Cabinet consider reactivating some of them in order to have them in place early in the new year.</p><p>I concur with the comments of Senator Cummins in respect of theatre and pantomimes.  I am involved in Longford's Traditional Panto group.  We had sold out shows but are now facing into an extremely difficult period.  We cannot access the scheme announced two weeks ago as a result of the requirement relating to a minimum operating cost of &euro;150,000.  We are in a very difficult position and are pushing ahead and adding extra shows but we will not break even if we do not receive supports.  I support the call of Senator Cummins for extra supports.</p><p>Significant supports have been made available in the context of online purchasing in the past 18 months.  As Senator O'Loughlin stated, the big purchasing days are coming.  I appeal to those buying online in the run-up to Christmas to do so from Irish businesses and to buy local.</p></speech>

I acknowledge his role, along with the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the wider Government, in trying to assist many people in business and employees in what I have described to the House on many occasions as extraordinary times, not ordinary times.</p> <p>Before I speak about the hospitality and entertainment sector, despite the difficulties we have, it is very important to acknowledge the financial assistance that has been made available.  In the course of three years, &euro;48 billion has been laid out to support various sectors.  The employment wage subsidy scheme has provided more than &euro;5.5 billion in payments to employers and employees to date and &euro;877 million has been foregone in PRSI payments.  Of course, importantly, the EWSS will remain in place until April 2022.  I acknowledge that many of us would like to tweak that scheme for businesses at the moment, but I am sure the T&aacute;naiste might have some reference to make in that regard when he is summing up.  As all present are aware, the number of employers on the EWSS has reduced, but it is now apparent that more people or businesses will probably be in need of it again. </p> <p>Payments to date under the Covid restrictions support scheme have amounted to &euro;704 million.  The business resumption support scheme has been significant.  Some 32% of registrants for the scheme were wet pubs, while 26% were other bars, restaurants, hotels or other accommodation providers.  That reflects clearly the trouble the industry is in.  More than 98,000 businesses have availed of Revenue debt warehousing.  That is an important point.  Several Members have mentioned the rates waiver.  I acknowledge the latest announcement by the Government that the rates waiver will now apply for the first three months of 2022.  It is very important and significant.</p> <p>Like Senators Black, Malcolm Byrne and many others, I have grave concerns in respect of the entertainment and hospitality sector.  The T&aacute;naiste may correct me on this but I think I have the right figure.  I looked up data on this last night.  From memory, the hospitality and entertainment sector was worth approximately &euro;5.18 billion in 2018.</p></speech>
