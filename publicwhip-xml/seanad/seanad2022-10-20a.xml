I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We all know we are facing into a tumultuous winter.  Many people are terrified of the energy bills that will land on their doormats.  Families are also concerned about the prospect of blackouts.  Unfortunately I remember when we used to have blackouts.  They were quite a regular occurrence in Ireland.  Most people are unfamiliar with blackouts and they see a functioning energy system as part of the social contract they enter into with the State.</p> <p>Another part of the social contract we take for granted is that our phones and the Internet will work.  This too, it appears, is in doubt.  The electricity outages we potentially face come with the threat of mobile phone and broadband blackouts.  Once unthinkable scenarios are now a very real prospect.  I have seen reports that 999 emergency calls could also be affected.  One of the comforts in the blackouts years ago was that we had landlines and public phones.  We knew that if anything went wrong we could still call for help or even just for comfort.  The corded landline did not need additional electricity to run.  Unfortunately those times have changed.  Even after the power comes back, we could be seeing prolonged outages of the mobile and broadband networks because the power outages increase the probability of electronic components failing if subjected to abrupt interruptions.</p> <p>How exposed are we?  What contingencies are built into our communications networks?  Throughout Europe the mobile phone mast antennae come with batteries that can last for up to 30 minutes in the event of a blackout.  Do the masts here have this facility?  How long can they survive a power outage?</p> <p>We know that in a gas supply outage, procedure dictates that some customers must be prioritised.  For example, an industry's gas supply is restrained before a hospital's gas supply and households are prioritised.  If there are electricity outages by the system operators, will they be able to isolate the mobile phone network antennae when they are cutting power to sections of the grid?  Reports from France and other EU countries are that it is not possible to isolate them and maintain power to them.</p> <p>On 7 September, the Minister announced that joint gas and electricity emergency training exercises would be held.  These involved Gas Networks Ireland, EirGrid, ESB Networks and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  Did these exercises take account of communications networks?  Did they look at scenarios where those communications networks would be knocked out?  What mitigation attempts are being put in place by the Department?  We know that telecoms companies throughout Europe are snapping up emergency generators.</p> <p>Things are very serious.  Nobody wants the lights to go out.  Certainly the Opposition and members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action have worked very hard and co-operated with the Minister.  We are concerned that we are seeing a regular pattern of rushed legislation and requests to waive pre-legislative scrutiny.  Only this week we were asked to waive pre-legislative scrutiny on a Bill that would disapply the planning system and the environmental impact assessment process with regard to emergency generators.</p> <p>We all have concerns about blackouts.  There can be knock-on and unintended consequences, one of which I am raising today with regard to communications networks and mobile phones.  What contingency plans has the Government put in place?</p></speech>

I recognise how vital telecommunications services are to citizens for so many aspects of their daily lives.  These include emergency situations during which it is imperative that individuals can contact emergency services by means of telephone and the Internet.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Government are very focused on the need to ensure that telecommunications services for the use of emergency communications are not interrupted during the very challenging time we are facing this winter with respect to the security of energy supply.  </p><p>The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the independent regulator, is responsible for the regulation of the electronic communications sector in accordance with national and EU legislation.  Regulation 16 of the Universal Service Obligation Regulations 2011 requires undertakings to ensure, to the fullest extent possible, the availability of fixed voice in the event of catastrophic network breakdown or unforeseen circumstances.  Voice providers must also take necessary measures to ensure uninterrupted access to emergency services.  </p><p>In addition, operators of public communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services are obliged under the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Framework) Regulations 2011 to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks and services.  In particular, these regulations stipulate that measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents on users and interconnected networks.  Specifically, the regulation states the following information: "Pursuant to 16(2) of the Universal Service Regulations 2011, (2) "An undertaking providing a publicly available telephone service shall take all necessary measures to ensure uninterrupted access to emergency services"."  </p><p>While oversight of all of these obligations is a matter for ComReg which is statutorily independent in the operation of its functions, I understand from officials in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications that ComReg first engaged with operators of public communications networks and publicly available electronic communications services in October 2021 as a consequence of the risk of possible power outages last winter.  The purpose of this engagement was to ensure that operators were factoring into their risk assessments the increased risk of power outages across the national grid.  </p><p>Further to this, in June of this year ComReg facilitated an information session between the power industry and operators.  The purpose of this information session was to update the operators on the current level of risk in respect of electricity supply and to inform operators of the expected impact to electricity supply if such a risk was to materialise.  </p><p>ComReg continues to engage with operators regularly, particularly in light of the European energy crisis.  From this engagement, ComReg understands that operators have and continue to factor in the risk of power outages into their business continuity plans and risk management protocols.  The emergency call answering service, ECAS, is responsible for answering all 112 and 999 calls and texts, providing a vital link between the caller and the emergency services, namely Garda, fire, ambulance, the Coast Guard or, in cases involving aircraft, air traffic control.  </p><p>ECAS is a stage 1 public safety answering point.  Its role is to establish the emergency service being requested by a caller and the location of the caller or incident for the purpose of routing the call to the most appropriate emergency services centre, which will then take responsibility for the call and the decision in terms of the appropriate response to the call.  ECAS is currently delivered from centres in Navan and Ballyshannon which take emergency calls from anywhere in the State.  I am pleased to confirm that ECAS has on-site diesel generators in its call centres in Ballyshannon and Navan for use in case of a power outage, which will ensure that individuals who have the ability to make a call will get through to the service.  These generators are tested on a monthly basis so as to ensure that there will be no interruption to ECAS services.</p></speech>

It is reassuring to hear there are back-up generators for ECAS.  The concern is that those who need to get in touch with ECAS will be able to do so because most people now use mobile phones or online services.  The response did not address my specific questions on battery storage or the isolation of antennae on the grid.  I will contact ComReg, and revert to the Minister of State if I do not get answers.  It is of serious concern that people could be left stranded in the case of blackouts.</p></speech>

It provides a single overarching initial response to address Ireland's energy security needs in the context of the war in Ukraine and sets out the Government's action in response to these issues across key themes, which includes ensuring security of energy supply in the near term.</p> <p>The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has set up an energy security emergency group, chaired by the Department's Secretary General, under the national energy security framework.  This group ensures that emergency plans are in place, and are stress-tested and up to date.  Emergency training exercises have been ongoing over many years as part of regular and ongoing contingency planning.</p> <p>Gas Networks Ireland and EirGrid, the latter working in conjunction with ESB Networks, have robust procedures in place with regard to managing any shortfall in gas and electricity supplies.  They regularly participate in simulation exercises to stress test the systems and procedures for emergencies to ensure that Government, State agencies and industry are prepared to effectively manage a range of potential scenarios.  </p> <p>The Commission for the Regulation of Utilities oversees the overarching emergency plans and works in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  ComReg can follow up on this issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-20a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102000002#B00500"><p>The Minister of State has been landed with duties which are not the responsibility of his Department.  The Ministers are busy people.</p> <p>Can the Minister of State please explain to me, in light of the huge uptake of free transport, which is a great thing in theory, what the Department of Education is doing about school transport in order to increase the number of available bus drivers?  My parish lost a bus that has run for 50 years, a bus I took to school.  Last Tuesday, over 37 families were left on the side of the road and have been left on the side of the road ever since.  Nothing has happened to resolve the situation.  </p> <p>I spent the weekend trying to get a bus driver.  I thought if I could find one, he or she could drive a bus, but that does not seem to have worked out yet.  I spoke to the Bus &Eacute;ireann school transport bus inspector for our region and gave her the mobile number of the driver I had contacted.  I spoke to the contractors and gave them the number of the driver, but nothing has happened.  There are a few issues.</p> <p>While it is great to offer free school transport, it has led to chaotic situations whereby the children of people who have always paid for school transport are not getting bus tickets, while others who never paid for bus transport have received them.  That is a good thing, but for people who have always paid for school transport to lose places on school buses is devastating.  People have built such arrangements into their routines.  </p> <p>As parents, we all know that in rural areas the only chance of children getting to school is through school transport.  There is no public bus service or Luas as there is in Dublin.  Many families' plans and days revolve around children getting on a bus to go to school.  This does not just affect people in Clare; parents have taken to the streets about this in other areas.  </p> <p>Did the Department think about this?  If the number of buses and bus drivers available are not increased, yet the numbers availing of the service increased from 110,000 to 180,000 pupils overnight, of course there will be chaos.  It is also unfair for children who always had a bus ticket to not get one this year.  I am sure the Department did not set out to create this mess, but we are in a mess and it is taking a toll on all families and students.  </p> <p>In the case of the Inagh to Ennis bus route, the bus driver did not turn up.  Parents were told he was ill and were not told when he would return.  It turned out that he was moved to another area to fill a gap created by a driver who got sick.  One route was prioritised over another.  A group of 52 children were abandoned for the sake of another group because somebody got sick.  I do not know whether the school transport section is paying contractors to treat students like that.  </p> <p>I do not know where the buck stops, but I want to highlight the fact that contractors have not been reliable in this instance.  There was nothing wrong with the driver on the route; he was simply moved to another route.  The students were shocked when they met him at school and he said he was sorry he had to leave them and felt bad but he was moved somewhere else.  </p> <p>It is ironic because I have asked for free school transport for years, but when it finally arrived it does not seem to be working.  Perhaps Bus &Eacute;ireann did not expect the uptake.  Perhaps a lot of people applied for bus tickets which they are not using.  We may need to examine whether parents applied for tickets because they were free and ask them if they need a bus ticket and allow somebody else to take the space instead.  There are many facets to this.  We cannot offer free school transport and not invest in more bus drivers and buses.  What is the Department doing to increase the number of bus drivers?  I understand it takes three months to become a bus driver and get a licence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Is the Department doing anything about that?  Is it running training courses?  If it is I would love to know about them because this is not just an Inagh to Ennis issue, this is happening all over Ireland.  I would love to know what the Department is doing about it and what it is doing about sorting out this one particular route, from Inagh to Ennis for the pupils who have relied on this service for more than 50 years until last Tuesday.  It is now nine days later and we still have no resolution.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-20a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102000002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Garvey for her important Commencement matter.  There is no doubt but that this issue has caused huge distress to families throughout the country.  Before I address the specific issue on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Foley, I would like to provide an outline of the extent of the school transport service.  The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.  In the last school year, more than 121,400 children including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  The cost of the scheme in 2021 was &euro;289 million.  The school transport scheme is an important service for families and children.  The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p> <p>In July 2022 the Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the 2022-23 school year as part of a wider package of cost-of-living measures.  School transport ticket registration for the 2022-23 school year closed on 29 July, by which time almost 130,000 applications and registrations were received for mainstream school transport.  This figure included 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.  Already more than 126,000 tickets have issued for the 2022-23 school year.  At the start of the last school year, circa 103,600 children were carried on mainstream school transport services, in the region of 22,400 additional places already have been created.</p> <p>The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets are allocated in line with the criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible when they live no less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest primary school.  At post-primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school education centre are deemed eligible.  Any pupils or students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible or otherwise known as concessionary applicants and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022-23 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  </p> <p>Following discussions between the Minister, Deputy Foley, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and officials in his Department as part of the budgetary process, some additional funding has now been approved for the scheme.  This will allow officials in the Department of Education, in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann, to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available.  The initial focus will be on families who applied on time and who previously held concessionary tickets to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.  However it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.  Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a longer number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity.  The specific issues mentioned by Senator Garvey related to a case where the driver of a route is unfortunately currently unable to work on the route.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is currently working to source a driver at present and hopes to have a replacement as an interim measure shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-20a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102000002#C00300"><p>I appreciate that response from the Minister of State but there is nothing in it that I did not know already.  I have been working on school transport with kids through Green-Schools and modal shift for about 14 years.  I have all the figures and I know the rules about 3.2 km and 4.8 km.  To be honest, the reply does not deal with the issue at all.  I asked a specific question, namely, has the Department done anything about increasing the number of bus drivers.  If not, it will not be able to get this bus service that it wants.  It is great the Department has the money for it.  It is great that it is free but it has caused absolute chaos.  Unless the Department actually focuses on increasing the number of bus drivers, it is not going to be resolved.  That was the simple question I asked.</p> <p>Also when the Minister of State's script says &ldquo;The specific issues mentioned by Senator Garvey related to a case where the driver of a route is unfortunately currently unable to work on the route.&rdquo;  That is not because he was sick or anything.  That is because he was moved to another route because the guy on another route fell ill.  How did the contractor decide that the students in one area were more important than those in another area?  That is the bigger question that I want to highlight with Bus &Eacute;ireann because they are paying these contractors.  These contractors have to be reliable and have some sense of honour towards the pupils they have been driving.  In regard to the last line, &ldquo;Bus &Eacute;ireann is currently working to source a driver at present&rdquo;, I do not know if it is.  I rang the inspector and told her I have a bus driver.  She said &ldquo;Oh that is brilliant, because we do not have any&rdquo;.  I do not think Bus &Eacute;ireann was actually looking for one but it was leaving it to the contractor to find a bus driver as the contractor is the one getting paid.  I do not know what is happening now.  I found a bus driver.  I gave the details to the contractor.  None of my questions have been answered and I do not think it is the Minister&rsquo;s fault.  There are people who are getting paid a good deal of money to deal with the school transport situation.  They have not dealt with it properly.  As for the concessionary tickets being given, that is also not true.  The ones who got tickets before did not necessarily get it now.  None of my questions have really been answered.  </p></speech>

It is her responsibility obviously to ensure that school transport is running effectively as it has done in previous years.  I will refer the matter back to the Minister and have her respond to the points that Senator Garvey has genuinely raised in that regard and I fully accept that.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will be aware that after the budget, a &euro;100 million health sector winter fund was announced to deal with various emergency costs.  This would be particularly targeted at section 39 providers to meet some of their costs.  The Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbitte, Butler and Feighan have identified some of the organisations that could benefit from this.  We know about them all around the country, including, in my own area, St. Aidan's Services in Gorey.  Some of it is about addressing capacity issues but some of it is designed to meet the cost-of-living crisis we all face.  Some of it is to deal with the rising energy costs.</p> <p>The challenge is that the &euro;100 million has been announced but we do not have any detail of it yet.  It is meant to be a winter fund.  I am not quite sure when winter is regarded as starting but from the drips in the Chamber here and in the other Chamber yesterday, and from what I experienced on the way home to Wexford last night, we are certainly not in the middle of summer or spring.  It is important that we get clarity on that &euro;100 million in regard to how its allocation is going to be determined, how section 39 organisations will be able to apply or will receive some of the funding and where it will go.  Is it going to be for addressing capacity issues?  Will it be around addressing the ongoing increased costs that everybody is facing?  Will it be towards energy costs?  What about the case of the staff?  This has been an issue for a number of section 39 and other organisations, namely, addressing some of the salary concerns.  Workers within the section 39 system often do the same work as their equivalents within the HSE but are paid less.  Will some of the funding be directed towards that?  At this stage it is important that we get clarity particularly for those section 39 organisations.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State would provide us with more detail.</p></speech>

I would like to say that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was delighted to secure the &euro;100 million additional funding this year.  It will provide a one-off non-pay inflation support payment to community-based voluntary organisations.  These organisations are funded through the HSE to deliver a range of health and social care services on behalf of the HSE to communities throughout the country.  This includes residential, day and ancillary services for people with a disability, older people, mental health services, palliative care services, addiction services and other health and social care services provided in the community.  The Minister is very aware that many of these organisations are experiencing significant inflationary pressures as a result of increasing energy, heating and related costs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This fund is being made available in recognition of the challenges being faced by the sector in delivering and maintaining these key health and social care services.  I hope it will provide the much-needed support to assist them in maintaining these important services.</p><p>Officials in the Department of Health are currently working on finalising a plan that will ensure the fund is allocated in a fair and transparent manner.  It is proposed that the fund will be administered by the HSE, utilising the mechanism in place for funding eligible organisations in receipt of service level and grant aid agreements.  As these arrangements are already in place with organisations, this will ensure that payments are processed and disseminated in a speedy and timely fashion.  It is the Minister for Health's intention that payments will be made as soon as possible within the next month and that all payments will be made by the year end.  Once the aforementioned plan has been finalised, the Minister will set out in detail the scope and mechanisms around the payments to these organisations, subject to the approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Department of Health officials will continue to engage directly with their colleagues in the HSE to ensure that these payments are made as soon as possible.  </p><p>Funding will be allocated through the established mechanism of the temporary assistance payment scheme to providers of long-term residential care who participate in the nursing home support scheme.  This will ensure that payments can be made quickly and I have no doubt that this will be very much welcomed by the sector.  I again thank the Senator for raising this matter.</p></speech>

I welcome the announcement of this funding but unfortunately, I do not share the Minister of State's confidence that the HSE will be able to allocate it as quickly as possible, particularly as many working in the sector are still waiting for their &euro;1,000 Covid-related bonus payment to which they are entitled.  I would be grateful for further guarantees in this regard.  I accept it is the Minister's intention that the payments be made quickly but I seek further guarantees that all of these payments will be made within the next month.  Can the Department say to all of the organisations that do wonderful work in all of our communities that by the end of November they will have received some of these payments?  There are already mechanisms in place for working out how funding is allocated to these organisations so it cannot be too difficult to draw up a plan, particularly given the costs.  The Minister of State has indicated that payments will be made by the end of November but I am looking for an assurance that this will happen.</p></speech>

There are so many valuable community organisations that rely on departmental funding.  Obviously, it would be foolish of me to give a commitment regarding an area for which I have no responsibility, but I will raise the issue with the Minister for Health.  As the departmental reply indicates, the Minister expects this to be done within the next month and guarantees that it will be done by the end of the year.  Those are his words, not mine.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the really significant issue of podiatry care in west Cork and will begin by providing some background information.  There are more than 300 people in west Cork on a waiting list that is going nowhere.  The majority of the people on the list are elderly.  Many suffer with arthritis and diabetes and they need podiatry care.  Last March, 15 out of 25 whole-time equivalent posts were vacant and because of that, people are waiting over a year to access podiatry care.  It is bizarre that elderly and vulnerable people are waiting for nearly a year to access this service.  I am concerned about the provision of podiatry services in the short term.  In the longer-term, we have been told that a recruitment campaign is ongoing.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the position with regard to that campaign over the last six months.  Six months ago there were 15 vacancies.  Have we made progress in filling those posts?  What are the short-term care options for the 300 people who are so badly affected by this issue?  At the moment, the service is firefighting in its efforts to ensure that people can see a podiatrist.</p> <p>The way in which the service is organised is also a matter of concern.  I have been contacted by people who are travelling from Clonakilty to Bantry and from Skibbereen to Clonakilty to access podiatry services.  Where is the joined-up thinking here?  We need to make sure that where there are podiatrists in a town, they are not travelling 30 or 40 miles to another town for an appointment.  People have contacted me who would have had three or four podiatry appointments per year previously but now they are only getting one appointment every 18 months.  This is a really significant issue.  I realise that a recruitment campaign is ongoing but 15 vacancies out of a total of 25 posts is a really significant number and the knock-on impacts are enormous.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to provide an update on the filling of the aforementioned vacancies.  What is the short-term plan?  We know the long-term plan is to fill the vacancies but we need to see some movement here.  The 300 people in west Cork that I am dealing with need to see this service up and running.</p></speech>

The Minister for Health is aware that the recruitment and retention of staff across CHO 4 has been very challenging in recent months as considerable organisational and operational changes have been implemented.  Indeed, as part of the enhanced community care programme, there are several vacancies across Cork and Kerry, including in west Cork.  Cork Kerry Community Healthcare continues to run recruitment campaigns at local, national and international level to fill these vacancies and has assured the Minister that a robust communication campaign is being utilised to attract eligible candidates.</p> <p>As an interim measure, a senior podiatrist from the Clonakilty primary care centre is providing podiatry care for those at greatest risk in west Cork, or network 10.  Eligible patients continue to be seen and are being provided with ongoing care from this location.  Those who are most urgent on the waiting list are being seen first.  When all of the active, in remission and high-risk patients are seen and when space in the schedule becomes available, moderate-risk patients will be offered scheduled appointments.  Currently, a total of 46 people are on the waiting list in west Cork.  Cork Kerry Community Healthcare reports that there is only one child aged between 5 and 17 on the waiting list and although this patient has been waiting over 12 weeks to be seen, he or she is in a lower-risk category than other patients.  Of those patients aged between 18 and 64, four have been waiting less than 12 weeks, two have been waiting less than 26 weeks and three have been waiting over a year.  For those patients aged over 65 years, six have been waiting less than 12 weeks, nine have been waiting less than 26 weeks, four have been waiting less than 39 weeks and three have been waiting less than 52 weeks.  However, there are 14 patients aged over 65 who have been waiting for longer than a year to be seen.  Cork Kerry Community Healthcare has assured the Minister that priority is being given to those patients most at risk and that the majority of patients waiting to be seen are in the lower-risk categories.  The Minister has, however, asked Cork Kerry Community Healthcare to accelerate the process whereby those waiting for more than a year can be seen.</p> <p>The senior podiatrist from the Clonakilty primary care centre who is providing interim cover is also proactively providing training to other members of the multidisciplinary teams within the network, including two GPs, public health nurses and practice nurses.  The senior podiatrist will also continue to provide services to west Cork in the short term.  She has also agreed to travel to Bantry primary care centre to start a podiatry service there.  Cork Kerry Community Healthcare has advised that it is forging strong links to ensure that this service will be well established when the new staff members are in post.</p></speech>

The key issue is the number of vacancies.  Six months ago, according to the figures I received, 15 out of 25 whole time equivalent posts were vacant in the Cork, Kerry region.  I seek an update on the recruitment campaign.  Perhaps the Minister of State does not have up-to-date figures.  I ask that the Department provide such figures to me in the next few hours.  How is the recruitment campaign going and how many of those 15 vacancies have been filled since last March?  The long-term goal is to fill those vacancies.  I acknowledge there is an issue with trying to attract people but we must find staff to fill these vacancies.  Otherwise, the problem of long waiting lists will just continue.</p></speech>

I will begin by welcoming the announcement by the Central Bank that it will change its mortgage lending rules for the first time to relax the restrictions on how much money people can borrow in order to finance a house purchase.  We must all be conscious of not burdening people with too much debt but we accept that we need to loosen up some more money for people who are desperately trying to buy houses at present.  As the Leader knows, from January 2023 first-time buyers will be able to borrow up to four times their salaries for a mortgage.  It was about three and a half times.  It should be noted that the Central Bank stated that separated or divorced people may now be considered first-time buyers as part of a fresh start policy - this is has been an issue for politicians up and down the country - as long as they no longer have an interest in their former properties.  I welcome that as well.  This proposal will bring new life to the construction industry, especially in regard to those badly needed and absolutely necessary houses.  A number of major construction companies intend to up the ante of their building programmes from January 2023, which is good news.  With the pandemic and the situation in Ukraine, businesses, particularly those in construction, have had difficulty getting off the ground properly.  I welcome that news and hope it will be of benefit to the many people who are currently trying to get on the property ladder.</p> <p>We should also acknowledge, as I am sure the Leader will, the amazing performance of the Irish ladies' boxing team in the European championships.  At this stage it has seven bronze medals, which has never been done before by any boxing team - male or female.  Some of those medals will hopefully turn silver and gold.  It is an extraordinary feat by any country, especially a little island like Ireland, that we have people like Aoife O'Rourke from my county of Roscommon, Kellie Harrington, Caitlin Fryers, Amy Broadhurst, Christina Desmond, Michaela Walsh and Shannon Sweeney.  They have all brought glory to Ireland in this championship and it is not over yet.  It is fantastic and I am sure all Members, including the Leader and the Cathaoirleach, will join me in congratulating them in a major way.</p> <p>Finally I will address an issue that has been ongoing for some time.  I ask that every avenue be explored to ensure the &euro;1,000 payment to people, particularly those who worked in nursing homes during the pandemic, is paid without further delay.  I accept that issues have arisen that probably no one foresaw, but it is extraordinary that 46,000 people who worked in nursing homes are still waiting for the payment.  It is everyone's wish that we get the payment over the line as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The Home and Community Care Ireland annual conference today will hear that six in ten people are concerned about how they will be cared for in old age.  It is a worrying and startling figure.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is doing a tremendously good job and has gained a welcome increase in the budget as regards the amount of money available, but Nursing Homes Ireland has told us that 16 nursing homes have closed in the past year, with 450 beds lost.  It is a complete failure of the system if 450 beds are lost or 16 nursing homes are closed.  I would like to have a debate with the Minister of State about the matter because a society is judged by how we look after our elderly at their time of most particular need.  I know we want to keep people at home as long as possible and that is the overarching philosophy and principal of Government policy but it requires community intervention and a radical change of policy in how we look after people.  We have made changes to the fair deal scheme and that is welcome but we should be looking at and doing other things as well.</p> <p>I also ask that we invite the Minister for the Environment, Climate Action and Communications to the House to discuss the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, report that revealed that only 51% of Ireland's sewage is treated to EU standards to protect the environment.  The European average, according to the EPA, is 90% and if we are to have a discussion about the European Union water framework, it is important we have that debate with the Minister as a matter of urgency.  It is worrying to see this.  When Noel Dempsey was the Minister a big sewerage treatment plant was built in Dublin, which was meant to be the pathway and panacea for everything, and suddenly today we see that only 51% is treated.  It is important to hold those debates as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on the visit of the President of Portugal yesterday.  It was great to have him in the Chamber.  It illustrates the importance of this House and I commend the Cathaoirleach on that.</p></speech>

"Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine is forcing Ireland to rethink its long tradition of military neutrality."  This is not the conjecture of some online theorist, or the fear-mongering of a political radical, but it is a quote from our Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  Speaking last week he said that public opinion may not be ready but he thought that a citizens&rsquo; assembly might take a look at the question with a view to amending the national stance of non-membership of military alliances.  This is shocking stuff.  Ireland&rsquo;s military neutrality has its origins in the birth of the State, making it as time-honoured a fixture of our international identity as is possible.  That would be a drift towards its erasure, or for it to be steered behind the cover of a foreign conflict is unconscionable.</p> <p>The vast majority of Irish people correctly hold our neutrality in high esteem and I for one do not want to sit and watch that being cynically undermined by concerted efforts in the service of supernational interests.  Some proponents of a more hands-on approach to war may feel as if our neutrality has us sitting on the sidelines when we could be helping.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The sustained neutrality of countries such as Ireland allow us to be highly trusted brokers of peace on the international stage and to lead by example in that regard.</p> <p>In other news, the intense public scrutiny of the European Commission&rsquo;s deal to purchase up to 1.8 billion Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine doses is now being matched by official scrutiny.  The European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO, has confirmed that it has an ongoing investigation into the acquisition of Covid-19 vaccines in the EU.  The European Court of Auditors has already found that a joint negotiation team was not involved in striking the Pfizer vaccine deal, in direct violation of a previously agreed protocol.  Allegations have been levelled at Pfizer&rsquo;s CEO negotiating the contract through text messages with the Commission&rsquo;s President, where this will see his product dominate the EU&rsquo;s vaccine portfolio until the end of 2023.  These texts have since been deleted.  He must have studied the Irish school of diplomatic politics.</p> <p>The European Court of Auditors established that Dr. von der Leyen had intervened in early talks with Pfizer and had sidelined the usual negotiating teams to personally hash out a preliminary deal.  Further information was sought from the Commission on this but, however, none was forthcoming.  We are not expected to hear anything more until the investigators themselves offer more clarity on the matter, or journalists do it for them.  Some millions of eyes are now on the European Commission and I am sure that we are all looking forward to what will be seen.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I asked a very clear question of the Minister for Education around school transport and to ask what will the school transport section of the Department of Education do to rectify the situation with school transport issues and, in particular, the route from Inagh to Ennis.  The answer I received was appalling.  It was completely pointless, a waste of time and told me everything we already know about the increase in numbers.  It is not just the Inagh route, which has been running for 50 years, but many schools have been affected by this.  Perhaps this is because it is a rural issue and that the people working in the school transport section of the Department are in cities, where they have great transport options, but 57 children were left at the side of the road last Tuesday and, nine days later, nothing has happened.</p> <p>I asked a very clear question as to what the Department was going to do.  The Commencement matter was accepted by the Cathaoirleach, a Minister of State who did not have anything to do with the Minister for Education came into the Chamber, which I suppose is the way these things are, but the reply was condescending, patronising and absolutely useless.  Not only was it disappointing to me, I felt deeply disappointed by it and I question the whole idea of Commencement matters, but this was also the case for the parents and the students.  How disappointed they must feel with this completely useless response.</p> <p>It is great that we have free school transport but it seems that the Department has done nothing about increasing the quantity of qualified bus drivers or the number of school buses that are available.  Now we have a case where there are thousands of students and their parents all over Ireland in absolute chaos about how to get to school.  Many of these children live 16 km to 17 km from school.  Their parents are at work and cannot drive them there or afford to drive them because of the cost of petrol.  This is a very serious issue which affects thousands of pupils.</p> <p>I understand how this was such a great idea, because there was significant demand, but did the Department not know there was going to be a big demand?  This was a very clear question and I ask the Cathaoirleach to perhaps go back to all of the Ministers to explain to them the concept of Commencement matters where, if Members are asking a question, they want an answer to that question and not a three-page spiel about something that is not answering the question at all.  Otherwise, as Senators, we are wasting our time coming in here for Commencement matters.</p></speech>

One is related to the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin city.  What a shame and a disgrace it is.  This is not about laying the blame on anybody.  I circulated a small memo this morning to all Dublin city councillors of all political parties.  Within ten minutes I received seven or eight responses at least.  In two or three cases they said that we did not need another task force for Dublin city; we need resources, responsibility and accountability.</p> <p>Clearly, in Dublin City Council, it is in the interest of its executive and elected members to run a good city but it is the capital of the country and a city.  To see the deprivation, the vandalism, the violence, and the taking of drugs openly on the street, is a shame.  Although alarmed as I am, I am around long enough, as are we all, and we understand the social as well as the economic consequences in our city and we have to recognise that there are underlying issues.  We are talking about people, circumstance, disadvantage and a whole range of issues.  This is a holistic approach.  Yes, it is about rebuilding and maintaining the fabric of our city but it is also about addressing why so many vulnerable people are on the edges, hanging around at night.  Have they no place to go?  There is a social dimension here, which is important.  It is too easy to be critical and to say that it needs to be cleaned up.  It needs to be cleaned up but the underlying issue is around the social issues of disadvantage, why people are there, and congregating there.  I would like to feed into that issue.  </p> <p>It is important.  We have asked before and we need a comprehensive debate about local government, on which I believe we are all agreed.  Matched with that is local government funding.  At a time when the citizens&rsquo; assembly is now doing its final report which will come before the Oireachtas, where we are talking about a mayor for Dublin, we need to look at the bigger issue of governance for everywhere, but particularly in Dublin city on this issue.  A multifaceted approach and response is needed.  Perhaps at some time we could have a debate, in particular on Dublin, but about local government generally as well.</p> <p>Finally, I renew my call for a debate on agriculture at some time in the future in the Seanad.  I thank the Cathaoirleach.</p></speech>

I, for one, am all in favour of the modal shift and of getting people out of their cars, on to public transport, using pedestrianisation and cycling, when possible but we know that the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre is steeped in corruption in respect of where it was located.  It was supposed to be-----</p></speech>

Staff in Liffey Valley Shopping Centre have suddenly been informed that they must now park in an overflow car park at a cost of &euro;2.50 a day.  Not only that, but the public can also park in that same overflow car park, which creates capacity issues causing great stress to the workers.  In addition, there are only 550 car parking spaces for over 2,000 members of staff.  The car parking could cost staff up to &euro;600 per year and these changes are to come into operation on Monday.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To put it in perspective, &euro;600 per year will wipe out the energy credit the workers are due to get.  It is effectively a pay cut for the staff in Liffey Valley.  Senators may have seen that the workers were out protesting at the weekend.  I express my solidarity with each and every one of them.  This seems an outrageously costly change for staff.  The reason given by management for the change was a decision to shift towards more sustainable modes of transport, but that just does not add up.  The infrastructure is not there.  It is coming but the location of the shopping centre is problematic for people trying to get to it.  As we face cost-of-living increases, the workers are now going to be charged just to go to work.  The management of Liffey Valley needs to review the change and continue to talk to staff, unions and tenants because staff at the centre should not be out of pocket because of these changes.</p><p>I have seen some commentary whereby  people have stated that it is only &euro;2.50, but that is still &euro;2.50 out of your pay cheque just to get to work.  Also, most of the workers are not able to get into that overflow car park.  One worker was saying that the car park is full from morning-time, and workers may be on late shifts.  Parking then costs &euro;12.50 per day.  Thus it will cost workers &euro;12.50 per day to go to work.  I reiterate my solidarity with the Liffey Valley workers.  As I said, I am all in favour of a modal shift but you cannot just bring in something overnight when workers do not have an alternative, especially those who work late.</p></speech>

I would like to comment on Senator Garvey's contribution.  I was there this morning.  The response read out by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, was a disgrace.  It was a very appropriate question.  As that question has been asked on school transportation and given the way the rules of the Seanad work, it will be six months before we can go back into that circle.  We got a bluff of an answer.  We have kids who want to get a school bus and we have a Minister of State who did not answer the question.  We are going to have to find another way to deal with this because what happened here, when you look at the blacks, was frightening.  The Department did not look at the question, did not deal with it and now it has blanked off the situation for the next six months.  I am not putting the Cathaoirleach on the spot but it is his responsibility to ensure that we get fair play.  We were wronged this morning.  Schoolchildren all over Ireland were wronged.  I had parents watching the response.  The phones lit up like Christmas because of what happened here.  We need to have a fair process in place so we can get a decent response to questions.</p> <p>What happened here was just unbelievable.  I have been here since 2016 and have never heard a response like it.  Senator Garvey can write in but the Cathaoirleach has a responsibility to protect us from what happened here.  I cannot happen again.  The school transport issue has not gone away.  There are kids in west Cork today who do not have a school bus and they have no ability to get tickets at the moment because we cannot get a response.</p></speech>

Do we need to go suspending Standing Orders?  Do we need to put down motions?  I am not sure where to go next, but the kids of west Cork deserve better, the kids of Ireland deserve better and to be perfectly honest this House deserves better than what we got this morning.  I put it to the Cathaoirleach that he needs to intervene directly with the senior Minister and come back to us next week, because we cannot have this.  If we do, there is no point in putting down Commencement matters.</p></speech>

I went out for a run this morning, tripped, fell on my face - I am fine, though it is not obvious - and ended up in the Mater Hospital.  I give huge thanks to all the staff in the Mater's emergency department.  They are just tremendous given what they deal with and we are very lucky to have them and everybody who works in our health service.</p> <p>I also wish to address the commentary that has been going on all week about O'Connell Street.  It is our country's main street and our capital's main street.  It is a street I walk on almost every day.  I would take offence at and be insulted by the commentary if it was not so ignorant and ill-informed.  That O'Connell Street has its problems is indisputable - and there is scope for improvement - but I do not accept the narrow characterisation of it that has been articulated by others.  I am not going to repeat the ill-informed and wholly inappropriate language that was used.  I invite the Deputy who spoke in the D&aacute;il to come to O'Connell Street with me, spend a day and walk around.  I also invite the Minister, who has put such a high level of dependency and people in need of additional services concentrated in this one tiny area.</p> <p>A big part of the dereliction element of O'Connell Street is the Moore Street site that runs from Henry Street all the way up to Parnell Street on the western side of O'Connell Street.  The State owns Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street.  I am hoarse from raising this matter in the House, as the Cathaoirleach knows.  I have tabled multiple Commencement matters on it.  Just before the summer break, I tabled one and got a commitment from the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, OPW, that works would commence on the national monument within weeks.  In fact, I was told it would be in three to four weeks.  The OPW is yet to commence those works.  It is October and will soon be November.  I would appreciate it if the Leader asked the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW to give us a date for commencement of works on a commemorative centre at the national monument.  She might also ask the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs and the Minister for Justice to engage with the city council and local garda&iacute; to address the issues that exist.  O'Connell Street is about more than those issues.  It is our main thoroughfare, there is beautiful architecture on it and we must all champion it and work with stakeholders to bring it up to its former glory.</p></speech>

It has been going on and on and there are many workers in Shannon Heritage who are very uncertain of what their future holds.  There should be some way of having a debate or even statements on the future of Shannon Heritage because of its importance to the tourism offering in County Clare.  There is major potential for growth.  All that is required is the financial commitment from Government to upgrade the sites.  It would complement the Cliffs of Moher visitor experience greatly if we had upgraded Bunratty and Craggaunowen visitor experiences.  This issue has been going on and on but we are coming towards the end of the year now.  Marketing plans and budgets are being put in place for 2023 yet Clare County Council does not know whether it is coming or going with respect to what it is to do or what its role will be with Shannon Heritage.</p> <p>We should also have a debate on flooding with the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy O'Donovan.  A great deal of money has been spent on flood relief schemes and coastal protection in County Clare.  In Lahinch alone, something like &euro;12 million has been spent over the past few years on coastal protection.  Money has been spent in Ennis.  South-east Clare has always been a challenge but there are many other parts of the country that are worried, having seen the inclement weather of the last week or so.  It is an important issue we need to be regularly updated on.  We need to know what the plans are for the next few years.  It would be a debate many Members would find interesting.  The people who watch us, especially those who live in areas where there is the constant threat of flooding, would be very interested in an update from the Minister of State.</p></speech>

Senator Conway wants two debates.  One is specific to a small number of Members but it is extremely important because all the Members from his area have raised on numerous occasions the funding for the transfer of the heritage sites to the county council.  Clearly, there is no response that is satisfactory to the Members, so I will see if I can organise statements for 60 minutes on it.  The Senator is also looking for a debate on flooding.  I will talk to the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW and see if we can get him to come back.</p> <p>God bless Senator Fitzpatrick; I wish her a speedy recovery because she looks like she did a serious amount of damage to her face on her run this morning.  She commended the staff in the Mater Hospital who looked after her.  She is also looking for a response from the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW on the matter of works on Moore Street that have been due for commencement for a long time now.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senators Lombard and Garvey both raised the response on school transport received earlier from the Minister of State.  I did not have the chance to read it.  Following the Order of Business, I will look at the response.  More important, I will write to the Chair of the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight, who is the Cathaoirleach, to discuss the matter.  To be honest, that does not get us the answers we need.  While discussions took place earlier, I contacted my office.  I am scheduling statements on school transport for 60 minutes next week.  The schedule Senators have received will have to be amended and I will add 60 minutes to it.  I have been told the Minister is not available, but somebody needs to be available to discuss this on behalf of the hundreds, if not thousands, of children who do not have school transport.  It is coming up to the end of October.  We need answers, and we need them now.  On the basis of that, we can go down the route of complaining to the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight and change Standing Orders.  Alternatively,we can go down the route of giving the Minister an opportunity to send someone to speak on her behalf, if she cannot come to the House, and provide substantive and qualitative answers next week as to when children in the communities we represent who do not have school bus transport will receive it.  I will arrange that for next week and send Senators a copy of the letter.</p><p>Senator Boylan stood in solidarity with the workers of Liffey Valley.  It is the most ham-fisted attempt to try to get people onto bikes and buses that I have ever seen in my life.  I support the Senator in raising the issue today.  I am not sure if there is anything we can do.  If the House thinks there is anything we can do collectively as a body, Senators can speak to me afterwards and we can certainly do it.  It has made a hames of something that should have been good, had some thought and planning been put into it.</p><p>Senator Boyhan asked for a debate on local government funding and governance.  In fairness, he has asked for that debate a number of times and the request has gone in.  I will remind the Minister of it once again.  Equally as important, he asked for a debate on agriculture, which I will organise in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>Senator Keogan spoke about statements made, one assumes, on behalf of Irish citizens by one of our Ministers of State.  I do not believe they represent the views of the vast majority.  I am all for transparency in conversations and having open discussions, but we should not make assumptions about what Irish people think.  The assumption one might make is far more in line with the views of people.  On the same note, I am glad that Ursula von der Leyen made decisions, albeit that they were not as transparent as they could have been, a couple of years ago when the European Union was fighting for vaccines for its citizens.  Obviously, those discussions and transparency will come into play once the investigation is finished.</p><p>Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on nursing home closures, in particular in respect of the care of older people in the future.  More people are getting older today than was the case in generations gone by.  It is a timely debate that is needed.  The Minister is not available at the moment, but as soon as she is I will book her in.  The Senator also asked for a debate on the EPA report released this morning.</p><p>Senator Eugene Murphy welcomed the Central Bank changes, in particular the policy for people who have separated or divorced, which will give them the capacity to buy houses.</p><p>Senators Murphy and Buttimer wished continued success to our Irish ladies boxing team, and I do the same on behalf of everybody in the House.  The ladies are punching above their weight in all sports, boxing in particular, for the past while.  We wish them continued success and thank them for the joy they give us.</p></speech>

As per the Order of the House today, the Minister of State has been allocated a further four-minute contribution in this resumed debate.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-20a.72" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102000002#S00400"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to speak on this.  I thank the Minister of State for joining us in the Seanad.  I commend my colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne, who has worked tirelessly in this area.  He is very passionate about extending the franchise for the Seanad vote.</p> <p>Discussion on the need to reform the Seanad is not new.  We could stack reports on Seanad reform a mile high.  I know the Cathaoirleach took time over the summer to go through them all.  I concur with my colleagues who say it is the time to act in those areas that we can.  Certainly, this particular area is one that we should absolutely act on immediately.</p> <p>When Seanad &Eacute;ireann was composed in the 1930s, Ireland was a very different place and a country that would be unrecognisable today.  Under the leadership of great leaders, such as Eamon de Valera, Se&aacute;n Lemass and Bertie Ahern, this country has transformed into a highly educated, highly productive and wealthy nation.  However, our institutions have not.  I support the premise of this Bill that the Seanad needs to catch up with that societal development.</p> <p>Seanad reform, as I said, is a vast topic that is complex and multifaceted.  This Bill proposed sets us down the path of action.  It allows us to move on from talking in circles on reform to implementing a reform agenda.  Extending the franchise of the university panel of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to all people who are over 18 and are holders of an appropriate third level qualification from an Irish institute of higher education is a logical and fair starting point.  </p> <p>In the 1930s, one in 50 reached third level on average.  Today three in five opt to enter third level, which is something, of course, on which my party is very proud to have led the charge.  To exclude certain graduates is elitist and does not make logical sense.  For that reason, I fully support this Bill that Senator Malcolm Byrne tabled.  A graduate of Technological University, TU, Dublin, University of Limerick, UL, or any other third level institution is just as entitled to participate in the democratic functions of this House as any other graduate.  It is completely unjust and is insulting to those who, for whatever reason, did not attend the &ldquo;right college&rdquo; to earn them a democratic vote.  </p> <p>I agree with Senator Malcolm Byrne in terms of making this an opt-in process.  We must be practical in how we approach this.  There were fears expressed that to do such a thing retrospectively would be an administrative pariah.  However, the opt-in method deals with that point comprehensively.  </p> <p>Reform of the Seanad is long overdue.  As colleagues in the previous debate referenced, we have seen little or no action on the topic since the passing of the seventh amendment in 1979.  There have now been 16 Administrations that have, frankly, ignored the 92% &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in that referendum.  Again, the demands of the people were expressed when this House was maintained by referendum in 2013 with a clear message to reform our ways.  We cannot continue to wait and we have no excuse to wait.  This Bill is logical and well balanced and shows a further commitment from my party to education and reform.</p></speech>

Not at this occasion, anyway.</p> <p>I join with Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin in commending my colleague and friend, Senator Malcolm Byrne, on this very important and appropriate Private Members&rsquo; Bill on Seanad electoral reform - if I can use that use that dreaded term, &ldquo;Seanad reform&rdquo; - to expand the franchise.  He is right that it is time we did it.  As Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin said, Seanad reform has been an ongoing, rolling debate for decades in this country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The debate has been fractious at times.  There has been little or no uniform agreement and we have had a myriad of reports published.  I think that this is the one area where we can find common ground in bringing reform.  I welcome the road map to this extension of the franchise.</p><p>It would be appropriate to have the Bill passed, given that we have seen a whole new suite of technological universities established, in particular Munster Technological University, MTU, in Cork.  As Senator O'Loughlin said, it is wrong that we differentiate between graduates in their being allowed this franchise as part of the Seanad election process.  We can argue as to how the new electors will be included, how we will be able to administer the system and how we will be able to ensure that people register.  That is all part of what we can do; it is not a roadblock.  That should not be a stumbling block to this legislation being enacted.  We can find very simple ways of doing that, in my opinion.  I support wholeheartedly the inclusion of graduates from the technological and other universities who have been excluded until now.  We must broaden the electoral base, extend the franchise and create an opportunity for the graduates of our new technological universities.  To that end, I highlight again the importance of MTU in the context of this debate.  I congratulate the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, on the bedding-in period in respect of MTU in Cork and Tralee.</p><p>I have one slight deviation to the debate to take in respect of St. Patrick's Pontifical University, Maynooth, which awards degrees, including postgraduate degrees.  In the context of this debate, would there be merit in the inclusion of graduates of that university?  Those graduates do not come under the remit of the NUI but, nonetheless, are awarded degrees.  It would be important to have that broader discussion again, but I will not delay the Bill.</p><p>In the context of education, I pay tribute to the John Bruton Government in which Niamh Bhreathnach was Minister for Education.  She created a pathway for people who could not previously access third level education to avail of it.  I commend Ruair&iacute; Quinn, Richard Bruton and Joe McHugh, who are past Ministers for Education.  Now, with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, we see third level education represented at the Cabinet table as a stand-alone Ministry, and rightly so.</p><p>I commend the Minister of State on his initiative today.  I wholeheartedly support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-20a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102000002#T00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  Is it not wonderful that more students with a third level degree will now be able to take part in the electoral process for Seanad &Eacute;ireann?  It will make the Seanad a lot more relevant to young people, and that is what we want to see.  We want people involved in what we do in this House day to day in order that they care about their representatives, who come through the universities and the colleges.  In that context, I welcome the Bill.</p> <p>I pay tribute to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on all the changes we see coming through with the higher education Act.  I pay tribute also to our former Minister of State, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who introduced the very first technological university.  These TUs are absolutely crucial.  The Minister of State will see - I am sure he will be looking for them - centres of excellence coming out of our TUs.  We have the brand-new Technological University of the Shannon, TUS, in Athlone.  It has just opened up a learning gate in Ballinasloe town.  It is looking at opening up another 11 learning gates.  These are places where students can come to study.  We will also see that for the Atlantic Technological University, ATU.  These are campuses all over Letterkenny, Castlebar, Mountbellew and Galway.  Students who are part of the TUs all across the country, not just in our cities but in our towns, will now be able to participate in voting for Senators as nominated through the higher education institutions.  That accounts for six of the Senators in our grouping.</p> <p>This is absolutely fantastic.  I thank the Minister of State for his time and look forward to hearing his response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-20a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102000002#T00300"><p>I thank Members for their contributions.  I thank Senators Malcolm Byrne, Casey and Cassells for bringing forward this Bill and all the Senators who contributed to the debate.  While the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, does not make an explicit commitment on the issue of Seanad reform, it is recognised that the issue of the university franchise, which has been outstanding since the seventh amendment to the Constitution in 1979, is among those that should be considered as part of any reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  On that basis, and as indicated by the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, when he spoke during this Second Stage debate, the Government is not opposing the Bill on Second Stage.</p> <p>However, the Government's immediate goals in respect of electoral reform are set out in the programme for Government, Our Shared Future.  A number of significant reforms have been brought forward by way of the Electoral Reform Act 2022, which was enacted in July of this year.  The Act provides for a number of significant reforms, including the establishment of an independent, statutory electoral commission.  It also provides for the modernisation of the electoral registration process, provides for new regulatory provisions to ensure transparency in online paid political advertising and provides a role for the commission in tackling online misinformation and disinformation during electoral events.  It facilitates the holding of electoral events during Covid-19-type restrictions and introduces same-day island voting.</p> <p>The short Bill before us presents a complex proposal, and a number of questions arise which will need further consideration.  The proposed amendment to section 6(1)(c) of the Act of 1937 would appear to give the Minster the power to address many of these issues by way of making regulations.  It may be more appropriate, however, to address these issues in the Bill.  There appears to be no clear definition in the Bill as to what is meant by "institutions of higher education in the State", which is the term used in Article 18.4.2&deg; of the Constitution.  That would need to be defined.  Detailed consideration would need to be given as to what third level qualifications should be recognised as confirming a right to vote.  Should it be a degree and a diploma, as set out in the Bill, or should a certificate be included?</p> <p>A related question arises as to what type of appeals process should be in place for determining whether or not the qualification is adequate.  Also, would there be a difficulty with third level courses undertaken in Irish institutions of higher education by Irish citizens where the awarding authority is not Irish?  These are not straightforward questions and need to be teased out a little further as we go through this process.</p> <p>At present, we have two university constituencies of three seats each, both of which have their own register of electors.  With a widening of the franchise, it would need to be decided whether each institution would hold its own register or whether there should be one centralised register and how such a register or registers would work in practice.  There is no provision in the Bill for a returning officer for the proposed new higher education constituency.  Consideration would need to be given as to who would hold this role or if there would be more than one.  The Constitution provides that Seanad elections must be conducted by postal ballot.  Extending the franchise as proposed would lead to a significant increase in the number of postal ballots than is the case at present.</p> <p>I note that costings for the Bill need to be examined further.</p> <p>I raise these issues absolutely not for the sake of finding fault with the Bill but to demonstrate the range of issues we now need to examine as we address the Bill as it goes through the Houses.  Once again, I thank Senators for all their contributions and acknowledge the contributions that were made this afternoon.</p></speech>

I also welcome to the Gallery Mary and Sarah Halford, who are neighbours of mine from home.  They are here for the next Bill, but I am delighted to see them.  I support the next Bill and hope that it does not have as long a passage as the reforms in the Bill before us.  The latter Bill goes back, as colleagues have said, to the seventh amendment to the Constitution, which was passed by referendum by the people in July 1979.  I noticed that a number of taoisigh were mentioned during the discussion.  In 1979 Jack Lynch was Taoiseach and Margaret Thatcher had just become Prime Minister.  We are going to see another Prime Minister across the water in the UK by the time this legislation will be enacted.</p> <p>I get the Minister of State's points, but we had this debate in this House two years ago.  At the time his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for whom I have great respect, came in and outlined some of the challenges and stated that the Government's priority was the electoral reform legislation, which we all supported, and having the electoral commission and all the necessary support measures put in place.  I pay tribute to the Department and the staff for being able to do that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On that front, we can say "mission accomplished".  Now that the Government has done all that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, committed to two years ago when he asked for a year so that the Department could consider it, the Minister of State should have come back today with the answers to the questions we raised at that time.</p><p>This legislation is quite simple.  It aims to establish a single, six-seat constituency for university Senators.  There were proposals for an opt-in provision, as Senator O'Loughlin mentioned, which would avoid the sending out of lots of postal votes unnecessarily.  People would have had to register to vote.  What I am disappointed about is the fact that the Department has not done a lot of thinking-----</p></speech>

It is one of the tasks that should be put to the Electoral Commission.  Under the legislation, it has a role in this.  Senator Buttimer mentioned the Pontifical University at Maynooth but the Bill provides that it is up to the Minister to designate the institutions.  The Minister can designate which higher education institutions qualify.  The Bill also answers the questions around those who are awarded by overseas institutions and whether they should be designated.  That would be a matter for the Minister under the legislation.  That is no different to other legislation under which the Minister is allowed to designate the bodies that are granting awards and so on.  Any awards that are designated level 8 or above within the system would be a good starting point but we can certainly debate going beyond that.</p> <p>The crux of this legislation is to give effect to a decision of the people that was taken 43 years ago.  It is also about reforming this Chamber.  It is something that is relatively easy to do in the context of the broader issue of Seanad reform.  As Senator Buttimer said, there is broad agreement that this is something we can do in advance of the next Seanad elections.</p> <p>We are awaiting a Supreme Court judgment in the Heneghan case.  That may be directly relevant to this legislation.  We will be moving pretty soon, with the agreement of the Leader of the House and the Department, to the Committee Stage debate on this legislation.  Given the fact that the Department has achieved all of its goals with regard to the Electoral Commission and other areas and that two years ago the Minister of State committed to firming up the Department's position on some of the administrative issues within this legislation, I hope that within the next two to three months, when we deal with the remaining Stages of the Bill, the Government will clarify its position on these matters.  I also hope that we can return to the people by the time of the next Seanad election and say that we have delivered this element of reform.</p></speech>

The couple who originally came to me many years ago with this issue, Caroline and Martin Smith, are here.  It has taken us this long to get a resolution.  They are very welcome today.  They are accompanied by Anne-Marie Murtagh, Sarah Behan, Georgina Culshaw and Mary Halford.  They are all very welcome and I am glad they are here today.</p> <p>I am introducing a Bill the concept of which is the most simple, unoffensive little item of legislation that introduces a non-statutory register for the tremendous loss that thousands of families and women feel every year.  In my heart, it is hard to believe that this did not already exist.  It is incredibly frustrating to know that I was the Minister responsible for the General Register Office when Caroline and Martin first came to me.  Considerable blockages were put in the way of the then Minister, who was myself, in order to be able to achieve something that is humongous for the people who lose their loved members of their family.  It is such a small thing for the State to do to recognise that loss and the life that was their family member. </p> <p>I am incredibly proud of the little body of work we have done over the past number of years to be able to stand here with the actual pieces of paper in my hand, with my name on it and the name of my co-sponsor of this Bill, Senator Seery Kearney.  It represents years of work of the families represented here.  There are so many more families.  In this country we are not good at speaking about loss, we tend to bottle it up and keep quiet.  Even when we know somebody else has lost a baby we tend not to speak to them because we do not know what to say to them.  Therefore it might not be commonly known that every year 15,000 pregnancies are lost in miscarriage.  One in five women who get pregnant every year lose their baby at some point during the term of the pregnancy.  I say this and it sounds wrong but those who are fortunate enough to lose a baby after 24 weeks or if the baby has reached the milestone of 500 g when the baby is born, they get a document, a stillbirth register, and the State acknowledges both the life and the loss of that much-wanted child.  However this does not apply for those whose baby is born what could be days before that arbitrary definition of a stillbirth that is laid down by the WHO, which was one of the reasons we could not or were not permitted to apply this register a number of years ago.  A baby that might be only 1 g shy of the 500 g or one day shy does not exist in the eyes of the State.  It never hiccupped in the womb, never turned, it just does not exist.  For those parents involved that is not acceptable.  Apart from the State having an obligation to recognise families in their entirety in all their shapes and forms and their gains, it is also the State&rsquo;s responsibility to look after the losses of families and to recognise the loss. </p> <p>This non-statutory register is not going to confer any rights, any financial benefit or any social welfare protections, and maybe it should but that is another day&rsquo;s work.  All it is going to do is acknowledge the life and the loss of a baby that does not reach the stillbirth definition laid down by the WHO.  To my mind what we have done for years is wholly disrespect the grief and probably in many cases interrupt the grieving process of families who have lost babies.  We had these conversations over the years in regard to other legislation.  We all agree as mammies, and Senator Seery Kearney said it last week when we introduced the Bill, when you do that first pregnancy test, and sometimes you do it a second and third time just to be absolutely sure, the two lines means there is a baby in there.  There is a lovely Fruit of the Womb calendar that shows you what the baby is like at four weeks&rsquo; gestation.  It likens it to fruits, so you go from having a strawberry to having a melon.  It is a wonderful experience.  As Senator Seery Kearney said last week, a whole life is lived in the first couple of hours.  What we have done to all of these families, the 15,000 families every year, for as long as this has existed, is halt their grieving process because we have not recognised that they have actually lost anything.  That is inherently wrong.  </p> <p>Today&rsquo;s register will absolutely allow those women, families, people who lose babies between the time of being medically certified as pregnant right up to and before reaching the milestone of 500 g or 24 weeks.  If you unfortunately lose your baby during that time you are going to be allowed to apply for a register that shows that the State acknowledges both the life and the loss.  That is all it is going to do.  It is not something to be afraid of.  A number of people contacted me last week who were afraid it will do something to some other legislation or infer rights.  First of all we should have rights.  The only thing this will give a right to is for families to have a legal and statutory, even though it is non-statutory, recognition and certificate of the baby they were carrying and lost that does not reach the milestones as set down by the medical definitions.  For Caroline and Martin and their little man who was actually born and passed away seven years ago today, the timing of this Bill is down to the universe because it was not anything to do with me or with Senator Seery Kearney.  It is the universe telling me that this is absolutely the right thing to do.  It was absolutely the right thing for that wonderful couple to keep nagging me for all the years that they have nagged me to make sure that we got to this stage.</p> <p>I want to say on the record and to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, who I thank for being here today, that I am incredibly pleased that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, has asked Cabinet not to oppose this Bill.  I do not know how I would feel today if that were not the case.  The feedback from my Seanad colleagues is that they are all supportive of this Bill because it is incredibly simple but powerful.  I will ask that we do Committee and Report Stages together given that there will not be any opposition to it.  We may do it very quickly so that we can get this Bill into the D&aacute;il.  Because there is not an equivalent of my role in the D&aacute;il, and Senator Seery Kearney and I are both the co-sponsors, I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, to comment or at least come back to me as to whether, if and when the Bill passes this House, the Minister will take it in her own name to the Lower House and to pass it and put it on our Statute Book in order that very shortly, we will be able to issue the certificates to any of the 15,000 women and families who have lost a baby this year, and every year going forward.  </p></speech>

I am very grateful to hear from the Leader that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is supportive of the Bill.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for being here today.  I thank the Leader for bringing this forward and for being so tenacious as a Minister and also as a Leader, and for inviting me to be part of it.  To Stephen, I want to say a very happy birthday.  I have no doubt that today is a day of mixed emotions, cherishing his memory and the sadness of the days that were not lived with him.  To Martin and Caroline and to all who have come here, but especially to Martin and Caroline, the organisation Proud 2 Parent lists these concepts among the definition of parenthood and parenting, namely, meeting basic needs, protection, love and leading.  I say to them today, well done on being the most fantastic parents to Stephen, for protecting him and making sure that his life, short as it was, was one of great significance, for loving him and leading the way for so many other parents to have the significance of their babies recognised.  Well done Mammy and Daddy, Stephen would be very proud of you in the universe today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Pregnancy loss at any stage can be a very difficult experience for a couple.  Academic studies by psychologists have shown a significant depression and anxiety in the first month following early pregnancy loss in women.  Partners have also been shown to display depression and anxiety, albeit generally at a slightly lower level.  There is also evidence of post-traumatic stress symptoms relating to early pregnancy loss.</p><p>The American Psychological Association found that while the tragedy of miscarriage has traditionally been private and an event grieved largely by the mother, healthcare professionals have seen that these women's great sadness would grow less pronounced over time, especially following a successful pregnancy.  That was the thinking but research suggests that some women mourn for much longer than expected, even after the birth of a healthy child, although the range and severity of the symptoms may vary.  That is also true for men.  Studies have found that men grieve over a miscarriage and what was once thought is no longer the academic and professionally-held view.</p><p>Miscarriages are very common.  Statistics show that one in four pregnancies end in miscarriage.  Its impact is often underestimated but a miscarriage is a traumatic loss.  It is a loss not only of the pregnancy but of a woman's sense of self and her hopes and dreams for the future.  She has lost her reproductive story and all of that has to be grieved.  The tragedy of miscarriage has traditionally been private but it is right that we talk about it and bring it out into the public, and afford women and men the opportunity to mourn the much-longed-for child and that their grief is publicly recognised and supported.</p><p>Clinical psychologists have found that a woman who has a miscarriage is at risk of depression and anxiety even after having a healthy child.  Women who miscarry have a greater possibility of postpartum depression.   The misunderstanding about miscarriage is that a woman will experience less grief if she has lost the baby early in pregnancy.  However, research has proven that is not the case and that the length of gestation has no bearing on the intensity of grief.  A woman who has lost a baby at 11 weeks may be as distraught as a woman who has lost a baby at 20 weeks.</p><p>While the medical experience and the emphasis and meaning of a pregnancy may vary, labelling it a traumatic loss will validate that experience of grief.  That is exactly what this Bill does &ndash; it validates the loss that has occurred and that life existed that was significant to the persons whose lives and circumstances were such that they longed for that child.  Recognising the life is also recognising the loss to those who grieve.</p><p>Society, in the effort to be helpful, can be very dismissive of loss.  Following the sharing of news of a miscarriage people can say that it was not meant to be or what is for one will not pass one - a hated saying of mine - and that one can try again.  While well meaning, it is a thoughtless implication that the baby that was due and the grief associated with that loss is not as significant as it is.</p><p>The statement and action of this Bill was brought about by the determination of Caroline and Martin Smith that Stephen was and is significant and maybe as we move forward as a society, in having a certificate of life and a State mechanism of recognition, we will review how we treat miscarriage and respect the grief of parents.  In many cases of early pregnancy loss, there is no body to hold or remains to bury and no place to go with the loss.  This Bill gives a place to go and a place of recognition.</p><p>On Good Friday 2008, four days earlier than I was supposed to do a pregnancy test, I woke up in the middle of the night having dreamt that I was pregnant.  I ran into the bathroom and did a pregnancy test &ndash; I had a pile of about ten of them waiting to be used.  I was not in my first IVF cycle but I knew this one felt different.  My body felt different. The test was a very clear positive.  I did it again to be sure that I was not imagining it or still dreaming it.  It was still positive.  My husband - my poor Dave - was woken up by my shrieking.  The two of us hugged and cried and celebrated that after seven years of marriage and trying, we were finally pregnant.</p><p>We were suddenly transformed into a family at that very early stage.  Dave made me tea and brought me breakfast in bed and treated me and my wonderful body that was now holding our baby with such tenderness and love.  We drove to my parents to tell them that all was great and they would finally have a grandchild and we rang my stepchildren to tell them they were going to have a little brother or sister.  Everybody was delighted.</p><p>That weekend, Dave and I were in Tesco with my mother and when we came to the baby aisle, an aisle that I studiously avoided for years, he stood at the top of it and proudly invited me to walk down it and I did so.  I looked at nappies and all of the bits and pieces.  I even picked up Sudocrem and thought I would have that and all of the other things.  We drove to Mamas &amp;amp; Papas and bought a baby grow, a nameplate for the door of the room that would be the nursery and I even started to crochet booties.  We speculated on names, birth, the celebrations of our baby&rsquo;s life, schools and a whole lifetime.  We imagined our first Christmas including the decorations and visits to Santa.  We planned a whole life.</p><p>In the weeks that followed, what started out as blood spotting ended in a full miscarriage.  That was the first of five such losses over the next few years.  Later that year, a much longer pregnancy ended on 29 December.  We still have the scans.  I can still hear the sounds of the heartbeat.  That new year of 2008 going into 2009, we locked ourselves away.  Our best friends, John and Melisa, hung groceries on the door of our house in order that we could lock ourselves away and grieve.  Every year on 29 December, we go to my grandparents grave and lay a wreath on their grave in memory of the lives we lived for such a short time and the lives we lost.  They are members of our family and they are in my heart and in David&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>I pinch myself every day with joy for the baby that was born, via the wonderful woman who was prepared to be our surrogate and the clinic that cherished our journey to holding our baby.  We celebrate her every day and while as a family we fully live and love her together, that does not diminish our need to memorialise our loved ones that were lost.  </p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.  I seek the support of this House - it is clear that will be unanimous - so that we ensure that for those families who wish to, they have the opportunity to have that lifetime that was lived recognised, for however long the pregnancy was, of those who are remembered and cherished and that we respect their right to grieve.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I acknowledge Senator Seery Kearney's honesty and bravery in telling us her story.  I acknowledge that Stephen's life mattered and welcome his parents, Caroline and Martin.  I have no doubt that the death of a baby is one of the most devastating experiences any parent will face and, sadly, many families have such an experience every year.  I can totally imagine how families are struggling with that loss.</p> <p>It is important to acknowledge that October is national pregnancy and infant loss awareness month.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I imagine it is a difficult time for families.</p><p>I acknowledge the positive intent of this Bill and the work of Senators Doherty and Seery Kearney to make sure it will become a reality.  It will support thousands of families around Ireland by ensuring that the loss of their baby, no matter at what stage it happened, is acknowledged and recognised.  I also acknowledge that the Bill is designed to provide for a voluntary scheme of registration.  It is important that it is voluntary.  As any of us deal with loss, bereavement or grief in our families, we all have different ways to deal with it.  I have no doubt that this will be important for many, but there may be some who may choose not to go down this road.  The loss of a pregnancy that does not meet the criteria for a stillbirth registration has to be painful.  I understand that the establishment of such a register would provide some type of comfort to parents bereaved by an early loss in pregnancy.</p><p>Yesterday, we had a presentation in the audiovisual room, organised by my colleague, Senator Clifford-Lee.  I had the opportunity to go to that and to listen to Professor Keelin O'Donoghue, consultant obstetrician, and Riona Cotter, senior midwifery manager.  They are the HSE implementation leads for national standards for bereavement following pregnancy loss.  It is important to acknowledge the incredible work that they are doing.  M&aacute;irie Cregan, the chair and founder of F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in, was also present.  F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in does incredible work and helped following the bereavement of a friend of mine who had twins.  My mother knits little matinee coats every year for babies who are stillborn.  I appreciate that we are not talking about stillbirths now, but I acknowledge the work that F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in does.</p><p>I understand that the Minister of State has said that some complex and difficult legal issues will need to be considered and resolved prior to any enactment, but a strong message should go from this House that we expect these issues to be considered and resolved to ensure that this Bill is enacted.  We should ask the Department of Health to look at the registration of a loss of life during pregnancy and to consult with the General Register Office about the method by which such a registration would be given effect.  That is important.</p><p>I understand that miscarriages are not officially recorded in Ireland, but it is shocking to learn that possibly 14,000 early pregnancy miscarriages happen each year.  That is one in four pregnancies.  The risk of stillbirth is at one in 200 pregnancies, despite many improvements in medical care.  These rates have remained nearly constant.  That is why the work of Professor O'Donoghue in leading a team of researchers who have been studying these causes and how to better prevent and understand these losses is important.  We need to support this work.</p><p>That is as much as I can say.  I do not want to go into the technical elements because today is about supporting bereaved parents, remembering Stephen and acknowledging the loss of Senator Seery Kearney and many others.  I fully support this Bill and look forward to it passing and being implemented to support many families.</p></speech>

Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite aige go dt&iacute; seo agus molaim mholt&oacute;ir&iacute; an Bhille, na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; Doherty agus Seery Kearney.  I begin by welcoming the Minister of State and thanking colleagues who have introduced this important Bill.  I apologise to colleagues for missing their contributions.  I was at a committee meeting.  I wanted to contribute to this important debate.  I acknowledge what Senator O'Loughlin said, that we recognise and appreciate that there may be complexities, but this is about resolving them and getting to where we need to be.  I welcome our guests to the Gallery.</p> <p>I begin by thanking Senad&oacute;ir&iacute; Regina Doherty and Mary Seery Kearney for bringing this Bill to the Seanad and allowing us an opportunity to speak on a matter of huge importance to the people of this country, especially the families affected.  This rarely receives public attention because of its sensitive nature.  I commend all involved, including Deputies, Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; and their staff, who have organised a number of events in the Seanad and the audiovisual room in recent days and weeks to publicly highlight aspects of life which directly affect women and men to different degrees.  These events have covered the importance of breastfeeding, the impact of menopause and the impact of stillbirth and miscarriage, as well as today's Bill, Civil Registration (Amendment) (Certificate of Life) Bill 2022.  All the events have shown the great work that has been done and what needs to be done to further improve the quality of women's lives and consequently the lives of their partners and families.</p> <p>The World Health Organization named October as menopause awareness month.  Two days ago, 18 October, was World Menopause Day.  We have all experienced, within our family or among friends and neighbours, the joy of a new arrival and the great hope that it engenders for the future for everyone involved.  A new arrival is a very public affair.  It is one of life's definitive and welcome occasions, where the parents or single mother are rightly at the centre of everyone's attention and praise.  For all involved with the new arrival, it is a positive, personal, life-affirming and memorable occasion, but life teaches us that in the bearing and rearing of children, joy and sadness are opposite sides of the coin of life.  Today's Bill reflects the sadness side of that coin of life because it addresses the loss of a child through miscarriage and the emotional impact of that loss on the mother and father.</p> <p>The Bill specifically calls for the setting up of a non-statutory new form of registration, called the certificate of life.  It specifically identifies this need on the basis that a miscarriage can occur at any time in circumstances that do not meet the requirements for a stillbirth registration under the current law.  The proposed amendment will ensure that a certificate of life will be available to any woman who has lost a baby outside the current regulations which provide for a recognition, in law, of the loss.  The certificate of life is important to the grieving parents who have experienced the miscarriage.  It represents recognition by the State of the child's existence, recognition of the loss and of its emotional impact on the mother, father and family.  It should also result in those affected being provided with the kind of support that is available at the moment to those who experience stillbirth, as well as parental leave, access to bereavement care and medical advice.  At a time of great emotional turmoil following a miscarriage, this thoughtful legislation will play its part in the grieving process and help the parents concerned to manage the loss of their child.  That is what this is about at its heart.</p> <p>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.  I think he will find willingness to engage with the Department and Minister across the Seanad to ensure that any complexities, issues and concerns can be ironed out, because we have the potential to do something.  With that potential, there is also a great obligation to ensure that we get this right.  This Bill, as proposed by Senators Doherty and Seery Kearney, shows us the way to get there.</p> <p>I support the legislation, wish it well and look forward to its continued passage through the House.  For all of the reasons that I have outlined, and reasons which other colleagues have and no doubt will outline, I hope to see the legislation come into effect as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I thank Senators Doherty and Seery Kearney for introducing it.  I pay tribute to Caroline and Martin Smith, who were in contact with us about Bill that was debated last year about reproductive health leave and the amendments tabled on Committee Stage earlier this year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I want to pay tribute to the tenacity, perseverance and work of Caroline and Martin.  I am thinking of Elaine and her family, Jacinta and her family, and all those in F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in who have been campaigning on this issue for a considerable time.  We were very glad to be able to put forward an amendment in our own Bill earlier this year but I am heartened to hear that we have a stand-alone Bill on this issue of a certificate of life and a non-statutory register with regard to stillbirth and early pregnancy loss.  It is very important that the Government takes this up and just gets on with it.</p><p>In much of the correspondence we have had, there is that plea for recognition by families who have been devastated by miscarriage and stillbirth.  There was hardly a dry eye in the House listening to Senator Seery Kearney and her devastating experience.  It is the stories we have come across in terms of that loss and the cruelty of what seems like an arbitrary definition of stillbirth despite what it would seem to the family at the time.  There is the shock that one mother described to me of learning that her baby, who came out perfectly formed, will not be recognised like any other baby just because they did not meet that threshold of 500 g or the 24 weeks when they were born.  Another parent describes that unnecessary torture of knowing that the siblings or other family members would not have access to the information about that baby in times to come.  I very much welcome this as a stand-alone Bill.  I hope it proceeds quickly and that some peace and solace is given to those families who have had to suffer that devastating loss.</p><p>A lack of a commemorative certificate is just one of a number of injustices associated with pregnancy loss.  In particular, I want to make the point that Ireland is out of step with other countries.  Most other European Union countries have a definition of stillbirth.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin, I listened yesterday to Professor Keelin O'Donoghue, Riona Cotter and Mairie Cregan of F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in talk about the disparities between the definition in Ireland and elsewhere.  In particular, we know that almost 60% of EU countries have a definition of stillbirth at 22 weeks.  I want to very much support the call by the pregnancy loss research group and the National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre for a change in the definition of stillbirth in Ireland to bring it to 22 weeks and 400 g.  I know the HSE has a recommendation from 2021 that it be 23 weeks and 400 g, but 23 weeks seems a bit unusual because there are so few other countries that have it at 23 weeks.  It is three decades or more since we last updated the definition of stillbirth.  My appeal to the Minister of State is that the Department of Health needs to look at this sooner rather than later.  Obviously, a change in definition does not provide any great solace to those who have lost a baby, but it does mean they have access to the statutory stillbirth register and, importantly, entitlement to maternity and paternity leave.  It would mean greater provision is made for those who lose babies coming to the 22 weeks or at the 400 g birth weight.</p><p>To conclude, I very much welcome the Bill.  It is simple and straightforward.  For all those families, there is a mechanism and a proposal here to ensure there is recognition for their loss.  As I said, I urge the Government to move on this as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-20a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102000002#Y00200"><p>I acknowledge the life of Stephen, and welcome Caroline and Martin to the Visitors Gallery.  I want to also acknowledge Senator Doherty and in particular Senator Seery Kearney for that very moving and emotive contribution in which the Senator outlined a life-changing experience that so many in our society go through in their daily lives.  It is poignant to note that October is the month set aside to mark pregnancy and infant loss and it is good that this House is contributing to recognising the unbearable losses suffered by parents, especially mothers, but also their families.</p> <p>This past week was a time when events to commemorate pregnancy loss were held across the country and internationally.  I know that many have joined in these events to mark the trauma that impacts many families throughout the country.  I have listened with great interest to the contributions of Senators.  It is difficult not to be moved by the stories of the families impacted by such loss and the commitment and support each of them provide.  We are fortunate to have support groups and those wonderful professionals working within the HSE who provide care, guidance and solace during very difficult times.</p> <p>Looking back, it is clear that a higher profile is being given to parental bereavement issues.  Whereas, before, many people felt that they did not know how to approach the subject or what to say, we are increasingly seeing people coming forward and offering words of understanding, sympathy, kindness and condolence.  Parents are also being more open about their losses, which in the past were not disclosed or discussed, even within families.  This openness is to be welcomed and our appreciation must go to those who are providing practical supports and leading the arguments for greater recognition.  Pregnancy loss affects many families.  Department of Health and HSE data indicate that, each year, as many as 14,000 early pregnancies end in loss, while 320 to 350 stillbirths and early neonatal deaths occur.  Many parents deal with this loss in silence and do not share their stories or seek support.</p> <p>Senators Doherty and Seery Kearney have drafted the Bill that is before us today.  As the Senators have indicated, the purpose of the Bill is to establish a non-statutory register called the certificate of life.  In doing so, the process will provide an option to recognise and commemorate a loss in pregnancy where it cannot be registered in the stillbirth register.  I think this is the first such initiative to have been put to either House.</p> <p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, I want to reference the forthcoming proposals which will soon be considered relating to the stillbirth register.  The General Register Office, GRO, is notified of all births, stillbirths and neonatal deaths that occur.   Something of the order of between 300 and 350 families are affected each year by loss due to stillbirth and early neonatal deaths.  The GRO also observes that due to the voluntary nature of the stillbirth registration process, around half of parents elect to register, meaning that a significant number of parents do not register, perhaps in part reflecting the effect of the huge loss suffered by them and their wider family.  While we accept that parents may not consider registration at the time of their loss, we feel that the stillbirth registration process confers a recognition of their stillborn child that in later years would bring a degree of comfort to them, and we would encourage parents to register.  Proposals are being advanced by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, which I hope the Government will agree to, that will see legislative change to the criteria and give greater access to the register. </p> <p>The report outlines that the threshold of foetal viability has progressively lowered over time.  In the 1970s, the limit was set at 28 weeks' gestation and, over the subsequent 30 years, it has decreased to 24 weeks' gestation.  More recently, the threshold of viability has reduced to 23 weeks' gestation with advances in medical care and practice.  I understand the report has taken account of the opinions of neonatologists, obstetricians, neonatal nurses, midwives and parents.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The report notes the psychological and emotional toll of a very pre-term birth on the parents and extended family.<br/><br/>I hope the House will join with me in expressing our deep appreciation to the many midwives, nurses, doctors and other professionals who deal with parents, and especially mothers, at a crisis time in their pregnancies and where the outlook can often be bleak and unforgiving.  I think Senators will agree that these are very welcome developments and ones that will need to be reflected in our legislation.  In mentioning this, I wish to draw the attention of the House to work that is being undertaken in respect of a commitment the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, made in the D&aacute;il this time last year to examine the scheme of registration for stillbirths.<br/><br/>The Civil Registration Act provides that no person other than the Registrar General or a member of the staff of the GRO, is authorised to search the Register of Stillbirths.  The GRO provides whatever assistance it can to enable searches.  There are restrictions on providing copies of the information held in the form of a certificate to anyone other than a parent.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has asked the GRO to examine the current restrictions and to bring forward proposals to improve access and to identify any legislative implications involved in making the stillbirth register more open and if it should in fact be fully open to public access, as with other public registers it holds.<br/><br/>In examining this matter, the GRO considered several approaches and took account of representations made by F&eacute;ileac&aacute;in and others, and I am happy to summarise these for the Members.  The first option is to leave the current access arrangements as they stand.  That is, access is restricted to the parents of the child recorded in the register and staff of the GRO.  A second option is to provide full public access along the lines of other registers held by the GRO.  A third option would fall short of full public access but would provide access to a wider cohort of family members and family representatives.<br/><br/>In determining an approach, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, accepted the view of the GRO and others that the <i>status quo</i>cannot be maintained.  Limiting access to the parents of a child is far too restrictive and this is borne out by representations made over the years by advocacy groups and others.  The current arrangement does not provide for situations when parents finally pass away where siblings and other family members wish to access the register.  I know that parents are worried that when they die, access to the register might not be facilitated.  That is a real concern which we need to address.  While the GRO facilitates access in such circumstances, I accept that a better solution can be achieved.<br/><br/>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is of the view that full public access to the register will not meet the needs of parents and families who have children recorded in the register.  Such a proposal, in her view, does not respect the sensitivities involved and that other, less limiting, forms of access could be considered.  Suggestions have been made that if public access is enabled, that an &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; could be provided for parents with respect to the nature of future access to the register.  The Minister does not consider that such an approach is feasible given the principles underpinning registration law and practice and how a position could be sustained into the future to deny access to interested family members if such an opt-out was in place.  A third option is to reflect the practice employed elsewhere in the registration system where access is permitted to a wider group of family members and representatives.  This is an approach favoured by the GRO, in that it balances the sensitivities of parents, while also providing for broader access, without going as far as enabling full public access.  The Minister plans to bring legislative proposals in this area in the near future to reflect the range of opinions expressed.  It will ultimately be a matter for the Oireachtas to determine the approach.<br/><br/>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, I also wish to raise a number of issues which merit consideration in the context of being helpful in regard to this Bill's passage through the House.  The Long Title of the Bill sets out that its main aim is to amend the Civil Registration Act 2004 to establish a non-statutory register called the certificate of life where a child is lost during a pregnancy and does not meet the stillbirth registration criteria.  Essentially, what the Bill purports to do is to create a statutory framework for a registration scheme.  However, there is a concern in respect of the discretion on parents and I note that parents were not referred to initially in regard to having a role in the registration process.  Also, there is no reference to the voluntary nature of the registration in the Bill, and this is at odds with how stillbirths are registered.<br/><br/>As the Bill seeks to amend the Civil Registration Act, no mention is made of the GRO or of its role with respect to registration matters.  It is unclear if registration should be voluntary, given that the obligation to register is placed on medical practitioners and others.  It is also unclear if the registers should be hosted by hospitals or the GRO, although I understand that the former is the intention of the Senators, given that it is proposed that certificates will be issued by medical practitioners or the hospital or medical institution.<br/><br/>While the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, fully accepts the spirit of the Bill, the aforementioned notes are essentially provided to be helpful to the Senators.  <br/><br/>The Ministers attention has been drawn in recent weeks to work that has been undertaken in England and to a recently published policy paper on a women's health strategy for England.  The policy paper contains a recommendation from the Pregnancy Loss Review.  This review has been under way for a number of years in the UK and is expected to be published later this year and has been mentioned as a useful resource in determining an approach which could also be applied.<br/><br/>The government there has accepted a recommendation to introduce a pregnancy loss certificate in England.  My understanding is that will be a voluntary scheme operated by hospitals and will enable parents who have experienced a pre-24 weeks' pregnancy loss to record and receive a certificate to provide recognition of the loss of their baby.  Unfortunately, very little detail is offered other than that of a certificate which will have no legal standing but will act as an acknowledgement of a life lost.<br/><br/>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, considers that such a scheme could have application and would go some way to meet the needs of parents.  However, as I already mentioned, consideration of any scheme along the lines that are proposed for England would be more appropriately undertaken by the Department of Health and the HSE.<br/><br/>This is an area on which the Government wants to work with all Senators and there is much work we can do in order to get a clear and common understanding of what people require and how we can meet those demands.  I want to acknowledge the commitment shown and to applaud those who have shared their personal stories and the stories of the people they represent.  The comments I have just made on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, are intended to be helpful.</p></speech>

The bizarre nature of the response would probably be okay if this was the first time that the Department and its officials had ever had any sight of this.  I spent a privileged four years in the Department and there are very large files of meetings we have had, not just with Martin and Caroline Smith but with all of the officials who attempted to do this, so this is not a new issue.</p> <p>Addressing the specific issues outlined by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, that there is no mention of the voluntary nature of the registration in the Bill; in section 2(2) the Bill states that the &ldquo;Certificates issued [will be] pursuant to a scheme ... where so requested&rdquo;.  It is entirely incumbent, therefore, upon the mother, the father or the people who suffered the loss to apply to the GRO for their certificate.  This is a completely voluntary and non-statutory process and does not ever expect to infer any other statutory rights.</p> <p>The reason that this is an amendment to the Civil Registration Act and that the medical practitioner is required to certify it is because that is what happens when we lose babies.  We go to the hospital because we want to try to save the baby and the loss to my mind, whether it is prior to 24-weeks or after that period, is part of the register of that hospital, so a medical practitioner after 24 weeks certifies that a baby was born and that a baby had died.  All we are asking for is the equivalent medical certificate for a baby that does not reach the WHO certification standards.  </p> <p>This is not something that is new and we are not trying to create something to be awkward here.  We want the medical practitioners at the time of the loss to register the baby's loss and then for the GRO, in exactly the same way as they do with the stillbirth register, if the parents wish to apply for the non-statutory certificate of life or loss -  whichever way we want to term it - that such an application will suffice the GRO to give them the records.  </p> <p>I am not trying to be smart, and particularly not to the Minister of State, but this is not rocket science.  What this does is acknowledge the 15,000 babies who are lost each and every year, and the lives lived in the first hours of the duration after pregnancy tests and that are lost, together with the years of grief that have been interrupted for so many families.  If there is a will, and there certainly is in this House from the contributions that the Minister of State has heard today, and there certainly is also from the activists, both parents and representative bodies, to ensure that the State does not stand in its own way or in the way of parents of citizens of this State any longer, then we will find a way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will work with the officials and if there are amendments that need to be brought before Committee Stage we will do that but we will see the passage of this Bill through to its end.
