    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#A00600"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this Commencement matter.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, to the House.  He is no stranger to local government having being a Minister of State in that Department.  He is hugely committed to local government, to reform and to the participation of the widest possible number of people in local government.  He is a strong advocate of that and I am delighted he is here to take this Commencement matter.</p> <p>The Commencement matter I have tabled is on the need for the Minister of State with responsibility for planning and local government to make a statement on increasing participation of women and diversity in local government, including the funding to facilitate this participation.  That is the issue.  At the very outset, I acknowledge the decision yesterday of the Cabinet to approve, at least in principle, maternity leave.  It is a really important step but it is only one step in terms of increasing the participation of women, particularly in local government.  However, I want to see more than that.  I want to see diversity within local government.  I am thinking of the migrant community and of new people who have come to our shores who are eligible to participate in local government because that is also an important part of it.  It is about good people in local government, and supporting people into local government.</p> <p>I am supportive of promoting wider inclusivity and diversity in local government in all local decision-making.  It is important the new entrants into local government are supported and facilitated and assisted in every way possible.  It is also important we support the existing councillors.  One of the things brought to my attention in recent weeks through the women's caucus is about bringing women into politics, which is fantastic and I fully support it.  However, we must also support the women who are there already.  Ageism is alive and well in local government and I do not like the suggestion that everyone has to be young to be in local government.  There are very able and experienced women in the Minister of State's party and in all parties, but Fine Gael has, I think, a higher ratio of women in local government than most.  These women need to be supported too.  It is not about them being pushed aside for new entrants.  We want new entrants in politics but we also want to support those who want to stay.  That is an important point.</p> <p>I acknowledged that the Cabinet has approved, in principle, maternity leave, which is important.  I acknowledge also the work of the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, who has done much work collaboratively with the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA.  It is important to acknowledge Councillor Mary Hoade.  She is a former president of the AILG and is a very strong advocate for women and for the participation of more women in local government as well as for more councillors in local government.  She achieved a lot during her term as president of the AILG and I want to acknowledge that.</p> <p>I acknowledge Councillor Terry O'Flatherty, who has been a councillor on Galway City Council for many years, and Councillor Karey McHugh, who was on that small steering group the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, picked to look at this issue.</p> <p>What I am really saying is that it is all very progressive and very important.  A new round of funding has been identified for increasing participation of women and diversity in local government, which, as it happens, is what this Commencement matter is about.  There is a new call for 2022.  I think we need to talk about that.  We need more publicity in relation to it.  People need to be aware there is funding being put in place by Government to encourage women in the parties.  It is also for independent women who make a conscious choice not to join a political party.  They are as valid and as important in the local government structure.</p> <p>It is important we encourage people and that we support women, diversity and everyone who wants to make a significant contribution to local government.</p></speech>

It is essential and I am delighted to be able to respond on behalf of Minister of State, Deputy Burke, who successfully brought his proposal through Cabinet yesterday in relation to maternity leave, which should have been there for many years.  I am glad he has achieved that now.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will again assist with the participation of women and people from diverse backgrounds in local government, and rightly so.</p><p>I fully agree with the Senator that this is a really important conversation we need to have more often.  We need to promote the work that is being done in this regard, as well as the notion of people of all ages entering politics.  Very often when we talk about new candidates, it is assumed they are young candidates but that is not necessarily the case.  New candidates of all ages and all backgrounds are essential in the system and we also need to protect those who are already there and who are giving great service.  I came into politics quite young myself, firmly of the belief that every generation should have a voice and be represented, whether at local or national level.  There certainly should not be any ageist comments, against either older or younger people.  A blend of people from all backgrounds and all age groups should come into politics.</p><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising the issue of increasing the participation of women and people of diversity in local government.  I fully recognise the low rate of female participation in local government and addressing this issue has been a policy priority of the Government since its formation.  A range of initiatives have been undertaken that are aimed at improving the gender and diversity balance of councils while, at the same time, working to make the role of councillor more sustainable for all and more attractive given, as we all recognise, it is a very busy but very important role, whether the person is a member of a party or is an Independent.  They are all equally important and equally beneficial to their local community.</p><p>On the specific issue of funding to local authorities, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has issued annual calls for funding since 2019, requesting local authorities to submit appropriate proposals for projects to address the under-representation of women and people of diversity in local government structures and decision-making.  While it is fully appreciated local authorities do not have a specific role regarding political candidacy for local elections, they are in a position to create an informed, supportive and encouraging environment for women and people of diversity who might be interested in local government.</p><p>There has been great interest from the local authority sector, with a range of innovative applications received.  In 2021, more than &euro;103,000 was allocated to 14 local authorities.  Proposals that have received funding at local authority level include a behaviour and attitudes survey among non-national groups, a webinar on political engagement, a work shadowing programme for young women interested in local government and the publication of an information booklet on the role of the councillor.  Earlier this month, the 2022 call for funding was issued to local authorities.</p><p>In addition, following research funded by the Department in 2021 on female caucuses in local government structures, funding was approved for local authorities to assist with the establishment and running of such caucuses.  The provision of this funding was through an application process and funding was provided mainly to caucuses that were yet to be established.  In 2021, funding of &euro;62,000 was approved to help facilitate 24 local authorities with local level and regional caucuses.  Since 2019, grant funding has been made available to political parties for specific projects aimed at increasing female participation and diversity in their parties.</p><p>In September 2021, following a review of the scheme, an increased fund of &euro;150,274 was allocated to seven political parties and, for the first time, to an Independent group.  I have no doubt the Senator will have been aware of that and will be glad to hear it confirmed.  Under this scheme, initiatives previously funded include: the appointment of a party diversity officer, a recruitment campaign targeting new members from migrant backgrounds, the Traveller community and people with disabilities; development and training workshops for women members; and an annual women&rsquo;s conference.  It is proposed to issue a further call for funding again this year to the political parties and, no doubt, to the Independent groups as well.</p><p>I again thank the Senator for raising this important issue and for his considered views.  It is important we continue to shine a light on the efforts of everybody in these Houses to increase diversity and gender balance in local government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#B00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  I am very familiar with the Independent group that was included last year because we lobbied for it.  It had not been included in the initial proposals and we pulled together a group of Independents to make a submission to the then Minister of State with responsibility for the matter, Deputy Phelan, the year before last.  To be fair to him, he was very keen to facilitate that.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy English, summed it up when he stated it is important every generation have an opportunity, to which I would add that all generations should have an equal opportunity, be they diverse or whoever they are, to participate in local democracy.  The work the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been doing is exceptional.  I acknowledge also Ms Louise Purcell, an assistant principal officer who has really driven this and taken responsibility for it within the Department.  She has kept in touch with the city and county managers, the chief executives and the local authority and councillor groups, so I acknowledge her participation and support, as well as that of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  It is all very progressive and will, I hope, bring in more new candidates.</p> <p>Let us continue to keep the focus equally on supporting in their work those who wish to stay on as city and county councillors.  We need every generation to get involved.  Local government is best served by having a mix of people with diverse views and a mix of generations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#B00300"><p>As I described, a range of measures are being taken to promote gender balance and diversity in local government, including supports through local authorities for women&rsquo;s caucuses and political parties.  Like the Senator, I recognise all those who have been involved in promoting this, whether in the Department, local government, the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, or any of the other the various councillor representative bodies, to make it happen, along with the Senator himself.  Deputy Peter Burke has been a Minister of State very open to engaging and he has built on the work of Deputy Phelan, working with all stakeholders to try to get results and make things happen.  It may have taken longer than it should have in regard to maternity leave and so on but I am glad the matter passed through Cabinet yesterday, which is really important.</p> <p>The measures I mentioned also include supports to Women for Election, Longford Women&rsquo;s Link and the National Women's Council of Ireland, which provide capacity-building and training services as well as policy research benefiting all women interested in entering local government.  As I said, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, just yesterday secured Cabinet approval for proposals to provide maternity leave and supports for councillors, as well as cover in respect of votes or important decisions at local authority level and administrative support, as may be required, which should take some pressure off councillors who need maternity leave to look after a newborn.  They will not feel as though they have to be there for all the meetings and votes and they will have a choice in that regard.  To be clear, that should have been in place a long time ago and I am glad it has been secured.  These measures are in addition to the significant reform of councillor remuneration introduced with effect from 1 July 2021, which places the role of councillor on a more financially sustainable footing and recognises their expanded role.</p> <p>We continue to work with the sector on non-pay-related improvements to the role.  It is the intention of the Government that through the funding schemes I have mentioned, alongside the holistic reforms being put in place such as maternity leave and supports, the role of the councillor can become truly achievable and sustainable for all, exactly as the Senator outlined.  It should be an option for everybody, no matter who they are or where they are from.  In that way, we will have elected councils that are more fully representative of the diverse communities they represent.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#B00500"><p>It is good to see the Minister of State and I thank him for coming to the House.  European works councils play an important role in the information and consultation of employees of multinational companies across borders.  It is a very important function, underpinned by an EU directive.  The directive on European works councils compels member states to put in place adequate administrative or judicial procedures in order that workers and company management can enforce all the rights and obligations deriving from the directive, but Ireland's legislation has not properly transposed the EU directive, leading to problems and issues that have been highlighted time and again.</p> <p>On foot of a complaint made by SIPTU, the European Commission "has identified a number of shortcomings in Irish legislation, which fails to guarantee the right of workers' representatives, the Special Negotiating Body (a body of workers' representatives) or the European Works Council to go to a national court over disputes related to breaches of the rights and obligations under this Directive".  As the Minister of State knows, this has not just appeared out of the blue.  The Government was warned by the European Commission and for years, Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies and I have been calling on the T&aacute;naiste to update the legislation governing European works councils to benefit workers and to comply with European Union law, while my party colleague Chris MacManus MEP has been working tirelessly on this matter in the European Parliament.  The Brussels European Employee Relations Group, BEERG, wrote to the Minister of State's Government in 2020 and even outlined a solution prepared by Mr. Kevin Duffy, barrister and former chairman of the Labour Court.  SIPTU also warned the Government about its concerns but it was ignored as well.  The Government has refused to act and it has now been issued with a letter of formal notice under Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p> <p>As I said, this came about because SIPTU felt there was no other option but to make a complaint to the Commission because the Government had refused to act.  My colleague, Denis Sheridan, from SIPTU had been in contact with the Minister of State's Department on a number of occasions and got nothing positive back when he highlighted these issues.  Indeed, I have to highlight the Minister of State's own statement of just three months ago, in March of this year when, in a written reply to a parliamentary question, he stated, "My Department are satisfied that the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Act, 1996 as amended fully and correctly transposes Directive 2009/38/EC into national law."<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like the Minister of State to explain that statement.  To be frank, the dogs in the street knew the way the Government had transposed this law was not correct.  This is something that has been highlighted for years and years.  I believe it also highlights a political bias in the Department the Minister of State represents in terms of workers' rights.  Anything that even touches the idea of collective bargaining is resisted on every occasion.</p><p>The good news is that at last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, BEERG outlined once again the proposals from Mr. Kevin Duffy, which are very straightforward.  This group believes the appropriate model of legislation should be based on the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006.  As the Minister of State knows, this Act provides that where a dispute arises it is first referred to the Workplace Relations Commission for mediation.  If mediation is not successful the dispute is then referred to the Labour Court for a recommendation and, if the recommendation fails to solve the dispute, either party can ask the court for a binding determination.  The Minister of State has a roadmap to fix this, which was highlighted by the enterprise committee's meeting just last week.  This approach is seen as fitting with the well-established Irish model of industrial relations, namely, direct talks between the parties followed by mediation and, if necessary, followed by the involvement of the Labour Court.</p><p>I have some simple questions for the Minister of State.  Will he explain that statement he made in March?  What is now the response from this Government?  What will it do now?  Will this Government act to amend the legislation or is Ireland set to face massive fines from the European Union? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to provide an update on the position regarding a letter of formal notice that was adopted by the European Commission on 19 May 2022.  The case concerns European works councils and the transposition of the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Act 1996.  The 1996 Act provides for the establishment of a European works council, or other mechanisms, in community-scale undertakings and community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees.  Community-scale undertakings are large multinationals with at least 1,000 employees across the member states and at least 150 employees in each of at least two member states.</p> <p>The complaint alleges that rights under EU Directive 2009/38/EC cannot be effectively enforced in Ireland.  It suggests a lack of access to justice for special negotiating bodies and European works councils, and the absence of certain dispute resolution mechanisms concerning exercise of these rights.  My Department is engaging with the European Commission on foot of the complaint alleging nonconformity of Irish legislation with the directive.  Department officials have also sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General and will engage further with the European Commission once this advice has been received.</p></speech>

In effect, he has no answer for me, which is extraordinary in circumstances where this has been highlighted for years by SIPTU.  I will again reference Mr. Denis Sheridan, my colleague from SIPTU, who stated, "As a consequence of the inadequate transposition of the Directive, the new Irish law made it attractive for multi-national companies to move their legal base to Ireland, in order to avoid meeting their obligations under EU law."  The point is this issue is being watched all over Europe.  The enterprise committee meeting last week had a huge audience of trade unionists and employers' groups watching to see when the Government will actually take action.  From the answer the Minister of State has been handed to read out today, it is very clear the Department still has nothing to say.</p> <p>I will give the Minister of State one final opportunity.  Will he please explain his reply in March when he, in effect, said there is nothing to see here and there is no problem with how we have transposed this directive?  The Minister of State is wrong.  The EU Commission has clearly said he is wrong.  He should at least own up to that and tell us what he will do. </p></speech>

The Department's involvement with the EU Commission is a process and that is exactly what I have updated the House on.</p> <p>To be very clear again, the Department's position is that the provisions of the 1996 Act, as amended, meet the requirements of the directive.

However, we will engage with the European Union, as we do.  Departmental officials will continue to engage with the European Commission on this matter.  Should any amendments to the procedures be deemed necessary as a result of this engagement, they will be effected as quickly as possible.  That is the process we are involved in.</p> <p>We will respond to the Commission by 15 July.  The Senator asked me for a timeline.  That is the timeline and legal process we are involved in.  It is as far as I can go today.  Naturally, after our initial response to the Commission, if there are further questions or issues to be addressed, we will also do that and we will engage in a satisfactory manner.  That is the process we are involved in and it is important we see it out.  </p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  As he knows, 22 August will be the 100th anniversary of the death of General Michael Collins.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste will address the annual B&eacute;al na Bl&aacute;th commemoration on Sunday, 21 August, as a sign of reconciliation in this decade of centenaries.  It is perhaps reflective of the new reality of politics in this country in the context of a coalition Government involving the two great rivals.  As the Minister of State will also know, the monument to Daniel O'Connell, the great liberator, was erected in 1880.  He was famous for his role in Catholic emancipation and as a pacifist.  It is extraordinary even with that passage of time we still have no national monument in Dublin to General Michael Collins or, indeed, to many other of the great heroes of our War of Independence, whether they are Cathal Brugha, Countess Markievicz, William T. Cosgrave or &Eacute;amon de Valera.  There is no reflection and commemoration in Dublin, our capital city, to these great heroes of our independence.</p> <p>It is now timely after 100 years and at this point in the decade of commemorations to change that.  We should not be ashamed of our past.  We should remember it.  Young people, in particular, should be able to remember and know what has happened in this country and in our past.  Monuments and statues should not be divisive.  They should be reflective of our history.  This issue was raised yesterday in the D&aacute;il by my colleague, Deputy Phelan.  The Taoiseach did not give a particularly informative answer on whether there are plans for a statue to General Collins.  It is beholden on us now, as part of this decade of commemorations, that this be looked at seriously and plans put in place for it.  The Minister of State might give answers in the context of his responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  Is it his job or responsibility to commission a statue or monument?  Is it something he can take upon himself or does it have to be agreed by Cabinet or the Taoiseach's office?  Who has to give the go-ahead for something like this to be initiated?</p> <p>So many school tours come to this Chamber and to the D&aacute;il, they visit the Gallery in Leinster House, and they attend the National Gallery of Ireland or the National Library of Ireland.  It would be a major addition for all those school tours that come to these buildings, as well as for active retirement groups and other visitors, that there would be a series of monuments or statues to the heroes I have identified as part of our struggle for independence in the general vicinity of Leinster House, whether it be Merrion Square or outside Government Buildings.  General Collins was our first Minister for Finance.  A monument in the general area of these buildings would be a fitting tribute for the benefit of all those who visit our capital city.  It would be a sign of maturity regarding a changing Ireland in that we would finally accept that we have put the divisions in our country behind us, while reflecting on those people who fought for and achieved our independence.  We see monuments to their heroes in every other country that has gained independence around the world.  Quite rightly, we have seen monuments to Queen Victoria removed from Leinster House, but we have not got monuments to those who replaced her and struggled to get independence from the crown.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply regarding plans that he or the Government may have for fitting tributes.</p></speech>

The Office of Public Works undertakes the acquisition of paintings, sculpture and drawings on behalf of the Department of the Taoiseach.  To the Senator's first point, there are no plans at present for any additional sculptures, monuments or anything of that nature for anybody associated with the War of Independence or the Civil War because we have to await instruction from the Department of the Taoiseach.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2316"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The OPW commences the acquisition process at the request of the Department of the Taoiseach and initiates management of the art project, be it a painted portrait or a sculpture, when this request has been received.</p><p>Since the foundation of the State, the OPW has been involved in managing portraits on behalf of successive Governments.  There are several existing representations of Michael Collins in State ownership, including the iconic three-quarter-length portrait painted by renowned artist Leo Whelan in the entrance hall to Leinster House.  It is on display in a prominent location and is on view to all members of the public.  There is another representation of Michael Collins on view in the environs of Leinster House.  His portrait accompanies those of Arthur Griffith and Kevin O'Higgins on the base of the cenotaph, a tall Wicklow granite obelisk that is located centrally on Leinster Lawn.  The cenotaph, which was completed in 1950, was designed by OPW architects Raymond McGrath and Frederick Du Berry.  The three portraits on its base were created by sculptor Laurence Campbell.</p><p>The OPW has been actively involved in marking the decade of centenaries across the many heritage properties it manages.  Commemoration ceremonies, exhibitions, public tours, seminars and lectures and a wide variety of events have been held in Dublin and throughout the country at OPW-managed locations.  I can advise the Senator that I have written to the Department of the Taoiseach earlier this year regarding a national monument to commemorate Michael Collins, a matter that was raised at an OPW-facilitated venue in Woodfield in County Cork where the diaries of Michael Collins were presented to the National Archives by the Collins family.  This matter was raised then and has been raised continually.  It has been raised with us by community groups, Members of the Oireachtas, Ministers and others, but, unfortunately, I have no news about whether this project will proceed.</p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and I represent our respective parties on the all-party committee on commemorations that advised the expert working group.  This matter was discussed by that committee.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and I are of the view that three people who, in the early days of the State, were either leaders of the provisional Government or the national Government after the treaty and who lost their lives in quick succession - Arthur Griffith, Cathal Brugha and Michael Collins - all deserve to be commemorated.  The Senator is right.  Michael Collins is commemorated in the context of his role as Minister for Finance in the form of a coin has been issued by the Central Bank.  He will be commemorated in the context of his role as a post office clerk in the form of a stamp that is due to be issued at a later date.  I know of nowhere in world - the democratic world certainly - where the leader of a democratic nation who was assassinated is not the subject of a national commemoration.  That happens in all democratic countries across the world.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, it is my view that it should happen here.</p></speech>

I was not at the event in Woodfield.  I know from media reports it was suggested that a statue would be commissioned.  Did the Taoiseach give a commitment on that day that a statue should be commissioned or that he would look into the matter?  According to the Minister of State, the Taoiseach has not requested that the Minister of State look into this matter and commission a statue.  Is the Minister of State saying that the OPW would be quite happy to commission sculptures, monuments or other pieces of work to commemorate General Collins, Cathal Brugha, Arthur Griffith and others if the Department of the Taoiseach were to make a request that this be done?  The Minister of State said he wrote to the Department of the Taoiseach and there was no reply.  Has he even received an acknowledgment of that letter to the Department of the Taoiseach.  Is it his intention to follow up on the Taoiseach's plans?</p></speech>

It is my intention to follow it up because we are inundated with requests from community groups.  In some cases, community groups even volunteer to gift us statues.  As the State organisation that looks after commemorative events and sites, we cannot take statues.  There is a process and protocol that must be gone through because otherwise it would be at the whim of the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW to put up everything and anything across the country.  There must be a process.  Michael Collins was a democratically elected head of State and Government.  In my estimation, he must be commemorated.  That will either happen in the short or medium term, but I believe it will happen.</p> <p>Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan from the Cork South-West constituency raised the issue on behalf of his constituents and said this issue needs to brought to national prominence and that it is not appropriate for community groups for do it.  The advisory group gave advice on the decade of centenaries, but it is ultimately up to the Government to govern.  In my estimation, the first democratic head of Government has still not been properly commemorated.  This must be rectified.</p></speech>

Even before the war in Ukraine and the pressure this is placing on energy provision, there was a need to address demand-side pressure on our power supply.  The previous Government's policy to make Ireland the data centre capital of the world is coming home to roost.  Only yesterday, the D&aacute;il debated the rushed legislation to allow for &euro;400 million of temporary gas-powered generation.  The Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, of which I am a member, did not have an opportunity to do pre-legislative scrutiny on this legislation.  Instead we are being asked to fast track approval for the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to facilitate this gas-powered generation in order to keep the lights on over the winter.  It seems that there is no such urgency to produce a demand-side response strategy, however.  Months ago, the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action heard from the Demand Response Association of Ireland how the Department is yet to have a single meeting with stakeholders to even discuss the new strategy.  This is unbelievable.  The climate action plan has an ambition of 20% to 30% demand flexibility by 2030.  Demand-side reduction turns energy users into virtual power plants by allowing users to adjust energy consumption during times of high stress on the grid.  Through reducing electricity consumption, it has the same effect as increasing generation but without the need for additional expensive carbon-intensive infrastructure.</p> <p>Previously seen as an emergency response to prevent blackouts, demand-side reduction in a modern electricity system will actually assist our transition to 80% renewables by 2030.  Not only that, it can also help the public to become active participants in the decarbonisation process and to benefit from it.  Across the water, the British grid is going to pay households to use less electricity at peak times.  Households with smart meters will be able to choose to cut energy use when supplies are high and to financially benefit from doing so by receiving a credit on their bills.  As a grid spokesperson said, "demand shifting has the potential to save consumers money, reduce carbon emissions and offer greater flexibility on the system".  Opening that demand shifting to households means that it will not just be the big companies that benefit from this.  It will also facilitates more flexibility on the grid, which means cheaper power for everybody.</p> <p>When will the CRU bring forward the new demand-side reduction strategy and will that strategy include households?  Big business is what has led to the pressures on the grid, therefore, it should not be the case that only big business benefits from demand-side strategies.</p></speech>

The climate action plan sets out a road map to cut Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030 and to reach net zero emissions by 2050.  Decarbonising Ireland's electricity system will play a vital role in this transition and, therefore, the Government has agreed a more ambitious commitment to increase the proportion of renewable electricity to up to 80% by 2030.  Renewable electricity will also support the decarbonisation of other sectors such as transport and heat. Using renewable electricity to power vehicles and heat homes and offices is an essential step to a zero-carbon future.  The climate action plan recognises the need for a range of supporting measures to enable the transformation of the electricity sector.  This will involve the development of a balanced portfolio of technologies to facilitate the energy transition, including storage and demand-side response to support a grid with increased levels of renewable electricity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Demand-side response involves users of electricity reducing their usage from their normal or current consumption patterns when required.  It is an increasingly important element of the management of electricity networks worldwide.  Successfully lowering electricity demand ultimately avoids the cost and inconvenience of building new generators and transmission lines.  Managing demand by changing the time electricity is used can allow greater use of renewable power and considerable savings to households and businesses.  Demand-side management is currently used by EirGrid in managing the power system efficiently.</p><p>Action 100 of the 2021 climate action plan requires the energy regulator, the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to deliver an electricity demand-side strategy by the end of this year, following public consultation.  This demand-side strategy will aim to have industrial, commercial and residential demand fully participating in supporting system needs with high levels of renewable generation, and seek to facilitate active participation by consumers and communities in the energy market.  Key stakeholders will be EirGrid, ESB Networks and a variety of market participants.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will also take a keen interest in the development of the strategy.  The strategy will be expected to consider various demand-side management techniques, including energy efficiency measures and demand response measures.</p><p>Under the national smart metering programme, new electricity meters, systems and processes are being implemented by ESB Networks to provide energy users with improved and more accessible information that will help them better understand and manage their energy consumption, and will enable higher renewable electricity by encouraging flexible demand.  Smart meters will give access to new tariffs and services and support participation in the transition to a carbon-neutral economy and society.</p><p>ESB Networks is currently working on the delivery of a new strategy, the National Network, Local Connections programme, which is designed to reinforce the electricity network to ensure it is fit for purpose to underpin a thriving economy.  Central to the work is a commitment to ensure citizens and communities are empowered to access the grid like more commercial players.  Empowering consumers to be participants in the energy transition will take many forms, including supporting them to generate and export excess electricity to the grid as well as to join groups active in the system such as through microgrid initiatives or demand-side management groups.</p><p>The unprecedented crisis in European energy, sparked by Russia&rsquo;s indefensible war on Ukraine, has underscored the urgent need to expedite the energy transition and to ensure Europe capitalises on its renewable resources.  This not only means finding ways to bring more renewables online but facilitating an agile and dynamic electricity grid that can respond to challenges in supply and demand, with demand-side responses playing an ever-critical role.</p></speech>

It is disappointing that the Minister of State did not acknowledge the fact that EirGrid's generating capacity statement, which came well before the war, stated that all new demand between now and 2030 would be from data centres.  We are living out the consequences of Fine Gael's failed policy.  I welcome that residential premises are proposed to be included but I do not hear the same urgency on this as there is with the gas-fired power generation we are rushing through.  This is a way of doing the same job and making sure the lights stay on but without having to build very expensive infrastructure, which is carbon intensive and continues to produce carbon emissions.  We need more urgency on this.  The end of the year is too late, especially if a public consultation is required on the back of that.</p></speech>

It is an increasingly important element of the management of electricity networks worldwide.  It can also provide significant benefits for customers through reduced bills and gives them greater control over the energy they use and produce.  Action 100 of the 2021 climate action plan sets out a specific task for the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities to publish and implement a new demand-side strategy.  This involves the publication of a consultation on a 2030 electricity demand-side strategy in the third quarter of this year, which is not very far away, and the publication of a demand-side strategy in the fourth quarter.  The Senator is saying that is some time away but we will have progress on this matter in the third quarter, which we are now heading into, with the publication of the demand-side strategy in the fourth quarter.</p></speech>

My request is very simple.  I ask that all people who are immunocompromised receive the second Covid-19 booster vaccine without delay.  I cannot understand why this is not happening.  We are told there is no shortage of vaccines.  Clearly, it would make sense to vaccinate the most vulnerable in society.  Someone with type 1 diabetes is in the same cohort as someone with type 2 diabetes.  We all know that type 1 diabetes is much more challenging and has a much bigger health risk than type 2.  Type 2 diabetes is more often than not brought on as a result of lifestyle whereas type 1 is something people are born with.  It is not appropriate that they would both be in the one cohort.  We want all of these people to be vaccinated but there is a delay, which is not acceptable.  I would like to know why that is.</p> <p>We also need a new and revised information campaign on vaccines in general.  There is a little slippage in this area.  People are a bit careless about getting their booster shots.  We need a renewed information campaign about the benefits of the Covid-19 booster vaccine.  Covid has not gone away.  The Minister of State knows that.  We all know it.  There are still people getting sick from Covid and there are people in hospital and intensive care as a result of Covid.  Clearly there is a benefit to the vaccine.  We saw that during the recent Omicron wave.  The numbers of people hospitalised were way down even though the numbers that tested positive for Covid were way up.  The number of people in intensive care was significantly down in spite of the fact that the virus was rampant throughout the community.  That was because 97% of the Irish people were vaccinated.  Vaccines work.  They will not prevent people from getting Covid but they will prevent them from getting very sick when they get it, in a lot of cases.  That is not true in all cases but it is in a lot of them.  There are immunocompromised people waiting to be called to get their second booster shot.  That is not acceptable.  Some have got it from their GPs but many have not.  If they look for it, they are told it is not their turn yet.  There is something seriously wrong here.  I do not know who is to blame, whether the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, the Minister, the Department or the HSE.  Can somebody please explain the logic of not vaccinating with a second booster shot people who are immunocompromised?  It is very simple.  This just does not make sense.</p> <p>There has been a lot of talk of long Covid.  There is a huge body of work to be done on people who are still suffering from long Covid.  We are hearing a lot of talking about it but we are not seeing too much walking or delivery.  That is an issue for another day but I thought I would raise it while I had the opportunity.  I hope the Minister of State will have some positive news for the people who are most vulnerable in our society, who need to get a second booster shot in order to protect their health and ensure they do not get sick or lose their lives from Covid.</p></speech>

Ireland's Covid-19 vaccination programme is based on the principles of safety, effectiveness and fairness and has the objective of reducing severe illness, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 infection.  The vaccination programme is underpinned by independent expert clinical advice provided by the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC.  NIAC makes recommendations on vaccination policy to the Department of Health based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in respect of immunisation.  This approach has resulted in a high degree of public confidence in the programme, which has contributed to the high levels of uptake in both the primary and booster programmes.  More than 96% of adults have now received primary vaccination and in excess of 76% have been administered an initial booster dose.</p> <p>On 5 April, NIAC recommended that a second booster dose be offered to all persons aged 65 years and older and persons aged 12 years and older with immunocompromise associated with a suboptimal response to vaccination.  In making its recommendations, NIAC highlighted that breakthrough infections in those vaccinated and boosted are generally mild and of short duration while in older persons and those with certain specific conditions infection can lead to severe illness and hospitalisation.  Following its recommendations, NIAC develops guidance which is contained in the immunisation guidelines for Ireland, which can be viewed online.  These guidelines are continually updated and outline conditions that inhibit a sufficient response to vaccination including certain cancers, chronic kidney disease and the recent receipt of an organ transplant.  Diabetes is one of a number of conditions associated with immunocompromise but not associated with a suboptimal response to vaccination.  Persons in this group are considered at higher risk than the general population and have been offered both a primary vaccination regimen and an initial booster dose.</p> <p>I emphasise that the Covid-19 vaccines have proven to be remarkably effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalisation and death.  Those who are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated continue to be disproportionately affected.  I take this opportunity to urge anyone for whom an initial booster dose of vaccine has been recommended and anyone yet to receive their primary course to come forward and avail of the protection that primary vaccination and an initial booster dose affords. </p> <p>I have asked NIAC to continue to actively examine the evidence regarding the likely benefit of a second booster to other groups.  NIAC will continue to examine emerging evidence regarding booster vaccination for others in the population where there is evidence of waning immunity and reduced effectiveness and will make further recommendations, if required.  I accept what the Senator has said in calling for everyone who is immunocompromised to be included but the guidelines so far have been specific to people who are severely or moderately immunocompromised.  I also accept the point the Senator makes with regard to people with diabetes and the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  NIAC is continuously monitoring this matter and it will make further recommendations, if required.</p></speech>

I would give NIAC nine out of ten rather than ten out of ten because it was slow off the mark in coming out with recommendations before Christmas of last year.  It is just slow in making recommendations.  The dogs in the street know what is ultimately going to happen and yet recommendations take forever to come out.  It can be very frustrating.  Will the Minister of State or his officials go back to NIAC on this specific issue and ask it to decouple type 1 diabetes from type 2 diabetes because there is a significant difference between the two?  Type 1 diabetics are often on pumps that have to be monitored 24-7.  They are in constant risk of having a diabetic attack.  If that is not a case for getting a second booster, I do not know what is.  If nothing else comes out of this Commencement matter, I hope type 1 and type 2 diabetes can be decoupled.  If NIAC was to allow those with type 1 diabetes a second booster shot, I would have achieved something.</p></speech>

I want to highlight the ongoing lack of swimming pools, or even of a swimming pool, in my constituency of Dublin Fingal and the long-standing frustration of the communities and towns in the constituency at that lack.  I know the Minister of State is in charge of the Central Statistics Office.  It can be seen from the latest census figures on population released last week that the population of Dublin Fingal has grown by 12% since 2016.  We now have more than 170,000 citizens living in Dublin Fingal but no swimming pool.</p> <p>By way of comparison, the county of Leitrim has a population of 35,000 and has two swimming pools.  I do not begrudge the people of Leitrim their two swimming pools but we have none.  There is no public pool for the large towns of Skerries, Balbriggan, Lusk, Rush, Donabate and Swords.  There are tens of thousands of people living in these villages but they have no pool.  Nearly three years ago, it was promised that a pool would be built in Balbriggan alongside a relatively new housing development called Castlelands but it never materialised.  In Skerries, planning permission was granted for a swimming pool on council land at the ballast pit in 2000.  Despite this, there is no swimming pool and the planning permission has now lapsed.  I really encourage the Minister of State's Department to revisit this.  The local councillors, including Councillor Tom O'Leary of my own party, have been working hard with the council locally to try to get the issue back on the agenda.  </p> <p>A local group, the North Fingal Pool Campaign, was established a number of years ago.  Genuinely month in and month out, it has been calling for a public swimming pool in north Fingal to serve the towns of Balbriggan, Balrothery, Balscadden, Skerries, Lusk and Rush and the tens of thousands who live in those towns who have no access to a pool.  It is high time that the families and communities of north Fingal were able to avail of a local swimming pool.</p> <p>As Minister of State with responsibility for sport, I do not have to tell Deputy Chambers that Swim Ireland tells us that swimming is in the top three sports that girls and women say that they want to participate in.  More than 290,000 people swim at least once a week in Ireland.  It is the most popular activity among older adults.  There are also health and social benefits.  One of the biggest barriers is access to a pool.  </p> <p>To be fair, we in Fingal are extremely fortunate to have some of the most beautiful beaches in Ireland, which a great many people use.  Even more have been using them over recent years because of the Covid pandemic.  However, the sea is not always an option for people who wish to swim, particularly in the winter months.  You cannot run water aerobics for older adults and, in many cases, it is not safe for our children.  Notwithstanding any inaction over recent years, I want to make the case that the best time to do something is now.  I ask for the support of the Minister of State and his Department and for them to work with Fingal County Council to ensure we get access to a swimming pool.  </p> <p>Ireland's first pop-up pool was launched in Donabate Portrane Community and Leisure Centre a number of weeks ago.  It is a fully heated pool in a structured marquee that can accommodate 16 children at a time.  It has been greatly oversubscribed.  It is really popular and welcome but we do not want a pop-up pool.  We want our own state-of-the-art full-length swimming pool where the communities of Dublin Fingal can enjoy access to a local amenity week in and week out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Will the Minister of State's Department give us its view on the possibility of constructing a modular swimming pool?  I am informed they can built for just under &euro;1 million, as opposed to the &euro;25 million that would be needed.  This is probably the problem with Fingal County Council.  Despite the fact it is one of the wealthiest and has the largest income of any county council in the country, I appreciate that &euro;25 million is lot of money.  I want to know the Minister of State's opinion on modular swimming pools that can be built for &euro;1 million.  I could suggest a funding breakdown of 50:50 between the State and the local authorities.  That would make it much more accessible and easy to deliver.  Instead of looking for one, we might look for one for every town.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming here this morning.  I look forward to working with his Department to try to deliver a much-needed and long-awaited swimming pool for the people for Dublin Fingal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#G00200"><p>I thank Senator Doherty for raising this important matter.  At the outset, I want to reiterate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing the necessary sports facilities right across the country.  If we are to achieve our ambitious targets for sports participation, we need the necessary facilities and equipment.  Our commitment in this regard was demonstrated in recent months when we announced &euro;150 million in allocations under the sports capital and equipment programme, which was by far the highest level of funding ever provided under the programme.</p> <p>On swimming pools specifically, as the Senator will be aware, the provision of such public facilities is primarily a matter for the relevant local authority in the first instance.  My Department, however, provides capital support for such facilities, as the Senator mentioned.  In this regard, my Department's capital funding for new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools was previously provided through the local authority swimming pool programme, LASPP.  A total of 52 pools have been completed, and three swimming pool projects at Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry remain in the programme, with the Lucan project nearing completion.  My Department's capital support for any new swimming pools is now being provided through the large-scale sports infrastructure fund, LSSIF.  The national development plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100 million for the fund over the period to 2027.</p> <p>The first call for proposals under the LSSIF closed in 2019 with applications confined to local authorities and national governing bodies, NGBs, of sport.  All applications were assessed in accordance with the evaluation procedures.  It was announced in January 2020.  Thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals.  These initial allocations include funding for eight swimming pool projects.  It should be noted that Fingal County Council did not submit any application for a pool project under this call.</p> <p>The priority in the short term is to advance all of these projects, including the swimming pools, to construction stage.  In relation to any future requests for capital support for swimming pools, my Department is currently undertaking a review of progress on all existing grants.  As part of this review, my Department is also considering the timing of any new call for proposals.  The review work is at an advanced stage and it is expected to be finalised shortly.  It will, of course, be a matter for Fingal County Council to decide on its priorities if and when a new call for LSSIF proposals issues.  </p> <p>More generally, the national sports policy commits to the development of a national swimming strategy.  As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be met.  Furthermore, the sports action plan, which was published in November 2021, contains an action to develop and implement this strategy to provide additional swimming opportunities, both indoors and outdoors.  Initial preparatory work has been undertaken in respect of this strategy and invitations have issued from my Department in respect of membership of a working group, which will be tasked with the detailed work of preparing the strategy, with a view to its completion and publication later this year.  The outcome of these will be considered when deciding on the future funding provision for swimming pools, including any in the Dublin Fingal area.</p> <p>As someone who was a councillor of Fingal County Council before being elected to the D&aacute;il, I am very aware of the democratic necessity of an increased swimming pool infrastructure.  That is why, as part of the national swimming strategy, we are looking at that infrastructure piece.  I know that Swim Ireland has ideas.  The pop-up pool is one example.  There are also interim infrastructure solutions that could arise.  The Senator mentioned a modular build of a pool, which, as part of the national swimming strategy, will form part of new of infrastructural solutions that we will have to move on to fill the gap.</p> <p>As the Senator referenced, if one looks at the existing capital allocations, many of them cost up to &euro;20 million.  One cannot put a &euro;20 million swimming pool everywhere.  It is, therefore, important to find new solutions to deliver the participation benefits for all ages.  As the Senator referenced, swimming is the second most popular sport, with up to half a million people swimming per week.  It is important that we meet that demand from a water safety perspective as well.  We are open, as part of the swimming strategy, to finding new solutions to deliver new infrastructure in communities.  We will be engaging actively on this in the coming months.</p></speech>

It is bizarre that we have the Government commitments.  The strategy is there and the money is there.  There is the figure of &euro;100 million up to 2027.  The Minister of State corrected me.  I said it was the third most popular sport, but it is the second most popular sport.  I have the largest constituency and yet we do not even have an application by Fingal County Council for my area.  There is something wrong.  This is certainly not the will of the people or of the organisations and the local groups that have established themselves to fight for this.  It is certainly not for the lack of it being raised by the local county councillors in my part of Dublin Fingal in Fingal County Council.  There is something amiss.</p> <p>I will tell the Minister of State what I know, which is that 170,000 people deserve to have access to a sports facility for second-largest and most-enjoyed sport in the country.  With the Minister of State&rsquo;s and his Department&rsquo;s help and with the swimming strategy, I hope we can co-operate and work together to get the modular builds built fast.  It is not a &euro;25 million structure, such as those we see in other towns and villages.  Right now, we have nothing.  We need something and we need it fast.</p> <p>I ask for the Minister of State&rsquo;s support and for someone in his Department to make contact with the relevant director of services in Fingal County Council to see how we can bring forward the modular programme.  Certainly, Fingal County Council can afford &euro;1 million.  Obviously, any access to funding would be welcome.  I ask the Minister of State for a commitment that somebody in his Department will work with us to see if we can advance the delivery of not just one modular pool, but a number of modular pools for Dublin Fingal.</p></speech>

That is the trialling of the new concept of delivery around transportable pools.  A modular pool is a scaled-up version of that and a more permanent fixture.  As a coastal community in Fingal, it is important to have access to swimming pool infrastructure.  I take the Senator&rsquo;s point on that.  That is why in the next six months, by year-end, we will have the swimming strategy published.  That will, as a key component, look at the infrastructural opportunities and the modular components which are happening right across the world and which we need to embrace in Ireland.  As part of that, there will be opportunities to identify the deficits geographically and how we can provide new infrastructure.  Then we will try to negotiate a budget line to achieve that.</p> <p>I appreciate the feedback the Senator has given on the necessity to deliver for a community that currently has that infrastructure gap.  We are keen to address many of those issues as part of the national swimming strategy.  There are new and exciting opportunities to deliver quickly to communities when it comes to swimming pool infrastructure in terms of the new modular pools, with much more affordable opportunities within communities.  That is something the group will be working on in the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>

As we know, these are very important schemes throughout our country that play a very important role within communities by providing amenities and they are a very important part of the fabric of many communities.  There are currently 19,000 participants in CE, 5,000 in T&uacute;s and just under 3,000 in the rural social scheme and the investment by the Government this year will amount to &euro;500 million.  The changes announced include the removal of the six-year limit for all participants in the rural social scheme, the eligibility of T&uacute;s being extended to persons in receipt of a disability payment, new flexibility to allow CE schemes to recruit eligible candidates directly to fill 30% of places, Intreo to increase significantly the number of referrals to CE, with schemes required to offer places to at least 60% of candidates referred, a new pilot scheme to extend eligibility to qualified adults to be developed, and a continuation to allow schemes to extend individual placements and retain existing participants in cases where no replacement candidates have been selected.</p><p>These schemes play a vital role in local services such as childcare, meals on wheels, the maintenance and upkeep of local amenities and graveyards, the extension of footpaths and the building or rebuilding of walls, so they do a lot of great work throughout the country.  The strength of the economy at present and the high level of employment have presented challenges to the schemes in regard to getting participants, and Ministers and the wider Government have listened to the concerns of supervisors regarding the need to provide and enact changes to increase the number of participants.  I have received much engagement and correspondence from people in places such as Maam and Clonbur where there are difficulties getting participants, so these changes are welcome.</p><p>I also welcome the opening of the <i>ex-gratia</i>payment for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors, which is a good initiative.  They had a long-fought battle, going back to the Labour Court recommendation of 2008, and I welcome the Government's decision to provide a gratuity payment.  Nevertheless, RSS and T&uacute;s supervisors have queried whether they might be eligible for a similar gratuity in the near future.  Of course, they do not yet have a Labour Court recommendation but I hope the Government can engage with them.  Perhaps the Deputy Leader could contact the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, in regard to the eligibility of RSS and T&uacute;s supervisors for future schemes.  Yesterday I raised a similar issue in the context of home help.  Travel costs for participants are problematic at the moment, not least given the price of fuels and the increasing burden on participants.</p></speech>

As Senator Kyne mentioned, these schemes are important for parishes, Tidy Town groups and groups that provide services for older people, social services and disability services.  They play a major role, so it is important that the Government continue to invest in them.  In excess of &euro;500 million is being spent on them annually.  The news is welcome.</p><p>I will now turn to a hardy annual.  Senator Hackett, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, knows what I am going to mention.  We are already starting to speak about flooding along the River Shannon again, particularly along the callows.  It is not that the areas are becoming flooded.  Rather, most of the farmlands there are in the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, under which farmers cannot cut meadows until 1 July.  Land has become particularly wet, and even though the level of rainfall so far has been below the summer average, the persistent rain over recent days has led many people to grow concerned.  There is good co-operation with the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is monitoring the situation, but it is important that the weir gates be kept open.  I understand that most of them are, which will allow the water to flow towards Limerick without causing any damage along the way.  It is important for the farmers that we not let their lands flood.  They are involved in GLAS and cannot cut their meadows before 1 July.  If the current weather continues &ndash; the forecast does not look god &ndash; then there could be some difficulties.  We must stay focused on this matter and remember that these farmers need fodder this year in particular.</p></speech>

I just wish that we would have treated the supervisors much better.  These people do an amazing job in local communities, but we have treated them badly.</p> <p>The part-time Minister for Defence has agreed to place the Defence Forces at the disposal of a private company at Dublin Airport.  If Supermac's or McDonald's was stuck for staff tomorrow morning, would we put the Defence Forces in with them as well?  What is happening is becoming a pain.  Today, I read that we were likely to lose another ship because of crew shortages.  Engineers are walking out.  The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces has been sitting around for more than five months.  Why did we put the commission together if we were not going to listen to its recommendations?  How much work is involved in following through on them?  We have bought two new ships but are about to lose one.  We are the only country in the EU that does not have a dedicated Minister for Defence.  It is tiresome that we are dealing with a part-timer who spends most of his time elsewhere in the world and not in this country.  It is just not on.  The fact of the matter, with respect-----</p></speech>

What the general public does not realise &ndash; the Deputy Leader does because she has been at the coalface &ndash; is that putting people on standby means that they are not going on leave and must instead be available.  In the middle of the holiday season, soldiers and their families go on holidays too.  In order to meet the commitment at Dublin Airport, we will be drawing troops from Cork, Limerick, Galway, Kilkenny, Dundalk and possibly Donegal.  They will need to be accommodated in the very barracks that the Minister for Transport wants to sell off and use for social housing.</p> <p>I want to see the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces being progressed.  A tiny number of its recommendations dealt with pay.  Those could have been implemented with the stroke of a pen the moment the report was published, but they have not been.  We have lost more than 200 people since then.  I understand that we are about to lose another 40 from the Naval Service.  If that happens, we will be in dire straits.  We have to look after Europe's largest exclusive economic zone in the Atlantic Ocean, but we are now down to possibly three ships.  It is a joke and it needs to stop.

I estimate that approximately 100 women from the local area gathered to hear from Edenderry woman Mary McHugh, also known as "Mary Menopause", who has been telling her story to anyone who will listen about her menopause, which hit her prematurely approximately ten years ago.  She described menopause powerfully as depleting women of all the hormones that made us natural.  She went on to describe the debilitating symptoms that she had experienced for years without treatment.  There was an outpouring of support and similar stories from the other women in the room, each with her own account of the difficulties associated with menopause, from the headaches and aches and pains to the low mood and anxiety, from the loss of libido to hot flushes and night sweats, and from the brain fog to the heavy irregular periods, all of which make life pretty unbearable.  For some of the women, these difficulties lasted for more than a decade.  That is no way to live.  Women have stopped working because of menopause symptoms.  Women in their 40s have had their working lives cut short.  Menopause affects 50% of our population, yet many are suffering in silence.</p> <p>Many of my senatorial colleagues have addressed the need for a better and more holistic approach to menopause care.  There have been calls on the HSE to implement a public awareness campaign for women who are in the dark about the changes through which their bodies will go.  While December marked an important milestone for menopause care with the opening of the first of four publicly funded specialist menopause clinics, we need the rest rolled out as quickly as possible.  Access to specialised advice and proper treatment is essential.  Women need to know that they are not alone.  This is why everyone in the room last Monday was grateful to Mary McHugh for her courage and her relentless determination to rectify this situation.  She is a true champion, and I thank her.</p> <p>Heavy irregular periods can affect women throughout their lives, but particularly during menopause.  If a woman is caught out, she loses and her period wins.  It is as simple as that.  That is why access to period products is crucial.  The Government rolled out a period poverty pilot programme this year, which will make available a range of free period products in nine colleges across six education and training boards.  Twenty-six local authorities have partnered with the Department of Health to deliver period poverty mitigation measures this year.  Offaly County Council has launched an initiative on period poverty following a motion last year by Councillor Clare Claffey, the council's sole female councillor.  I want to see period products rolled out in all public buildings, something that I will be pushing my Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to do.  Female farmers can find themselves caught out too.</p> <p>A F&oacute;rsa survey found that 70% of women had taken time off work because of their periods.  As such, the argument for menstrual- and menopause-friendly policies in the workplace is a strong one.  Recently, Spain became the first European country to consider a legal right to menstrual leave.  The facts are clear.  In the 21st century, it is time that menstruation and menopause came out of the dark and we put in place proper measures that deal effectively with the challenges they bring and give women their lives back.</p></speech>

There has been no pre-legislative scrutiny of these amendments and no notes as to why they are being produced.  It is not the way we should be doing business.</p><p>Tomorrow morning at 9.30 a.m. we will be discussing amendments that have nothing whatsoever to do with the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill.  Members of the House should be given some information on the justification for those amendments to the planning Act.  We saw what happened when amendments on forestry were put forward in respect of the Bill to end mink farming.  The consequences were that many in the environmental sector were not given the time or opportunity to raise the issues of concern they had regarding forestry.  It also delayed the mink farming legislation going through.  It is not a good way to do business.</p><p>However, I wish to raise the latest <i>Daft.ie </i>report which shows that after two years in office the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, appears to have utterly failed to address the affordable housing crisis.  The <i>Daft.ie</i>housing report shows that 19 counties now have double-digit inflation and across the State house prices have increased by 9.5%.  Monday marked the second anniversary of the Minister's appointment and not a single statistic is going in the right direction.  House prices and rents are up, while the amount of rental accommodation available is down.  Homelessness has returned to pre-pandemic levels and child homelessness has increased by 40%.  This will have profound long-term consequences for those children.  The Minister has to accept that events have now surpassed his Housing for All plan.  Budget 2023 has to be the opportunity to show that he is prepared to change direction, and he must seize that opportunity.</p><p>All Members know from talking to constituents that the inability to access affordable accommodation, be it rental or purchase, is driving our young people off the island.  It is an incredible situation whereby we have young, talented people who feel they have no option but to emigrate.  It is not because they want to or they cannot find employment, but because they cannot access that most fundamental right which is the right to a roof over one's head.  This is a tragedy.  It is not just a tragedy for the young people who are leaving against their will, it is also a tragedy for their families and society as a whole.  Across the country we are seeing services crumbling and employers calling out huge staff shortages, yet young people cannot take up those jobs because the pay will not allow them to have a living here and they cannot afford to access accommodation.</p></speech>

On Friday, I put in a query on behalf of somebody whose house is being sold and who is about to be made homeless.  The person cannot find anything for under &euro;1,500 per month.  I inquired whether the revised HAP figures that the Minister had indicated at a social housing conference three years previously had been communicated to local authorities and I was told the local authority had not received any communication.</p> <p>It is unfortunate that the Minister is making announcements without informing local authorities, and that people who are about to be evicted and made homeless have not been communicated with and do not know the level of HAP allowance to which they are entitled.  This is a single person, so the person is inquiring whether it will be merged with the couple's rate, which is what was indicated.</p> <p>There are also people on homeless HAP.  We wrote to the Minister on the back of that, but I also ask the Deputy Leader of the House to write to the Minister and ask him to communicate to local authorities what the available HAP rates are and to ensure that they are more reflective of the market.</p> <p>Second, I wish to raise autism places in Dublin 8.  Today, the Labour Party introduced a Private Members' Bill on the autism strategy.  I was speaking to some of the people in Dublin 12 who have been advocating for special autism classes.  There are 17 primary schools in Dublin 12 and 11 of them either have an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, class or an early intervention class.  There are six primary schools in Dublin 8 with no autism classes.  There are eight secondary schools in the area and four of them have no autism classes.  The Dublin 12 group is asking that, essentially, Dublin 12 be used as an exemplar and that every school would have an autism class for people who need special education and people with additional needs.  I ask the Deputy Leader of the House to speak to the Minister to see if Dublin 12 can be used as an exemplar.  Most of the schools there are willing to put classes in place, but they need the support and resources of the Department to be able to open them.</p></speech>

A lot of the time we can use poor women to kick cans down the road, so I encourage the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, to focus on issues such as housing and childcare as well, and perhaps speak to the poor women who are living in poverty.  That could be a very good starting point.</p> <p>I will move on to a very important issue.  In Ireland in 2022, Traveller children in secondary schools are being given primary school work.  These are children of 15 and 16 years of age.  They have the best of academic skills, emotional skills, reading and writing skills and so forth, yet they are being given crosswords and colouring pages.  Some people might want to laugh at that but I, as a member of the Traveller community, find it extremely sad that we are still living in an Ireland where this is acceptable behaviour.  First, I want to know who is held responsible.  None of us knows.  No Member of the House knows who is held responsible for the failure of Traveller education.  I call for the Minister to come to the House not for a Commencement matter but for a discussion on Traveller education with all Members and to let us know who is held accountable.</p> <p>I could not say that these children are being treated unequally in our society if I could not stand by it.  Two years ago today, I stood in this Chamber for the first time as a Member of this House and I spoke about the inequalities that are happening in the Traveller community.  Two years later, I know that those young Traveller children could go on to be doctors, nurses, barristers, solicitors, Deputies or local politicians.  There is what we have to do as a society and in our education system.  Not all teachers are bad, but there is a minority of teachers who will just give the Traveller child the colouring-in work at the age of 16 years.  As a young Traveller woman said, she will be leaving school anyway because she is 16 years old and she will not have to face the shame of getting this type of work at 16 years of age.</p> <p>Our children are being stereotyped whereby the men will go off and work with their fathers and the women will go off and get married.  This is not true for the majority of members of the Traveller community.  I am asking teachers to stop stereotyping our children and to support them to be better than even they believe themselves to be.  I strongly encourage that in our education system.  It is 2022.  I want a better life for my two children and for the days of children being put to the back of the class to colour in pictures to be over.</p> <p>I would appreciate if the Deputy Leader would organise an emergency debate on Traveller education because this is an emergency issue.</p></speech>

I welcome the reforms announced today by the Minister with regard to the community employment, CE, scheme, the T&uacute;s scheme and the rural social scheme.  Being immersed in our local communities, we all know the work experience given to the men and women in our local communities - there are 27,000 - is absolutely powerful.  We see the enhancement of the public realm, and many community and sporting facilities are enriched by participation in these schemes.</p> <p>The announcement by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is very important.  The six-year term limit is removed, eligibility for T&uacute;s is extended and there is flexibility to allow schemes to hire and recruit directly.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The application process for the <i>ex-gratia</i>payment for ex-community employment supervisors is now open.  That is tremendous news by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and her Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien.  I ask that both of them are invited here to discuss these schemes that play a huge role in communities.<br/><br/>Yesterday, during the Order of Business, I raised the issue of members of the Defence Forces being asked to be on stand-by.  In terms of what has been announced by the Government, the members of the Defence Forces are on stand-by.  I challenge Members of this House to listen to the remarks made this morning by Mr. Mark Keane, president of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA.  He made a good point and I support his call for clarity.<br/><br/>We should also support and congratulate the hard-working staff in Dublin Airport, Shannon Airport, Ireland West Airport Knock and other airports who do tremendous work in a very stressful and challenging period.  It is wrong for Members to come in here and say that we have a part-time Minister for Defence, and they should be corrected, when we actually have the Minister of State, Deputy Jack Chambers, and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, in the Department.  They are not part-time Ministers and I made the point that they are not part-time Ministers.  In the context of the comments made by Mr. Mark Keane, the Government and the Dublin Airport Authority must clarify the role envisaged for PDFORRA.<br/><br/>Last night, I saw Mr. Dalton Philips on &quot;Prime Time&quot; who made points about terms and conditions.  As clarity is required, and just like yesterday when I requested the Minister for Transport to come in here, I now request that the Minister for Defence comes in here to explain and give us clarity on the points in question.</p></speech>

To be fair to the DAA and all of the staff in Dublin Airport, they are victims of their own success.  The bounce back has been incredibly quick and large so there are challenges, which are clearly visible in terms of queueing, parking, etc.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer and I are members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  Last night, the committee held a public meeting at which both Senator Buttimer and I were in attendance.  The committee was told that the earliest there will be a metro to Dublin Airport will be somewhere between the window of 2030 to 2034.  Therefore, we will continue to have problems with parking and accessibility in general until that time.</p> <p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la has ruled that Dublin Airport cannot go beyond 32 million passengers.  That figure was breached in 2019 and it is likely the figure will be breached this year but if not this year then next year.  I would like the Deputy Leader to arrange a discussion, and ideally with the Minister for Transport.  Let us remember that every single Minister for Transport since Noel Dempsey has been Dublin-based, including Deputies Leo Varadkar and Paschal Donohoe, and Shane Ross.</p> <p>For the sake of all passengers, Dublin Airport needs attention and focus in terms of its security and management.  I welcome the fact that members of the Defence Forces are going to be available but they should not be taken for granted.  The public has huge faith in the involvement of the Defence Forces and their availability, which I would like to see happen.  I would also like us to discuss the future of Dublin Airport in terms of its next phase.  If Dublin Airport has already hit a limit of 32 million passengers then we need to think about where we go next because aviation is part of what we, as an island nation, do very well.  For example, Irish people lead some of the largest aviation organisations in the world such as British Airways and Qantas Airways Limited, and Mr. Willie Walsh is director general of the International Air Transport Association, IATA.  We must have a debate on the future of Dublin Airport, its future capacity and expansion, whether we need a third terminal, etc.</p> <p>The DAA has proposed that passenger charges be increased by 80% and the Commission for Aviation Regulation is due to deliver its deliberation by the end of June, which is tomorrow.  I think that asking passengers to pay 80% more to Dublin Airport at a time when it is clearly not delivering is something that the public is not ready for and, therefore, we need an urgent debate.</p></speech>

I extend a very warm welcome to them and hope they have a good day here.  Of course I am referring to Councillor Joe Kelly and his wife.</p> <p>Today, the audiovisual room was packed as we had a delegation from the Social, Economic Environmental Forestry Association of Ireland, SEEFA.  The event was particularly interesting because we again heard, which is a fact that we have heard since the Government targets for forestry were set, that the planting and harvesting targets are not being met.  All forestry targets are verified by a dashboard of indicators, which is issued by the Department.  We are off target and that is disappointing.  Everyone on all sides of the House who spoke at the event talked about how disappointed they are with the targets not being reached.  I am not in the blame game but we still must address the issue.  We must increase our ambitious national targets, which the Government has set in the programme, and everyone who attended, including me, supports that idea.</p> <p>There seems to be a big difference between how we treat forestry in the private sector, which is represented by SEEFA, and Coillte forestry.  Clearly, the indicators differ which begs the question and I ask for a debate.  Senator Hackett is the Minister of State who has overall responsibility for forestry and perhaps she could facilitate a debate when possible.  We must get back on target and deliver because we are not doing so.  I want us to address the issue of the inconsistency between the Coillte figures versus those of the private sector.  It seems that Coillte performs better.  Some people have suggested that Coillte has received favourable treatment and I do not suggest that but the private sector wants a fair chance.</p> <p>I fully concur with Senator Flynn's excellent contribution about educational opportunities for Travellers.  Indeed, there should be educational opportunities for everybody because we know that when people are given good educational opportunities early, and there are early interventions, then we excel, which is no different for the Traveller community.  I support her call for a debate on education for Travellers in this House.</p></speech>

I commend her on her powerful and important speech on the subject.  She has been a great advocate for the rights of Travellers and, indeed, for oppressed and abused minorities everywhere for which she deserves to be praised.</p> <p>As the Cathaoirleach commented, yesterday was the anniversary of the start of the Civil War, which is probably one of the saddest days in Irish history when erstwhile friends divided and took up arms against each other, and that great unity of purpose, which had existed during the War of Independence, was fractured.  Fortunately, the Civil War did not last very long.  I think that was because the participants on both sides did not want to fight.</p> <p>It is important to note that the losing side, and I would be a descendent of some of those people, very quickly realised the futility of continued violence, and very quickly adopted the democratic path.  They achieved an awful lot through the process in Leinster House under de Valera, Lemass and so on.  It was a pity at the time that a very small minority could not see their way to go with them as that gave rise to the continued violence by disillusioned or delusional people who thought that they could shoot and bomb their way to a united Ireland.  It gave rise to the 30 years of mayhem and murder that was carried out by Sinn F&eacute;in-PIRA in the North.  Thankfully, the violence has come to an end thanks to the Good Friday Agreement and Sinn F&eacute;in is now in the democratic system.  While I do not agree with any of the Sinn F&eacute;in policies I welcome that development.</p> <p>There is a good news story about the Four Courts.  The archives of the Four Courts have been refurbished, saved and recorded in digital fashion for future students.  That fantastic work involved meticulous attention to detail as tiny scraps of charred paper were the only clues to where to find further information.  Everybody thought that the archives that were burned in the Four Courts were gone forever and, thankfully, that is not the case.  The people who worked on the archival project, especially those from Trinity College, deserve the highest praise.</p></speech>

I particularly welcome the &euro;2.5 million for Irish Rail to support studies on the development of a rail freight system connecting Ireland's busiest seaports and establishing transfer points for freight between rail and road.  As the Deputy Leader will know, Ballina is the only rail freight railway station in the country.  I have no doubt that this report will help build other train stations that will actively support rail freight between railway stations and seaports.  Our home town of Castlebar is an ideal place for a rail freight town.  It is the capital and county town of Mayo.  Baxter Healthcare and Meissner, as well as other industries are located there.  They would use rail freight if it was there.  I was talking to someone from Cunningham Transport, which is on the railway line recently.  I have no doubt it would use rail freight if we had it in Castlebar.  We also have the ideally-placed KOG logistics, which is one of the most modern logistics plants in the country.  It would actively use rail freight if it was available.  I welcome this report.  We should have a debate on rail freight and passenger freight and the extension of the rail line from Athenry to Claremorris.  It is because of that that it was pointed out to us that Ballina is the only rail freight station in the country.  It would be an ideal opportunity for this debate, particularly in light of the &euro;2.5 million that has been made available to Irish Rail to carry out this study.</p></speech>

It is vital.  On my behalf and that of Senator Flynn, I welcome the new mayor of Waterford, Joe Kelly, and his wife, to the House.  They are very welcome.</p> <p>I congratulate the organisers of last Saturday's Pride parade.  Is always so beautiful and exciting to see thousands of people marching together, celebrating the wonderful and great diversity, creativity and resilience of Irish LGBT people.  I also salute all my colleagues who attended the march to show their support.  We are very fortunate to live in a country where the vast majority of political figures are empathetic supporters of LGBT people.  When we look at the profoundly toxic discourse around transgender people and their rights in the US or UK we can see the damage the normalisation of bigotry can cause.  Is not enough to use respectful language and fly rainbow flags on State buildings every June.  If we are to be real allies of transgender people, we need to provide them with the access to healthcare that they need in order to thrive.  The HSE service plan for 2022 commits to developing capacity to meet its obligations under the national LGBTQI+ inclusion strategy 2019-21.  That inclusion strategy committed the State to the recruitment of the specialist healthcare and support staff necessary for the provision of gender-affirming care.  Despite this commitment, the national gender service has huge wait times that leave many transgender people waiting years to be provided with care.  This wait can cause a lot of anguish.  Some individuals self-medicate with hormones purchased online.  Others are forced to crowdfund for gender-affirming surgery on social media and travel to medical tourism destinations like Poland to access the services they need in a timely manner.  This failure to provide adequate levels of care is depriving transgender people of the dignity and equal treatment they are entitled to.</p> <p>Another issue that impedes transgender people's access to healthcare is the fact that the national gender service uses an outdated model of care.  This means that people seeking care are subject to invasive questioning about their sex lives and other intimate matters.  This is not in keeping with international best practice guidelines set out by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, WPATH, which seek to de-pathologise transgender identity.  Being trans or gay is a normal part of human diversity.  People should not feel stigmatised or violated when seeking care.  Adoption of the WPATH guidelines is part of the programme for Government.  That is wonderful but we need to make sure this commitment is brought to fruition as soon as possible.</p> <p>Trans people in Ireland face a stark choice between an interminable wait at home or a daunting journey abroad to get the care they need.  We need to take action to ensure Ireland's commitment to transgender equality is reflected in deeds, not just words.  I ask the Minister for Health to come to this House to brief us on the work being done to build capacity in this area to meet the Government's commitments.</p></speech>

These schemes have been beneficial for so many people and communities.  I also welcome the mayor, Councillor Joe Kelly, and his wife to the House.</p> <p>I raised a few weeks ago the fact that Caherconlish in Limerick was losing its post office due to the retirement of Kitty Hickey.  I wish her well in her retirement.  There was welcome news this morning that a new contractor has been announced for the post office.  That is most welcome.</p> <p>Some colleagues highlighted the issues at Dublin Airport.  They are looking for a debate with either the Minister for Transport or the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.  It should be a wider debate on how to better utilise our airports.  We have so many regional airports, including in Shannon, Knock and Cork.  We need a debate on how to create a counterbalance between Dublin and the rest of the airports.  It is not good that 87% of all flights go from one airport.  There has to be balanced regional development in utilising our airports.  There is a need for a wider debate.  That said, I realise that the issues at Dublin Airport are very serious.</p> <p>Senator Black raised the Pride march.  The Limerick Pride march will proceed on 9 July.  Any colleagues who would like to come and join in the parade would be more than welcome.  We will have a big turnout there as well.</p></speech>

I extend a warm welcome to the mayor Joe Kelly and his wife.  It is great to see them here.</p><p>Something very significant happened in Limerick City and County Council last week.  The following motion was put to the council:</p> <blockquote> 	This council calls on the Government and the Minister for Housing to declare a housing emergency and to use emergency powers to introduce an immediate moratorium on evictions, similar to that during Covid, to be reviewed after three months; and that the Minister increase the income threshold limits for social housing supports during this time. </blockquote> <p>The motion was introduced by my colleague, Councillor Sharon Benson, and supported by my other colleague, Councillor Tom Collopy.  I am glad to say it received unanimous support.  Councillors from Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and all parties signed up to that motion, which has since been distributed to authorities throughout the State.  It is highly significant that councillors in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are now recognising what Sinn F&eacute;in has been saying for years, which is that we have a housing emergency and carrying on the same old fashion simply is not good enough.  I wonder whether Senators in this Chamber would have the courage to stand up and stand with their colleagues in Limerick City and County Council in acknowledging that we need a moratorium now.  There is a deluge of eviction notices in Limerick.  I am sure it is no different across the State.</p><p>These are political choices.  That is what we are talking about.  Every day the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage refuses to raise the income threshold, which is a ridiculous &euro;30,000 in Limerick, and every day he continues to ignore the report that has been on his desk since December is a political choice that only compounds the homelessness issue across our State.  We need an urgent debate on housing.  We need the Minister to finally wake up and raise those income thresholds now, before the summer recess.  Too many people are excluded.  People earning &euro;35,000 or &euro;40,000, which are average incomes, have no support from the State.  They are basically told they cannot even join a list for housing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a disgrace and one that sits firmly at the feet of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.

We need a debate on the fishing industry, particularly around the issue of licensing, upgrading of equipment and so on.  The fishing industry has such potential in this country that is untapped.  Clearly, it needs much greater Government support.  I would appreciate it if we had that debate at some stage.  We could all learn a lot from it and it would certainly inform the Government.</p> <p>On housing, I agree with Senator Gavan regarding the income levels to qualify for HAP and social housing.  We have a situation in County Clare where the upper limit for a family, a husband and wife with two children, is &euro;28,000.  It is completely unrealistic to have the income limit at that level in today's world.  I have also dealt with a number of people from abroad who have been living in Ireland for a significant period but whose names may be associated with a property in a place such as Poland.  In effect, the property is worthless but they are automatically excluded from social housing or HAP simply because their name is associated with a property in Poland.  We need to look at that again because these people are working in this country, their lives are here and their children are going to school in this country.  Yet we have a situation where, since their names happen to be associated with properties, they are completely excluded from the social housing infrastructure.  In some cases, they may not be able to take their names off the properties because they could be part of a family structure.  That is something that needs to be looked at.</p> <p>I welcome the various pre-budget briefings that are taking place today and have taken place over the past number of days.  Certainly, family carers were in Buswells Hotel, as were members of the Society of St. Vincent St. Paul.  The presentations they give are quite stark.  The cost of living is impacting on many people in a devastating way.  The budget process has to begin earlier.  I would like to see the budget happen in September, as opposed to October in order that interventions can happen earlier. </p></speech>

When the American Supreme Court ruled last Friday in the Dobbs <i>v</i>. Jackson case, overturning Roe <i>v</i>. Wade and related court decisions, I thought of a famous campaign slogan from American politics in the 1980s: &quot;It's morning again in America.&quot;  Following the darkness of almost 50 years of federally mandated abortion, which resulted in 60 million dead, it will now be possible for American states to enact laws that, it is to be hoped, will protect the lives of unborn children and their mothers.  I also thought it was significant that on a weekend where many people sincerely marched to express support for inclusion and diversity that perhaps the American Supreme Court had taken the greatest step in that direction.</p><p>There are three lessons for us in Ireland.  One concerns the debate about human rights.  Abortion unsettles a society and the debate on it is never over.  Sooner or later, the communitarian human rights vision of including everybody will prevail over an individual choice ethic.  That is certainly my hope.  The second lesson relates to the media.  The narrative in Irish media over the weekend was amazing.  There was hardly any interest in hearing the views of pro-life people as to how this American decision might change Ireland or whether it would lead to reduced numbers of abortions.  It was all presented in terms of fear and negativity.  I remember Congressman Richard Neal referring to America's &quot;noisy democracy&quot; when we met him in the Chamber a few weeks ago but it strikes me that for all its ills, when we look at the spectrum of media in America, from Fox News on one side to CNN on the other, it may not be pretty and may sometimes be very ugly but at least there is diversity.  That is perhaps part of the story.  We could do some with some greater media diversity in Ireland.  My final point is this.  Can we ever hope to arrive at some consensus in this country?  Could we, for example, think about the fact that while we may have different views of Roe <i>v</i>. Wade or the legality of abortion, we can again get to the idea that abortions are at least regrettable and we should work together to reduce the numbers of abortions as much as possible?  That would just be a first step for me.  I recognise it would be the end of the journey for others but I ask that we at least restart that conversation because it has been lost in Ireland in recent times. </p></speech>

These were groups of people who work with Galway Rural Development under rural social schemes, T&uacute;s and community employment schemes.  Many of our public representatives were also present.  We know all our community heroes.  They work in towns on all these schemes and doing so many projects.  They work with our town teams, Tidy Towns and the GAA, as well as on sports pitches and with charities.  In my local area, they were painting walls and making towns look well.  These groups and the people who work in them give so much.  I thank them, including Galway Rural Development, Roscommon LEADER and all the groups in all our towns.</p><p>The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, has made some serious reforms to these programmes.  Throughout the country, there are 19,000 people on CE schemes, nearly 5,000 in T&uacute;s and just under 3,000 on the rural social scheme.  This investment will amount to more than &euro;500 million in 2022.  What are the changes?  The six-year time limit for RSS has been removed, which was one of the big asks at that last meeting.  The eligibility for T&uacute;s has been extended.  We are seeing much more flexibility allowing the schemes to recruit directly because it is a major challenge that so many people are back at work now.  We have one of the highest levels of people who are back at work but the challenge is there is probably a smaller pool to pull from.  These schemes will now be able to recruit and advertise directly for people in the local area to work with them.  A new pilot scheme for qualified adults will be explored and an <i>ex-gratia </i>payment for CE supervisors is being looked at, which is very welcome.</p><p>This builds on changes the Minister has already made through the Department of Rural and Community Development for people who are on CE and RSS schemes.  If they are aged over 60, they can stay on these schemes until retirement.  These changes mean so much, especially in our local areas in Galway.  The challenge is that our local authority is the second lowest funded, but it also means that so many of these groups support local authorities to develop and deliver projects.  It happens in so many local authorities throughout the county.  I welcome those funds today. </p></speech>

Senator Kyne welcomed today's announcement from the Department of Social Protection and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, of significant reforms to CE, T&uacute;s and RSS schemes.  These reforms also were welcomed by Senators Murphy, Buttimer, Maria Byrne and Dolan.  There is widespread support for those changes.  As many Members pointed out, there are in excess of 25,000 people across all three schemes.  They employ a significant number of people in our communities throughout the country.  The removal of the six-year limit is probably one of the biggest reforms.  That was quite an arbitrary cut-off for many people who had come to rely on working under those schemes.  The communities relied on those people and the experience they had built up.  It was a shame people who had built up that experience were lost from those schemes.  I certainly welcome those reforms, in addition to the changes to CE schemes in respect of the gratuity payments.</p> <p>Senator Kyne raised the issue of increased travel costs for many people participating in those schemes and has asked that it is kept under review.  Senator Murphy welcomed the changes to CE, T&uacute;s and RSS and spoke about the concern and fear regarding flooding along the River Shannon.  While acknowledging we are not currently in a flood scenario, he said we needed to be mindful that it is something we will have to deal with in the very near future.  It is an issue Senator Murphy has been raising for many years now as a Member of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the ongoing situation at Dublin Airport, as did other Members.  His contribution focused predominantly on the issues with the Defence Forces.  I concur with many of the Senator's remarks.  The manner in which it was announced that the Dublin Airport Authority would potentially get the assistance of the Defence Forces was somewhat lacking in respect for its members.  It was only a short while ago we were told that such assistance would not be necessary.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The chief executive of the Dublin Airport Authority said it is a standby situation but Senator Craughwell rightly pointed out that those people serving in and with experience in the Defence Forces know that being on standby means they need to be in the country and they need to be ready to go.  It means there is probably going to be a limit on those personnel taking annual leave.  We have yet to get clarity on that and I know PDFORRA and RACO are looking for clarity.  It is a regrettable situation that we find ourselves in, not just for Defence Forces members but for those staff working at the airport, who are clearly under a lot of pressure, and, very importantly, for those passengers going through in either direction, who are trying to deal with what looked like chaotic scenes at the airport in terms of baggage being lost, bins not being emptied and people missing flights.  It is very regrettable.</p><p>In the interests of fairness, it is fair to point out that international airports in other countries are experiencing similar difficulties.  This is stemming from the reduction of staff during the pandemic and then trying to scale back up.  It just not happening at the rate it needs to happen at.  We are not alone as a country in dealing with this, but we still have to deal with the issues here domestically because it is damaging Ireland's reputation internationally.</p><p>The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, spoke this morning on the issues around menopause and has called for a more holistic approach to how we deal with menopause, on which we will all agree.  There have been many debates in both Houses and among the public around menopause.  Senator Hackett welcomed that we now have the first menopause clinic open in the country with many more supports to come, which are long overdue.</p><p>Senator Boylan spoke about the circular economy Bill and amendments to the planning Act.  A note was circulated around the need for those amendments, which are to provide for the Environmental Protection Agency to license certain activities to make sure they are in line with its activities.  We will get an note sent to the Senator if that was not sent on.  I take on board her point about pre-legislative scrutiny not happening on those particular amendments.  The amendments are in the public interest.  We will send a note to the Senator on that.</p><p>I take on board the Senator&rsquo;s comments with regard to the Daft report on affordable housing.  It is important to say that we have record investment in housing and &euro;4 billion is being put behind housing policy in this country.  We have never seen that scale of investment.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has been doing a very good job in terms of turning the numbers in the right direction.  Commencements are up and more homes are being built, which is an important figure.  It is also fair to acknowledge that in his very short time as Minister, and he has only been there two years, we have had construction close down for periods because of the pandemic, we have had difficulties in getting things back up and running and, now, because of supply chain issues flowing from that but also the war in Ukraine, there are a lot of pressures impacting on the cost of materials and labour as well.  It has not been an easy time to be the Minister with responsibility for housing yet we are seeing more homes coming on stream.  We have also seen an opening of the shared home equity scheme, which will benefit many couples, families and individuals trying to buy their first home, to bridge that gap in terms of what they can borrow and the cost of purchasing their first home.  That has been broadly welcomed.  There is a lot happening in terms of providing affordable and social housing and assisting people to get on the property ladder.  To be fair to all sides, it is fair to acknowledge it has not been an easy two years for anybody to be in that brief, considering a pandemic and a war in Europe as well.</p><p>Senator Moynihan spoke about the increase in the HAP figures and asked whether local authorities have been informed.  I have been informed by the Minister's office that the statutory instrument is being signed tomorrow and the new regulations will then be sent to all local authorities after that, and the new HAP limits will come into play on 11 July.  That information will be sent to local authorities following the signature of the statutory instrument tomorrow.</p><p>Senator Moynihan also spoke about the issue of autism in regard to Dublin 8 and the lack of school places.  I know both the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, have been working very hard on this issue.  It would have been difficult to miss that conversation in the media in the last number of days and there is a lot of work ongoing.  Some schools are not providing places for children with additional needs and that needs to change.  The Government has been very clear that if schools do not do it willingly, they will be mandated to do it.  We are absolutely focused on making sure our education system is inclusive for all children.</p><p>That brings me on to the comments, the statement and the speech this morning by Senator Eileen Flynn around education for Traveller children.  I am disgusted that a child of 15 or 16 would be given something to colour in at the back of the classroom.  That is absolutely outrageous and should not happen.  Whatever school that is, and I do not have the details, the principal should be informed of that.  If that needs to be escalated to the Minister, then that should happen.  That should not be let go.  While we will not get into naming schools here in the Chamber, that should not be let slide and there should be consequences.</p></speech>

While I am sure it is only a small number, shame on any teacher who would do that, or that any child would be left at the back of the classroom and not treated the same as every other child in the school.</p> <p>I note the Senator has received support this morning for that debate and I have requested a debate at the earliest opportunity.  It is unlikely to happen before the summer recess as the schedule is so jammed for the next two and a half weeks, but we will come back to the Senator to get that debate organised as quickly as possible.  The Senator has had support this morning from Senators Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan, Victor Boyhan, Paul Gavan, Frances Black and many others who have supported that call.  We will try to get the debate as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer responded to the comments of Senator Craughwell.  We will leave that issue as it is and take on board the Senator's comments.  He also welcomed the community employment, CE, and T&uacute;s changes.</p> <p>Senator Gerry Horkan spoke about the Dublin Airport Authority.  He has requested a debate with the Minister for Transport around the future of Dublin Airport, its capacity and whether it has gone beyond what it was granted planning for.  Senator Maria Byrne also requested a debate on transport and airports in general.  That debate request has gone to the Minister and we are looking for a date.  We will likely have a debate on aviation in general for the country which can facilitate all members having their say.</p></speech>

We are at the mercy of Minister's office to try to get a date from him or from the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.  We will try to get that as early as possible.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan spoke this morning about the Social, Economic, Environmental Forestry Association of Ireland, SEEFA, and the briefing that was organised by Deputy Jackie Cahill this morning in the AV room.  There are ongoing issues with forestry.  We will certainly request a debate with our Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in the Chamber at the earliest opportunity.  Senator Boyhan is right that there are ongoing issues and this has been going on for a number of years, with particular difficulties in getting a licence to fell trees.  As licences have been given to people to plant, they have a reasonable expectation that they would be able to fell those trees at a certain point, given they have invested in doing that.  It is unfair to give a licence to go in and not come out, and that needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>Senator O'Sullivan acknowledged that yesterday marked 100 years since the beginning of the Civil War, which he was right to say was a very dark day in Irish history, and what came out of that.  He also welcomed the archives project at the Four Courts and commended those who have worked very hard to pull that together.</p> <p>Senator Paddy Burke welcomed the funding from the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, the EU fund around transport, in particular the &euro;2.5 million for Irish Rail.  He has specifically requested a debate on the reopening of the Athenry to Claremorris railway line - the western rail corridor - for freight purposes.</p> <p>Senator Black acknowledged the fantastic Pride parade that took place in Dublin and spoke specifically about the LGBTQI+ community and the inclusion strategy, and trans healthcare.  We will certainly request a debate with the Minister for Health.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne congratulated Kitty Hickey, who is retiring from the local post office, and she also alerted Members to the Pride march taking place in Limerick on 9 July.  She also requested that debate on transport and aviation, in particular in regard to Shannon Airport.</p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke this morning about the housing emergency that has been acknowledged by Limerick Council and he referred to those countermotions.  I have dealt with the housing issue in response to Senator Boylan.  There are issues with housing and we know that.  However, we have a Housing for All plan, we have record levels of investment, we have commencements going up and we have several schemes in place to try to assist people, in particular first-time buyers and first-start individuals and couples, so there is a lot of work ongoing.  We acknowledge there are particular difficulties in the rental market and we know that a lack of supply is the big issue.  With commencements going in the right direction, more homes are being built and coming on stream, and we are seeing affordable and cost-rental homes come on stream as well.  The Minister is doing a good job in that regard.  We also acknowledge that there are, of course, still challenges and we need to do more.  That is why we are putting record levels of funding behind the housing policy.</p> <p>Senator Conway spoke about the fishing industry and has requested a debate on that.  He also acknowledged and welcomed the pre-budget briefings we have all been facilitated to attend by different groups, in particular this morning by Family Carers Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which were in Buswells Hotel.  I attended both briefings.  I would agree with Senator Conway's remarks that some of the statistics and figures presented to us were stark.  When we look at Family Carers Ireland, for example, 69% of family carers say they are in financial distress and one quarter of family carers are cutting back on heating their homes and on food, so there are some very stark statistics.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I agree with what Family Carers Ireland said this morning, that is, that its asks are ambitious but not unreasonable.  I have no doubt but that Ministers with responsibility across all areas, in particular the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will look closely at those pre-budget submissions.<br/><br/>Senator Mullen spoke about Roe <i>v</i>. Wade.  It will not surprise him to hear that I take a different view from that expressed in his comments, although I respect his right to articulate those comments in this House.  He made points about the debate not being over and about the kind of media coverage we have here in comparison with that in the United States.  The debate is never over and there will always be conflicting views.  Yes, the media landscape in the US is diverse, but it is ugly, and the reports are very often not factually correct.  I am not sure we want to go down that road in respect of the media.  For the most part, our media do their very best to be balanced and fair.  Senator Mullen may disagree with me on that, but I think we have a better standard of reporting in this country than there is in the United States.<br/><br/>As for the Senator's final point about abortions being regrettable and the need to reduce their number, we both sat on the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which made some strong recommendations on trying to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies.  We have a long way to go yet to successfully implement those recommendations.  As a country, we have a long way to go to get rid of the stigma still attached to being a single parent, particularly for single mothers.  We know that single mothers are more likely to live in poverty and to drop below the poverty line, their children likewise.  We are still trying to implement and to roll out the recommendation to have free contraception for 17- to 25-year-olds.  There will be money in the upcoming budget to that end.  It is quite perverse to think that it is free to get an abortion but not free to get contraception.  It does not make sense.  Abortions are decisions that people do not take lightly.  Making abortion illegal does not stop abortions; it just drives them underground.  We know that from the evidence Senator Mullen and I heard at meetings of the committee.</p></speech>

We will not rehash the debate.  My point is that making abortion illegal does not stop abortions happening and that there is a reason we make them legal, namely, that it makes them safer and that we know that women need access to that care for a variety of reasons.  What we have not done in this country, however, is enough work to make the choice to go through with a crisis pregnancy a bit easier for some women who may feel they cannot do so because this country does not care for women properly in that regard as single parents are more likely to be in poverty, and then there is childcare, housing and so on.  We have consensus on that for the most part.  I am of the view that all sides could work together on that aspect, and we could have a better society for it.  For some reason we just do not seem to be getting to grips with that element.  In any event, I take on board the points Senator Mullen made.  I know that he articulates views that are shared by some members of our society.  I also know that this is not a consensus issue.</p> <p>Senator Dolan spoke about the meeting held in Raheen Woods, Galway, in advance of the announcements today on the RSS, T&uacute;s and CE.  She made the point that in all our communities they do vital work not just for the GAA clubs, parish councils and Tidy Towns but also for charities and many other organisations.  They are a valuable resource.  They do so much good work that just would not get done otherwise by local authorities.  They provide a great service.  The changes announced today will be greatly welcomed right across the board.</p></speech>

Standing Order 154 requires amendments on Committee Stage of a Bill to be relevant to the subject matter of the Bill.  Amendments which do not meet that requirement are ruled out of order by the Cathaoirleach.  In the case in question, I ruled the amendments out of order.  Amendments tabled on Committee Stage to the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022 are not relevant to the subject matter of the Bill but, according to the motion before the House, if the House agrees to set aside the requirement in respect of Government amendments for the purpose of Committee Stage of the Bill, that will clear way for the amendments to be moved.  It will, of course, be entirely up to the House to agree whether or not it should proceed with those amendments.  At my request, the review of the practice of the setting aside of Standing Orders to facilitate amendments which are not relevant to the subject matter of a Bill is to be considered by the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight.  Any changes recommended by the committee will be tabled before the House.</p> <p>I share Members' concerns about the tabling of amendments that are not relevant to the subject matter of the Bill.  The issue has grown during the term of this Seanad; it did not arise in previous Seanad.  Like the D&aacute;il, we believe that all elements of a Bill should receive scrutiny on all Stages and that loopholes such as this, which is the best way I can describe it, should be shut down.  That is my view because legislation is there to be scrutinised.  Mechanisms are being used to add what can often be quite big changes to other legislation.  Those loopholes need to be shut down.  They have been shut down in the D&aacute;il and it is to be hoped they will be shut down here.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State will be aware from the contribution made by my colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, the reason we have tabled the amendment is because legal experts have suggested that we may need a better definition of illness or injury.  I do not want to labour the point, but we are concerned that the definition needs to be right.  I ask the Minister of State for his own view on that.</p></speech>

I thank the Cathaoirleach for facilitating the debate.  The issue of the definition was discussed in both Houses on a number of occasions previously.  I understand the concerns that have been raised, and the Senator's amendment reflects those concerns.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, also raised the same concern.  In our view, the amendment is unnecessary.  The general rule is that where a term is not defined in legislation, the ordinary understanding of the term applies.  It is notable that the State illness benefit scheme does not have the term as defined, and this does not lead to any difficulty.  Generally, inserting a definition where none is normally used can lead to some uncertainty as to whether a different interpretation is intended.  The legal opinion around the legislative process and the bringing forward of new legislation is that definitions should not be used unnecessarily.  We think the amendment is not required.  Other legislation has followed a similar approach.  I hope the Senator accepts our disagreement on the amendment.</p></speech>

We welcome that.  However, I have included this amendment to discuss the length of time currently provided for in the Bill before a worker can qualify for sick pay, that is, 13 weeks' continuous service.</p><p>The Minister of State knows as well as I do that illness and sickness do not pay any heed to how long an employee has been with an employer.  I wish to raise the following point.  At a meeting of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Bruton, stated: </p> <blockquote> 	Sickness can strike anyone at any time, as we have seen during Covid.  It does not seem to me to have a foundation to say the right should be deferred for a period.  Probation is not about sickness; it is about reliability and other things.  If someone is sick and has produced a medical certificate to show that, I do not see how not offering it from the first day is justifiable. </blockquote> <p>It is not often that I say this, but Deputy Bruton is right.  He is spot on in relation to the point.</p><p>It is grossly unfair that a person who is sick does not qualify for sick pay because he or she is in the first 13 weeks of employment.  I am not suggesting that this was the intention when the Bill was drafted, but we have pointed out that it is unfair, and the Minister of State's own colleague, Deputy Bruton, has pointed out why it is unfair.</p><p>It seems to me that the workers' perspective has been missed in this particular aspect of the Bill.  It makes perfect sense to me that workers should qualify for sick pay from the first day of their employment.  As has been pointed out already, probation is an entirely different matter.  Sickness does not pay heed to the fact that an employee is in the first 13 weeks of service, and only strikes after that.  People can be unlucky.</p><p>The whole point of sick pay is to give people a backup, to ensure that they can be supported by their employers.  That is why this legislation is being brought in.  It makes sense to ensure that workers qualify for sick pay from the first day of their employment.  The current provision is unfair.  The good news is that the Minister of State has an opportunity to take this amendment on board.  It would fix that, and ensure that from day 1 employees will qualify for sick pay.  I hope the Minister of State takes the amendment on board.</p></speech>

I hear the points made by Senator Gavan.  To me, the idea of protecting both the employer and the employee is important.  I am asking the question in the context of <i>pro rata</i>sick pay.  I accept that an employee who works a certain number of days, weeks and months will build up entitlements and an indemnity in terms of cover.  To me, the bulwark of our social protection system is that we protect both the employer and the employee.  Casting my mind back to the days when I was a student, I was a porter in the hospital.  I am thinking of those who worked alongside me and reflecting on the experiences of those who work in sectors such as retail.</p><p>I recall that when I worked in the hospital, a colleague of mine was out sick for a long time.  However, they had the buttress of the support of the social welfare system.  The nature of work has changed now, particularly in the hospital system, where contract cleaners are used and different aspects of work are subcontracted out.  To me, the provision of sick pay is about supporting employees so that if they become ill, they are not worried or concerned about pay coming in to the house.  It is about putting a buttress around them.</p><p>I am perhaps discussing a matter relating to another section, and the Cathaoirleach may ask me speak to this section only, but I wish to raise another point that I made on Second Stage to the T&aacute;naiste.  It concerns the provision of the requirement to provide medical certificates, in respect of the cost involved in having to go to the doctor.</p><p>Under Part 2 of the Bill, the employee is entitled to up to and including three statutory sick leave days in a year.  I am saying this badly, but employees build up annual leave entitlement, whether it is 20 days' leave or 21 days' leave.  I am worried that we are getting the approach to sick leave entitlement wrong from day 1 of an employee's employment, if that is how Senator Gavan is reading it.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response to the amendment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a balance we must strike between the employer and employee.

In recent years we have seen how we do not have to be so black and white about things.  With regard to the trust issue, in recent years we have also seen that employees can be trusted to work, and to manage their work, remotely and that sometimes the fears are greater than the reality.  In saying that, it is all about finding balance.  I was struck that in a survey Iceland was described as having the best approach to sick leave.  In Iceland I  believe that each month, people work they are able to accrue a certain number of sick days.   Were various approaches examined when it came to the length of time?  Has it always been the view that people reach a certain date and then get the entitlement?</p></speech>

This boils down to how we distinguish illness from other entitlements such as holiday leave and other leave.  Illness is not something that workers invite upon themselves.  I listened to Senator Buttimer.  The vast majority of workers do not abuse sick pay provisions if they are provided in their workplace.  The key issue is trust.  We must understand that not every worker will be sick every year.  We saw in the regulatory impact assessment an estimate of costs.  This was based on an assumption that workers would be taking up their sick pay.  Workers will not be taking up their leave if they are not sick.  It must be available from day one when a worker is sick.</p> <p>A seasonal worker works for a number of months in a year and may not work again for more than 26 weeks.  Seasonal workers might work for three or four months over the summer and seven or eight months will pass before they take up employment again.  They will not be covered.  They will have to wait 13 weeks.  Workers need to be able to take up sick pay from day one.  We need to get rid of the 13-week wait period for an employee.  If people are sick, they are sick and they need to be covered by the Bill.</p></speech>

Others have also tabled amendments.  The Senator quoted what Deputy Bruton said on Committee Stage.  I participated in that debate and we had a good lengthy discussion on many amendments and the Bill.  It was a worthwhile discussion and we teased through the issues.  We introduced some changes on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il that deal with some of the concerns, including those raised by Senator Sherlock.  We have reflected them.</p> <p>To be very clear, we do not agree with these amendments and I will explain why.  They would confer the right to statutory sick leave on employees from the very outset of their employment.  Genuinely in our view it is difficult to see how this would be practical.  Many employment rights require a certain period of qualifying employment and we think this is appropriate in this case also.  The period of 13 weeks is a relatively period short to wait.  We recognise that sick pay is slightly different to other benefits.  We have already dealt comprehensively with the area of concern, which is the possibility that people on successive but non-continuous contracts might have to re-qualify for sick leave entitlements on a regular basis if laid off over the summer, such as in education or childcare-related jobs.  This would be a difficulty and it has been dealt with.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer touched on the issue of balance.  We are trying to get a balance to recognise that this is a new employment law.  It is a new statutory right and one of which we are all supportive.  We have been discussing it for several years.  We looked at quite a lot of countries.  I am trying to remember whether Iceland was among them.  I am sure we did because it is very much involved in many issues at European level.  I will check as to whether we specifically looked at Iceland but I think we did.  We spent a lot of time looking at international best practice trying to get this right and to have the entitlements at the right time.  We want to make sure we get the legislation passed and that it is responsive to the needs and that we are towards the top with regard to the offering from a European point of view.</p> <p>If these amendments were accepted if an employer in a shop or restaurant took on somebody for a few weeks in the summer would it be fair that an employee could end up needing ten days sick leave at the beginning and only work for a few weeks after that?  Is this fair on the employer?  We are trying to get the balance right because this is a cost to employers.  We also want to protect jobs.  An employer could genuinely take on somebody and the person could be genuinely sick for ten days and might work for no longer than a week or two after that.  We believe it is best that a relationship develops between the employer and employee.  We believe 13 weeks is fair.  It is not a very long length of time.  Other legislation provides for that relationship to be developed over six months or 12 months.  In this case we are providing for 13 weeks.  On balance and on reflection after plenty of debate in both Houses, we still think this is acceptable and we are refusing to accept these amendments.  I hope people understand.  This is about balance.  There is an issue of cost for employers.  It is recognised.  This is a public health measure.  It is to make sure people do not feel they have to go to work.  It is a major addition to employment law and we accept this.  It does come at great cost to employers.</p> <p>Senator Sherlock asked about the regulatory impact assessment and the cost analysis.  We are not in any way, shape or form assuming that people will automatically take the days but we have to look at the potential maximum impact if it did happen.  Those costs are assessed.  That is what we have to do in a regulatory impact analysis.  It is proper order.  It does not mean any of us has an assumption.  In fact, it is the opposite because we understand most people want to go to work and earn their full potential.  They would not take sick pay unnecessarily.</p> <p>To make sure there is proper oversight of the scheme certification is required.  This is also important and right and we will discuss it later.  We have to protect the system and protect the balance we are trying to achieve.  I hope Senators will accept that we believe 13 weeks is a reasonable timeframe for an employer and employee relationship to be developed before the sick pay legislation kicks in.</p></speech>

The difficulty I have is that if we put barriers in the way of workers qualifying for sick pay they will go to work sick.  If they go to work sick, they will make other people sick and that will impact the business in a detrimental way.  We have been through two horrendous years of Covid.  We now think we may not be out of it in the winter and it could be back again.  How would it make sense in the context of what we have just been through and what we may have to face again this winter to say to workers that in the first 13 weeks of work, they will not qualify for sick pay?  How does that make sense from the perspective of the employee or the employer?  Let us face it, and I know this from my time as a trade union official, when workers lose sick pay they go to work sick rather than not attend because they need the money.  It is as simple as that.  This is my concern.</p> <p>We support the Bill.  We do not believe the Government has the balance right and that three days is far too short an amount of time to give at the beginning.  Rather than fight the debate intensively again, let us agree that the balance needs to be struck in a way that is effective.  In the context of Covid, how does it make sense to tell workers that in the first three months of their employment, they do not qualify for sick pay?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In that context, if that person contracts Covid, what should he or she do?</p></speech>

Certainly, Covid is forced on our minds in the context of the Bill.  One of the first discussions I had when I became a Minister of State was on a Bill of this nature.  It has been recognised for a long number of years that Ireland does not have a statutory sick pay scheme.  Therefore, Covid or no Covid, it is an important move in the right direction.</p> <p>I compliment all those involved and those who brought forward Private Members' Bills, including Senator Sherlock, that focused our minds on this issue.  The T&aacute;naiste has been very clear from an early stage that this was something he wanted to make sure we achieved throughout the lifetime of the Government.  It is not just about Covid.  Covid proved the necessity of this legislation without a doubt.  There are arrangements in place whereby if someone has Covid, he or she is not encouraged to go to work.  Enhanced illness benefit was brought in to enable that because there was a concern at the start of the pandemic that people who were employed for many years in many jobs might feel they had no choice but to go to work because of costs.</p> <p>The Government is bringing in new legislation which provides new employment rights, which we believe will strengthen the employment right legislation overall.  It is a positive measure and will make Ireland a more attractive place for talent to come.  We also have to recognise that there is a huge cost involved in running a business, and labour costs are a massive part of that.  Employers are generally quite responsible.  The vast majority treat their staff extremely well.  Even without legislation, they have implemented their own schemes and other employee supports.  Generally, they do look after staff extremely well.  This legislation is to make sure that everyone, no matter what job a person is in, has the option of a statutory sick pay scheme.  </p> <p>It is important that an employer-employee relationship is developed over 13 weeks before the scheme kicks in.  I do not think that is unreasonable but the Senator clearly does, which is fine.  We have discussed this on a number of occasions before this debate.  The Government thinks it is important.  I have given a very simple example of something that could actually happen whereby the employer would be left with that cost, yet there would be no relationship with the employee if that happens now.</p> <p>I am conscious I am giving scenarios that would hopefully not happen but it could happen.  There is a big ask of employers.  I know the Senator does not necessarily understand that situation, but I do.  The Department has to get the balance right.  The Government wants to be able to sustain and create jobs and help small businesses to create jobs so that everybody benefits.  People who take up work, offer their skills and talents, and do the job should be properly remunerated for their work.  Having those jobs strengthens our position as a country to respond in many other ways, such as across health, education, public services and so on.  It is important that we recognise that.</p> <p>We cannot take jobs for granted either.  I often find that sometimes people do take jobs, as well as the business owners and employers, for granted.  We cannot do that.  There is a big ask in this legislation of them, but the Government wants to get the balance right.  I hope the Senator accepts that we will not be accepting his amendment, which would start the scheme on day one.</p></speech>

This amendment is important.  The reality in this State is we live in a low pay economy.  Close to one quarter of workers are on low pay.  On top of that we do not have the same basic State provision of GP visits and care as other European countries.  These matters make the Irish context very different in regard to medical certification for access to sick pay.  This is a very moderate amendment which simply asks for a report to look into this issue.  We need to do this because, for example, my son works in a minimum wage job at &euro;10.50 an hour.  His day's pay is &euro;84.  If he is sick he has to pay a GP &euro;60.  According to this Bill he will not even get the &euro;85 sick pay because sick pay is only at 70%.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The reality for all low-paid workers in this State who are on minimum wage is that if they are sick, they will end up with &euro;58 but have to pay &euro;60 to a GP.  In other words, the sick pay will not even cover the cost of visiting a GP.  That is another barrier.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill but the Minister of State has to get rid of the barriers.  He does not seem to have a full perspective on how this Bill as it is currently drawn up impacts on low-wage workers.  I have given him a concrete example in that regard and I ask him to acknowledge that under the Bill as it is currently constituted, the first day of sick pay amounts to zero.  That is just a fact.  The ask is for the Minister of State to consider this.</p><p>Under Sl&aacute;intecare, all parties are apparently committed to bringing about free GP care.  I ask him to please not go down the road of stating that many people have medical cards.  I have the threshold figures before me.  I know from the experience of my son that a low-paid worker on the minimum wage who works more than 30 hours a week, does not qualify for a GP visit card or a medical card, so I ask the Minister of State not to go down that road.  The issue is that, right now, many people who have to pay &euro;60 to a GP - it is more likely to be &euro;70 in Dublin these days - under the Bill as constituted will end up getting nothing for that day's pay.  Our ask is simple.  The Government needs to address the issue and make the Bill workable for low-paid workers.  It needs to remove the barriers.  I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 aim to alleviate the financial strain on lower-paid employees who do not benefit from having a medical card or a GP visit card.  However, while I understand the intent of the amendments, it is important that there are safeguards for employers.  With respect, the Senator referred to having a "full perspective".  I repeat that is the job I have to do, as a Minister of State, as it is the job of the T&aacute;naiste and the Department bringing forward the Bill.  We have to have a full perspective.  We are bringing in a new right and statutory entitlement.  All present are supportive of that and it is needed.  We must also recognise, however, that it must be a system that can work for everybody.  Certification is part of that because we have to make sure that everybody can have trust in the system.  Medical certification is part of that.  It is important that there are safeguards for employers and everybody else.  In my view and that of the Department, it is a reasonable requirement that an employee should provide a medical certificate.  It is a feature of this benefit that an employee must provide evidence of his or her illness.</p> <p>In general, people go to a doctor for more than one reason.  They do not just go for a medical certificate; they go because they are sick.  The Senator should bear that in mind.  I accept that there is a cost to visiting a GP and, in some cases, there is an issue with access to GPs.  That has been dealt with in different ways.  The House and the Government are committed to reducing GP fees and having universal access to healthcare.  We are on a journey to that but it is separate from this legislation.  The Bill relates to employment law.  The cost of GPs and access to GPs is a matter we are dealing with in different ways through the programme for Government.  We are committed to that and will do it, but it is separate from employment law.  I hope the Senator accepts that.</p> <p>We believe it is important to have a certification process in respect of this aspect of the Bill.  I accept that the Senator is seeking a report and things like that.  We will keep this under review.  That is what we always do with legislation.  We are bringing in this legislation that will benefit everybody who does not already benefit from a sick pay scheme in their workplace.  Anyone in employment, whether low paid or high paid, will be entitled to a statutory sick pay scheme going forward.  That is a massive addition to our offering and will assist to ensure people are looked after and do not feel they have to go to work when they are sick.  It will also make Ireland a more attractive place to grow talent and encourage people to live and work here.  I do not agree with the Deputy's repeated remarks in respect of a low-pay economy.  Ireland has the second highest minimum wage at European level.  I accept that when that is adjusted for the cost of living we are down to fourth or fifth.</p></speech>

A move towards a living wage is provided for in the programme for Government.  That will be a positive journey but, again, it is a cost that will affect the creation and protection of jobs.  We have to get that balance right, too.  It is important to recognise that, in the context of the minimum wage and a commitment to a living wage, we are in a good place in Ireland.  We need to focus on reducing the cost of living but that is not just the responsibility of employers.  Their job is to make sure they pay and look after staff well, create jobs in the first place and create a good working environment.  We, as a Government, along with all parties, have to work on the other parts of this.  In general, that is what we do and try to achieve.  Part of that is trying to bring down the cost of attending a GP.</p></speech>

I ask him to acknowledge the example I gave of a minimum wage worker.  Will he acknowledge that under the scheme, the first day of sick pay amounts to nothing for these low-paid workers.  I have given that example and I ask the Minister of State to acknowledge it.</p></speech>

We have had plenty of discussion on this in both Houses.  I ask him to acknowledge that the Government is bringing in a new statutory sick pay scheme.  Today, a worker who is sick may not get payment.  People go to a doctor for more than one reason.  They do not just go there to get a medical certificate; they often go because they are sick and need to see a doctor.  The Senator should bear that in mind.  Even under the existing illness benefit scheme through the Department of Social Protection, a person needs to have medical certification.  That is not new.  I totally acknowledge the example put forward by the Senator.  I am not denying it whatsoever.  I ask him to acknowledge the current situation and that what we are bringing in is a major improvement on that situation, one of which we are all supportive.  We must also bear in mind that there must be protections and balance within that.  Medical certification is a natural and fair way to give protection to everybody involved in the scheme.</p></speech>

Good legislation has to stand on its own two feet.  It cannot be the case that we are bringing in legislation but we will have to amend it in a particular way because of something else.  It has to stand on its own two feet.  What Senator Gavan is proposing is a matter that can be brought forward by a different Department.  The fee to see a doctor could be waived or whatever by another Department.  This is new employment law legislation and it has to stand the test of time and on its own two feet.</p> <p>There are winners and losers in every legislation that is brought forward.  There may be wins in the Bill for employers.  Their staff might stay with them for longer as they have better conditions, for example.  However, employers are going to lose as well because there will be a cost to this.  It will be a big cost on employment.  Every day, employers come to me seeking permits.  I have spoken to the Minister today in respect of several people seeking permits.  There are many companies that have to pay way above the minimum wage to get people to work.  Most people are on the living wage now, rather than the minimum wage.  I agree with the Minister of State.  This is new legislation and it has to stand the test of time and on its own two feet.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is aware of that.  We have worked constructively with him on it.  We just happen to believe that, right now, the balance - we have been speaking about balance - is not correct because it does not work for low-paid workers.  I have given the Minister of State a clear example to show why it does not work for low-paid workers.  We are asking him to consider that balance because if low-paid workers are excluded, there is a fundamental problem and weakness.  That is why I am asking him to consider accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

It kicks in after that.  It will move to ten days in the next couple of years, as committed to by my party and the other parties in government.  I am not sure what Sinn F&eacute;in would do.  It has a very different view when it comes to creating and sustaining jobs.  I will not go into that today.  The Government is clear that there is a commitment to go to ten days.  The Senator is taking a one-day view of this, which is not a fair analysis of the legislation.  If he wishes to redo his example in the context of the payment for three days, rather than one day, it will be a different story.</p></speech>

Implied in the response of the Minister of State is that it is somehow okay for a low-paid worker not to get any money for the first day of sickness.  To be frank, I disagree with him on that.  If a person is sick, he or she should be entitled to sick pay.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that, for the first day, there will be no sick pay because the person has to fork out for a GP.  That is a point of fundamental difference between us.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill but we think workers should qualify for sick pay that makes a difference.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The reality for my son or anyone else on low pay is that they are down money that day through no fault of their own.

I hope he is not still sick.  To be very clear on this - there is no sick pay legislation in place at the moment.  There is no statutory sick pay scheme.  I ask the Senator to perhaps acknowledge that we are improving the situation.  It is not the case that there is no financial gain and there is only a loss on the first day.  That is not true.</p></speech>

The cost involved in attending a GP or obtaining a medical certificate differs throughout the country.  I do not agree with the Senator at all that somebody is at a loss on the first day.  That is his assertion, and it is reflected in the figures he is putting forward.  New new employment legislation has been brought forward, which is a positive development, and it strengthens the hands of employers in respect of the talent war, but it also comes at a cost to them.  There is absolutely no doubt about that.  The certification process is part of a good scheme.  This scheme stands in comparison with those in most countries internationally.  We will have one of the best statutory sick pay schemes in the context of the rate of pay, when it kicks in and the roadmap relating to it.  I hope the Senator is committing to a similar roadmap in the years ahead as well.</p></speech>

The Government is bringing through legislation that will cater for so many people working in the private sector who currently do not have access to any sort of sick pay scheme.  It is absolutely crucial that this happens.  It is a statutory scheme that will come into place over a number of years.  We will increase the period from three to ten days.  It is absolutely phenomenal to see that we will be brining this in and that the Bill will be enacted as soon as possible.  I know the drive from the Government is to see this legislation in place as soon as possible.  It is important to note that it is a support involving both the Government and employers.  The latter will be funding up to 70% but the Government is stepping in to support them in providing this.  It will be crucial that this works as a partnership going forward.  In addition, we are looking out for people who are on the minimum wage.  We have already been working to increase the minimum wage.  We are working to ensure that people on the minimum wage in the private sector who are not currently receiving sick pay will receive it in the future.  It is very important to acknowledge this is groundbreaking legislation.</p></speech>

I take Senator Gavan&rsquo;s points on board.  The Minister of State is right that Senator Gavan should acknowledge that we are beginning a new chapter.  As Senator Dolan rightly said, this is about access to sick pay.  We must strike a balance.  Senator Gavan should acknowledge that this is a positive outcome that has been reached by means of a process of consultation and engagement.</p> <p>We all come to the debate with different viewpoints.  As I keep saying, however, the fundamental thing is that we must get the balance right.  Senator Burke is right.  Many of the people we are talking about are employers who are paying far more than the minimum wage.  Whether the Senator accepts that or not, it is the reality.  I will bring it to many employers in Cork, where I live-----</p></speech>

That is what we are doing today.  We are making provision.  That is the fundamental point about this legislation.  There is also the Payment of Wages (Amendment) (Tips and Gratuities) Bill later on.  It is about ensuring that workers' conditions and living standards are looked after by the Government.  This is a positive day.  I take Senator Gavan's point on board.  The Minister of State can take back that point back to the Department.</p> <p>I often look at amendments - not necessarily in this case - seeking that reports be made within so many months and ask what such reports will achieve.  The Minister of State is committed to a review.  I ask myself why we table amendments stating that reports on legislation should be made within three or six months.</p> <p>I am of the view that the Bill highlights the importance of the Government acting on behalf of workers.  It also accentuates the need for a public sector pay deal, because there is power and strength in terms of the cohesiveness of such a deal.  Coming out of Covid and in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis fuelled by a war that is so wrong, we need to protect public sector workers.  That is why, in the context of arriving at a public sector pay deal, I appeal to those on all sides to go back to the table and engage.  I heard the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, speaking about this matter at the weekend.  I exhort him and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to act.  Senator Sherlock and the Labour Party can use their influence in this regard.  It is about brining people to the table.  We cannot have successful talks through various people appearing on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and expressing different points of view.  It is about the power of being at the table.  That is why I hope the negotiations can resume.</p> <p>I am not being critical of anybody.  I have been a public sector worker all my life.  My point is that I recognise the importance of the public sector and of the employees within it and what they bring to the table.  I was in this House when former Senator Eoghan Harris used to pillory the public sector week after week.  There were very few of us who were in here every day defending the public sector at a time when some individuals were bringing forward proposals to decimate that sector.  I do not know if Senator Sherlock recalls that.  She probably does.</p> <p>I am not trying to pit one against the other.  I have never been about that.  I accept that I am digressing - I apologise for that - but what I want to see happen is the talks resuming because our country and workers need to that collective pay deal to be agreed.  We are better served by that than by people having to go off and do individual deals, which serves nobody.  That is the point I am making.  Please do not say that I am being divisive because I am not.</p></speech>

Any day we mention Eoghan Harris is never a good day as far as I am concerned.  The central point I want to make - and I will not fall out with people, well not much anyway - is that there is a weakness in this Bill.  Just to be clear: I think this is the third time I am saying it &ndash; I support the Bill.  I acknowledge this Bill as being a significant step forward.  However, there is a weakness in terms of this issue of the first day of sick pay effectively being nothing.  I do not see how the Minister of State can argue with my figures.  I encourage him to go into detail about that if he wants to.  The cost of attending a GP in Limerick is &euro;60.  That is the reality.  On the basis of the 70% payment provided for in this Bill, my son will come out with &euro;58.  That is the reality.  The first day sick pay is zero.  All I am saying is why not take the opportunity to improve that now.  That is all.  I am repeating myself.  I do not want to labour the point.</p></speech>

It is not and cannot be about access to or the cost of health services.  That is a separate discussion.  We both agree that there is improvement needed in respect of access and the cost of health services, but that is completely separate from the debate on this legislation.  This is the statutory sick pay scheme that is putting a cost on employers who create jobs and want to protect jobs.  We have to bear that in mind.  We can use all sorts of figures of rates of pay because the Senator&rsquo;s amendment relates to everybody and every rate of pay.  Fewer than 10% of people are on the minimum wage.  Of course we want to increase the minimum wage up to a living wage.  However, it is fewer than 10% of people, which is my understanding, because there has been a major move during our years in government to reduce the numbers on the minimum wage.  The Senator may not like that fact, but it is true.  We naturally want to improve the lot of any worker.  That is why we want to bring forward this scheme.  However, what we are legislating for and the cost of access to health services are separate matters.  It is important they are kept separate in the interests of having good legislation.  Senator Burke made that point, and I should have acknowledged it.  Again, I re-emphasise the point that most people go to a doctor because they are sick.  Just bear that in mind.  If you are sick, you go to a doctor.  The Senator is just focusing only on the certification piece.  However, the reason people go is because they are sick and want treatment, help and advice.</p></speech>

Again, this really impacts on lower paid workers in particular.  It just seems low.  If we want to talk about balance, 70% does not strike me as the right balance.  If someone is sick and they are unable to go to work, they should not be penalised for that.  I have given the Minister of State a concrete example of &euro;84.50 a day but we can bring it up to &euro;90 or &euro;100, and 70% is not going to compensate fully for that person&rsquo;s sickness.  We should not always start from the perspective of &ldquo;Well, they may not really be sick.&rdquo;  We should start from the perspective that the person is sick, they are missing from work and they should not be penalised for that because it is not their fault.  We have heard a lot about balance and I agree with the Minister of State that we need to get the balance right, but the balance should not be 70%.  People should get a full day&rsquo;s pay if they are sick.  To me, that is the fairest solution and the correct balance, particularly when we are starting off with a very small number of days, just three days to begin with.</p><p>The reality at present is that workers will make a choice to go to work sick.  This Bill should be and can be more effective.  I do not see the rationale for the 70% figure or where it comes from.  I will listen to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#Z02000"><p>There is no doubt this Bill is ground-breaking in terms of providing all workers in this country, once they have served 13 weeks, with a right to paid sick leave.  We in the Labour Party very much welcome that, and the Minister of State earlier acknowledged the Bill we put forward in September 2020 to give a right to all workers with regard to paid sick leave.  When we look at this, we have to remember who in this country has an occupational sick pay scheme and who does not.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The more a worker earns the greater the probability of him or her having an occupational sick pay scheme and the less one earns the greater the probability that one is reliant on the State's illness benefit system.  This Bill is about low-paid workers and middle-income workers, but, in particular, low-paid workers.</p><p>I want to speak to amendments Nos. 15, 17 and 18, and to support amendment No. 14 as well because it is an alternative to amendment No. 15.</p><p>I have looked at the debate in the D&aacute;il about the Government's rejection of the payment of a worker's full rate and we have to question that.  Workers on low pay do not have spare capacity.  They cannot afford to not work because of the bills they have to pay.  If they are only getting 70% of what they would typically expect to earn, there is an issue about providing them with the assurance and comfort of knowing that they will not be out of pocket when they fall sick.  They will be out of pocket under the proposals in this Bill because the maximum payment is 70%.  We believe that is wrong.  It needs to be at a full-day's pay rate.  As I said earlier, no worker wants to be sick.  Workers want to get on with their work.  They want to be able to pay their bills and know that they can pay their bills as opposed to having to take a cut in income because they are sick.</p><p>In section 7, the maximum daily amount has a number of exceptions or allowances.  There is an allowance regarding board and lodgings.  I do not believe that is fair.  They are either to get their daily rate of pay or not, but to introduce an allowance in respect of board and lodgings is wrong.</p><p>That brings me to amendment No. 17.  I am reluctantly bringing forward this amendment in the knowledge that the Minister of State will reject our amendments to ensure that workers will get their full daily rate.  It is to ask that, when he is introducing the maximum rate of pay, the Minister of State will also introduce a minimum rate of pay.  I listened to the Minister of State's comments earlier where the talked about the Minister taking a full perspective on this Bill.  Beyond labour legislation, the Minister is ignoring what is happening in the health system at present because there is not timely access to GPs in this country for many people.  There may be people in this Chamber who can pick up the phone to their GP and get an appointment within a few hours but there are many workers out there, particularly if they are new to this country or if they are new to a particular area, who cannot get a GP appointment within a day or two days.  One could be waiting well over a week.</p><p>Senator Gavan already touched on affordability.  The reality is minimum wage workers will not get enough in sick leave benefit to cover the cost of going to the doctor.  Amendment No. 6 was an eminently sensible amendment and it is unfortunate that the Government has ruled it out of order.  I suppose what is particularly striking is that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in its pre-legislative scrutiny of the legislation, recognised that there is an issue with timely access and affordability of GPs.  In an ideal world we would have certification on the first day of illness, if GP visits were free and one was able to get them in a timely fashion, but that is not the reality in this country.  There was a strong cross-party recommendation from the committee - I note Senator Ollie Crowe was here today - that an allowance would have to be put in place for low-paid workers and the Government has ignored that recommendation in bringing this Bill before the House.  Because the Government has ignored that cross-party recommendation, I am asking the Minister to State to introduce a minimum rate of pay to ensure that any worker will at least be able to afford the cost of going to the doctor from the first day of illness.</p><p>To go back to my original point, this Bill has to work for all workers but it particularly has to work for low-paid workers because they are the ones who do not have occupational sick pay within their workplaces.  We need to ensure that this Bill works for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1636" speakername="Paddy Burke" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#AA00200"><p>As Senator Sherlock said, this has to work for all workers.  It has to work for employers as well.  We have to be fair to employers as well.  This is, as has been said, groundbreaking legislation.</p> <p>I suppose everything is relative.  Whether one is on a lower wage or a middle-income wage, one's outgoings will be relative to what one's income will be.  If somebody is out sick, whether he or she is in the middle-income bracket or not, he or she cannot afford to be out of work either.</p> <p>When this legislation is passed, and when it is enacted and up and running, we do not know where it will finish.  In small businesses, when somebody is out sick they have got to get cover.  Larger businesses can operate to some degree because they have more employees but if one has a small business with four or five employees and one person is out sick for whatever reason, that business more than likely has to get cover.</p> <p>I had asked on Second Stage that we would look at surveys to see how many people in the public service are out sick because they are allowed sick days and whether everyone working in the public service take all of their sick days.  In the private sector, what is the number of people who are out sick or are there statistics to show that people are going to work when they are sick?  In the latter case, we know from the meat industry that that happens.  We should have had some of those findings before being able to have a real overview of this legislation.  In any event, we are passing this legislation without that knowledge now.</p> <p>There will be a new industry providing locums, as is the case with doctors and dentists.  This will apply where, for instance, one has a restaurant or a bar.  People will work in one bar today and in another bar the next day, or they will work in one restaurant today and a different restaurant next week.  That is the business they will be in.  They will be covering for people who are out sick because, as I said, if one has a small business and one gets a phone call on Monday morning to say a person is not coming in because he or she is sick, it will throw the whole business into disarray, particularly given it is nearly impossible to get anybody at present.  I can see a new locum industry growing from this.</p> <p>We have to bear with the legislation that the Minister of State is bringing forward to see how it will pan out on the ground.  That is my view on it.</p></speech>

It is about supporting people who cannot afford to be sick at present.  We have heard personal examples of that.</p> <p>I have sympathy for the Minister of State in this scenario.  It is easy to talk about employers all in the one bracket but we are talking about employers who, in this scenario, will have to pay 70% and then may also have to find replacement workers at 100%.  They are already working in very difficult situations, increasingly so, with wage increases, energy costs and high business costs at present.  It is about getting the balance right.</p> <p>We have received some emails about a rebate scheme for employers and helping them.  I believe there is something in section 10 around inability to pay.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My question is on what supports there could be for employers.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#CC00300"><p>I thank the House for taking these two motions.  The two motions before the House today seek the approval of the Seanad to continue in force provisions in the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 aimed at tackling terrorism, and the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 in respect of organised crime.  Given the nature of these provisions, the Houses of the Oireachtas has decided that they should be reconsidered annually.  The Minister for Justice, in accordance with the provisions, has laid reports on the use of these powers covering the 12 months up to 31 May 2022.</p> <p>As the House will be aware, the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 contains a series of amendments to the Offences against the State Acts to make them more responsive to the threat from certain groups.  This robust legislation was enacted by the Oireachtas in the wake of the murder, by the Real IRA, of 29 innocent people in the bombing of Omagh in August 1998.  That atrocity demanded a resolute response from the State, and the legislation enacted then was a necessary and proportionate measure to defend the desire of the vast majority of law-abiding people on this island to live in peace.  The report laid before this House on 7 June includes information provided by the Garda Commissioner on the use of the provisions in question over the past 12 months, and a table setting out reported usage figures for each of the years since the Act came into operation.  The report also provides a brief assessment of the security situation.  Regrettably, despite the enormous progress made towards a lasting peace on this island, there remains to this day a real and persistent threat from those same paramilitary groups who have set their faces against peace.  We know these groups are vehemently opposed to peace and seek to attack the institutions of Northern Ireland.  Their callous targeting of PSNI officers underlines the morally vacant path which these dissident groups seek to follow.  While the recent lowering of the threat level in Northern Ireland is to be welcomed, the threat level remains substantial and the State cannot be complacent in this regard.  I pay tribute to the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, who work tirelessly and co-operate to counter the threat from paramilitary organisations.  The report also notes the clear view of the Garda Commissioner that the Act continues to be an important tool in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism.  Of course, while the 1998 Act was a response to a domestic threat, as an open democracy it is very important that we do not lose sight of the threat from international terrorism.  We are not immune from this threat.  Many provisions of the Offences against the State Acts form part of the response to that threat.</p> <p>The House will be aware that in February last year the Minister for Justice established an independent expert review group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Michael Peart, to examine all aspects of the Offences against the State Acts, taking into account the current threat posed by domestic-international terrorism and organised crime, the duty to deliver a fair and effective criminal justice system to ensure the protection of communities and the security of the State, and Ireland's obligations in relation to constitutional and ECHR rights and international law.  The chair of the review group has recently reported that the group has had significant engagement with relevant stakeholders, statutory agencies and civil society organisations.  The group's final report is expected in the autumn.  I would like to thank Mr. Justice Peart and the members of the review group for undertaking this significant and complex task, and I expect full engagement with any recommendations they might have for this important legislation.  In the meantime, the report laid before this House notes the clear view of the Garda authorities that the Act continues to be one of the most important tools in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism.  In the circumstances, I must conclude that these provisions continue to be required and that they should remain in operation for a further 12 months.</p> <p>I will now turn to section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which is also the subject of a motion before the House.  It refers to a small number of serious organised crime offences that are set out in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Section 8 of the 2009 Act makes these offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the Offences against the State Act 1939.  That is to say, trials for these offences are to be heard in the Special Criminal Court subject to the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to direct that the offences be tried in the ordinary courts.  The purpose of the provision is to guard against the possibility of interference with jury trial by ruthless criminal gangs.  Of course, it is the case that jury trial should be preserved to the greatest extent possible.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that organised crime gangs have shown a particular ruthlessness in their activities, including attacks on witnesses and intimidation of jurors.  The report on this section that has been laid before the House includes information provided by the Garda Commissioner on the use, over the past 12 months, of the provisions in question and details of the offences in question.  No one can be under any illusion as to the threat that society and the criminal justice system face from organised crime gangs who will stop at nothing in pursuit of their criminal activities.  The Garda authorities are working intensively to bear down on these criminal gangs and to disrupt their activities.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deserves praise for the considerable successes it has had against these gangs.  With the Government's support, that work will continue.  The views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are set out clearly in the report, namely, that the continued operation of the provision is required.  It is my view, therefore, that section 8 should continue in operation for a further 12 months.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> As set out in the two reports that have been laid before the House, it is the clear view of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the provisions in the 1998 Act and the 2009 Act continue to be necessary and effective in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism and serious organised crime.  On the basis of the information set out in the report, and on the advice of Garda authorities, I propose that the House should approve the continued operation of the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act and the 2009 Act for a further 12 months commencing on 30 June.</p></speech>

I, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, support these motions that provide for the continuance of certain provisions under the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and also the continuance in operation of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  I thank the Minister of State for outlining in great detail his case for the continuance of these measures.</p> <p>We fully agree with the continuance in operation of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, which was a central provision in the battle against dissident republican groups engaged in terrorism.  The Act, as the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach will know, was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il in 1998 in response, as the Minister of State outlined, to the Omagh bombing.  We as a State must remain vigilant to the continuous threat from dissident republican terrorists who refuse to recognise the legality or existence of the Irish State and, as the Minister of State also outlined, other threats as well.</p> <p>Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 is a vital tool in the battle against organised crime and was also introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Section 8 allows for the prosecution of individuals before the Special Criminal Court without a jury for directing a criminal organisation or participating in or contributing to the activity of a criminal organisation for the purpose of committing or facilitating the commission of a serious offence.  Unfortunately, we are all used to the activities of these criminal gangs, as they continue to murder and be involved with the supply of drugs, firearms and explosives.  As the Minister of State outlined, this legislation is necessary to protect those who are members of juries from intimidation.</p> <p>It was mentioned that it is the view of the Garda it is important both these pieces of legislation continue for another 12 months.  I welcome that and take the opportunity to commend the Garda on the work it does in this dangerous field on behalf of us all, and indeed on the many successes it has had in this particular area.</p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned the review group is due to report in the autumn.  I am wondering what the timeframe is thereafter as far as the two pieces of legislation at issue are concerned.</p> <p>On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, I am happy to support both motions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.197" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#DD00300"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it ar na r&uacute;in th&aacute;bhachtacha seo.  I am a huge fan of juries.  They are a fantastic part of our criminal justice system.  They take out of the realm of tired and jaded lawyers and judges questions of fact that should be determined by people who are fresh to the system, instead of people who are used to the system.  They are people with fresh eyes, fresh perspectives and represent the strand of common sense that runs through our criminal justice system.</p><p>Let us be in no doubt, therefore, that juries are an incredibly important part of the fairness of our system, and I do not want to in any way denigrate that.  That is not to say, just as has been recited in the report laid before the Houses on 7 June, that there are not cases that need to be heard by courts other than ones with juries.  The reality is jurors, as ordinary citizens who come to court, are potentially exposed to intimidation and other tactics that we know have happened in the past and we know may happen again if certain cases are put in the charge of juries.</p><p>I see the Special Criminal Court as something that is flawed in many ways but it is a necessary evil nonetheless.  It is a system we have put in place, as has been said already, as a response to certain activities by certain groups.  It is a system that continues to work in respect of certain types of prosecution.  Also important is where one has a Special Criminal Court sitting, there is not, for example, a consistent level of guilty verdicts.  The judges who sit in the Special Criminal Court take their duties as judges and jurors - which is <i>de facto</i>what they are - very seriously.  The presumption of innocence accorded to a defendant is a serious precept of Irish criminal law.  The judges apply that and we can see that in the fact cases result in acquittals in the Special Criminal Court.</p><p>Those who express concerns about the operation of the Special Criminal Court are justified in doing so.  It is an aberration in a system that recognises the importance of the presumption of innocence in respect of individuals.  As I said, it is a necessary evil and we must acknowledge there are certain cases that merit this particular non-jury court, no matter how much we might find it distasteful or have concerns about it.  As long as it is a necessary evil I am happy on behalf of the Fine Gael group to second these motions and support the notion of the continuation of the Special Criminal Court in force.</p><p>I also recognise the value of having this debate, even though it takes place every year and even though I often make the same remarks about it.  There is a value in coming back to the Oireachtas, as the Houses that represent the people, and getting the <i>imprimatur </i>of the elected representatives of the people and more importantly perhaps, forcing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and by extension the State to justify each year the basis upon which the continuation of this court is necessary.  I welcome all that, notwithstanding my misgivings.</p><p>I also welcome the fact the Minister and the Department have put in place a review.  There is no better man to lead it than Mr. Justice Michael Peart, who is a judge of singular authority and respect within the system.  He is somebody who I am certain will approach his task with the even-handedness and fairness we expect.  I look forward to what his review has to say in that regard and to being able to analyse the issues that may arise in the course of that review.</p><p>One of the issues I raise in this regard every year is the fact the current legislation allows the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, to designate whether a case is appropriate for the Special Criminal Court or not.  The DPP does that of her own motion, as it were, and she decides, for example, if a case is an appropriate case for the Special Criminal Court.  That should not happen.  I do not criticise any of the decisions she has made.  I am not aware of any case that has gone to the Special Criminal Court that did not objectively belong there.  However, there is a case to be made for a separate, independent and objective process for that decision to be made, perhaps by way of an application by the DPP to the High Court and perhaps even <i>in camera</i>if that is the appropriate way to do it.  That decision should be put in the hands of an independent, non-prosecutorial body and the High Court would seem to me to be the most the obvious place to do that.  I have made that suggestion on previous occasions and submitted it to Mr. Justice Peart's review as well.</p><p>It is very important for people to understand what these motions are about and to understand elements we need protection from and that juries need protection from as well.  I do not mean to score any political points but it is remarkable Sinn F&eacute;in has changed its position insofar as it was so vehemently opposed to it and now it has stepped back.  It seems to me another attempt to normalise its relations, notwithstanding the fact it has unjustifiably opposed the existence of the Special Criminal Court in the past and it is worth remarking on that.</p><p>I welcome the motions and support them on behalf of the Fine Gael group.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber and acknowledge his dedicated efforts.  Jury trials are a cornerstone of our justice system.  The UN Human Rights Committee has said one should only dispense with a jury trial in very exceptional circumstances.  They are extraordinary courts for extraordinary times.</p> <p>Senator Ward said they are a necessary evil.  I submit if they are such a necessary evil, that they be backed by the very latest evidence to justify the continuation of a necessary evil.  I am concerned about the perceived rubber-stamping of this every year, though I welcome that it comes to the Oireachtas every year and is held to account, but I am concerned it is more in ceremony and less in substance.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P. Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=VincentPMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A jury is the cornerstone of the criminal law system as it ensures that the innocence or guilt of a person charged with an offence is determined by 12 randomly chosen members of the community, each of whom brings to the process the benefit of his or her life experience and individual perspective.  In typically colourful language, Lord Devlin, one of the most senior judges in the common law world, stated that trial by jury "is the lamp that shows that freedom lives".  When the Birmingham Six took a civil action against the West Midlands Police, he could not fathom that the police would lie, as that would create an appalling vista.  In a better moment, however, he, while Master of the Rolls, properly summed up the importance of trial by jury.</p><p>It is only in the most exceptional circumstances that I would support dispensing with the constitutional right to trial by jury.  The Constitution contains many rights that point to only getting rid of jury trials in the most exceptional of circumstances.  The Constitution guarantees equality before the law, including the right to equal protection of the law.  With the renewal of these provisions in the Acts, we will continue to have the bizarre situation whereby two citizens in Ireland can be tried on the same serious offence, referred to as a scheduled offence, in two different court formats.  One of them will have the benefit of a jury trial while the other will not have the benefit of his or her peers as jurors.  Of course, with the Special Criminal Court comes a different evidential outline in terms of the evidence that is allowed.  With the utmost respect, it is a weaker evidence test in respect of opinion evidence and interpretation evidence.</p><p>I have concerns.  There is a guarantee in our laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.  We have a duty to uphold the rights of citizens and we must do so.  That includes the right to a fair trial and a jury trial.  The test is whether there is an alternative.  This is the crux of what I am coming to.  If it is an absolutely necessary and unavoidable evil, then, of course, we protect our people.  Where is the evidence that alternatives have been sought, however?  In this day and age, having learned from Covid, we have remote hearings.  Why can we not have screen jurors or anonymised jurors?  I am not convinced that this is being taken seriously enough.  This right is being taken away from people without it being convincingly shown that it is totally necessary.  Human rights organisations not just in Ireland but throughout the world would state that only in the most exceptional circumstances should non-jury trials be conducted.</p><p>A certain political party has been riding high in the opinion polls for some time.  It is entitled to change its mind or do U-turns.  The late Brian Lenihan Snr. once spoke about the futility of consistency.  Such a U-turn is acceptable if it is based on courage and working it out, rather than on political expediency.  Only the people who are making the U-turn can answer for that, however.  They alone truly know.  In a democracy, we need a vibrant Government and a vibrant Opposition to hold the Government to account.  There could be a long run-in to the next election.  It could be a long and winding road.  I would not like to see the balance and checks of opposition stultified by people in opposition looking over their shoulders and dropping such a firmly held principle due to political expediency.  Is it because they are preparing to be more ready to be in government or whatever?  Only they can answer that.  I am concerned that I have not seen the evidence.  I am not asking people to vote for or against this today.  That is everyone's individual right.  At least, however, they should not lose their voice.  If they held to something for many years, they should not lose that voice suddenly.  Where is that voice gone if there has been a deeply held concern about this for many years?</p><p>A functioning democracy needs jurors and, I am afraid to say, I have not seen convincing evidence to justify the continuation of trials without jurors.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is very welcome to the House.  Sinn F&eacute;in will do whatever it takes to get criminal gangs off the streets.  We need 21st century laws to tackle 21st century criminals.  That means everything: more garda&iacute; on the streets, more resources and, yes, special courts that protect jurors and those giving evidence against these dangerous gangs.</p> <p>Our approach to all of this has been to improve the legislation.  For the past three years, we have called for a review of the criminal justice system to ensure the Garda and the courts have all the powers they need to take on organised crime.  It is welcome that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, has started that review.  The renewal of the Offences against the State Acts will pass through the Oireachtas this week and Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose that.  It is to be hoped that by this time next year, the review team will have brought forward its proposals for improvement and the Government will have legislated for that.  We want to work with the Government to bring about necessary change and, crucially, improvement.  We can improve on what is there.  That is the job of legislators.  I do not see how laws crafted in the 1940s can possibly be fit for purpose in the 21st century.  In that regard, I point to the shocking cyberattack carried out on the HSE last year.  I do not see how having an aspect of the crime-fighting legislation subject to annual review is a good thing either.  I support all the courts but a fundamental question is whether we can improve upon them.  I believe we can.  Can we improve the current legislation?  I believe we can do that, too.  For example, in its submission to the review, Sinn F&eacute;in argued for improved protection for juries, including a new offence of jury tampering, and an end to the annual renewal, which would bring certainty to the process.  Decisions in respect of the types of offences being tried within particular courts should be centred within the courts system, be they jury trials, anonymised jury trials or, in exceptional circumstances, non-jury trials.  All present want the same thing, namely, safer and vibrant communities.  Our job as legislators is to put the tools in the hands of the Garda and the courts to make sure that happens.</p></speech>

There is a lot in the Acts in question but I will focus on the Special Criminal Court.  There is much talk, nationally and internationally, about how we need to protect European values and democracy.  If we are serious about protecting and defending democracy, we must scrap the Special Criminal Court.  The cornerstone of any democracy lies in its justice system and the cornerstone of such a justice system is the right to a fair trial by a jury of one's peers.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties is one of many organisations to have called for the abolition of the Special Criminal Court.  It highlighted many concerns, such as the lack of a jury, the judge serving as both judge and jury, the extensive powers of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and the claims of privilege by members of the Garda.  I do not believe we need two criminal justice systems.  For example, if jury intimidation is widespread, there are better ways to address that.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has concerns and wants rid of the Special Criminal Court.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Ruane, has spoken passionately in the House in respect of rehabilitation.  In many cases, punishment is not the answer.  I agree with her in respect of helping people re-integrate back into society.  Members must remember that Senator Ruane and I come from two communities that are very different from those of most people in the Houses.  We have seen these issues on the ground.  Unfortunately, the justice system only works for the few, not for the many.  In the context of the justice system, it all depends on the community from which you come.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many people I know from the Traveller community are judged based on the fact that they are from the Traveller community, not on the crime that was committed.  Travellers in Ireland make up 1% of the population and yet we make up 10% of the prison population.  Traveller women make up at least 15% of all women in prison.  In Ireland people from minority groups and indigenous communities are over-represented in prison and we see that all over the world.  The 1963 report of the Commission on Itinerancy spoke of our Traveller way of life and way of making a living as a problem within Irish society.  For some people, there is no justice in the justice system.  We see all over the world the rise of oppressive governments.  One of my biggest fears moving forward is about future governments, which could have the power in their hands that would work to their advantage.  We need to be very careful moving forward around the Special Criminal Court and how it can impact and oppress people within our society, and be mindful of future governments.</p></speech>

In regard to Senator Gallagher's question on what happens once the review is provided to the Minister, the Minister will consider that review, have a look at the recommendations and any timeline thereafter will depend on the extent of any recommendations made and whether legislation, for example, may be required.  I will endeavour to get a timeline for Senator Gallagher.</p> <p>In regard to Senator Ward's contribution, I agree absolutely on the importance of the jury in the criminal trial system.  What we are doing here is necessary in the circumstances to deal with the threat from serious criminal gangs and terrorists, but it is no more than what is necessary in that respect.  I hear Senator Martin's concerns in regard to needing evidence and the concern about rubber stamping.  The reports have been laid before the Houses.  This comes before both Houses for consideration.  I am here in this House and the Minister, Deputy McEntee, is in the D&aacute;il.  There is no greater place than these Houses for giving that in-depth consideration and being able to look at the matters.  Mr. Justice Michael Peart is doing an in-depth review which will look at the current threats, the duty to deliver a fair and effective criminal justice system and our obligations under the Constitution and the ECHR.  We will see what Mr. Justice Peart comes back with in regard to his review.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile pointed out that Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose the motion.  In regard to the tools, neither myself nor the Minister, Deputy McEntee, have been found wanting in terms of passing significant legislation in regard to strengthening the hands of the garda&iacute; and our criminal justice system in the two years we have been here, and in terms of the amount of legislation we are bringing forward.  In the budget in October, funding was put in place for an additional 800 garda&iacute; and an additional 400 civilian staff for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that would free up garda&iacute; from administrative duties and put them on the front line.  We are giving very strong tools to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with the threat.  However, what we are doing here is, and remains, necessary and proportionate.</p> <p>In regard to Senator Flynn&rsquo;s call for the abolition of the non-jury courts, again I would say that what we are doing is necessary and proportionate.  We face a very serious threat from criminal gangs and terrorists, both domestic and international.  It is only for those most serious situations that we have the non-jury courts.  I agree that rehabilitation is absolutely critical.  Our new justice strategy has provided significant additional funding, more than 33%, into youth justice funding to redirect young people who are at risk of, or who are, coming into contact with the criminal justice system.  That proves that we very much believe in rehabilitation.  However, when dealing with very serious criminal gangs and terrorist organisations which do not believe in the justice system and want to undermine it through threats and intimidation of jurors and witnesses, we say this is necessary for those very special and rare occasions and that it is both necessary and proportionate.</p> <p>I am grateful to the House for its consideration of these important motions.  I thank all the Senators for their contributions, particularly those who supported the motions.  As I said, terrorist groups remain a threat to the people on this island.  They are opposed to the benefits that have flowed from the peace process and are determined to undermine it.  The State must retain in its laws the capacity to defeat them and we have a duty as legislators to ensure that this is so.  Likewise the renewal of section 8 of the 2009 Act is an important contribution to the overall framework of measures in tackling organised crime.  We are all too well aware of the appalling damage caused by organised crime, in particular the damage caused by the drug trade, on individuals, families and communities.  By renewing these important provisions this House is sending a message loud and clear that this State will not tolerate the activities of terrorists and organised crime groups and is committed in its resolve to see them defeated.</p></speech>

I know there are no amendments to the Bill.  As for its general application, however, in the context of this section and the application of military law to serious criminal offences, has the Department given any consideration to, for example, application beyond the court martial for people accused?  There is a concern, which other Senators have raised in the Chamber, that somebody who is the subject of military law and who may have been accused of quite a serious criminal offence would see that offence downgraded within a code of military justice or a code of military offences.  Does the Bill in any way restrict the ability of the law of the State to deal with such persons who are charged with serious offences?  I do not think this comes under any specific section, but has the Department given any consideration as to whether there is any danger that those who are accused of serious offences, particularly sexual offences, may be able to escape full justice in respect of such offences if proven against them?  Is there any issue in that regard?</p></speech>

I will go through the section line by line to discuss why it is imperative the peer support programme be put on a legislative footing.  In a statement by the Minister a number of weeks ago on why it the Department's view that we should not put it in legislation the reason given was there was no need to do so because we subscribe to Regulation (EU) 2018/1042, which was implemented by the Commission a number of months ago.  It concerns me that the written communications between us and the Department tell us the Department does not feel that crew peer support should be in primary legislation because it is in Regulation (EU) 2018/1042.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The understanding of the Department, which we have in writing, is that the airlines are responsible for putting in place the peer support programmes for their own flight crews.  However, when we read the regulation, it states airlines are responsible for a hell of a lot more than just providing peer support programme for their own flight crews.  It states that an operator "shall enable, facilitate and ensure access to a proactive and non-punitive support programme that will assist and support flight crew in recognising, coping with, and overcoming any problem which might negatively affect their ability to safely exercise the privileges of their licence.  Such access shall be made available to all flight crew."  That is clearly far more comprehensive than just putting in place something wishy-washy.</p><p>I want to concentrate on the amendment we have tabled.  Under Commission regulation 2018/1042, each airline must facilitate access for pilots to non-punitive peer support programmes.  They must fundamentally, progressively and proactively help them overcome problems which might negatively affect their ability to safely exercise the privileges of their licence.  The regulation came into effect on February 2021 under the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, rules.  It is required that it is effective in each member state by August 2022.  We know that some peer support programmes have been provided in Ireland for many years.  One, in particular, has been operating very effectively.  However, there is no consistency in the provision of peer support programmes by the multiple airlines operating the country.  Some airlines are protracted in their views that the peer support person should be selected by management, which results in the entire programme being undermined and ineffective.  The amendment that the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association, IALPA, has proposed, as a number of colleagues have mentioned today, additional national requirements in respect of crew peer support programmes.  Under these requirements, the IAA would review the peer support programmes every three years under specific criteria, and not under a wink and a nod such as that proposed in the draft documents that we received from IAA as to what it would do, to reassure us that there was no need for us to put the requirements in legislation.  According to the amendment, comprehensive and specified criteria for the review would be required.  The IAA would be required to seek feedback from users of the programmes, if and where feasible; and to direct changes to the programmes where deficiencies are identified.  It would also be required to convene a national forum whose functions would include the sharing of best practice; encouraging co-operation between different programmes; the monitoring of the effectiveness of the programmes;  the approval and monitoring the content and delivery of peer support training programmes; and the creation or encouragement of the provision of a national crew peer support programme, so that there is consistency of delivery and consistency in the provision of support and services to the licence holders.  More importantly, it would ensure that there is consistency in upholding the standards of safety that we claim to hold dear to us in these Chambers.  </p><p>In response, unfortunately, I believe a Government amendment will be introduced, which will just require the IAA to conduct a review of the effectiveness of the crew peer support programmes, almost at any stage it likes.  The language could not be more evasive.  What we are really seeking to do is to address the matters such as the promotion of these programmes, the consistency of the programmes and the trust that is needed to make sure that the programmes work in the best interests of the licenceholders, who all have the same issues as all other professionals in the country but with much more serious consequences if they are not managed and minded.  We want to address matters such as the independence of the peers from management or the supervisory functions.  We need to address the selection and training of the peers.  Unfortunately, the Government amendment does not provide for a national crew peer support forum, as we have requested.  The Members of this House and indeed the officials from the Department have engaged extensively on the matter.  However, it is not yet clear, as far as the Minister and the Government are concerned, how the objective of such a forum will allow for the creation or the encouragement of the provision of national peer support for crew.  Previous amendments that I have tabled have been ruled out of order.  The Government amendments to be moved later will establish a forum to discuss the matter of national peer support programmes.  We will be relying on a forum that has no compellability, no timelines for when it is going to meet, no clear charter as to what the agenda of what the forum is going to be, and no encouragement features to ensure that everybody who has an interest in the safety of our airlines and aviation industry will be there to sit down and have a conversation about what a peer support programme should look like nationally.  If everybody is not at the table, I do not really understand how we can come together and effectively say that we are going to create a single national consistent and supportive programme to support the aviation licence holders in the country.</p><p>From speaking privately to the Minister of State and from hearing her public utterances, I know that she is supportive of the proposal, and believes that a proposed peer support programme would effectively be a very good thing.  However, I am mindful that we apparently do not believe that we are there yet, despite the fact that an exemplary peer support programme has been running since the 1970s that is state-of-the-art and could be used as a benchmark to show and prove what we can do nationally if we have the mindset to do it.  I also note that during the course of our meetings, a number of proposals and draft documents were sent to us by officials in the IAA to try to dissuade Members of this House from supporting or even introducing amendments that were recognised and requested by the IALPA.  Listing and reading the measures that it will take, which are supposed to assuage us, I really am not sure whether the tail is wagging the dog or the dog is wagging the tail.  I know many people think that we are making a mountain out of a molehill by stretching this legislative process out.  I do not doubt for a moment how important it is to get it passed.  However, we do not want to pass a piece of legislation that is completely flawed.  To my mind, legislation that does not address a significant amount of the safety regulation that is required in this country is a very dangerous piece of legislation, because it gives the pretence of doing something when in reality nothing is being done at all.   </p><p>I support amendment No. 3 that has been put down by my colleagues in relation to putting in primary legislation the specific details of a peer support programme, the specific regulations that our airlines will be required to comply with and the specific authority that will be given to the IAA to review, regulate, control and mind the licence holders in the industry.  They are powers that the IAA says that it does not want, which is really bizarre.  I have never come across a regulatory agency that has refused extra powers in my life before.  Yet, we have been at pains for months to try to persuade the IAA that it needs the powers.  In my view, we absolutely need peer support programmes to be consistent, uniform and available to every single member that is a licence holder who is responsible for the safety of crew members, passengers and cargo planes in this country.  I ask the Minister of State to seriously consider the flaws of her response that this issue will not be addressed now but at some stage in the future, and that we need to sit around a table to discuss the matter.  It is a table that nobody is ever going to be compelled to sit around to ensure that we have the safety of the people who run, manage and are licensed to fly the aircraft in this country, whether commercial, passenger or search and rescue operations, and to ensure that we do well by the people that we put our trust in every single time we fly into our of Ireland.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will have received a letter today from IALPA.  I wish to put the content of that letter on the record of the House.  It reads:</p> <blockquote> 	Dear Minister, <br /><br />I refer to the script of the debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on Thursday, 16 June 2022.  An extract is attached for your convenience.  A considerable amount of time in the debate was dedicated to the in-house (or lack of) aviation technical expertise of Department Officials.  As you know, the R116 Accident Report does not comment favourably on the aviation technical expertise available in your Department.  It is the IALPA observation and concern that none of the officials we met with you to discuss the Air Navigation &amp;amp; Transport Bill demonstrated an aviation technical expertise, at a level necessary to appreciate the significance of some provisions of EASA regulations and guidance material and to support appropriate transposition into national legislation. </blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The letter continues:</p><blockquote>	It has been an issue of considerable concern that the [Air Navigation and Transport Bill] was drafted, in the first instance, by officials who had unique access to the <b><i>draft</i></b>R116 Accident Report but had no expertise to the technical nuances of the Accident Report.  As IALPA recalls the conversation, they stated that they took the draft findings into consideration when drafting the new Bill, but this was not evident to us in our reading of the draft Bill.  It is our impression, and we could be wrong, that officials in your department relied heavily on the IAA for technical expertise in countering the IALPA amendments.  It is our position, that if this is the case, then it was wholly inappropriate for you to rely on the advice from the very entity, the reform of which is the central thrust of the [Air Navigation and Transport Bill].  Further, we have pointed out in numerous correspondence what we believe to be incorrect or misleading interpretations of the EASA documentation which appear to support the view that there is an absence of aviation technical expertise available to you in the Department.<br /><br />As you will recall, your speech in the Oireachtas [in] November 2021 placed reliance on the Bureau Veritas Report with regard to the IAA.  We have raised with you directly the shortcomings in the Bureau Veritas report with respect to other recommendations in the R116 Accident Report, shortcomings explicitly identified in the report by the report's authors.  Any reliance on this report as meeting the standard required in the recommendation is therefore, in our opinion, untenable.<br /><br />In summary, ... we are concerned by your response in the Seanad (16 June) when you stated: &quot;<b><i>Yes, we have expertise in the Department in respect of-----</i></b>&quot;.  It is our observation that the Department has not changed the aviation technical expertise available to it before or after the R116 accident (March 2017) or since the publication of the Accident Report in November 2021. </blockquote><p>We are discussing legislation that will regulate the IAA and other entities in this State for quite some considerable time to come.  I asked the Minister of State at the last engagement here if she had an aviation expert on her staff.  It is my belief, as well as that of IALPA, that her response was that she did.  This is factually untrue.  There is no aviation expert in the Department of Transport.  The first thing I would like to establish before we go any further is whether it is the case that there is an expert employed by the Department of Transport.  I am talking about a State employee, not a contractor or consultant, who is an aviation expert.  I would like that question answered, after which I want to come back in.</p></speech>

I am very conscious of getting through the legislation.  I will give a response again today but I would like to keep it brief, if that is possible, because I am conscious we have important legislation before us.</p> <p>The IAA has more than 120 safety experts committed to their roles, including 25 highly experienced pilots with aggregated experience of hundreds of years of flying in all large aircraft types, 25 highly qualified and experienced engineers with aggregated hundreds of years of experience in all aspects of airworthiness, other safety experts, including air traffic controllers, air navigation services engineers, as well as experts in aerodrome security, aircraft certification, pilot training and licensing, ground operations, charting, drone regulation, risk management, statistical analysis, aviation medicine etc.  It is a leading global expert in safety management systems and it is a member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, safety management panel, recognised and acknowledged by other states as an excellent regulator with frequent requests for assistance.  </p> <p>Apart from the limited circumstances where there is a reason for a different approach, in normal practice, as with other expert agencies, the IAA is the key source of advice on matters pertaining to aviation safety and security.  It is designed to be and its staff are the coalface experts.  The IAA is very extensive and has highly regarded technical experts.  It operates as part of the executive framework, both with an obligation to decide on matters within its remit and on an independent basis.  A different approach is appropriate where it is necessary to have expertise to assess the conduct of the functions by the IAA or in relation to the possible assignment to it of new functions.  The Department has availed of such expertise on a number of occasions over recent years. </p> <p>My Department has access to appropriate aviation expertise in order to provide effective oversight of the IAA.  The Department largely operates an external contracting model for specialist aviation expertise.  Independent aviation experts are engaged periodically to conduct an examination of the IAA&rsquo;s performance of its functions relating to the application and enforcement of safety standards pursuant to section 32 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993.  The most recent section 32 examination was carried out in 2019 and the next one is scheduled for 2023.  My Department also recently contracted expertise to undertake a review of the IAA&rsquo;s regulation of areas outside the European aviation safety regulatory regime.  In terms of advice on the evolving aviation regulatory and safety oversight environment, the Department has engaged external expertise to advise on, among other things, the framing of aviation coastguard activity provisions in the Air Navigation and Transport Bill and advice to inform our engagement with the Irish Aviation Authority on draft search and rescue rules.</p> <p>I see significant advantages to the approach of externally contracting specialist aviation expertise as required.  It gives you greater access to a range, depth and quantum of expertise compared to a standing appointment of a single expert on contract or otherwise.  Notwithstanding the advantages of this approach, I am committed to examine our practice in the area.  My Department will undertake further analysis of best practice in this area by reviewing oversight of aviation safety regulation in other jurisdictions and oversight of safety regulation in other sectors in Ireland.  We are now moving to scope this work more fully and decide the arrangements for delivery. </p> <p>I hope that clears up the matter.  I addressed this at the last meeting we had here.  I am very anxious that we proceed with the business of today, which is to move through and discuss and debate this legislation before us.</p></speech>

Therefore, I am glad she had that opportunity.</p> <p>However, I have to be honest with the Minister of State with regard to her statement and the safety recommendation updates for recommendations 2021-031 and 2021-029 that were uploaded to the Air Accident Investigation United, AAIU, website on the 17th.  Both of those recommendations arising from R116 failings and from the loss of life from that terrible accident highlighted the fact that neither our search and rescue nor our Department had any expertise.  The Department was challenged with reviewing and looking at the expertise.  The Minister of State just outlined all of the expertise that is available in the IAA.  It is true and it is very reflective of the reality.  What is very concerning is that this legislation that has passed the D&aacute;il and which the Government is trying to pass through this House has been drafted to regulate the IAA, and yet, the Minister of State told us the people who are assisted her in drafting the legislation to regulate IAA are, indeed, in the IAA.  </p> <p>Looking at the Department's response to the AAIU, it cited that Department of Transport does not have any in-house expertise.  It has contracted aviation expertise available to it, which is great.  However, the recent examples the Minister of State cited of the Department&rsquo;s engagement of expertise to assign or advise on the framing of search and rescue provisions for the Air Navigation and Transport Bill raises the question of who the adviser was for the rest of this Bill.  The Minister of State just outlined that the people she relied upon to draft this entirely new regulation and legislation to govern not only our aviation industry but the State authority that is manned to make sure that industry lives up to the standard we expect were the very people who are employed by the regulatory authority the legislation is supposed to be guiding.  I hope the Minister of State can tell me that somebody else, whether contracted or not, advised the drafters &ndash; be they in the Department or on the Attorney General&rsquo;s team &ndash; relied on more than the expertise in the IAA to draft legislation that is responsible for governing the IAA.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not even putting the fox in charge of the henhouse.

It is vitally important that the IAA is staffed with experts in all aspects of aviation in order that it can do the job we are legislating for it to do.</p> <p>However, moving on from what Senator Doherty has said, I still have not got an answer today as to whether the Department of Transport has an aviation expert on its staff.  I do not care how many contractors, consultants or anything else there are.  I will come back to the IAA's input into the legislation in a few moments.  I want a simple "Yes" or "No".  Do we have an expert in the Department of Transport, employed by the Department of Transport, paid by the State, paying his or her PRSI, contributing to his or her pension for public service?  Do we have such an expert on the Department's staff?</p></speech>

I think we need to be able to proceed.  All of us agree safety is paramount.  The Bill provides as follows: it shall be the duty of the company to provide assistance and advice as the Minister may require; it shall be the duty of the company to give the Minister such information as may be specified; and it shall be the duty of the company to permit the Minister to have access to all documents which are under its control.  The Minister of State has made it quite clear.  It is contained within the legislation dealing with the demands and requests of the IAA, to be fair to the Minister of State.</p></speech>

The Acting Chairperson must excuse me for a moment.  The question is very clear.  Who with technical and legal expertise and with aviation expertise assisted the Minister of State and the Department with drafting the legislation?  That is a very clear question.  If the Minister of State is relying on the experts in the IAA we have a serious issue with regard to legislation that has been drafted by a body for that body itself.  It is as if we were drafting legislation on meat plants and went down to one of the meat barons and asked him or her to give us a hand with it.  It is outrageous.</p></speech>

I know the Minister of State thinks I am trying to talk down the Bill.  I am not.  I want this Bill passed.  However, if there is a question mark over the drafting of the Bill as to who was involved, then as a parliamentarian I am obliged to follow through and get answers to that question.  It is a simple "Yes" or "No" answer.  Do they have an aviation expert on their staff?  I can answer it here myself from the Air Accident Investigation Unit, AAIU, report which states that it is still under consideration.  If the answer is "No", the Minister of State should just simply say "No" and let us move on to the next section.</p></speech>

The Department on two occasions accepted every single recommendation that was put to it yet we are still standing here with probably the biggest piece of legislation we are going to conduct for the aviation industry and the Minister of State is telling us that the experts who came to be relied upon to draft this legislation are the very people we are looking to regulate in the industry.  It does not make any sense.  It really undermines the authority of the Department that they are drafting legislation to govern a State body that has been providing the Department with all the information.  It would not happen in any other Department or sector.  It galls me that the Minister of State would stand here and think it is okay.</p></speech>

Not in our wildest imagination can we believe that the Minister of State has responded.  The only thing I know now is that the Minister of State has told us there were consultants involved and that the IAA was involved in the drafting of this legislation.  The Department is asking the people we want to regulate to draft the legislation.  Let us get serious here.  We should have total separation between those who are to be regulated and those who are writing the regulations.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer referred to section 59 in respect of the advice the IAA will provide to the Minister.  That has nothing to do with the legislation, it is after the legislation is passed.  The IAA has a role in advising whichever Minister is in power as to various things with respect to aviation.  The IAA is the regulatory body for which we are passing legislation through this House.  If we cannot satisfy ourselves that there is a clear separation between the IAA and the drafters of the legislation, I want to know who drafted the legislation.  If it was in-house people in the Department and there is no aviation expertise, then where are we going?</p></speech>

However, with all due respect to the Minister of State, I think there are questions that have come to light.  The last time we were having this conversation, I accepted that Departments will seek outside expertise.  That happens in lots of Departments.  Many organisations will hire consultants who have the expertise that is not in-house.</p> <p>What I am seeming to hear today, however, is that the Minister of State will not confirm that it was in-house or, if it was not in-house, which consultant it was.  There is nothing commercially sensitive in saying we used this consultant who has this expertise.  It would be for the benefit of everyone if we could just know who gave the aviation expertise.</p> <p>I do not think there is anything wrong in seeking expertise if it is not there in-house.  However, we deserve to know who provided it.  Saying the Attorney General drafted the legislation, with all due respect to the Office of the Attorney General, they are legal experts and will draft legal documentation but they do not have the aviation expertise.  Somebody had to be feeding aviation expertise into this Bill and it is important that we know who that was.</p></speech>

It is not about recreating the regulatory framework.  In respect of the expert input, that was sought for the search and rescue.  As I have said, the parliamentary draftsperson from the Office of the Attorney General provided drafting advice and the Department officials worked with the IAA, which has all of that technical expertise that I outlined earlier.  This is about a structural change within the regulatory framework.</p> <p>It is important to say that the IAA is an independent body.  What we want to do here is ensure that this legislation is in line with best practice across the world and across Europe.  The aim of today's debate is to get that over the line and to talk through all the amendments that are of concern to Senators.</p></speech>

The bit we are stuck on does.  The bit we have been talking about for months now in this House and externally at private meetings is all about regulation.  The charge in the letter today from IALPA that was received by the Minister of State and copied to all of us is that the only expert advice the Minister has received with regard to responding to the changes of regulation in the Bill is by the very body that should be providing that regulatory system under the law we are talking about.  What we have now is the tail wagging the dog.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is not acceptable in any way, shape or form.</p><p>I am grateful to Senator Craughwell.  What we have established today is that, despite the AAIU putting forward clear recommendations, there is a clear deficiency in the Department of Transport in that it does not have any aviation experts.  Imagine a Department with responsibility for transport not having an aviation expert but buying the services of one every time that is required.  When the Department needs it in the context of regulatory changes that are being suggested in what is the first Bill designed to regulate the aviation industry in a long time, the body that it took advice from as to whether it would accept or not accept something - whether it was needed or not needed - is the body we are seeking to legislate in respect of today.  That is beyond comprehension.  It really is not acceptable.</p></speech>

On the website the other day, the Minister of State's spokesperson indicated on the Minister's behalf that the recommendation was accepted.  This is boasting in respect of recommendations 29 and 31.  The relevant statement goes on to say that the Department will buy expertise as and when it needs it and does not see the relevance of having somebody contracted 40 hours a week - week in and week out - as being of benefit to it.  That is not in progress.  Putting a last line on a recommendation where people lost their lives to say that the matter will be reviewed periodically and the Department will get back to us is not taking seriously the recommendations that were made by the AAIU.  The Minister of State can dress it up or down as she likes, but it is not.</p></speech>

What would happen if we decided in the morning that we would take the approach of putting a couple of pilots onto the board of the IAA who are also flying for some company or other?  What sort of regulation would we have then?  That is what we are talking about here.  We are talking about mixing the regulated with the regulator.  That is fundamentally wrong.</p> <p>The staff of the Attorney General's office, as my colleague said, are experts in the legality of drafting legislation.  Who is the person in the Department of Transport who drafted this legislation and what expertise did he or she have?  He or she could have listened to the IAA.  If the IAA was holding the pen, however, we have a serious problem.  This Bill should not progress until we find out exactly who is who and what is what in the context of the drafting.</p> <p>The Acting Chairperson wants to push this forward and the Minister of State wants to push it forward.  God knows, everybody wants to push it forward.  It would be wrong of us to push forward flawed legislation, however.  If there is a conflict of interest somewhere, then the Bill is deeply flawed.

I am obliged to do it.  We are talking about safety.  Already, in this country, four people lost their lives.  The Department of Transport was damned to hell in the report relating to that accident in the context of its failure to have proper oversight.  So was the IAA, but to a lesser degree because it was not sure of its responsibility in the area.  We have to be realistic.  We cannot ignore what has happened in the past.  Those who do not remember the past are destined to relive it.</p> <p>By God, if we were to allow this legislation go forward knowing in our heart of hearts that it was written by the very people who we are setting out to regulate, it would be wrong in every sense of the word.  I will not be bullied or bamboozled into changing my position until I get an answer.  I believe I am entitled to that.  If I get that answer, I will run through this legislation as quickly as possible.  However, I am not running through legislation that was written by those for whom we are trying to legislate.  It would be wrong to do so.  Do not tell me, in all your years of experience, that you would feel any different from me, Acting Chairperson.</p></speech>

The amendments that have caused the delay to this legislation progressing in the past number of months are all about giving powers of regulation to the IAA.  I am mindful as to why the Minister of State indicated that she took on board contracted special aviation expertise in her dealings with the IAA.  Whether it is the IAA's own functions or whether it was with regard to developing information in respect of search and rescue, which is a different topic but which is related to the same recommendation, the Department did not feel the need to take on external contracted expertise other than the IAA in order to respond to all of these regulatory amendments tabled in respect of the Bill.</p> <p>I am of the view that we have a legal conflict of interest.  I would be minded to suspend the sitting in order that we, as Members, can take legal advice as to whether we are doing something that involves a breach of trust between two authorities.  The Department of Transport is supposed to be governing the other; it is a not a case of the other governing the Department.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1648" speakername="Emer Currie" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#BBB00400"><p>In section 7, we were discussing the understandable reasons employees would want 100% pay cover, as well as the understandable burden on small employers who are already very concerned about having to pay 70% of the statutory sick pay in addition to the replacement cover.  This was brought to my attention by the Local Jobs Alliance that consists of small, local and family-run businesses, including the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, the Retail Grocery Dairy and Allied Trades Association, RGDATA, Irish Small and Medium Enterprises, ISME, the Vintners Federation of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners Association, and the Restaurants Association of Ireland.</p> <p>One can understand how we keep coming back to the point about getting the balance right.  The Local Jobs Alliance suggested the idea of a rebate.  I am aware reference has been made in the Bill to an employer's inability to pay, but employers are talking about situations in which they could provide documentary evidence that an extra employee was paid for during the period of sick leave in order to ensure that there is no interruption to business activities.  They make the point that any rebate could be viewed as an allocation of the employer PRSI and not an additional cost to the Exchequer.  I am aware we are on Committee Stage, but is that something the Department and the Minister of State would consider and potentially bring forward on Report Stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.301" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#BBB00500"><p>I understand why there is a push for employees to have 100% cover.  However, as Senator Currie said, it is about striking a balance, particularly for small childcare providers.  In order to open a room to provide childcare spaces for parents, employers have to meet staff to children ratios, therefore, they have to have cover.  They do not have room to avoid making sure that there is staff cover in place.  Presumably they will get it and, thankfully, there will be moves in that direction also.</p> <p>For small childcare providers, there is the situation whereby they would have to provide 100% of the payment cover.  In that regard, I appeal to the Minister of State to consider the idea of a rebate as put forward by the Local Jobs Alliance, which Senator Currie mentioned.  In mandatory situations where cover is required, there should be a rebate when it is obvious and provable that cover had to be provided.</p> <p>In starting off with 70% until everybody gets used to this measure, perhaps we could review this in a number of years and see how it is working.  In the context of some very small employers having to absorb this as a costs, I again ask the Minister of State to consider the possibility of a rebate.</p></speech>

There is overwhelming support for the general thrust of the Bill.  It is about bringing in sick pay for employees who never had the option of it to date.</p> <p>While there is goodwill, I too support the call from the Local Jobs Alliance, about which my colleagues, Senators Currie and Seery Kearney have spoken, and ask the Minister of State to consider its suggestion.  I know we could bring forward an amendment on Report Stage if we thought it would work.  When the T&aacute;naiste was before the Seanad, he said that the Department was willing to consider looking at the whole rebate scheme side of it.  This is especially relevant for smaller employers, many of whom have had such a burden during Covid, and now with the war ongoing, there are so many extra costs involved.  While the employers are willing to pay employee sick pay that will be phased in over time, some of them are still not back up and running fully.  The Minister of State might not be able to look at this matter today, but if he could come back to us on this or take it into consideration, it would be appreciated.</p></speech>

From talking to constituents who own and operate small and medium-sized enterprises, we understand there is a concern about the costs of this to the employer as well.  I know I spoke earlier about the employee, and it might be said that I am riding both horses, but I am not.  I am conscious of the burden we are putting on the employer while recognising we need employees as well.  I am talking about people who own and operate small and medium-sized enterprises in the hospitality sector or the construction sector, including in subcontracting, and who provide services to people and in communities.</p><p>The important issue is the rebate.  Before Covid, hard-pressed businesses were under pressure - bh&iacute; siad faoi bhr&uacute; - and, post Covid, they still are.  There is a need to look at what the small or medium-sized enterprise gives us in its contribution to the local economy and employment.  We are looking to ensure that, if possible, no additional financial exposure is imposed on them and no burden is imposed on the Exchequer.  We should consider the principle of the rebate option for small and medium-sized businesses.  I know the Minister of State is open to engagement.</p><p>We are talking about the convenience store, the newsagent, the grocer, the retail sector in general, the vintners, the licensed premises and the restaurants.  We are conscious that in some cases these businesses operate antisocial hours.  When we are all out having a good time, these people are working and providing services we avail of.</p><p>I am digressing for a moment, which I know I have a habit of doing, but part of the problem with the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, is that to be asked to come in to work at 3 o'clock in the morning, for example, a very unsociable hour, and to perform duties in a pressurised environment requires not only great skill and great training but also proper remuneration.</p><p>I have made my point.  The Minister of State knows what I am saying.  I support my colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.305" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#CCC00200"><p>I spoke earlier to amendment No. 17.  There is an important point here.  We have heard Senators speak about the impact on and the cost to businesses and justify the payment of 70% of the daily rate.  I remain absolutely opposed to that because low-paid workers cannot afford to go out sick on 70% of the daily rate.  To pick up on something Senator Seery Kearney talked about, we know that in the childcare sector many childcare workers earn barely above the minimum wage, often just over &euro;12 per hour.  They cannot afford to be out sick and to get less than their full daily rate because they do not have any spare capacity.  They need everything they earn in a week to cover their bills.  We need to keep coming back to who the Bill is for.  It is for low-paid workers.  We are not acting in their interests by applying a 70% rate.  I appeal to those Senators who justify the 70% rate to support amendment No. 17 in order that those who are paid only 70% of their daily rate at least get enough to cover the cost of going to the doctor.  Those Senators have had their chance to support amendments to review the requirement for medical certification.  They have chosen to say that every worker going out on sick leave should need a medical certificate on day one.  I now appeal to those Senators to make sure that a minimum daily rate is set such that such workers will at least be able to cover the cost of going to the doctor.  Otherwise, there is no point; they will have to go into work sick because they will earn less than the cost of going to the doctor, as we said earlier.</p></speech>

I wish to highlight something that came up at a meeting of the tourism committee today.  We are talking about low-paid workers.  To be clear, the call from Sinn F&eacute;in is that the full daily rate of sick pay is paid.  What the Government might not be aware of is that, according to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, whose statistics I do not doubt, 68% of people who work in the hospitality sector earn less than &euro;12 per hour.  That is seven in ten workers in that sector.  It is a disgraceful figure, but that is the fact of the matter.  If this Bill is to work for low-paid workers, it certainly will not work if the State is to pay 70% of a rate of pay that is less than &euro;12 an hour.  We can and must do better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#CCC00400"><p>I will try to cover most the points raised.  I had a note on some of the points made earlier but, for the life of me, I cannot find it, so if I do not answer some of the Senators' points, I ask them to throw them back at me and I will try to come back on them.  I do not where I put my note.</p> <p>Before turning to the amendments, an issue was made earlier of amendments not being accepted by the Government.  I wish to be absolutely clear that the Government does not decide which amendments are appropriate and which are not.  We can speak to amendments and we can agree or disagree, but that is done independently of us.  Senators can nod or wink all they want, but I am absolutely clear on that.  I have no role as a Minister of State in deciding what is ruled in or out of order.  The Chair might wish to clarify that.  It is unfair of Members to put such comments on the record because they know I do not and cannot, as a Minister of State, decide such matters.  I wish to be very clear on that.  I am happy to discuss any amendment.  People know that I will talk all day.  I certainly would not rule anybody's amendment in or out.  That is not my job.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 14 to 18, inclusive, would require sick leave to be paid at a person's full rate of pay.  This is, in the Government's view, likely to have a disproportionate impact on SMEs, particularly those in the service sector.  We have tried to give the greatest certainty possible to employers in setting out our plans.  We cannot support these amendments.  We spoke about this quite a lot earlier and on other Stages of the Bill.  We understand that this is bringing in a new statutory sick pay scheme.  It is an additional cost to employers.  Let us be very clear about that.  We can discuss different rates of pay and so on, but the cost of this will fall to employers.  At the moment, employees do not have a statutory sick pay scheme in many cases.  They do not have access to this at all.  We want to bring this in and we believe a rate of 70% is appropriate.  I have said it before and I will say it again: we can keep an eye on this, we will monitor and review it as we go along and we can discuss it because it is in regulation.  I will come back to that point in a minute.  We think it is important it is kept in regulation.  If at some stage it is decided it should change, it is easier to do so in regulation than in primary legislation.  We think 70% is appropriate to get that balance right because we value these jobs.  We value the companies, no matter what sector they are in, whether childcare, hospitality, retail or any other sector.  There are different rates of pay.  These jobs, as well as employees, have to be protected.  We look for the balance there and we believe that 70% is a balance.</p> <p>As for amendment No. 17, setting an absolute minimum amount could give rise to some strange effects for employees who work short hours.  For example, if a person is due to work for three or four hours, their employer could end up having to pay them more for a sick day than they would be entitled to on a normal working day.  That is an anomaly put forward if a minimum amount is set.  We are setting a minimum rate.  The former would be a clearly unfair result, so I cannot accept amendment No. 17.  In general, the regulation will deal with the 70% rate.  We think it is appropriate.  We will review this legislation.  We have always said that.  We will keep it in play and we can look at it again and focus on it if need be and if Members so wish.  The legislation will provide for a replacement rate of 70% of gross salary for a duration of three working days in a calendar year, coupled with a 70% rate of pay.  The application of a daily earnings cut-off point of &euro;110 will ensure that employers do not face excessive costs and that jobs are not jeopardised.  We genuinely believe we are getting the balance right on that.  We can discuss this all night.  We will not necessarily agree on it.  It is important we discuss it.</p> <p>Senator Gavan, I think, referred to a debate earlier during which I spoke about the minimum wage and said that less than 10% of the people in this country are on the minimum wage.  It could be 7% or 8%.  I am open to correction.  I did not say they were on &euro;12 or &euro;13; I referred to the minimum wage.  We are committed as a Government to bringing the minimum wage up to a living wage.  As a country and a Government, we are setting out a roadmap on that.  We are happy to pursue that over the coming years in conjunction with these Houses.  It is important we do that too.</p> <p>As for the costs to employers, I have engaged quite a lot with employers over the past year and a half through this discussion.  The issue of replacement costs for some sectors is there already.  It is not really an issue.  If they are using agency workers, there might be an extra charge in that regard.  That is an issue.  Childcare, which has been referred to, is a difficulty.  We can look at that again.  Section 10 provides that if an employer can prove that he or she genuinely cannot afford to pay for this, there is a route to go down, as there is with the minimum wage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not very often used, although it is there as a mechanism and it is in this legislation as well.  We spoke earlier about the whole area of the extra costs on employers and getting that balance right.  This is an extra cost on employers and we have to be very careful that it does not impact jobs and erode jobs.  Naturally, we will be keeping that under review as well.  I spoke on Committee Stage and the T&aacute;naiste also spoke in the D&aacute;il around trying to see if there is some way in which we could assist where we can genuinely see employers are under pressure.</p><p>With regard to the amendments in the group, speakers referred to the Local Jobs Alliance.  My understanding from some of the correspondence is that this focuses beyond the three days.  When it increases to the five days and eventually to the ten days that we are committed to, that becomes a major issue for them.  Some say they could probably handle the three-day cost but as it goes to five days, seven days and ten days, it becomes a major cost.  It is something we should continue to engage on.  I cannot commit to making changes here but we have said we will look at this.</p><p>Similar to the conversation earlier around the 70% and the maximum of &euro;110, we are trying to get the balance right.  We think a gradual increase over four years makes it doable for businesses and they would accept that.  If we brought in the ten days straightaway, which would be extreme, it would put extreme pressure on businesses and the SME sector.  It would not be manageable and would jeopardise jobs.  We have tried to bear in mind the pressures the sector has been under for the last couple of years and the current high-cost environment.  It is a difficult time.  Bringing it in in stages over four years is appropriate and should ease it in for businesses.</p><p>We recognise this is putting extra costs on businesses and it is something we will keep under review.  As the T&aacute;naiste said before and I will say again, we will monitor this to see if we need to work with the various sectors to bring in some sort of assistance.  That is something we will deal with as we go along.  We think we have the balance right but I am aware some sectors are under a lot of pressure to absorb these costs.  I have made the case that for smaller businesses, any increases in costs, even in the minimum wage alone, can take a few thousand euro off profits at the end of the year, and those profits might not be excessive and they might even be taken from the wage of the employer.  We are conscious that they cannot always pass on the costs.</p><p>Likewise, the sick pay scheme is increasing costs.  We will commit to reviewing that.  This was raised on Committee Stage and we said we would track it to see if there is a way to deal with it.  Similar to the cost of healthcare and the cost of a GP, it is possibly a conversation that is outside this legislation and it might be had through our business development agencies and jobs agencies, and it would have to be discussed across different Departments.  We have held the view that it does not really belong in this legislation.  Nonetheless, I understand what the ask is and that there should be assistance.  It is very similar to the ask to reduce the costs of a GP.  We are all trying to get a balance.  As we pursue reducing the cost of access to a GP, on one side, which I would say does not belong in the legislation, on the other side, supports for businesses and SMEs are something we have to work on as well.  Many supports are provided by the taxpayer through all of the various agencies and through the Department to assist businesses and jobs, but that discussion might not belong in this legislation.  I hope that is of assistance.</p><p>On the last point, I do not know why the Senator said the legislation is written assuming that someone is not going to be sick.  That is not written anywhere in the legislation.  The Senator made a comment earlier around the 70% that it is as if we are assuming somebody is not sick and is looking for this.  We are not assuming that at all and I want to be very clear on that.  The legislation in no way gives that impression.</p></speech>

It is important that the Government offers support to small and medium enterprise owners and employers because they are the backbone of our communities.  Without them, we would have a very different economic outlook today.</p> <p>On the wider picture of the summer economic statement and the forthcoming budget, I made the point that it is incumbent upon us in this House, even though we have no direct role in the budget itself, to have a debate in advance of the budget.  Sometimes, all we hear is a particular voice shouting and articulating a particular proposition but, on the whole, we, as a Government, need to look out for and support small and medium enterprises &ndash; I note that Senator Casey is an employer too.  We saw what happened with Covid and we have seen this in other parts of the world with regard to enterprise.  We need to be pro-enterprise.  The Minister of State and the T&aacute;naiste have been very proactive around small and medium enterprises and we need to keep that going.</p> <p>There is a balance that needs to be struck.  We need to have the support of the people I and other speakers have mentioned.  Senator Seery Kearney made reference to childcare, as did Senator Sherlock.  It is important that we also have this discussion.  As a former Chairman of the committee dealing with children&rsquo;s affairs, I know that is an area we need to go back to in terms of offering further supports.  To be fair, Senator Seery Kearney has been very proactive on the childcare industry in this House and in the committee.</p> <p>This Bill and the next Bill on the schedule today are two good bills for workers, and we should not forget that either.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 1 means that the Minister will be defined for the purpose of the Bill as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is required because of the new provisions we are inserting requiring a review of the Bill once it is enacted and in force for more than a year.  The new section 9 provides a review clause for the Bill.  It will be reviewed after one year in operation when employers, employees and customers will have an experience of how the legislation works in practice.  The review must be completed within six months and laid before the Oireachtas.  It will help us determine what changes, if any, may be required.  That was an ask at an early stage, that it would have a built-in review.  That is there now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#FFF02100"><p>In regard to the new section under 4D it provides that if an employer describes a mandatory charge as a "service charge" or a similar term in a tips and gratuities notice or, for example, on a restaurant menu, the employer must treat the charge as if it was a tip or gratuity received by electronic mode of payment.  That means that the service charge must be distributed to staff in a fair and reasonable way.  This does not restrict a business from imposing charges which form part of that business's normal revenues.  It simply prohibits it from describing it as a service charge.  Businesses remain free to impose a cover charge or a table charge, however they wish to describe such additional charges, provided the description does not give rise to a reasonable expectation from customers that the charge concerned is distributed to staff.  This is consistent with a key aim of the Bill which is to introduce greater transparency for customers and avoid confusion as to what constitutes a service charge.  The clarity for customers and staff is a key aim of the Bill and is a key aim of what Senators want from the initial discussions.  All of the other amendments are necessary corrections to internal cross-references if the Seanad agrees to insert this new section.</p> <p>I will speak in general about what we are trying to achieve here with all the other amendments.  I think we are at one in what we are trying to achieve.  I will make a brief observation that the Government amendments proposed today and the amendments Senators are proposing are really quite similar in intent.  They are just using different methods to achieve the same end result.  We want to make sure that customers and workers in the hospitality sector, in particular, are clear on what a service charge is, that is, a charge that benefits staff above and beyond the minimum contractual terms, and that is whether it is discretionary or mandatory - in short, that it is very like a tip or gratuity except that it is not always discretionary.  We want to make sure that where something is described as a "service charge" in the sector, customers and staff have a reasonable expectation that staff will receive it.</p> <p>We do not want to be heavy-handed and require massive amounts of signage apart from anything else that could be an eyesore in some settings, but I understand why people want to make it very clear what this is about so we think changing the definitions is the best way to do it.  We want the reasonable expectations of customers and staff to be met and to have a mechanism for complaints to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p> <p>I hope Senators will look favourably on the Government amendments which are designed to enhance the clarity for everyone.  If it is called a "service charge" in any shape or form, then it is expected that it is included in the tips and gratuities.  What we are saying is that you can have other charges that are clearly defined, but not related to service.</p></speech>

It is good that there has been a real consultation on the key issue of the service charge.</p> <p>I will begin by introducing our colleagues in the Gallery this evening.  They are Joe Cunningham, general secretary of SIPTU, Fiona Dunne from the ONE Movement and Clem Shevlin from SIPTU.  They are here specifically to listen to the debate on this Stage because they played a leading role in the campaign around my tips Bill in the previous Seanad and in the context of ensuring respect and dignity for workers in the sector.  The trade union movement deserves a huge amount of credit for the campaign it has built behind the issue of tips justice and, related to that, the very important issue of the service charge.</p> <p>I do not mind which amendments are passed in order to achieve the goal I hope we all want to see being realised, namely, an end to what has been the scandal of service charges.  A host of large restaurant chains operating in this city slap on service charges that customers may well think have been going to the staff when that has not been the case.  Unfortunately, we are all familiar with some hotels, and I stress some, that also slap on a service charge once there are six people in a group.  I can tell the House, from first-hand experience as someone who has worked as a trade union official and worked in this sector, that all too often those charges were unfortunately not passed on to the people who earned them, that is, those who delivered the service.</p> <p>It has been a long journey.  The original tips Bill, which was a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, had a broad campaign of support behind it, including from the Labour Party and the Civil Engagement Group.  That started five years ago.  It was frustrating to see our Bill blocked by a money message, and quite a cynical one, in the previous D&aacute;il.  That said, the point to make is that there was a major campaign and a head of steam built up around this issue.  It simply did not go away.  It featured in the general election campaign, and that was where we got commitments, I think from all parties, to deal with the issue.  Therefore, we are pleased to see this Bill.</p> <p>We are pleased about Committee Stage because we had a good exchange of views on Second Stage and, in fairness, the Government said it would listen and take on board our concerns about the service charge.  I am sure I will not be the only person to mention this but the key aspect pointed out to us was that the origin of service charges in Dublin was after a strike by trade union workers in the sector who needed a decent pay rise.  The solution to that was the introduction of a service charge that was distributed by trade unions.  That was the origin of the service charge in Dublin in 1951.  I will not be the only one to credit Norman Croke for that, but he has fought ferociously and lobbied a number of us on this issue.  I pay tribute to Dr. Deirdre Curran, who, as an academic, has done fantastic work in this sector.</p> <p>I remind colleagues of a point I made a few minutes ago.  We still have huge issues in this sector.  According the Government's own body, 68% of workers in the sector earn less than &euro;12 per hour.  The solution to that is a joint labour committee, JLC.  If the Government wants this sector to be one in which people can have decent careers and look forward to pay progression and respect, then we need to reinstitute a JLC to make that happen.  Surely none of us can accept a sector in which, according to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, 70% of workers, or seven out of every ten, earn less than &euro;12 per hour.  That is not a sector people can have careers in.  There is a bigger conversation to be had on that, but I welcome the fact the Government has listened.</p> <p>I pay tribute to those in the trade union movement who led this campaign from the start.  We will do good work tonight to ensure decent legislation on tips.  There are one or two other points I will raise during the course of the debate, but this is something of which we can all be proud.</p></speech>

I grew up and spent all my life in this industry.  I have been an employee and an employer; I have been on both sides of the fence in respect of the matter to which the Bill relates.  I have seen the distribution of tips in many forms, guises and modules in many hotels and restaurants.  Some tips are divided equally and some are divided unequally.  I have had good experiences and bad, but as a person involved in the industry, it is disappointing that we have had to introduce legislation around tipping within the industry.  It is disappointing that we had to do this and that there are people who are abusing the system.  I am not denying that.  Most of the people in the hotel and restaurant industry treat tips properly and try to distribute them fairly.  Sometimes I have had to create inventive schemes where a tip would go all the way down through the services.  However, there are some people the tips do not actually get to, namely, the person in the kitchen washing the pots or filling the dishwasher or the one working upstairs or in the reception.  They do not have access to the same level of tips as a waiter or waitress.  In my time in the industry, I have always tried to come up with a group scheme that everybody contributed to and then we tried to divide it out equally.  It does not really work that way.</p><p>I accept this legislation.  It clarifies a lot of stuff, and I have no major issue with it.  When I was in college and was working in some of the bigger hotels in Dublin, there were two service charges.  There was a 2.5% booking service charge and then some hotels had a 10% or 12.5% service charge on top of that.  As a result, people were paying between 12.5% and 15% in service charges.</p><p>I am going to reiterate something I said on Second Stage.  We are opening a can of worms with this legislation.  I need people to look a little bit further down the road.  We have not defined what a tip is in the context of the Finance Act.  This means that these tips, which will now probably be electronically controlled in most situations, will be available to Revenue.  Consequently, they will probably be exposed to tax at some point, which is not the case at present.  I said that maybe we should have defined a tip as a gift because it is defined in the Finance Act, and then it would not be subject to taxation down the road.  I have a genuine concern that at some point in the future Revenue will look at all tips as a revenue stream and they will be taxed.  I am just saying that here.  I said it openly on the previous occasion and I am saying it openly again today.  This is what this Bill is doing.  We have nearly moved to a situation where payments are made electronically.  Most tips are now tracked electronically.  That information is available to Revenue.  The hospitality sector must divide it by using some format that shows clear evidence it has been done.  I can see Revenue focusing in on this at some time in the future as a source of revenue from its point of view.</p><p>Senator Gavan referred to the JLC.  I spoke about the JLC on Second Stage.  As a person who had to take over my father's business when he died suddenly at 57 years of age, I relied at the time on the JLC agreement to give me the rates of pay I should have in the industry and what I should be paying.  What the JLC also did was identify a higher rate of pay where people were working in non-tipping zones.  That is where I got the whole emphasis on a tip being shared across all the services, and not just by the waiter or the bartender.  It takes many people to deliver a service.  I have no problem with reintroducing a JLC.  It identifies the different services that are provided within the industry and applies a different rate to them.</p><p>On the minimum wage and the low rate of pay, I am not going to say it is not but we also have to acknowledge it from a hospitality industry and a tourism industry perspective.  Ours is a very labour-intensive industry.  Anywhere between 35% to 45% of your costs are labour costs.  That is quite significant against your turnover.  We talked about the Sick Leave Bill earlier.  For a company that has labour costs of 5%, having to pay sick pay is not a major concern.  In an industry like the service industry, however, where 35% to 45% of the cost is labour, then that is a much higher cost <i>pro rata</i>.  Our industry, the same as everybody in Irish society, is paying over and above what is being paid in the rest of Europe, be it for electricity, oil or insurance.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pat Casey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The input costs of the hospitality sector are quite stringent as well and the industry faces a lot of challenges.  It is not straightforward to state that we can simply pay the living wage.  You also must take the seasonality of hotels into consideration.  The labour costs of seasonal hotels are much higher than in hotels that operate at a certain level across 12 months of the year.  It is much easier to define your costs if your hotel is open 12 months a year and there is a regular income and sales level across that period.  Seasonal hotels are open for six months or nine months or for ten months and some weekends.</p><p>As a person from the industry, I am disappointed that this Bill had to be introduced.  I accept this legislation; I have no problem with it.  I have identified the key issue regarding revenue that will have to be dealt with down the road.  Equally, I note to Senator Gavan that I had no problem with the JLCs and I used them during my time in the industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#HHH00200"><p>I very much welcome this amendment.  I had the privilege of speaking on this on Second Stage when I touched on the fact that I am married to someone who worked in the hotel and hospitality industry and who was involved in the hotels, restaurants and catering branch of what was originally the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, ITGWU, which became SIPTU.  In that context, he avoided particular establishments around Dublin because their owners would dip into tips and use them for payment of wages.  How scandalous was that?  In my early experiences of dating him, he would not go into places but then gave me the history of the events in 1951 to which Senator Gavan has alluded, when an employee of a hotel was disciplined for eating in rather shameful circumstances.  Due to his low rate of pay, he ate from the discarded food of the hotel for which he was disciplined.  A strike arose from that, which resulted in a service charge being implemented.  That is the history of how the trade union movement was prepared to stand up for those workers and, consequently, a service charge came into being.</p> <p>I spoke about that on Second Stage and supported the contention regarding service charges that was made to the T&aacute;naiste in that debate.  I continued my advocacy afterwards to the T&aacute;naiste and I was advised that I needed some sort of evidence of the history.  Thankfully, a colleague of my husband, Norman Croke, who was a great trade union official, supplied me with his historical report of the hotels, restaurants, and catering branch's 75th anniversary, which tracked all of these changes and referred to the developments, security and standing of the service charge.  I am very pleased that this amendment is in place.  It is very necessary and right.  As it honours a custom and practice that has been in place for well over half a century, it is important that this amendment was brought in.  I am very grateful to the T&aacute;naiste for taking on board everything that was said to him by all parties, including the trade unions that met him.  It is a very important feature.  On the departure of those in the hospitality industry post Covid and the difficulty in getting workers, a JLC is possibly a solution to that.  I also think that is very good in that regard.</p> <p>I pay tribute to Norman Croke and to my husband, Dave Kearney, who never would have let me live it down had I not spoken up for service charges, and all of those who fought for services charges to be in place.  It is important that this is absolutely red-circled for the workers for which it is intended and for those of us who are the patrons of establishments and believed all along that service charges were going to staff.  Now we know that there are.  A couple of cases before the Workplace Relations Commission and we will make sure that everyone comes into line.</p></speech>

As Senator Seery Kearney said, we are here because of a collective effort and the input of so many.  Senator Gavan's tips Bill was a starting point and it acted as a catalyst.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the T&aacute;naiste, there was engagement and a willingness to listen to what we are speaking about.  Senator Seery Kearney used a great phrase "red-circled for the workers".  That is who we are here for today and who the Bill, whose interest is the employee, will benefit.</p> <p>We should reflect upon Senator Casey's contribution for a number of reasons.  I am probably one of the old-school people who does not use Revolut, does not like to pay in restaurants-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1637" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#HHH00500"><p>I do not mind paying but - I mean this with the best intention - I actually have a fear of paying a tip in a bill using a card and I actually refuse to do so.  I know I am old school and old fashioned and I put my hand up but Senator Casey's contribution reinforces that principle in my mind and my continued determination not to do that.  There is a myriad of reasons that we will not go into because it could open another Pandora's box.  Senator Casey made a fine point and we should reflect upon it.  In an ideal world, we would not be here because staff should be in receipt of the tip and service charge as a matter of form, but it is not so.</p> <p>We heard the history involved tonight.  Many people do not understand what the service charge is for and why they pay it, and I am glad that will change now.  I know we use the word "transparency" with abandon, but it is important that there is clarity in the Bill.</p> <p>The Bill brings positive news for hard-working staff in our hospitality sector.  To those watching or listening to the debate, I thank the staff who serve and wait tables, pull pints, work in hotels and the service industry, and work antisocial hours to give people a quality of service in our hospitality sector.  It is very easy for people to go onto Tripadvisor or social media to criticise establishments and staff.  I ask that they pay a ten-second delay before they put their fingers to the buttons.  They should remember that staff are working in pressurised environments and sometimes do not get everything right.   Nine times out of ten, the quality of the hospitality is phenomenal. </p> <p>We welcome that the money goes to the staff - that is the principle - but I ask that we reflect upon what Senator Casey said in the debate.  The Minister of State again showed the importance of listening and engaging.  At a time when the Government gets criticised for many things, the last two Bills today are an example of when the Government has engaged critically and has emerged with legislation that will benefit the worker, which is important.</p></speech>

I was certainly not rewriting Sinn F&eacute;in's Private Member's Bill.  To be clear, I do not think it was opposed on the grounds of money.  I think there were some technical difficulties at the time in 2017 or 2018.  In Senator Doherty's absence, I wish to mention that when she was the Minister with responsibility for social protection, she brought forward a Bill to replace and add to the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  A lot of work was done on that on Committee Stage and in pre-legislative scrutiny in the autumn of 2019, before the general election of 2020, which fed into this Bill and put us into a position to progress the Bill.  Everyone in the Chamber has played a part in this and I recognise that we do that as well.</p> <p>It is a positive Bill for an important sector in this country.  It is important that employees get their entitlements, which certainly should not be taken from them.  I also acknowledge that the majority of employers do the right thing but, like any legislation we bring forward, this Bill deals with those who do not.  For those who have been doing the right thing up to now, the Bill will not change much in how they operate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will not change much in terms of how they operate, but those who are not will have to review their operations, and rightly so.  We will deal with some more amendments later but I think we all agree with the main aims of this Bill.  That is what the T&aacute;naiste brought forward in February in Second Stage.  He undertook to look at the concerns raised in this House.  It was important that the legislation started in this House and continued the work of Senator Doherty.  We will finish here, bring it to the D&aacute;il and try to have it dealt with before the summer.  That is what we are trying to do.  I want to acknowledge and thank all involved for the agreement to work on this Bill to try to get it finished tonight.  That will help to put this in place over the summer for those who are in the sector.</p><p>It is an important sector.  I might get a chance to say more later on, but it is one I worked in for many years.  I value my time in it.  However, we have much to do in making it a career of choice and a long-term career where people can earn a good wage and support their families.  The joint labour committee, JLC, method is one way of doing it.  It was there in the past but has not been used.  Like other sectors, I value the JLC..  We see the benefits of it with childcare.  We should look an employment regulation order, ERO.  We should also look at the training and supports.  I made very clear here before that I am happy that my Department works with Department of Education, the Department of Social Protection and the industry to try to bring forward new initiatives to make this a very valuable sector.</p><p>There is much pressure there to fill vacancies.  I would rather we did that with people who are already living in Ireland or certainly within the EU.  At the moment, there is an awful lot of pressure to bring people in from beyond the EU to work in these roles.  If we all put our minds together to bring forward initiatives, we should be able to deal with that through quality training, expertise and skills development, as well as recognising that the opportunity to use innovation in the sector to be able to deal with some of the roles.  It is hard work and people are fully switched on.  You are on your feet and fully switched on in the hospitality sector, similar to retail.  We need to recognise that as well.  That is why it is important that while we have the conversation on the minimum wage, we are on that journey to a living wage.  That is something we will all agree with here.  I am glad the T&aacute;naiste has prioritised that in our work.</p><p>Similar to the Sick Leave Bill, this Bill is part of making sure that work always pays.  In this case, it is to recognise that if you earn a tip or gratuity, that you get it and it is not taken off your wages.  That is what this is about.  To be very clear, it would prohibit employers from using tips and gratuities to make up contractual rates of pay.  This ensures the tips and gratuities are additional to a worker&rsquo;s contractual earnings.  It also makes sure the key objective is that workers will be entitled to receive tips and gratuities paid in electronic forms, such as by debit or credit card, even though Senator Buttimer will still use cash.  That is fair enough and I am the same as him.  The Bill requires that these tips and gratuities should be distributed in a fair and transparent manner.  If there is a dispute, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, can adjudicate on whether the approach taken by an employer is fair and transparent.  That piece is key.  The WRC had observations on previous Bills and it was very clear and it fed into this one as well.  That is why some of the amendments are trying to make sure the WRC can do its work to police this.</p><p>Lastly, the Bill will require businesses to clearly display their policy on how tips, gratuities and mandatory charges are distributed.  This transparency is to the benefit of employees and customers and to the good employers who do it right.</p><p>I would have assumed, to be honest, having worked in the sector, that people knew that a service charge was not necessarily a tip or gratuity.  I discovered during this Bill and over the past year&rsquo;s debates on this that most people thought the opposite and assumed that it was a tip that the staff were getting.  I am delighted and proud that this legislation is clarifying that.  Having been in the sector, I knew what it was.  However, I discovered the majority thought they were actually giving people a tip and recognising quality service.  It is important that is clarified as well.  I thank the Senators for the time.  We have more amendments to go through, so I do not want hog it.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is being very proactive and progressive in the work permit area as is the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, in the whole area of apprenticeships.  Yesterday the Minister, Deputy Harris, announced a new apprenticeship programme.  He specifically mentioned chefs and executive chefs.  The Minister of State made the point about these jobs being a career.  The whole issue of post leaving certificate, PLC, courses, further education and apprenticeships is one that we should have a serious debate in this House on and how we can use them as a pathway to a sustainable career for people in the hospitality sector.  I know the Minister, Deputy Harris, has broadened apprenticeship programmes.  We have seen the PLC courses being expanded and the different levels under FETAC.  In the context of the apprenticeship scheme, perhaps after the summer, we should have a debate about how we make the hospitality sector, in particular, a sustainable career for people who want work in that sector on a long-term basis.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 3 proposes that &ldquo;mandatory service charge&rdquo; be renamed &ldquo;mandatory charge&rdquo;.  This reflects our decision to refine our approach to service charges and transparency.  Again, the T&aacute;naiste committed reviewing this since the Second Stage debate here in February.</p> <p>The definition will remain the same, but our view is that, in fact, the charges concerned do not have a clear and direct link with the service provided by employees.  As we already discussed, where a business describes something as a service charge, that creates a customer expectation that the charge is directly for the benefit of the staff.  The definition of &ldquo;mandatory service charge&rdquo; is broad and this was always intended as an anti-avoidance mechanism.  The direct link to service was always quite limited.  This change facilitates the policy adjustment we already discussed, restricting the use of the term &ldquo;service charge&rdquo; in certain context.  Amendments Nos.10, 13, 40, 58, 60, 70 and 72 are consequential amendments to ensure the term &ldquo;mandatory charge&rdquo; will be used throughout the Bill.</p> <p>On the service charge in other sectors, just to be very clear, it is important to note the provisions of the Bill will not apply to all sectors.  They will be applied by means of ministerial regulation where it is appropriate to do so.  They will be applied only to areas where tips and gratuities are a regular feature and where there is significant customer uncertainty as to what a service charge is for.  Nothing will change for utility bills, for example, because nobody expects a service charge for broadband to be like a tip or gratuity.  I think we are all on the same page here.  We are focusing on hospitality and that is what we are talking about here.  The regulations are there to reflect that.</p> <p>If the Chair wants me to go into the other amendments tabled, I can deal with them all.</p></speech>

It also provides that employers may not retain any share of tips or gratuities received by the employer electronically, unless such retention is required or permitted by law.</p> <p>Employers who regularly do the same kind of work as their employees may also retain a fair and reasonable share of electronic tips, proportionate to their work.  This is the policy already set out in the Bill, but this amendment better clarifies that intent.  I hope it is clear to everybody what we are trying to achieve there.  </p> <p>Section 4B(1) is broadly in line with section 5 of the Payment of Wages Act 1991.  There is no offence provision under section 5 and therefore there should also be also no offence provision in respect of section 4B(1).  This is a technical amendment, but I can assure Senators that it does not prevent appropriate enforcement action by the WRC.  </p> <p>An amendment is required to section 4C(b) to clarify, by reference to section 4B, that the prohibition on an employer making a deduction only applies to employees&rsquo; electronic tips.  The only deductions from electronic tips that will be permitted by section 4C(b) will be those required by law or the fair or reasonable costs associated with processing payment of tips or gratuities made by electronic means.  I think that is fair and accepted.</p> <p>While employers will be required to include detail on how cash tips are dealt with when displaying their policy towards tips and gratuities, there will be no other regulation of cash tips.  The Workplace Relations Commission advises that this would be unenforceable due to the lack of an evidential trail in respect of cash tips.  The WRC has to be able to do its job to enforce this.  There has to be legislation that has enforcement as well.</p> <p>Senators Higgins and Black have jointly proposed amendments that would require mandatory service charges to be treated exactly the same way as tips and gratuities.  Senator Gavan proposed amendments also intended to achieve this.  The Government amendments are a safer and surer way of achieving this aim.  I hope that is accepted in good faith.  The reason for this is that the definition of &ldquo;mandatory service charge&rdquo;, or &ldquo;mandatory charge&rdquo;, as we will now call it, was deliberately very broad.  When the policy was that there would be no change at all in relation to mandatory charges, this was to support the transparency aims of the Bill.  It made sure that the notices required under the Bill would have to explain the purposes of each of those charges and that is still the case.  However, if we require the distribution of all charges, we will need to consider whether that definition is fit for purpose.  It will cover items such as function charges for weddings or similar events where extra staff are required to provide an adequate level of service or cover charges where a band is also playing.  The Government amendments are sufficient to address the reasonable expectations of customers and staff and are not unduly onerous for employers.  I would ask that the Senators accept our amendments and not press their own, because I think we are achieving the same thing.  However, I will hear the Senators&rsquo; views on that.  At this stage, perhaps I will hear the Senators' comments and then come back in on the rest.</p></speech>

There was quite a lot to go through.  With regard to mandatory services charges, as I have said I am very happy to accept the Government's amendments.  I do not mind and I am not precious about which amendments get the job done.  I acknowledge the fact there has been engagement on this.  We have what I regard as a good result on the mandatory service charge issue.</p> <p>I want to take issue with several other amendments that fall into this broad category.  This is where the Minister of State and I will disagree.  We should have included cash tips.  They were included in my original Bill.  Amendments Nos. 19 and 22 do speak to this.  We should do this because we know abuse has been carried out.  Our research showed that one in three tips were being withheld.  I acknowledge the fact that more and more we are moving towards electronic payments and certainly Covid has hastened this.  Where cash payments are involved we should be able to include them.  This is why we are pushing the amendments.  It is important for the staff concerned.</p> <p>I could cite several examples but I will not delay matters.  I will cite the example of people working in a hostelry in Connemara where the first drink was free when the tourists came in.  Of course the tourists were delighted and tipped on this basis.  The employer pocketed all of the tips because in effect that is how the drinks were being paid for.  The staff who served those drinks were not getting a cent.  This is one of several examples I could spend the rest of the evening going through.  I acknowledge what Senator Casey said and there are many good employers.  However, there are some awful abuses relating to cash payments in particular.  This is why it is important that the Bill could and should look at including them.</p> <p>Amendment No. 48 is on a curious point that Senators Higgins and Black have also spotted.  The amendment wants to delete a part of the Bill that allows an employer to deduct money from an employee to meet costs directly arising from paying tips or gratuities by means of electronic modes of payment.  I find this strange.  The Minister of State knows that most packages for electronic card and contactless machines are already paid for by the employer.  They are paid for so that customers can pay for goods and services.  I am sure covering the cost of these machines is factored into the cost of the goods and services sold by the employer.  To allow an employer deduct moneys from an employee to pay for these machines is unfair.  It is a strange and convoluted situation.  If we have the opportunity to fix this we should do so.  There is no justification for allowing employers to make this charge.  I am somewhat concerned that it could be open to abuse.</p></speech>

The service charges issue is a rare example of the Government taking on board a point raised on Second Stage and introducing an amendment.  I welcome this.  I am delighted Joe Cunningham, Fiona Dunne and Clem Shevlin are present.  It is through their campaigning that we have the Bill.</p> <p>Senator Casey made some very important points on the sector.  The Bill has to be the start and not the end of the conversation on what happens in the sector with regard to pay, training and careers.  The Government, employers and workplace representatives must have this conversation.  There are significant benefits from the much-needed VAT reductions for hospitality employers in many parts of the country.  We need a conversation about how we get better sustainable pay and conditions in the sector.</p> <p>I want to speak on amendments Nos. 44, 46 and 48.  Amendments Nos. 44 and 46 aim to tighten up the ban on the deduction of employees' wages in respect of tips and ensure the Bill also covers cash tips.  I heard what the Minister of State had to say on the Workplace Relations Commission and enforceability.  Setting out in legislation very clearly that the ban must also include cash tips is very important.  There is a gap in section 4C that bans tips and gratuities being used as justification to deduct from wages as it does not specifically mention or clarify that service charges are part of this.  The Bill is about sending out a message and clarity with regard to service charges.  As the Minister of State said, most people would be horrified to realise their service charge does not necessarily go into the pockets of those serving them.  These are important amendments.</p> <p>Senator Gavin has spoken on amendment No. 48.  An employer does not charge an employee for the paper or ink used to produce the wage slip or the method an employee is paid.  It is unacceptable that the burden of transaction fees with regard to the transfer of tips to workers would be placed on the workers themselves.  It is unfair to ask low-wage workers in particular, and we are speaking about low-wage workers, to bear this cost.  Will the Minister of State consider amendment No. 48?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1640" speakername="Pat Casey" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#KKK00300"><p>I will focus on the point on cash tips and I will speak from a practical point of view.  It is almost impossible for an employer to regulate them.  I have been on both sides of this.  I have been through many schemes in many establishments.  There have been schemes to pool tips and distribute them throughout the services or pool and distribute them among the waiting staff only, and there have been situations where people keep their tips.  In most situations the employer never sees the cash.  The cash is almost always given to a waiter or waitress.  Very seldom is it given to the employer.</p> <p>Every establishment has different arrangements for tips, particularly cash tips, and how they are distributed.  Most of it is decided by the staff themselves and how they want to distribute the cash tips and whether they want to keep them themselves.  I will give the example of one establishment where I tried to introduce pooling tips, whereby they would be divided proportionately based on what part of the service people were involved in.  Everybody signed up to it and everybody agreed.  The first month went very smoothly but the pool of money gradually got smaller and smaller.  It did not work.  We are discussing an employer trying to manage, reconcile and distribute cash when he or she has no interaction with it.  For bigger functions, where one person pays a bill and leaves a tip, it might be different.  When people walk into a restaurant for dinner tomorrow night they will not hand their tip to a manager or the employer.  They will hand it to a member of staff.  They have the cash.  It would be very difficult.  I know what the Senator is trying to do and I do not disagree with it but practically on the ground trying to manage it would be almost impossible.  On the other side, we would also be leaving a trail for Revenue to follow and I will leave it there.</p></speech>

Senators are keen to extend the Bill to cover all cash tips and gratuities.  I understand this.  We would all like to do this but it is exactly as Senator Casey has said.  It is about what is possible to trace and manage in law.</p> <p>With respect, I cannot disregard what the Workplace Relations Commission recommends to us.  It is the body that will be charged with policing the legislation we introduce.  I assume we want legislation that is workable and enforceable.  We are all on the same page in that we would like to be able to do it but it has to be enforceable or else it will be legislation that is not worth bringing in.</p> <p>The Workplace Relations Commission is a body we all respect and engage, with and we have asked it to police this.  I assume we are all happy that it does its job extremely well.  If not, that is a different story but I believe it does in general.  This is the issue we have.  There is a general prohibition on making deductions from any employee but there is no accompanying penalty.  The Bill is clear that it is an offence but there is no penalty because we cannot police it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is no point in kidding ourselves on that.  It has to be legislation that is enforceable or else the rest of it will not be worth the paper it is written on.  The reason for this is simple.  Cash left voluntarily simply is not traceable.

Electronic payments create an evidential trail that can be examined if there is a complaint.</p><p>We have to recognise that most payments, except maybe those of Senator Buttimer and a few others, are now being made electronically.</p></speech>

I am only slagging.  I am the same.</p> <p>I see it in practise.  Many people pay their bill electronically and then pay the tip in cash separately.  The issue we would have, exactly, as Senator Casey said, is how the Workplace Relations Commission would trace the case.  This legislation has to be workable and enforceable if we are to achieve what we want to achieve.</p> <p>We should recognise that most payments are being made electronically and fewer and fewer people are using cash on a regular basis.  We make a significant proportion of our purchases, including in person, through electronic transactions by debit or credit card, e-wallets, etc.</p> <p>I want to assure Senators that in a case where a customer pays a bill which includes a mandatory service charge by cash, that mandatory service charge has an evidential trail and the WRC can consider a complaint.  That is clearly on one's bill.  One would be able to see that.  We can and will trace that.  We will pursue that as well.</p> <p>I hope the Senators accept that it is in good faith.  It is not trying to avoid anything.  It is merely that it has to be enforceable.</p> <p>We are committed to a review after a year.  After six months, the Senator may come back telling me that we are completely missing something here and it is being completely abused.  I do not think it will be.  This legislation will work because everybody has contributed to it over a long number of years.  It is the right legislation.  It will work to what we are trying to achieve.</p> <p>In relation to the electronic means, I spoke earlier about the amendments to clarify by reference that employers will be required to include details on how cash tips are dealt with when displaying their policy towards tips and gratuities.  That policy is there for everyone to see and read.  There will be no other regulation of cash tips because we cannot enforce it.</p> <p>The WRC advises it would not be enforceable.  It has been clarified in this legislation.  It held the same view on Senator Gavan's legislation in 2017.  It stated it was neither workable nor enforceable.  I did not want to raise that earlier on but that was the technical difficulty with it.  The WRC said that we would not be able to enforce it.  There is no point in bringing forward legislation that we cannot stand over.</p> <p>In relation to what is allowable for an employer to deduct out of tips paid electronically, to be clear, there is no question of paying for payment infrastructure out of the tips.  It is not a case of paying for the machine at all.  It is the fee charged for processing payments, bank transfers, etc., that is to be looked at.  There are real costs here and it is not necessarily fair that the employer should take on those extra costs.  In some cases, there could be other costs associated with legislation and that is allowed for as well.  However, it is not to pay for the machine that is there anyway.  It is additional costs that would not normally be there if they were not processing the tips through electronic means.  We can clarify that more for Senator Gavan in regulation, if the Senator wants.  I am happy to discuss the regulation with the Senator when we are doing that.  That is what we are trying to achieve here so that no one is out of pocket.</p> <p>The people are entitled to get their tips without doubt.  If it is a service charge, that is what it is there for.  People wanted them to have that but we also recognise that one cannot put extra cost on the employers.  It goes back to the point that in most cases it is not necessarily a high margin industry.  Of course, there are always some who will do well but the majority are covering all their costs, making a reasonable wage and want to continue with the business as well.  We want to see the hospitality sector thrive and survive and more jobs created in it as well.  It is not to put any extra costs on them.  It is to make sure that people are getting what the customers thought they were giving them in the first place.</p></speech>

What the WRC said in relation to my Bill was that it may not be enforceable, which is the same as saying it may be enforceable.  The Minister of State can check that for himself.  That is what is on the record.</p> <p>Here is my point.  Without covering cash tips-----</p></speech>

To be clear, there was certainly ambiguity in terms of that.  I remember it at the time.</p> <p>Here is the point.  If we do not include cash tips in some way, it means there is no recourse in any circumstance in relation to cash tips.  We can do better than that.  I will not delay matters but I will give one example from Limerick.  Actually, it is the example that kicked off this whole conversation where a number of staff explained to me how at the end of the night the employer would simply put his hand into the jar and say either that it had been a slow night or that he did most of the work that evening, and help himself to the cash tips.  When one bears in mind that the Workplace Relations Commission makes decisions on the balance of probability, it would be quite possible in that case for the WRC to come to a decision that something wrong has happened here and these people deserve recompense.  I would ask the Minister to revisit this when the Bill goes before the D&aacute;il if possible.  We should go further to try and ensure in circumstances such as that which none of us approve of - we all think it is horrific - that there is some course to see how we can deal with that.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about that.  Of course, we all would like to achieve that.  I must be black and white on this.  If the WRC tells me something is unenforceable, I have to accept it.  It is the body we will be asking to police this.  We want this policed.  I am assuming we are here bringing legislation that we think will be policed and enforced and I have to work with the WRC on that.</p> <p>By all means, when the Bill comes before the D&aacute;il, if we find the magic formula that achieves what we all want to achieve, we can look at it.  If it needs to be in regulations or anywhere else, we can do that.</p> <p>We looked at it and we do not have that magic formula.  To be honest, Senator Gavan is not giving me the magic formula and it was not in the Senator's previous Bill either which the WRC said was unenforceable.  I am not trying to rewrite history-----</p></speech>

How does one prove that something happened or did not happen when it comes to cash?  One could potentially leave an employer open to false allegations that he or she could not defend whereas at least in other provisions in employment law the onus is on the employer to prove it.  They would not be able to prove that tips came or did not come.  I can see how it would be unenforceable.</p></speech>

I disagree fundamentally because I am genuinely puzzled as to why it is only a class C fine, as in a fine of &euro;2,500, that can be applied.  Let us be honest here that contravention of sections of this Bill equate to employers stealing money from their workers.  We have seen such instances uncovered time and time again through WRC investigations.  Often one sees it labelled in the media as &quot;recovery of unpaid wages&quot;.  That is a nice way to spin stolen wages but that is what it is.  In the last decade alone, nearly &euro;18 million in stolen wages was returned to workers after WRC investigations.  Indeed, this disgusting practice has been escalating in recent years, with nearly &euro;9 million being recovered for workers in the period 2018-20.  The withholding of wages is especially rampant in sectors where women and migrant workers are heavily employed, those being the food and drink, retail, nursing and childcare sectors.  These are the same sectors where one would expect tips, gratuities and service charges to be left by customers for workers.</p><p>There are two ways to combat this unscrupulous practice, that is, to further resource the WRC to investigate more places of work and to ensure the punishment matches the crime.  For this reason I propose to amend the legislation to increase the punishment for contravention of sections within the Bill from a class C fine of &euro;2,500 to a class A fine of &euro;5,000.  We need to send a very clear message with this Bill that stealing employees' money is wrong and must be punished.  We need to send a clear message because the Minister of State's own Government's figures, through the WRC each year, show we have a scandalous amount of stolen wages each year.  In the last three years alone it is &euro;9 million.  These are wages stolen by employers from their employees.</p><p>With the greatest of respect, a &euro;2,500 fine is not going to fix that.  I know we are going to get this Bill done this evening and that the Minister of State is not going to agree with me but I urge him to have a look at this when the Bill reaches the D&aacute;il.  We cannot tolerate people's wages being stolen.  Let us be clear that no-one can dispute this.  The facts are in.  The figure is &euro;9 million for the last three years.  Are we seriously suggesting a &euro;2,500 fine is sufficient when people's wages are being stolen?  We cannot.</p><p>I emphasise the second point, which the Minister of State and I have had a back-and-forth on before, that is, the WRC is consistently under-resourced.  Again, that is a political choice being made by this Government.  We need a significant ramping up of labour inspectors.  I hope the Minister of State takes my points on board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-29a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062900002#MMM04500"><p>I thank the Senator for his amendment.  He is right that I cannot accept it.  I will explain why in a moment.  There are two things I agree with.  One is the whole area of a deterrent.  The greatest deterrent is that one might be caught, more so than the fine itself or the punishment, in our view.  That is my understanding of criminal legislation and legislation like this as well.</p> <p>I also agree with the Senator that the WRC has not proper resources to do its work.  We have worked with it over the last couple of years to increase the resources available to it as well.  There have been issues and delays in attracting the staff we need, or sourcing them, but I have committed before, as has the T&aacute;naiste, to dealing with the extra resources required there.  Extra money has been allocated but we will continue on that journey because the Senator is right there must be enough inspectors within the system to let people know they are going to be caught and have them be afraid of being caught.  That is the greatest deterrent above any fines.  We agree on that one as well.</p> <p>The Senator's amendment would change the penalty for breaches from a fine of up to &euro;2,500 to a fine of up to &euro;5,000.  This would be far out of line with the penalties included in the Payment of Wages Act 1991 that this Bill amends.  That Act provides for fines of up to &euro;1,000.  The WRC can also impose a fixed penalty notice of up to &euro;1,500.  If these amendments are accepted then breaches of this Bill would have the most serious consequence of any offence under the Payment of Wages Act 1991 and this would not be proportionate.</p> <p>I appreciate what the Senator is trying to achieve but in the overall legislation we are amending it would not be proportionate, so I cannot accept this amendment.  However, the Senator and I discussed, I think on Committee Stage of the Sick Leave Bill, that the overall level of fines is something we need to look at in general across all the legislation.  Rather than doing it piecemeal or accepting one amendment here that then distorts the overall payments Act, I agree with the Senator we should look at legislation in general to see whether the penalties are enough of a deterrent.  As I said, I believe the chance of being caught is more important than the penalty itself but we should look at the penalties across the system.  It affects more than one Department but I am happy to be part of that work.  I commit that we take a look at that in general to see if we can make a better impact if we have larger fines in general.  However, it should be a general conversation as opposed to individual pieces of legislation here and there, or amendments, because then the overall thing does not have a proper logic.</p> <p>I hope the Senator accepts I genuinely think we should do that but we cannot accept this amendment because it would not be proportionate.</p></speech>

I will be pressing the amendment but I hear what he is saying.  I ask that he give that commitment to review the fines within the next 12 months or something like that so we can get something concrete out of this.  The very fact we have seen &euro;9 million stolen in the last three years shows - and in fairness the Minister of State has acknowledged it - that the current set of fines is not sufficient.  I ask for a timeline so we can get something concrete from the conversation.  I very much welcome the Minister of State's comments.</p></speech>

It would be unfair because I need to consult Ministers and other Departments but I have listened to the Senator tonight and on other Stages, and listened to others as well, and it is something we should do.  I certainly take on implementing that across Government but I cannot commit colleagues or the whole of Government to a timeline I want or that the Senator wants.  I will come back to him with a timeline.  It is something we should do and I will ensure it happens but I just cannot say how long it will take until I assess it.</p></speech>
