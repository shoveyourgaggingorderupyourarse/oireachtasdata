Se&aacute;n had a long and distinguished career in public service, including four terms in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as a Teachta D&aacute;la for Tipperary South.  He served as Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce from 1987 to 1989 and as a councillor for Tipperary for many years.  His public service spanned five decades.  Before entering public life, Se&aacute;n's commitment to serving the public could be seen when he graduated as a medical student and became a medical doctor and general practitioner in Cashel where he was affectionately known as "The Doc".  Among the many tributes paid to Se&aacute;n on his passing was a tribute from Cashel King Cormacs GAA Club, where he was doctor for many years to the senior hurling team in the 1990s. Se&aacute;n was an intercounty hurler, serving with Tipperary as a minor hurler.</p> <p>At this sad time, our thoughts are with his family.  On behalf of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I convey my sincere sympathies to his children, Eoin, Caitr&iacute;ona, John, Aidan and Maria and to his extended family and friends.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1642" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#A00500"><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, to move No. 18 before No. 71, motion 7 on the Order Paper.  I concur with the Cathaoirleach's remarks in regard to the passing of former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister of State and Teachta D&aacute;la, Dr. Se&aacute;n McCarthy.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I extend our deepest sympathies to his family, friends and community and I wish them well in this very difficult time for them.</p> <p>I want to raise two points this morning.  The first point relates to the survey by the Irish League of Credit Unions on the cost of attending primary and secondary school in this State.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It found that more than a quarter of parents get into debt going back to school because of the high costs.  The estimated cost of sending a child to primary school now is &euro;1,200 per year, while the estimated cost of sending a child to secondary school is &euro;1,500 per year.  The cost of purchasing books is the most significant financial burden on parents.  It averages approximately &euro;200 annually per child.  If a family has more than one child in school, it is a significant burden.  The cost of extracurricular activities, in particular for primary school students, comes in at almost &euro;200 as well, which adds a significant financial burden, especially so for families with more than one child.</p><p>The survey has found that many parents are using credit cards or other forms of credit to pay for the cost of going back to school, which is a significant problem that we need to address.  Some schools do book rental schemes and others do not.  The Minister for Education must examine the situation.  Schools should be encouraged to a point, and then they should be asked to implement book rental schemes because that would ease the burden on so many parents and families across the State.  I cannot understand how some schools can manage it and others cannot.  The burden on parents could be a topic we might discuss in the new term.</p><p>The second issue I wish to discuss is the reopening of the hospitality sector, which is a hot topic and one that we discuss regularly.  It is welcome to see that hospitality is opening in some form.  It is not a full reopening for everybody.  I have significant issues with the suggestion that somebody who has not had an opportunity to get a vaccine would be excluded from hospitality but would be allowed to work in the sector.  There is an anomaly in that regard.  I take note that the Government has changed slightly in that antigen testing will form part of the phase 3 reopening of hospitality so there is some movement in that respect.</p><p>Figures were released yesterday which indicate that if we had the same death rate as the EU average, then 3,200 more citizens would be dead in this country.  If we had the same death rate as the UK, more than 4,000 more Irish citizens would be dead as of today.  We should commend the Government on that front in terms of handling the Covid pandemic situation very well in terms of protecting lives, which is clearly the top priority of the Government.</p><p>We need clarity on two issues: the first relates to the CMO&rsquo;s remarks yesterday that it is not advisable for young children to access indoor dining.  We must be very careful, as there are many lone parents and families that have children of different ages.  We require clarity on the comment.  What we do not want is what happened at the beginning of the pandemic when it was suggested that children were super spreaders and people became afraid of children, which was a ridiculous situation.  We do not want there to be any judgment or a frosty reception if a lone parent in particular brings a child to dine.  We must get clarity on that.</p><p>The second and final issue relates to the timing of the introduction of antigen testing.  When will phase 3 take effect?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1670" speakername="John McGahon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#B00500"><p>It is not a case of calling for a debate or anything like that, but I wish to comment on the atrocious language that has been used by Members of the other House regarding some of the greatest atrocities that have been committed against mankind on the European Continent in the past 60 to 70 years.  There were references to "Nazi Germany", "1930s Germany" and "the Weimar Republic".  Other Deputies have used the term "Stalinist".  Stalin murdered between 7 million and 9 million people.  Language like this should be rarely used.  I hope we will never need to use such language again and that we will never see acts like that again on the planet.  They are the most serious words in the English language and should only be reserved to describe the most heinous crimes committed against our fellow man and woman.  It is most disingenuous in the extreme for them to be thrown around for cheap headlines or to increase somebody's profile.</p> <p>It is not ignorance, because everybody knows what happened during that era.  Everybody knows the death, murder and destruction that was unleashed across the world throughout the Second World War by these regimes.  It is not ignorance of history.  They know the history and the meaning behind these words and yet they still used them.  It has been happening for months now.  It has been happening in radio interviews and in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  The situation kicked off properly this week and it has rightly been condemned by all sides of the House and everyone here.  It is incumbent upon Members of this House and on those elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to remember that language matters.  The use of such language delegitimises the seriousness of those words.  If we throw a word around enough times to describe a situation we do not agree with, then it enters discourse as an acceptable thing to say when it is not.  It should be reserved for the worst atrocities, not something like a vaccine passport that one does not agree with.  The worst thing about it is that they are cognisant of the history behind these words and yet they continue to do it.  It is incumbent on everybody in the Oireachtas to call it out for what it is.  It is totally and utterly wrong in the extreme and the more of us that speak out against it the better.</p></speech>

I also extend my sympathies on the deaths of the Independent councillor, Hugh Conlon, from Dunleer, and the retired Independent councillor, Jimmy Cudden, from Duleek who will be buried later this morning.  I also extend my sympathies on the death of our Fianna F&aacute;il colleague in Fingal County Council, Councillor Freddie Cooper, who passed away in recent weeks.</p> <p>As a new Senator my first year in this House has been a learning curve.  I am enjoying the challenge and I hope I am making some contribution to the House.  I intend to bring my first Private Members' Bill to the House in the autumn.  I believe it to be an issue that could potentially have cross-party support.</p> <p>I wish to use my time today to talk about my colleagues on the other side of the House.  I have never hidden my background in Fianna F&aacute;il.  My family connection to Fianna F&aacute;il goes right back to the foundation of the State.  I was a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il national executive for four years.  I loved every minute of the time I gave to Fianna F&aacute;il but, unfortunately, there was no room for me to run for the party that I loved.  I was not wanted.  I say this because out of 180 Independent councillors, 87 are ex-Fianna F&aacute;il.  These unwelcomed men and women are some of the most hard-working community activists and local politicians in the country, yet Fianna F&aacute;il did not want them.  This is not unique to Fianna F&aacute;il.  Some of the remaining Independent councillors are ex-Fine Gael, ex-Sinn F&eacute;in, ex-Labour Party and ex-Green Party.</p> <p>As I look from the outside in, I can say with my hand on my heart that I do not like to see what has happened to this once-great party.  I do not like to see the internal party bickering, the constant negativity within the party that serves no purpose, only to divide.  This country needs Fianna F&aacute;il.  It needs a Fianna F&aacute;il Party of purpose, one that is relevant and that appreciates grassroots-level politics once again.  It needs a party that will listen to the grass growing and know what is going on in every townland, parish, village and town.</p> <p>While some may think we have never been more connected with social media, I would say differently.  This country does not need a party that will put its finger in the air on any given day to see what direction the wind is blowing and decide which direction to go in.  We have the Social Democrats for that.  I so want Fianna F&aacute;il-----</p></speech>

Whether one likes it or not, we have a Christian ethos.  We are nationalist, republican, cosmopolitan and we are constantly evolving as a people and as a nation.  We know that Fianna F&aacute;il is capable.  Even in the darkest days it built this country up.  Look how far we have come in the past 20 years.  As we prepare for the recess, I hope this will give Fianna F&aacute;il time to reflect, rebuild and rebrand, and return to be a better, more united party.  It can prove to the Irish people that it can work together for the greater good of people and put aside the internal squabbles for leadership.  Party members should put down their mobile phones at parliamentary party meetings and tog out to be the great party that it once was.  This nation needs it and wants it.</p> <p>I thank Martin Groves, Bridget Doody and all the staff, you Chair, and the Leader for putting up with my rants at times, and my Independent colleagues.  I thank Gr&aacute;inne, Ruth, Mark and Shauna for helping me to do the job as best I can.  I thank the Leader for putting up with me today.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#C00500"><p>It will be hard to follow that love note to Fianna F&aacute;il, so I will not try.</p> <p>I thank Senator Ward for putting the motion on Belarus on the Order Paper today.  Obviously, we, in the Green Party, as well as Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are supportive of that.  It will be taken without debate, but it is important the Seanad recognises the important role that human rights defenders play across the globe.  The shocking stories coming out Belarus cannot go unmentioned.  I know they will be raised in a committee later today.  Anything we, in the Green Party, can do, we are happy to do.  Ireland is a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  Belarus is also a member of the OSCE, so there are many avenues for us to follow.  However, we cannot allow the fact human rights abuses are taking place to go unmentioned.</p> <p>I want to raise the issue of school transport.  The difficulty is that this is our final week sitting before school starts again.  I would like the Leader to get in touch with the Department of Education to have a proper look at school transport.  It comes up every year that children cannot get onto school buses, because they have to live a certain distance from their school.  We discussed this at the Committee on Climate Action this week.  If we are to see the kind of change we need in transport, children are the first port of call.  The passengers in 30% of cars on our roads during rush hour are children being driven to school.  We could, therefore, have a huge impact on our carbon footprint if we could get that right.  However, it takes all Departments working together, including the Department of Education.  School buses should be free and freely available to everyone, regardless of how far away from the school children live.</p> <p>More and more children and their parents are making choices about what school they want to go to.  It is right that we have that freedom.   However, this means that they need to have transport, regardless of where the school is.  I have raised this issue before.  In terms of ethos, there are restrictions.  A child could live within 1 km or 2 km two of a school, but it could be too dangerous for them to get on a bike or to walk on a footpath.  That needs to be changed by the Department of Transport.  Even for short distances, children should be able to get onto a school bus so that they can get to school safely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#C00600"><p>The British Government announcement yesterday that it would introduce legislation to cover up the role in the conflict in the North, in the form of a statute of limitations, has united opinion in this country in an unprecedented manner.  The Irish Government, Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Unionist Party have all called on the British Government not to proceed with this unilateral and self-serving action.  The main relatives' organisations, Relatives for Justice and Wave Trauma Centre, who campaign for justice and truth, have also called on the British Government to abandon its amnesty-based plans.  There is a deep sense among relatives' organisations that the British Government has put its narrow interests ahead of their interests and, indeed, of the interests of the peace and political processes.  It is protecting a small number of political and military figures from the scrutiny that would arise from a process that would help tens of thousands of people who have endured much pain for many decades.</p> <p>It is infuriating to have to listen to the British Government's deceitful attempts to excuse its actions by claiming it is in the interests of those killed by British Crown forces, or loyalists acting in collusion with British forces, to deny them access to the truth and justice.  It is equally infuriating, especially for relatives' organisations, to have their concerns summarily dismissed in such an off-hand manner.</p> <p>The British Government did not consult anyone, other than the British military and those lobbying on its behalf, before it announced its statute of limitations decision.  Its decision effectively undermines the Stormont House Agreement, an agreement that was negotiated between the Irish and British Governments, and had the support of all of the main parties in the North.  As journalist Julian O'Neill said, if the British Government proceeds with its plans it will effectively close down police investigations, ombudsman investigations, prosecutions, inquests, civil actions and Operation Kenova.</p> <p>It is little wonder, then, that the Relatives for Justice organisation would describe yesterday as "the single worst day for all victims during our peace process".  It described the proposal as "the mother of all cover-ups".  As John Finucane, MP, son of the murdered human rights lawyer, Pat Finucane, said "the British government made it clear that victims do not matter to them".  As always, British interests come before everything else.  It cares nothing for victims, or for truth and justice.</p> <p>I welcome the clear and firm statement from the Irish Government in response to the British Government's statement.  The Irish Government has thankfully made it clear that the Stormont House Agreement is the framework for making progress on legacy; that the proposals from the British Government are not the basis for dealing with legacy cases; and that the way forward is through a collective approach.  It is clear that the barrier to justice for all of those impacted by the conflict lays first and foremost at the door of Westminster.  It is not on this island.</p> <p>I would urge the Irish Government to continue to pressure the British Government to implement the Stormont House Agreement and to pursue all avenues, including internationally, to ensure the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.</p></speech>

We are still newbies.  This is our first year, as Senator Keogan said, after her love poem to Fianna F&aacute;il.  It was great for us to have that assistance throughout our first year.</p> <p>When I saw Jadotville listed on the Order of Business I was very happy.  Maybe the Cathaoirleach has some information on what is happening.  We will have statements tonight but we have not yet seen the report.  I would really appreciate if that report could be circulated as soon as possible to all Members of the House.  Last November, the Cathaoirleach facilitated a debate on Jadotville.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Simon Coveney, came into the House to announce the independent commission.  We all wait in anticipation today.  Hopefully, tonight, there will be some good news for the heroes of Jadotville.</p> <p>I thank Senator Ward for his motion on Belarus.  Maybe we will have time in the autumn to debate what is happening in Belarus.</p> <p>Given that we are all enjoying the good weather, and the forecast is for more good weather this weekend, I want to raise an issue currently being promoted by Water Safety Ireland.  We are all aware of the great fun that a day at the beach, at a local river or at a watercourse can bring to so many.  However, we also need to be aware of the dangers of water and we must all respect it.  In a conversation with my colleague, Councillor N&iacute;all McNelis, in Galway, he informed me that Clare County Council passed by-laws last month banning the use of inflatable devices from the designated bathing areas.  Waterford City and County Council banned them two weeks before that.  Cork County Council has placed a number of warning signs on its beaches in an attempt to influence behaviour, so that we can on all enjoy the summer safely at those locations.  We all know those inflatables are sold as toys and not as life-saving devices.  We must all be aware of that.  It is vital that we all recognise that and stay safe while enjoying our terrific watercourses this weekend, and over the coming months.</p> <p>I want to use the opportunity to once again emphasise the importance of lifebuoys at all our water and bathing locations.  I recently asked Waterways Ireland to place lifebuoys along the new magnificent blueway from Athy to Robertstown.   These should be placed along all our blueways, running as they do along watercourses.  Consideration should be given to working with local communities along these routes to provide defibrillators, where possible.  Unfortunately, we are all aware of locations where a life-saving buoy has been stolen, tossed away or put out of use.  I am sure that we would all appeal to those minded to doing this to leave those lifebuoys where they are located.  You may never know the hour or day that you will be the one who needs it.  When you look around, it may be too late at that stage.</p></speech>

It was difficult to watch as, once again, the high levels of neglect in nursing homes throughout the country in the midst of the pandemic when so many people among us needed support and care were highlighted.  Again, our institutions failed them in the worst way possible.  The programme accurately reflected the severe incidences of neglect that are occurring throughout the country every day.<br/><br/>This is an urgent human rights issue.  There is no legislation to prevent abuse and neglect of adults at risk.  We cannot allow another programme with such shocking findings to stimulate conversations for a number of days and then, once again, be forgotten.  We saw similar findings in 2014 with the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme on &Aacute;ras Attracta.  Due to the ongoing media attention in regard to Covid-19, the most recent programme has not gained the necessary media attraction to stimulate engagement on this issue.  This is a human rights issue and it needs to be raised repeatedly in this House.<br/><br/>The shocking reality is Covid-19 claimed the lives of more than 2,000 nursing home residents.  The programme explored the shocking findings of serious neglect in nursing homes, the failure to provide adequate isolation settings and adequate pandemic health regulations.  Covid-positive and Covid-negative residents were placed in the same wards and their breakfast was served at 6.30 a.m. when some residents were still half asleep.  The programmers spoke to a brave and grieving woman named Christine Thompson, who is the daughter of Kathleen Thompson, who, tragically, was among 21 residents in a Cork nursing home with 51 beds who were confirmed to have died from the virus during the third wave of the pandemic.  A shocking finding in the programme that shook me was a conversation with a whistleblower who was assigned as a care worker during the third wave of the pandemic.  She said she had noticed problems during the changing of incontinence pads.  She said:</p><blockquote>	I observed a care worker taking off pads.  We would go to each room.  The pad was just taken off and another pad was put on.  There was no personal care, no washing or anything done. </blockquote><p>This horrifying ill-treatment and neglect echoes the equally harrowing findings from the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme into &Aacute;ras Attracta.  It is another damning indictment of the State's failure to safeguard adults at risk.  The stories are now many and all too familiar.<br/><br/>In 2017, together with former Senator Colette Kelleher and my colleagues in the Civil Engagement Group, I sponsored the Adult Safeguarding Bill 2017, which sought to establish Ireland's first independent safeguarding authority for adults at risk.  This Bill provided for a range of measures and mechanisms to address the gaps in our regulatory framework and to ensure no person slips through the cracks.  Sadly, it has yet to become law.  I am pleased to say I am drafting a new adult safeguarding Bill to be brought forward later this year, having consulted with civil society organisations and experts in the field.  I intend to introduce the new Bill on adult safeguarding to provide for robust and effective measures to prevent abuse and neglect, to support people to protect themselves when harm occurs, and to put human rights at the core of our safeguarding framework.  Throughout this process, I will be listening carefully to the views and unique perspectives of individuals with lived experiences, their families, front-line social workers and civil society.<br/><br/>I call on the Government to address this issue with the utmost urgency and to take swift and decisive action to ensure the tragic events revealed by the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme never happen again.  I hope with all my heart the Government will support our efforts to introduce this much-needed legislation.</p></speech>

This decision of the British Government has given an amnesty to the British Army and security forces in the North and to all paramilitaries.  For the families of those killed in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, in which 34 people lost their lives, Bloody Sunday, Derry and many others this means they are being told to go away and to stop annoying the British Government.  I can assure you the families will not go away.  The Irish Government must do all in its power to ensure the British Government is stopped in its tracks and that it does the decent thing for once.</p></speech>

The proposal of the British Government to give an amnesty is not the application of the rule of law; it is the application of the rule of the jungle.  I agree with the Government, as I am sure do all Senators, that the proposal goes against all of the agreements we have had with the British Government and it is breaking international agreements.  We have seen this happen in regard to Brexit and we are now seeing it with regard to the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.</p> <p>I invite the Leader to respond on the Order of Business.</p></speech>

The statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, was incredibly strong and he speaks for all of us.  As stated by Senator Boylan, the Stormont House Agreement is a treaty negotiated between all parties.  It is the only framework that will be tolerated and used to deal with the legacy issues.  Justice for the victims and the families left behind in respect of those tragedies and activities will be only dealt with by the framework agreed by all parties to address legacy issues.  I acknowledge people's upset this morning.</p><p>Senator Black spoke about the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme, which was raised by other colleagues the week it aired.  It was incredible, harrowing television to watch in terms of the pain and grief families are going through and will probably continue to go through until they get answers that we do not have now.  I join in the call made by my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, at the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party last night for a public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic in our nursing homes in the early days and up until last Christmas.  I would go so far as to say we need a public inquiry into the State's handling of Covid-19, but not to point fingers or to lay blame because everybody was floundering.  Our nursing homes, private and public, were left bereft of staff.  Without staff, all of the awfulness described in the programme came to be reality, although that does not justify it.  We need to learn from all of the mistakes the State and the agencies and organisations of the State made in the past year.  I have a terrible fear that although this is a horrendous pandemic and we are still in the middle of it, it will not be the last one for many of our children.  We definitely need to have public inquiries to make sure we learn the lessons from what we have been through in the past 12 months.</p><p>On the issue raised by Senator Wall, when the Minister told me he was releasing the report this week, I knew this was the House to do it.  During the past year of my membership of this House, I have heard many of colleagues speak passionately about the Jadotville soldiers, and so this is definitely the place to do it.  The report comprises 500 pages.  There are 45 pages in the executive summary.  It will be released at 12 noon and circulated to Senators by email.  I hope it delivers for all of the requests that have been made by Senators in the House over the past year and, in particular, the requests of the families and the last remaining gentleman who should be so well honoured for his service to the State.  I look forward to that debate later.</p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly raised the issue of school transport and Senator Chambers raised the issue of the survey in regard to back to school costs.  I am privileged to be in this campus serving the people for the past ten years.  It is <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>in terms of the reports we get every year on the same issues.  This time next year, we will be talking about school transport, school books, uniforms, crests and school bags again.  Nothing changes.  One of the most frustrating things about public life is how slowly the wheels move.  While our children will be back at school before we return to this House in September, this is an issue on which we need to focus to try to bring about change.  As suggested by Senator O'Reilly in relation to school transport, it is logical in terms of the climate challenges we face that our children would walk, cycle, scoot or take public transport to school rather than be driven there in trails of cars by mothers, fathers and so on.  It is crazy that school buses on which there are free placements are passing out cars in which parents are driving their children to school.  We need a new way of thinking.  I will try to arrange that debate as quickly as I can when we return in September.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not know where to start with Senator Keogan's contribution.  As a person who has been a member of my political party since I was born - I did not have any choice; I was born into it through my father and grandmother - I know she feels that way about politics too.  Her passion and loyalty to a party of which she has not been a member in a long time is testament to the kind of public representative she is.  I thank her for her contribution.  I am sure my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues are very grateful for her love-bombing.</p><p>I will finish up with two items.  First, I am happy to accept the amendment to the Order of Business this morning from Senator Chambers.  She opened the discussion we had about hospitality and Senator McGahan spoke about some of the words that were used in the debate yesterday.  I do not believe anybody is happy about the legislation that was passed in the D&aacute;il yesterday and that will, please God, be passed here tomorrow to try to get some of our businesses and employees back to work.  It does disenfranchise some people.  I do not believe that is something any of us want to do willingly.  However, the other two choices - the rock and the hard place we are between - are to open up everything and allow the virus to rip through our young people, who have made so many sacrifices over the past 15 months, or keep everything closed and perhaps close down for good some of those businesses that have been closed for the past year.  We really are between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>Senator Chambers is correct, however.  We need to talk with urgency, from tomorrow or whenever the President signs the Bill, about how we get those people who are disenfranchised by this legislation to not be disenfranchised.  The only way we can do that is by supporting Professor Mary Horgan.  We need an urgency with the use of antigen testing in hospitality and transport, however.  To be honest with Members, we have not seen that urgency in the past six, eight or ten months.  That must be demanded by all of us and not forgotten when we go off on our recess tomorrow.  I know we are all tired and everybody has worked incredibly hard under difficult circumstances for the past couple of months.</p><p>The message that has been sent out for the past year are that our children are safe in schools and have nothing to worry about.  The message that was sent out yesterday by the CMO is that our children are no longer safe.  Our summer camps are closed because they are not safe and yet, in six weeks, we are going to send messages to parents to the effect that it is safe to send our children back to school.  It is either safe or it is not.  Our message must be consistent.  I know the virus keeps changing and we have to adapt.  Our message has to at least be consistent and it has not been.  I urge all Senators to continue to make that an issue over the next couple of weeks, as well as supporting the use of antigen testing in order that our disenfranchised friends, neighbours and relations are not disenfranchised for any more than the shortest time they need to be.</p><p>I recall former Deputy, Olivia Mitchell, when we had a meeting here approximately ten years ago, saying that words are all we have.  That is really important.  I thought it was a mad thing for her to say at the time given that we were in the Houses of power and I was new.  Words are all we have, however.  In this House and in the D&aacute;il, words are what we use to express how we feel and to form legislation.  They need to be used carefully and mindfully.  I do not believe that some of our colleagues did that yesterday.  That is doing a real disservice to what we do in the Seanad and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#F00500"><p>I am pleased to introduce the CervicalCheck Tribunal (Amendment) Bill 2021 to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The purpose of this amendment to the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019 is to extend the period for receipt of claims by the CervicalCheck Tribunal.  The current time limits for making a claim to the tribunal are set out in section 12(1) of the 2019 Act.  The current relevant time limit for all eligible women is nine months from the date of establishment, which is 26 July 2021.  This Bill proposes extending the final date for receipt of claims to the tribunal by way of an initial six-month extension and allows for one further extension of six months.</p> <p>While this is a technical amendment, I once again acknowledge the profound impact the CervicalCheck debacle has had on the women and families affected.  The tribunal was established in October 2020 under the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019, which implements the recommendations of Mr. Justice Charles Meenan by providing for the tribunal as a more sensitive and timelier alternative to the courts for eligible claims.  Following a pause in the steps towards full establishment to allow for discussions with the 221+ patient representative group, the establishment of the tribunal was completed with the appointment of the nominated members to the tribunal in December 2020.  At that time, I gave a commitment to patient advocates that their members would not be disadvantaged by the five-week pause in establishment during which claims could not be made.  Unfortunately, as we now know, after the appointment of the members on 1 December, the epidemiological situation in Ireland worsened considerably.  Public health restrictions imposed to protect health and save lives caused significant disruption to all legal proceedings, and particularly those proceedings where claimants had to attend medical practitioners to secure reports on their conditions.</p> <p>It was only in March this year, when restrictions had eased somewhat, that the tribunal received its first claims.  The tribunal suffered a further blow in May of this year when it too was affected by the cyberattack.  That resulted in the tribunal&rsquo;s email and databases being taken offline.  This measure was purely precautionary, but it was only at the end of June that the tribunal was again fully connected.  All of this has been deeply frustrating, not least for those directly impacted, and has had the effect of substantially reducing the timeframe during which eligible women can access the tribunal.  This amendment ensures they will be given as much time as possible to consider the options available and make the choice they believe is right for them.  </p> <p>It is important to state that the 221+ support group made several requests in advance of the setting up of the tribunal.  We were able to accommodate many of those requests, but not all.  I acknowledge the group's disappointment that it was not possible to allow for recurrence as a mechanism in the tribunal, for example.  Unfortunately, while the Government very much wanted to accommodate all those requests that were made, we were precluded by the clear legal advice received from the Attorney General in this regard.</p> <p>The tribunal has received seven claims to date.  The State Claims Agency, SCA, has advised that additional plaintiffs have made formal requests to transfer their claims to the tribunal from the courts and, in addition, more claimants have expressed an interest.  I am advised that the tribunal and the 221+ support group are also receiving queries, so it is expected that the tribunal will, ultimately, deal with more claims.  The tribunal has agreed to my request to make its premises available to women eligible for the tribunal regarding the hearing of their claims, even if they choose to remain in the High Court.  The tribunal's premises have been designed with privacy in mind and it has similarly agreed to make its facilities available at no cost for the mediation of CervicalCheck claims.</p> <p>Before concluding, I mention that the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019 provides for restoration of trust meetings.  The intention behind such a meeting is to document experiences, facilitate discussion and provide information to those affected by issues concerning CervicalCheck, or to the family if it is the case that a woman has sadly died.  This option is open to all women eligible for the tribunal, irrespective of whether they make a claim to the tribunal.  A recruitment campaign is now being conducted for moderators.  Amendments to the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019 will ensure that those eligible for the tribunal will have ample time to consider whether they will make a claim to it.  I thank the House for taking the Bill as speedily as it has.</p></speech>

It is worth pointing out at the start we are here because of the very brave women who brought this to our attention.  I am talking about Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, Lynsey Bennett, Irene Teap and all the other women who have put their own horror to one side and spoken and fought so bravely for redress and recognition.  They have highlighted the very deep failure of this State to provide healthcare for women.  We must recognise those women and the sacrifice they have made for all of the rest of us, in order to ensure the system is corrected and that we invest in women's healthcare.  There has been a historic lack of investment in women's healthcare in this country, and the Minister has been working to redress that, along with other many areas.</p> <p>None of us will ever forget the horror of the CervicalCheck scandal.  CervicalCheck impacted on women of every age across every part of the country.  It was horrifying when Vicky Phelan's story broke and she was followed by more and more women.  There are many women suffering whose names we do not know.  They have not spoken publicly because they are suffering and they are dying, and they should not be.  Their families are bereft.</p> <p>I welcome that we are dealing with this Bill.  There is obviously a need to extend it.  I am aware the Minister has engaged extensively with the 221+ group and am glad to hear the restoration of trust element is contained within the Bill because most women caught up in this absolutely outrageous scandal want the cervical screening programme to continue.  It is a good programme.  A very early diagnosis is achieved for thousands of women and all of these women have been encouraging others to go ahead.  The trust in the system must be restored and the families who unfortunately have been deeply impacted and affected for ever more need to regain trust in the system.</p> <p>I look forward to hearing the contributions from everybody else in the House.  It is such an emotional topic for women.  We have all gone for our smears, got our results and trusted what came in the post.  To think that might not have been the case for a large swathe of women is absolutely horrifying.  There is enough dedication to women's healthcare, particularly here in the Seanad, that we can ensure this Bill is the best it can be, and keep on top of the issue to deliver some justice for the women.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.61" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1664" speakername="Sharon Keogan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#G00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House once more.  It is important to begin by briefly explaining what this Bill sets out to do.  The Bill primarily sets out to amend the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019 to extend the period for receipt of claims for compensation to the  CervicalCheck tribunal until January 2022.  Section 1 of the Bill amends section 12 of the 2019 Act to extend the current period.  This Bill seeks to extend the above nine months by a further six months or more, per the subsection, at the discretion of the Minister.</p> <p>I welcome this Bill.  It is the absolute minimum that should be done to compensate the hundreds of women who have been affected.  These women have been failed not once but twice by this Government.  The second failure stems from the subsequent treatment of these women, which has been nothing short of appalling.  That only 90 minutes have been allocated for this debate is also disappointing.  That is 90 minutes given to the women failed by this Government and then dragged through incessant and unrelenting legal battles, even though in 2018 the then Taoiseach, and current T&aacute;naiste, falsely promised no woman would be made go to court and even referred to being aware of the further trauma a court battle would cause.  It is important to remember these women were made to endure these lengthy, stressful and tenuous court battles.  These legal battles were made necessary to secure any level of justice.  They were then left to suffer not only the physical effects of this failure but also mental and emotional anguish.</p> <p>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women.  In Ireland, approximately 270 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer per year and just under 100 deaths occur from it annually.  However, with proper screening and early detection the disease is preventable.  In Ireland this screening was and is outsourced to US laboratories, a move on the part of a Fianna F&aacute;il Government, undoubtedly to cut costs, while having little regard to the difference in screening standards between Irish and US laboratories.  If Fianna F&aacute;il had had more regard for the lives of these women, rather than cutting back on costs, the outcome for them may have been different.  However, the Government is still not prepared to accept any fault and shifted, and continues to shift, the blame to the US laboratories to which it willingly outsourced the responsibility for screening.  It must be remembered that Fine Gael is not entirely blameless either.  It has, even now, retained the privatisation of cervical screening in Ireland.</p> <p>Not only did the Government fail in its duty to protect these women from this absolutely preventable disease, it also failed to show compassion, empathy or indeed any proper accountability in its subsequent treatment of these women.  There is a continuing lack of dignity and respect shown to these women, particularly regarding the lack of accountability.  It is suitable to reference the actions, or should I say the lack thereof, of the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan.  Dr. Holohan echoed the attitude of this Government with regard to these women when he was seen to offer his deepest sympathies but after several chances refused to make an apology or take any accountability over his failure.  However, what is perhaps the most abhorrent of Dr. Holohan's actions was his strongly advising against conducting of a much called for CervicalCheck review.  This is the man who went on, to the absolute outrage of the public, to be awarded the freedom of the city of Dublin in January.  What message does that send to the women affected by the cervical cancer scandal and their families?  I have no doubt a similar attitude will arise on the part of Dr. Holohan and his merry National Public Health Emergency Team when a Covid-19 tribunal of inquiry is conducted.</p></speech>

I begin by saying Dr. Tony Holohan, our Chief Medical Officer, retains the confidence of this House, the respect of this House and indeed that of the Irish people for the extraordinary manner in which he has led this country through the worst pandemic in living memory.  It is extremely important that is reiterated.  The work Dr. Holohan has done, coupled with the work of Dr. Ronan Glynn and indeed all of NPHET, the Department, the HSE and frontline workers throughout the country has saved thousands of lives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In terms of what is going on in the UK and in other countries we should be proud of the work of our Chief Medical Officer and his team. </p><p>I echo the sentiment of Senator Clifford-Lee and others that we should always remember the reason this legislation is necessary in the first instance.  It is a response to the awful scandal of what happened over the past three or four years.  Our respect for the people who stood up and called it out is enormous.  The introduction of this legislation to extend the timeline by another six months is appropriate, particularly as a pandemic has existed here for the past 18 months and it has affected everyone, including people who wanted to use this vehicle to seek redress.  This particular manner of seeking redress is far more preferable than people having to go to court.  Anything that we can do to facilitate this extension of the timeline will be done.  If a further extension is needed in 2022, we should not be shy in introducing further amending legislation to do that.  We have passed many technical Bills in this House down through the years, many of which have been of little importance in that they sought only to tidy up or close off loopholes.  While that work has to be done and it is what a good Legislature will do, sometimes legislation is introduced that has unintended consequences and technical amending legislation is required to address those unintended consequences.  Rarely has a technical Bill of such importance as this Bill come before this House.  </p><p>We will do what we can.  I agree that the 90 minutes is appropriate because we do not want to delay the passage of this legislation.  We do not need a two or three-day debate on this Bill.  That is not what the women who have been affected by this scandal want; they want this Bill passed as quickly as possible so that the tribunal can get on with its work and redress can be achieved.  It is important that this legislation is passed and it will be passed.  I sincerely hope it will be passed unanimously without any objections.  It appears that that will happen.  As I said, if further amending legislation is required in 2022 Members of this House will not be found wanting.  </p><p>It is important that I and others articulate the fantastic work that has been done by Dr. Tony Holohan, Dr. Ronan Glynn and others.  Everyone makes mistakes, but the mistakes have been few and far between.</p></speech>

This is a very sad issue for me, or any woman, to have to speak about.  Over the past few years, I have often sat at home and cried while watching and listening to various people on television and on radio speak about this horrendously bad hand that people were dealt through no fault of their own.  I have regular cervical smear checks.  During one check irregular cells were detected, but in time to enable them to be removed.  Lucky me.  Unfortunately, that was not the case for many women.  It is important that this amending legislation is enacted as soon as possible to provide for more time for the women who were not as fortunate as me to go forward with the tribunal if they deem it suitable for them.  The restoration of trust meeting is important but care needs to be taken in regard to the gender balance in that regard.  I am not a feminist or anti-man but this matter raises again the issue of the latent patriarchy within which we live.  We, men and women, do not value women and their bodies in the same way that men have not been oppressed in that way.  This is the reason we had to take to the streets in regard to other rights such as the repeal of the eighth amendment.  We have to take time to consider if there are too many men in charge of the healthcare system and if we are doing our best to represent all genders by ensuring there is gender equality.</p> <p>This is a good amendment.  It gives people more time.  One wonders if this was men's services would this have happened.  We have to think about that.  There has never been any issue with prostate cancer checks.  It is important that we think about that.  I am not suggesting I am perfect.  I might be a little sexist.  We have the patriarchy in us; we were raised in it, but women are 51% of the population.  It is time to get things right on every level.  The gender pay gap legislation is very helpful in that regard.  I do not believe the Minister is sexist.  We should all be more aware of that go-to of making preconceptions about people.  We need to value women's bodies much more.  The Government has more to do to reassure women to have cervical smear checks because that service is still in doubt.  Each time we discuss the cervical smear scandal and the tribunal it causes further doubt about the service.  We will need reassurance in that regard.</p></speech>

It is appropriate that we put those who were impacted at the centre of this debate.  Nothing we do can bring back the women who lost their lives.  This tribunal can bring about some justice but it cannot do all that those impacted want it to do.  The Minister recognises that and it is the advice that we have before us.  It also does not change the fact that women are entitled to go to the High Court.  Time and again there are scandals related to women's healthcare.  It is ten years since Vicky Phelan's smear test and we are still discussing the issue.  It is absolutely right that we extend the timeline.  I am happy to note that more people have come forward since this legislation was first debated in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister also said that more people are indicating their intention to come forward.  That is welcome.</p> <p>There needs to be a proper investigation by the State in regard to what happened around justice and healthcare during the pandemic that has impacted women more than men.  The cyberattack and the pandemic have influenced this amendment.  We know that women and children have been impacted more by the pandemic than men.  We need to have a proper investigation in that regard.  </p> <p>Time and again, we talk about putting something on the table that will restore trust in the Irish State.  It is right that we would do that, but we have a long way to go.  The restoration of trust meeting is welcome but unless we have a broader conversation around the role and place of women in this State and the support that Departments give to women it will not do what we need it to do.</p></speech>

I will begin by extending my best wishes to Vicky Phelan.  We all know she is in a battle and we wish her the very best.  I also extend my solidarity to all of the women affected, as I am sure the Minister and all Senators here do.  It is our job to make sure we do right by them and that we stand by them and their families.  I take this opportunity to encourage women to continue to go for their cervical smear tests and those eligible to get their HPV vaccination.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in will support this technical Bill to extend the period during which women may make claims.  It is welcome that this period is being extended.  However, the fundamental question is why it is being extended.  This Bill fails to address that question.  </p> <p>The Sinn F&eacute;in health spokesperson, Deputy Cullinane, has spoken to members of the 221+ group and their legal representatives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Their view as to why it is being extended is that very few women have lodged claims.  Despite hundreds of women being affected and hundreds of claims being made in the courts, only a handful of women's claims have been received by the tribunal.  Rather than deal with the substantial and genuine reasons most of the women have not made claims, we are simply extending the period during which they can make a claim.  The view of the 221+ group is that without dealing with the very real issues and concerns, which were not dealt with leading up to the establishment of the tribunal, we are not really making any changes at all.<br/><br/>We said from the outset that the CervicalCheck survivors deserve compassionate treatment.  They have asked from the outset for this process to be non-adversarial.  I believe we would all accept that this is a very reasonable ask, as were their requests that the State should be prepared to settle rather than contest clear-cut claims and that where possible, the laboratories should be pursued separately.  The State should not be using the survivors to do its work for it.<br/><br/>The Minister and the 221+ group published correspondence exchanged between them prior to the establishment of the tribunal.  The Minister stated in a letter of 8 November 2020:</p><blockquote>	I strongly believe that proceeding with the final steps necessary to commence a tribunal is the right thing to do.  Doing so will enable women and families who are seeking access to the tribunal to proceed with their claims without further delay. </blockquote><p>We must ask ourselves if this has worked.  Have women lodged claims?  How many claims have been lodged?  How many have been heard?  Only a handful of people have opted in.  That low number suggests that women are voting with their feet.  They are saying loudly and clearly to the Minister that there are problems with this tribunal and there were problems from the get-go with reoccurrence, the Statute of Limitations and whether their legal advisers sought an alternative to the courts system.<br/><br/>There is, therefore, little point in establishing a tribunal for a section of society and for those women who were so badly wronged and let down by the State and who feel genuinely so hurt.  If it does not have the confidence of the women, that is a problem.  By standing with those families, I believe the Government would set up a tribunal that works for them.  Quite clearly, with the figures we have, that does not seem to be the case.<br/><br/>As I said, I will support this Bill, as will my party, to extend the deadline for women to make more claims.  Our real concern, however, is why so few women have stepped forward to use this mechanism.</p></speech>

The Labour Party will be supporting this legislation, as we did in the D&aacute;il.  It is a technical amendment to the 2019 Bill to extend the existence of the tribunal.  This in itself is unobjectionable.  We will not be found wanting in ensuring those who want to go through the tribunal can do so.</p> <p>I must express frustration, however, as have others, that this Bill contains no attempt and makes no effort to resolve the reasons so few women have come forward.  It almost seeks to extend in the hope that more claims will arise.  As my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, has repeatedly said, as we understand it at this point, only five women are currently making claims.  This small number should surely be ringing an alarm bell when we contrast that with the 160 active cases that were going through the courts as of May of this year.</p> <p>There is, therefore, a very real question as to why the Government has not engaged with or listened to the very real concerns of those women who have decided not to go down the tribunal route, and why the 221+ group could not advise its members to make claims through the tribunal.</p> <p>A number of key issues remain unresolved in this Bill.  We have heard assurances so many times that this process would be non-adversarial.  Of course, that has not come to pass.  Ms Lorraine Walsh has repeatedly been seeking assurances with regard to those who suffer recurrence of their cancer, which the Minister mentioned in his contribution.  It is my understanding that in the hepatitis C tribunal, in the event of recurrences of hepatitis C people could go back and had a right to return to the tribunal if their health deteriorated.  That avenue has not been opened up to women in the context of the CervicalCheck tribunal, however.</p> <p>Women wanted reassurances that they would not be statute barred.  They were asked to have faith in the system.  It is very hard to have faith in a system that let them down in the first instance.  Of course, we have a very real failure to take on board and respond to the Chief Justice's decision following the Ruth Morrissey judgment.  There was a failure to amend the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act so that no woman has to choose between taking a case herself or waiting until after she passes away.</p> <p>I wish to pay tribute, as have others, to the enormous courage and fearlessness of the women and men behind the 221+ group and the others who have stepped forward.  Behind those faces, obviously, are enormous personal challenges, while they are sick and having to fight this campaign to get the recognition and justice they deserve.</p> <p>I really believe it is incumbent on the Government now to respond the Chief Justice's comments and that decision to amend the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act so that no woman has to choose.  We need the Minister to come back in the next term and remedy these issues so many of us have spoken about today.  We are happy to support this Bill to extend the tribunal but ultimately, the tribunal will fail if it does not address the issues that have been set out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1632" speakername="Frances Black" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#J00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House today.  I can only imagine how hectic it has been for him and how busy he is in these really crazy times.  I fully support this Bill to extend the period for receipt of claims by the CervicalCheck tribunal.  As we all know, the past 16 months have been seriously challenging for everyone.  Covid-19 has affected the pace of everyday life and the CervicalCheck tribunal has been affected the same way; there is no doubt about it.  Naturally, therefore, an extension is essential, especially given that it was only in March of this year, when the restrictions eased slightly, that the tribunal received its first claims.</p> <p>While this Bill is a technical one, it is imperative to acknowledge the immense pain and suffering of the women and families who were tragically impacted by the CervicalCheck failure and the many women who died as a result of the errors that were made.</p> <p>I thank the inspiring leadership of the 221+ patient advocacy group.  This group continues to do so much for the State in improving the health service.  It is also essential to acknowledge the brave women who have been cervical cancer campaigners like the incredible Vicky Phelan, who we all know is an absolute inspiration.  I wish her well going forward.  She is a powerful advocate for Irish women.  I also pay tribute to the voices of Lorraine Walsh and Stephen Teap.</p> <p>It is important to remember the CervicalCheck contract was awarded by the State based on the lowest price procurement process rather than price and quality.  The failure to give proper consideration to quality was one of the main issues raised by the Scally report.  This is why the Quality in Public Procurement (Contract Preparation and Award Criteria) Bill 2021, introduced by my colleague, Senator Higgins, is so important in preventing this horrific part of Irish history, which has not only darkened our past but also the present lives of so many women, from ever happening again.</p> <p>I also want to bring awareness to the fact that I have been hearing reports about many women who are currently undergoing cervical smear tests and who have not been receiving results.  Many of these women have been given different excuses as to why they should wait another three months before resubmitting the test.  Some say they are being told of the backlog that is preventing their access to results.  As the Minister can imagine, it is very frightening for many women to receive news that their results are not being processed, particularly after Covid-19.  Many women have not had screenings for a long time and that will unfortunately affect fertility for some women.  We need, therefore, to ensure that the backlog is being tended to and make sure that all cervical smear tests are being processed.  I believe it is an urgent priority.</p> <p>We have a long and tragic history in this State when it comes to women's healthcare but the shocking reality is that this is not just something that happened in the past.  This reality still adversely affects women today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a problem that perpetuates itself and it must be solved.  </p><p>I pay tribute to all the inspiring women and their families who have been so tragically impacted by this failure of our system and by the failure of leadership in the healthcare service that led to this appalling situation.

I am happy to support this legislation, but much more must be done to ensure that cervical health is a priority and the hideous past never repeats itself.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1642" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#K00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House to address this important issue.  I note that the House is exclusively occupied by women here to speak on this issue.  It shows the importance of this subject to female legislators, policymakers and Members of this House.  It also demonstrates the importance of showing our solidarity with the women and families affected by the terrible tragedy that is the CervicalCheck scandal.  I am sure all of us have been through the CervicalCheck system in the normal way.  It saves lives and it is fantastic to have a screening programme, but it is important that the screening programme is fit for purpose.  The bravery of women who spoke out, like Vicky Phelan and the members of the 221+ support group and their families, means we will now have a better system than before.  It is something positive to take away from what is an awful blight on our State&rsquo;s history of providing women&rsquo;s healthcare.</p> <p>One important thing to emerge from this tragedy is that before this CervicalCheck scandal broke many people, including me, misunderstood what the screening programme was there to do.  Sometimes we went away with a false sense of security that getting a negative result meant the all clear.  We might not have taken symptoms we then experienced as seriously as we would have otherwise.  I feel like I have been educated by the whole process.  If you get a screening test appointment now you will take it and if you get a negative result, that is fantastic and you get a sense of relief from it.  You are still more vigilant, though, because you know that it does not mean you are 100% clear all of the time and that you do not ignore symptoms.  That was not made clear previously.  I did not understand that as a young girl going to get my first smear test.  I did not understand that a number of cases would not get picked up.  The real failing of the system was that we did not properly educate young girls and women about what the screening programme did and was intended to do.  It is definitely important to get screened, but it is also important to not ignore symptoms thereafter.  It is still important that we get that message out to young girls and women who will be going through this system.  We must encourage as many as possible to go through the system.</p> <p>I welcome that the Bill proposes an extension to the final date for the receipt of claims.  It is important that we give more people time and that we do not rush through this process.  Time is always welcome.  It is good to have this legislation coming through the House in that regard.  The Bill also allows us to discuss other issues.  More than 6,000 women every year get early detection and treatment.  Those are lives saved every year and that is something for us to be proud of as a State.  We are doing something right in this area of women&rsquo;s healthcare.  I also welcome the introduction of the human papilloma virus, HPV, test last year.  That is a positive step.  The old test, if I am correct, caught seven out of ten cases, whereas the new test detects nine out of ten cases.  We have greater detection rates now and a more robust and safer screening programme in which we can have greater confidence.  That is very important.</p> <p>While we are making great headway in this area, I acknowledge that there are still women and their families dealing with the fallout from the CervicalCheck scandal and they will be dealing with it for the rest of their lives.  I think of the children left behind and the husbands and partners who have been bereaved.  It is a very sad situation.  While discussing this issue today, we must bear in mind that many of those women are still trying to fight their cases or have fought their cases.  I commend the 221+ support group that has undertaken amazing advocacy for women in this country.  It has kept this CervicalCheck issue live, to the fore and as a priority.  I say that because things in this job move at a great pace and we must deal with many issues as legislators and policymakers.  The Minister for Health also has to deal with many other issues going on in the State.  However, the 221+ group has been fantastic in ensuring that this issue stays to the fore.</p> <p>I ask for one reassurance from the Minister today.  On foot of everything the country and the women of Ireland have been through, it has been really upsetting for women to listen to all of this.  It was especially difficult when this CervicalCheck issue first arose.  You could have been sitting in the car, listening to reports on the radio and then wondering if your test was okay and if you needed to go and get rechecked.  That whole issue was there.  Every woman across the country felt that anxiety and was wondering if she was okay and if she needed to get rechecked.  Therefore, there is a healing process here for us to go through as a State.  If we can take one thing away from this whole matter, it will be to ensure that we educate and better inform young girls and women about the screening programme, what it does, its benefits and also its flaws.  It is a flawed system and no system is perfect.  If we can do that, then we will protect and save the lives of more girls and women in the future.  It is a positive takeaway from this whole situation.  If it is possible to find one positive aspect of this situation, that is it.</p> <p>It is good to be here on the floor of the House with so many other female legislators and policymakers, colleagues in the Seanad, to discuss this important issue.  It is also important that we have a female Acting Chair.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I also commend this Bill to the House and I support it 100%.  I am glad to see that the numbers who have registered have improved even this week since the debate in the D&aacute;il.  It is regrettable that we have only seven women involved from those more than 221 potential applicants.  I heard the Minister&rsquo;s reassurance that it looks like participation will improve and the number will increase.  I read the transcript of the Minister&rsquo;s speech in the D&aacute;il and I listened to him today.  I note that some of the requests of the 221+ group could not be accommodated due to the clear legal opinion of the Attorney General.</p> <p>I want to dwell on this aspect for a moment and consider it.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s role as defined in Article 30 of the Constitution enshrines it as an adviser to the Government.  The Attorney General is obliged to advise on all potential Government policy.  It is then our job as politicians to find a way forward, to surmount issues and to try to maximise meeting needs when we craft legislation.  We must keep the idea that politics is the art of the possible front and centre when we legislate.  Even when the Attorney General puts up roadblocks and states something cannot be done for this, that and the other reason, it is important for us to revisit an issue and state how it can be addressed while bearing in mind the advice from the Attorney General.</p> <p>The 221+ group has undertaken fantastic advocacy in respect of a shocking and horrific experience for those women.  It is one which resonates with us all as women.  The treatment they received in being obliged to go through the courts was horrendous.  I congratulate Vicky Phelan for her courage in being the first woman to stand up and speak out.  I welcome her home after treatment in the United States.  I am sure it was very difficult to be away from her family.  Treatment for many of these women, and for others diagnosed with cancer, particularly when it involves any sort of cervical cancer, involves hysterectomies.  Part of the standard treatment in our State in this regard is for women to be referred to the Rotunda Hospital where their eggs are taken and frozen, even when there is knowledge that they are going to have a hysterectomy.   </p> <p>This leads me on to what is probably a predictable subject.  In light of that practice, we need laws on surrogacy and we need international surrogacy laws.  We cannot yield to impediments being raised in this regard.  We must find a political solution, enter into discussions and engage with the advocacy groups.  I state that because some of the women who are members of the 221+ group need surrogacy and will need international surrogacy.  Others are women with cystic fibrosis.  The Irish Families Through Surrogacy group has really highlighted these stories.  People have shared their personal experiences regarding why they have needed international surrogacy.  Therefore, if we have a medical programme which anticipates the need for eggs post hysterectomy, then there is no reason we cannot find pathways to both domestic and international surrogacy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The statement that went to the "Today with Claire Byrne" show last week from the Department of Health has had a chilling effect on people throughout the country who are waiting for the Government and the Legislature's response to the report from Professor Conor O'Mahony that finds a pathway to international surrogacy.  This is not about morality.  It is about an ethical pathway to a treatment that is available.  Some of the language around the discussion is appalling in terms of how women are being categorised.  It is really important that we engage with this issue.  Women are accessing a service and we, as legislators, must have courage in embracing what is and will continue to be a reality.  Surrogacy is now a pathway to parenthood and we need to find a way to legislate for it.  We cannot rush the legislation and publish it without proper engagement.  Parents and their children need a response on surrogacy and it must be included from the outset in any Bill that comes to the floor of the Houses.  Let us not rush it.  Women and families deserve better than that.</p></speech>

It is important that the Minister listens to her point that there must be a pathway found between his Department and the Department of Justice in regard to international surrogacy.  I have heard anecdotally that there is an impasse on the issue.  The Minister needs to find the political will to address it.</p> <p>We are here to discuss the cervical screening programme and, as I speak, there are only women in the Chamber discussing it.  Ultimately, we have a role to ensure that trust is put back into the programme.  Extending the date by which people can submit claims goes some way to instilling trust in the CervicalCheck tribunal.  However, there is clearly still something wrong.  It is very easy to blame the lawyers for being greedy in wanting to go to the courts because they will not get huge fees if they go to the tribunal, but that is unfair.  No solicitor could advise his or her client to go to the tribunal when there are clear or perceived limitations to that forum.  We need to find a political way, as other speakers have said, to address the issues of recurrence and the statute.  If the hepatitis C tribunal was able to address the issue of recurrence, why can the CervicalCheck tribunal not do the same?  The changes set out in this Bill go some way to encouraging people to avail of the tribunal but the reality is that the system is not perfect.  Legal advisers are not going to advise their clients to go the tribunal route when they perceive limitations and consider it to be wrong to do so.  That needs to be addressed.</p> <p>We are here today because of the work of the many advocates involved in the 221+ group.  I do not like listing names because there are so many brave women, but I will mention Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na,  Irene Teap, Ruth Morrissey and Lorraine Walsh, all of whom have been in the public eye.  All the members of the 221+ group have kept this issue alive, as my colleague said, through huge adversity and pain for their families.  My father had cancer for a long time before he passed away.  I do not know how these women had the energy, going through this, to keep their fight alive.  It is commendable.  People are watching Vicky Phelan's journey as she goes to the United States, gets an apartment and goes through therapy.  Her experience gives hope not only to cervical cancer patients but also to many patients across the board.  It gives them courage to face their treatment and keep going.  Ms Phelan has been very generous in sharing the detail of her treatment and life.</p> <p>As other speakers noted, we have moved to the HPV first screening method for cervical cancer.  Screening has its limits and is not perfect.  As Senator Chambers said, the HPV procedure has a success rate of nine out of ten, but there are still 10% of samples that will get through the hoop.  We need to make people aware of the symptoms of cervical cancer, which include bleeding between periods and perhaps after intercourse.  Some women do not know about that and the message must be put out there.  As public representatives, we must use our platform to let women know what the symptoms are and that while screening is not perfect, it is vital that they attend their appointment because it may catch early abnormal cervical cells.  They also need to be alert to other symptoms that may present.</p> <p>This Bill is a first step towards improving the CervicalCheck tribunal but, as other speakers said, much more needs to be done.  The figures alone speak volumes and what they indicate cannot be denied.  The fact there have been only seven applicants makes clear that the system is not working and more must be done to improve the legislation.  We would all be delighted to come back to the House to see improvements in it.  Through the Leader's office and with the assistance of the Fianna F&aacute;il leader in the House, we would be very happy to schedule time to consider improvements to the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act.</p></speech>

It was wonderful news for the cohort of 35 patients who have amyloidosis.  I am delighted for Pat Tinsley, about whom I have spoken to the Minister and whose situation I have raised several times in the House.  This is a life-changing drug.  While I appreciate that the access programme has to be put in place, this news is a lifeline for many.  I thank the Minister for it.</p> <p>I also thank him for all the work he has done in the area of women's health since he came into office.  Within a relatively short period, he has put in place funding for more gynaecology services, enhanced endometriosis services and fertility clinics.  He has appointed a clinical lead for women's health and accepted the Free Provision of Period Products Bill 2021 that was tabled by our colleague, Senator Clifford-Lee.  The Bill the Minister is working on at the moment to do with assisted human reproduction is very important.  Senator Ardagh and I have been working closely with his officials on the issue of IVF.  There is also the matter of the issues that have arisen during the Covid period and the health challenges they present.</p> <p>Turning to the Bill that is before us, I want to express my compassion and understanding for, and solidarity with, all the women and their families who have been impacted by cervical cancer.  There are children, sadly, who have lost their mums.  This is a moment to reflect on what the women affected have gone through and the challenges ahead of them.  I welcome the extension that is proposed in the Bill for receipt of claims by the tribunal.  There will be an initial six-month extension, to 26 January next year, and a further extension to 6 July 2022.  Reference was made to the smaller than anticipated number of women taking up the tribunal process.  It is important for us to outline why this option is a good one.  Women eligible to present to the tribunal under the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists review are currently at a disadvantage in terms of time limits.  That is why this provision is particularly important.  It gives an opportunity for potential claimants to consider how effectively the tribunal deals with claims it has received to date.  The dedicated case management process operated by the tribunal means claims can be brought to a stage where mediation may take place much faster than is the case for a new claim lodged with the High Court.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that those who have already started court proceedings have the option to come back to the tribunal.  As Senator Chambers has outlined, it is also an opportunity to talk again about the importance of the screening process.  Over 6,000 women are referred for early treatment every year.  Cervical screening continues to have a highly significant value for population health in our country.  The introduction last year of the human papillomavirus screening test is a significant milestone for the screening programme.</p><p>It is my view and that of my party that the tribunal offers a more suitable and less adversarial alternative to the courts for dealing with eligible claims.  We know it may be several years before all claims are dealt with in the courts.  This is beyond the control of the Government.  By establishing the tribunal, the Government and Minister have provided an alternative forum with the exclusive purpose of dealing with the claims promptly.  The outreach programme put in place is to be commended.  The tribunal has a number of significant advantages and it is the best possible forum.  I wish the Minister well in his continued work.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for attending.  This really is tough because the CervicalCheck tribunal is such a mark on our history.  There have been terrible outcomes, including loss of life.  It is important to recognise the women affected and their families.</p><p>The cervical screening tribunal is examining the State cervical screening programme, including inaccurate diagnosis and lack of treatment.  As previous speakers have done, I encourage women to ensure they get regular checks.  With the lockdown and pandemic, we have prioritised other things and we sometimes forget about our own health.  I encourage women to log on to <i>cervicalcheck.ie</i>and book an appointment.  I acknowledge the general practitioner services in our towns and villages, many of which provide this service so it is not difficult to get this done.  I appeal to the Minister to introduce measures to support our GP services and primary care services to ensure more specialties for women's health in our local GP and family practices.</p><p>As has been mentioned, we should encourage parents of young girls to consider the importance of the HPV vaccine.  Imagine not having to go for smear tests.  Having access to the HPV vaccine is crucial.</p><p>The investment in the clinical lead for women's health is wonderful.  Senator O'Loughlin mentioned this as well.  Has that appointment been made appointed yet?  I will speak to the investment in healthcare infrastructure, resources and laboratories as well as the training of medical scientists.  All of these things will prevent anything like this recurring.  What infrastructure do we need to have in place?</p><p>I welcome the Bill to extend the period for compensation claims.  I acknowledge the bravery and strength of women who are suffering the impact of this.  I acknowledge the 221+ group, the CervicalCheck patient support organisation, which supports women taking the first step to go into this process.</p><p>We should acknowledge that this is an extremely onerous process.  It is such a demand on a woman who is going through this to have to deal with the potential tribunal or the legal side.  I acknowledge the strength and bravery of women who are doing that, as well as managing outcomes relating to their health.</p></speech>

I begin by welcoming Vicky Phelan home after six long months in the United States where she received treatment arising from her misdiagnosis under the CervicalCheck programme.  No individual should be required to leave her family, as Vicky did so bravely and amid a pandemic.  She had to go through this experience alone and that was genuinely awful.  The late Ruth Morrissey was another Limerick woman who was affected by CervicalCheck.  I recognise the courage of both women and how they prevailed through the most difficult of challenges.  It should never have happened.  I also recognise the work carried out by the 221+ group and other organisations, as many Senators have done today.  We need to ensure something of this nature never happens again.</p> <p>I welcome the amendments.  While I recognise that they are mainly technical, they are important.  We all recognise the importance of the Bill.  The extension of time is welcome, especially in light of the delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent cyberattack.  Can the time be further extended or should there be an overarching time limit?  The experiences of all women should not be disregarded.  They should be allowed access to the tribunal at a time suitable to them.  For many of the women in question, their health is very important and they are, unfortunately, going through a great deal.  Having spoken to some of them, it seems they are fighting for their lives in terms of their treatment and what they are going through with their families.  It is not always an appropriate time to apply for compensation.  Perhaps that is why there has been such low uptake to date.  Would it be feasible to investigate why the tribunals have seen such a low uptake?  Can we work with these women?  There are more than 200 of them.  Can we try to encourage more of them to apply and work with them on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#M00400"><p>I thank everyone for their contributions.  I have a wrap-up speech but I am not going use it.  Instead, I will try to respond to the questions and points raised because this has been a useful debate.</p> <p>I echo the sentiments expressed by Senators from across the Chamber that we have to get women's healthcare right.  We have never got women's healthcare right.  I have no doubt that if men had babies, Holles Street would look like the deck of the Starship Enterprise or the Blackrock Clinic or some other gorgeous place.  There is no question about it.  The maternity hospitals are not fit for purpose.  We have extraordinary clinicians throughout the country in obstetrics, gynaecology, midwifery and so many other areas.  We have not given women's healthcare the investment and focus it needs.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we have a deeply dark past and history when it comes to women's sexual and reproductive health in this country.  We know that and we all know the reasons for that.  What I want, and I think all of us want, is a revolution in women's healthcare.  We do not want marginal change or for things to get a little better.  We need to do women's healthcare fundamentally differently.  That means large amounts of money and cross-party political agreement in the Oireachtas to enable our phenomenal clinicians to do the jobs they know how to do and to do them better and better.  We need this in women's health.</p> <p>The women's health task force is amazing.  It has already identified many areas.  For younger women, it identified areas such as mental health, especially around eating disorders, wellness, sports and activity.  There is a great deal of focus on team sports and sports that have been more traditionally played by boys rather than girls and we need to rebalance that.  Sexual and reproductive health is essential in many different ways.  Obstetrics and gynaecology are important.  Menopause is now being flagged.  There was considerable focus on it publicly recently but the Department and the women's health task force were already examining the issue.</p> <p>I acknowledge the role played by Deputies and, in particular, Senators given that we are in the Seanad today.  I have been working on many of these issues with many of the Senators who contributed to the debate this morning.  When Senator Chambers and I were in opposition, she raised with me the issue of endometriosis.  We have set up the first specialist clinic in Tallaght and we are going to do much more.  Various Senators spoke about domestic surrogacy, international surrogacy, donor-assisted human reproduction and IVF.  We are moving on all these matters.  I will soon introduce legislation on surrogacy.  Three Departments are working on that.</p> <p>The maternity strategy from 2016 is very good and everyone bought into it but it never got any money, until this year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This year, I allocated five times more money to the maternity strategy than it got last year, so it is happening now.  They are hiring midwives and creating more choice for women around midwifery-led care, home births, community-based care and so forth.  We funded an extra 24 lactation consultants recently and we will keep going.  We have one of the lowest breastfeeding rates of anywhere in Europe; that has to stop.  It must change and we are going to change it.  We are setting up new fertility clinics and hubs.  There are new &quot;see and treat&quot; gynaecology centres that are very important.  There are some great ones already in existence, but we are expanding on them.  For the first time, we have funded a clinical lead out of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, for women's healthcare and primary care.  This has been mentioned by various Senators this morning.  That has to be just the beginning.  I have met with the cross-party women's caucus of the Oireachtas and we must keep meeting up.  We have an opportunity here - I am acutely aware that I am a male health Minister saying this, but so be it, there is nothing I can do about that - if we work together on this.  There is strong cross-party support in both Houses to start doing women's healthcare differently and make it something we can be immensely proud of.  There is no reason we cannot do this.  Other countries can and so can we.<br/><br/>I echo the importance of cervical screening.  I was taken by the many Senators who got that message out there, notwithstanding what was an horrific and unacceptable situation for the women involved in the 221+ group, which is what today is about.  It is wonderful to hear so many Senators echo the point that our cervical screening programme is one of the most advanced in the world.  We have some of the highest participation rates and most advanced technologies in the world.  I may have my numbers slightly wrong but, from recollection, deaths from cervical cancer were falling by 7% a year, from the year CervicalCheck was set up.  I remember the graph.  The rates were going up and up, but the year CervicalCheck came into being, they started going down.  Clinicians from around the world come here to understand how we have such a high participation rate.  It is partly because of the advocacy of political leaders like Members of this House and encouraging people.  We have the same thing with vaccines generally.  It is wonderful to hear the call being pushed again and again.<br/><br/>Not everything has been possible to deliver on, and the issue of recurrence was raised here this morning, but a lot has been done.  Dr. Scally's very good report came up with 170 recommendations.  Some 155 of those have been fully implemented and progress is being made on the last 15, so that is pretty good.  There were a lot of recommendations that involved a lot of work, and credit goes to our clinicians working in the HSE and officials in the Department for helping to make that happen.  There was an <i>ex gratia</i>payment of &euro;25,000 to recognise the trauma of the non-disclosure aspect of what happened.  Some 170 women applied for this and all 170 women received it.  I appointed a new independent chair to the steering group which the 221+ group had asked for.  There was progress made on medical cards, and other issues, as well.  However, not everything was possible.  The issue of recurrence is one of the big ones and I believe it is one of the reasons not as many women or families have applied.  The 221+ group decided not to support the tribunal, which was entirely its right to do.  We know the legal advice to some women and families is not to support the tribunal.  Can I take another minute, n&oacute;im&eacute;ad amh&aacute;in?</p></speech>

All I can say is that I wanted to do it.  Every Member of the Cabinet and the Oireachtas wanted to do it.  If it could have been done, we would have done it.  There were numerous conversations at the Cabinet about this.  Every time we brought it back, my Cabinet colleagues and I asked whether we could go further and do more.  We pushed and pushed for this.  It has never been out of a lack of willingness or due to not listening.  We have listened and we have got most of the requests over the line.  Some of them are just not possible because you hit up against the Constitution.  On the issue of recurrence, for example, if we did it and changed the Act, a few things would happen.  First of all, the laboratories would walk.  Under the Constitution, we cannot compel them to be involved in the tribunal.  Therefore, they would walk and go straight to the High Court.  The tribunal would shut down.  Even if the laboratories did not walk, which they would do, the initial awards would be lower because in the High Court, as in the tribunal, awards are given for the future possibility of recurrence.  It is already brought into the first award.  What would happen is that the first award would be reduced.  The legal advice I got was that if there was recurrence three or five years later, constitutionally, the laboratories would be allowed to ask that it be proven that it is a recurrence and that it is linked to what happened several years earlier.  Women could be potentially asked to go through a process again.  All I can say is that everything that was possible to do was done.  I am acutely aware of this.  There is nothing I would have liked more than to have got everything over the line.  We are all on the same team on this.  That is as far as it was able to go.</p> <p>In terms of the tribunal versus the High Court, it is up to every woman and family to do what they think is right.  It is up to me to lay out the case for the tribunal.  During the debate, I made a few notes on the advantages of the tribunal that we have tried to create over the High Court.  One is that it is much quicker.  It is months versus years, and, as colleagues have said, time matters.  Months versus years is really important.  The hearings are in private.  The whole thing has been set up differently from the courts to address the process women have had to go through.  The hearings are in private.  There are pre-hearing steps that reduce the adversarial nature of it.  There are, for example, written statements rather than verbal testimony.  The hearings are less formal.  I remind the House that this is a specialist tribunal just for CervicalCheck cases.  Like a commercial court or a specialist court, the tribunal does not have to go through and re-establish facts of law or science.  That gets incorporated in it.  The legal fees are lower in the tribunal than in the High Court.  The facilities are specially designed.  There are bespoke facilities, including private rooms, specifically for CervicalCheck hearings.  Any woman, at any time, can immediately go to the High Court if she is not happy with how things are going in the tribunal.  We have given tight assurances that there would be no penalties in terms of cost or anything else.  The State has underwritten any potential liabilities for additional legal fees or else anything like that.  The justice, the chair of the tribunal, has agreed that the tribunal will fully support and encourage mediation, which many of these cases will hopefully end up in.</p> <p>Those are some of the advantages of the tribunal.  In contrast to that, there is no advantage of the High Court over the tribunal - there is not one.  That is why we introduced this legislation and set up the tribunal.  In so many ways, we tried to set it up to be better than the High Court process.  There is not a single criterion that I can find where the High Court is a better option than the tribunal.  The debate has been that unless we get everything over the line, the tribunal is not what we wanted it to be - I accept that.  There is nothing we would have wanted more.  Part of my job is to lay out why the tribunal is a better option for the women and families because they are all who matter here.  Let us remember, there is a default that at any given hour of any given day when a case is in the tribunal, a woman can say that it is not working for her and she can go back to the High Court.  She can do that, and the State will cover any costs or issues there.  I will finish with that.  I thank the Chair for the extra time and colleagues for what has been an important debate this morning.</p></speech>

It is important to pass it and, to be clear, we will not delay it today in any way.  He had a good debate with my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, in the D&aacute;il about this.  I will speak to these three amendments together because they are classed as such and are, effectively, trying to do the same thing.  I proposed them to ensure that a worker's name is not included in a published decision where it might impact on his or her ability to secure future employment.  </p><p>I will refer back to my time as a trade union official and the difficulties that can occur for employees in difficult cases.  I will give a concrete example from Limerick.  A particular employee in a service sector job had a hard time from her employer in all sorts of ways.  One of the issues that infuriated her were discrepancies in her pay.  I represented this employee and, as the Minister of State knows, at that time the company's name was, typically, published but the employee's name was not.  The difficulty and concern she had was that Limerick is a small place and if someone is trying to get work in the hospitality sector there it could jeopardise his or her chances if his her name is published in respect of a case.  It could make employers think, &quot;Well hold on, if this person has taken a case against an employer, do I really want the person coming to work for myself?&quot;</p><p>The amendment addresses that type of circumstance where there is a particular vulnerability.  We are not suggesting that employees' names are not published.  We are simply suggesting that the Bill has discretion when the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, appreciates there is a particular vulnerability.  Let us be clear: the vulnerability is often on the employee's side in these matters.  We are looking for flexibility in order that the employee's name would not have to be mentioned.  The Minister of State knows where we are coming from on this matter.  I do not intend to speak at length about it but would like to hear his opinion at this point in time. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1637" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#Q00800"><p>I will take up the Senator's point.  It is important that the Bill is passed.  The key issue for me is "workplace".  Those of us who have been involved in advocating for, and representing, people recognise that the workplace is a complex, diverse institution, whether it is the public or private sector.  Senator Gavan touched on vulnerability, but people are afraid, in some cases, to come forward.  People are in situations of genuine difficulty in the workplace and if they make a complaint, it is dismissed or not acted upon.</p> <p>In the context of the adjudication officer conducting affairs in public, and there is a need for transparency whether it is a social welfare appeal or an issue in the workplace, I always hold the view that whatever is done should be done quietly and behind the scenes.  In many cases, people can then progress their complaint and they can be heard.  The key phrase is "they can be heard".  Their action can be upheld or otherwise but it is important that we give people the security of confidentiality. </p> <p>I welcome what the Minister of State is doing and, to be fair to him, he has engaged extensively on this matter.  It is important that we pass the Bill.  It is also important that we allow people in the workplace to have a voice, including the right to join a union, which is not part of this Bill.  However, it is important, in general, that we give people that right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#Q00900"><p>I thank the Senators for their contributions and for tabling amendments, which are proposed in good faith.  I accept we had a discussion in this House and in the D&aacute;il earlier in the week on the issue of public versus private proceedings.  I understand the concerns about that but we have a duty to respect the Supreme Court decision, and to implement legislation as best we can to reflect it, while getting the balance right.  I believe we are doing that.  Discretion is provided for in the Bill and it is important to do that.</p> <p>The Supreme Court has been clear that the administration of justice, even when its ambition is to provide an efficient, user-friendly and cost-effective dispute resolution system outside the formal courts, must maintain certain cornerstones of the justice system.  A fundamental aspect of the administration of justice is the requirement that it should be done in public.  There are exceptions to that rule and I am satisfied that the draft Bill delivers on this policy.  There is room for discretion, as we have discussed previously.  It is important that that would be there and we can certainly reflect that.  We will bring forward regulations and guidelines to inform the decision-making of the adjudication officer on that issue, in addition to the public versus private aspect of it.  </p> <p>In recognition of the fact that in certain circumstances the administration of justice is more appropriate behind closed doors, we have introduced in this Bill clear entitlement to address the issue with an adjudication officer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This means that either party may request a private party or that they are not named in a publicised decision.  The other party must be on notice of said request and have an opportunity have their say on the matter.  I am sure that the Senator accepts this.  Such exemptions are subject to special circumstances, such as where a case involves a minor, sensitive health or other social matters, sexual harassment, protected disclosures and so on.  It is at the discretion of the adjudication officer, who is the person in charge of the case, like the judge in that situation.  Such officers have the ability, on their own opinion, to make that call.  That is probably as far as we can go with the legislation to build in that discretion, while reflecting the advice of the Supreme Court that it is in public.  In recognition of the fact that the WRC is the court of first instance and that some parties may not have considered privacy issues, we have included a power for the adjudication officer in circumstances in which the facts of the case may warrant such inquiry to raise the matter with the parties.  Therefore, they can bring it up themselves and they can give advice.  I am conscious that it might be the first engagement of some members, certainly of some employees.  They might not have brought any support with them.  The adjudication officer will be able to recognise that and give advice or suggestions and help to inform the people coming through that.  In my view, the legislation, as drafted before us, is the only acceptable way of balancing the rights of the complainant, the respondent and wider civil society by ensuring fairness in an impartial way.  The necessity for transparency and impartiality are essential parts of our justice system.  Persons who are tasked with administration of justice must adhere to fair procedures at all times.  Adjudicators do not make decisions based on feelings.  Their role is to decide on facts applicable to the law .  In doing so, they have a duty to enquire into matters before reaching a decision.  Reasons supporting a decision must also be given.  A statutory provision which in any way anticipates victimisation or penalisation of a person is undesirable from a fairness and public interest point of view.  For this reason and for the reasons previously stated, I cannot accept this amendment.  However, I understand what is behind it.  I think we have achieved what the Senator wants in the legislation.  Again, regulations and guidance will come after we have completed our work on it in this House.  </p></speech>

First, I hear what the Minister of State is saying.  I acknowledge that he is doing his best to meet these concerns.  I put on record that this is a good move overall.  It is important that in most cases we will find out who the companies are.  That was a flaw in the original Act of 2015.  Sinn F&eacute;in is supportive of the legislation but we have one concern, which is why I will press a little further.  The concern is the idea that a worker's name could be published by the WRC against his or her wishes.  That is my concern but I acknowledge the points the Minister of State has made in that regard.</p></speech>

From my own experience, I have often volunteered to be part of the referee process for individuals I have represented where, when they go for their next employment, it has been important for them to have their representative be prepared to explain the circumstances.  Therefore, I understand the sentiment.  However, it needs to be particular and there is no reason we would be too prescriptive to the adjudication officer as to his or her discretion.  The discretion, as it is provided for in the Bill, is sufficient.  We can support it with regular training and updating the continuing professional development, CPD, done by the adjudication officers.  This can be built into their term-beginning training.   We can do that.  As this is a new scenario, we have new sensitivities to be borne in mind.  In the same way that we responded in respect of housing under equal status legislation, we can look at the Employment Equality Act, where litigation has occurred in that context.  In future, maybe that will be open for review and we can consider reviewing an inclusion.  If there is evidence of prejudice arising from having taken cases or an inhibition to access employment in the future or some sort of an inhibitor, there is no reason we could not consider it in the same way that we do for landlords refusing housing assistance payment, HAP.  We can start by being creative, in adding into the employment equality.  There are solutions, without being overly prescriptive in the Act.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1637" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#R00600"><p>I have a question for the Minister of State about the adjudication officers.  Who appoints them and what are their qualifications?  When we create legislation, I worry that sometimes, the practicalities in respect of the courts' decisions are different.  I want us to make it easy for people.  Senator Seery Kearney mentioned the referee process and I fully support that.  However, I seek more clarity on the role of the adjudication officer for myself.  I apologise that I might not necessarily know this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#R00800"><p>For the purposes of today's discussions, because I am conscious that not everybody was in the room when we discussed during the week, I will set out exactly what is in section 4, as well as the amendments being put forward.</p><p>Section 4 contains an amendment of section 41 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015, in respect of the provision in section 41(13) of that Act.  It currently provides that &quot;Proceedings under this section before an adjudication officer shall be conducted otherwise than in public&quot;.  The court held, in paragraph 148 of its judgment:</p> <blockquote> 	It is appropriate to declare [section 41(13)]  repugnant to the Constitution.  The effect is that the prohibition on public hearings is removed, and proceedings may, but not must, be heard in public. </blockquote> <p>This is Supreme Court decision is telling us this has to be done in public, as routine.  However, we are then allowing for a decision to made by the adjudication officer to do some of this work in private when it is justified.  The proposed amendment refers to the adjudication officer to whom a complaint of dispute has been referred.  In response to Senator Buttimer, the chair of the WRC will assign a case to the adjudication officer.  There is an issue in relation to their qualifications and independence that we will deal with again.  I did touch on it but for now, we must get the law right.  We will come back to the qualifications and independence.  However, there is a procedure they have to go through to be appointed in the first place.  It is accepted that the majority of adjudication officers are fit to do their job.  We will strengthen the work around that as well.  Therefore, they are assigned the case.  In previous discussions in the other House, there was a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment on an appeal mechanism.  We had a fair discussion on this.  I understand what was behind it but when one assigns the case to an adjudication officer, he or she is the judge.  One would not necessarily appeal it back to the chair, who would not have heard the case in the first place.  </p><p>There is the option to appeal outside the WRC to the Labour Court and to the District Court.  There are other appeal mechanisms already in place if someone is unhappy with a decision.  In that regard, the adjudication officer to whom a complaint or dispute has been referred will have discretion to direct that either the whole or part of the relevant proceedings can take place otherwise than in public where this would be desirable in light of the nature or circumstances of the case or in the interests of justice.  Therefore, the discretion is there to make such a direction.  The default position in respect of such proceedings is that they would be held in public.  Pursuant to this provision, the adjudication officer can make the determination of his or own motion but this does not exclude parties to complaint or dispute applying to the adjudication officer to have the whole or part of the proceedings held in private.  </p><p>In respect of the proposed substitution of section 14(14), while the judgment of the court does not address the issue of automatic anonymisation, which is currently provided for in section 14, it is the Department's view, supported by strong legal advice, that maintaining policy of anonymisation of all published decisions is contrary to the requirement that justice be administered in public.  It does not mean that we cannot do that in certain cases, however, which is what Senator Gavan is asking for.  We are at one here.  We both agree there has to be discretion to allow for anonymisation at the appropriate time.  That is allowed for.  That is why we do not need to take Senator Gavan's amendment.</p><p>The proposed section 14(14)(b) provides that an adjudication officer with the powers to effectively direct a commission, if he or she is satisfied that special circumstances exist, not to name parties in the published decision.  It is already there in the draft legislation that I am putting forward.  I know that Senator Gavan is bringing forward the amendment in good faith.  I say to him, in good faith, it is already allowed for.  I want to be clear on that.  Again, the regulations and guidance will inform the work of the adjudication officer in this space.  </p><p>I am happy to share draft regulations and guidance with everybody in this House to get their views and to make sure that it is strengthened.  Senator Gavan's concern in his second contribution was that, against the wishes of the person, he or she would be forced to be in public.  It is the Supreme Court who has made the decision that it has to be in public as the default position.  That is in our Constitution.  But we will allow, when it is right to do so, to have it anonymised and in private.  To be clear, justice is based on respect of the rights of every individual.  I know that both Houses in which we operate recognise that access to justice is indispensable for every democratic state that is rooted in the principles of the rule of law, human rights and democracy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Our system is based on the right of individuals to take a case against an employer whom they believe has violated a right.  I said last week that everybody should be encouraged to discuss this in public or private and have his or her rights honoured.  We believe that for a violation of a right to be decided upon, fair procedures have to be adhered to.  That is what the Supreme Court is judged on.  We have to put in place procedures to ensure justice is administered fairly.</p><p>It should not be stated that because an employee is taking a claim against an employer, he or she should be criticised for exercising that right.  I am concerned about the assumptions made in both Houses that an employer will judge a potential employee badly if he or she pursued his or her rights.  In this country, people are entitled to pursue their rights, so we should not assume employers will regard this as negative.  It is an unfair assertion.  I would be concerned about the tone of it because it does not reflect how the justice system is meant to work.  We should not be assuming employers will have a negative view.  There should not be any statutory statement relying on a feeling that employers, as a rule, view all employees who exercise their fundamental rights as troublemakers.  Doing so is not fair or right and it does not truly represent what happens in this scenario.  I understand some individuals have concerns.  They will be able to make their case to the adjudication officer.  We should not be assuming that what I have described presents a difficulty in all scenarios.</p><p>The provisions of this Bill already provide for discretion regarding how anonymisation is to be addressed when the circumstances so require it and are justified.  I am aware Senators are genuinely anxious about this area so I want to ensure the WRC can proceed with its important work.  It is important we pass the legislation.  Since the Senators have concerns, we have agreed, in conjunction with the committee members on a cross-party basis, that we will review the legislation within 12 months.</p><p>I do not see the benefit in accepting this amendment because it would open the door to a new challenge in the superior courts.  That is not what we want.  We want to be able to copper-fasten the work of the WRC, which is well recognised.  The legislation of 2015 will be recognised by the Supreme Court, as will changes to ensure justice is administered in public.  That is what we are trying to achieve here.  The officials in the Department have done a lot of work in the past couple of weeks to try to ensure as best we can in legislation that the WRC will be able to continue with its great work and deal with the cases in the system while recognising the need to do this in public in most cases.</p></speech>

We will see the repeat offenders.  As I said some days ago, there are appalling cases of repeat offending.  The reporting of cases will allow us to see just how innocent employees fall prey to ignorance and arrogance in some instances, and to see that the employees are right in such instances.  The reporting of cases will raise the standard and expose repeated claims of ignorance as to how the law works.  Ignorance is not an excuse under the law, but there are occasions on which employers are just ignorant.  Some employers almost have to be brought to the WRC and have a case adjudicated upon before realising their obligations or that they really do have to make sure employees have their breaks along with many other entitlements.  Reporting will lend itself to bringing about circumstances where taking a case is normal and not shameful.  The people who take cases are not troublemakers.  They are very normal people who are being treated unfairly or whose employer's interpretation of the law is unfair and needs to be addressed.  It is for this reason they take a case.  What the Minister of State proposes would be positive.  I support him on that.</p></speech>

This is a simple amendment to ensure a review under section 13 will examine whether the provisions of the legislation are having a chilling effect on employees.  I am aware others share our concern that the provisions introduced in this Bill, especially where they relate to public hearings and the disclosure of the names of parties to proceedings, could deter employees from bringing claims against their employers.  The point has been made that there is a significant power imbalance between employees and employers.  Workers have fewer resources and options and so much more to lose.  As a result, it takes a lot of courage for an employee to take a case against an employer.  The benefit of conducting hearings in private and ensuring published decisions are anonymised is employees may be assured that making a complaint against their employer will not damage their career or affect their future job prospects.  If an employee believes his or her name and the details of the claim will be available to the public, he or she may choose not to proceed out of fear it would have consequences for the rest of his or her life.  We are concerned, therefore, that the proposal in the Bill might have the unintended consequence of deterring employees from making a complaint, even where they have a strong case against their employer.</p><p>We acknowledge the legislation was introduced on foot of the judgment of the Supreme Court and, further, that the Bill provides that hearings may be held in private under certain circumstances, but we believe a review of the Act under section 13 should recognise these concerns and examine whether and the extent to which the amended legislation is deterring employees from making complaints.  This is important because we need to ensure that if these provisions have a chilling effect, it will be remedied as soon as possible to allow employees to avail of the law and the relevant complaint mechanisms to have their rights vindicated.</p></speech>

I will not be able to accept it because we have already allowed for what it proposes in legislation.  We got into this in detail earlier in the week although I am conscious that not everybody could be here.  I also discussed it with colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  I gave a strong commitment on the proposed review.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The amendment being put forward relates to a provision we inserted into the draft Bill following a positive and productive cross-party engagement with the members of the Oireachtas joint committee.  For the information of the House, because we were asking for pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill to be waived due to its urgency, we met members of the committee and others who were interested in the matter.  We took on board their concerns and the issues they raised.  One of their suggestions was that the legislation should be reviewed after 12 months.  I was happy to commit to that.  To be clear, I will put on the record of this House - as I put on the record of the D&aacute;il last week - that the post-enactment review will be a fully consultative process.  Anybody who wishes to get involved is welcome to do so.  It will examine the implications of the new policy positions introduced in this draft Bill which, as the House will be aware, stem directly from the Supreme Court judgment in the Zalewski case.  I am happy to commit again on the record of this House that the review will encompass the views of all relevant stakeholders, including groups representing service users.</p><p>However, it is important to clarify that there should be no implication whatsoever that the Bill will result in any deterrent effect.  I am very concerned by the constant use of the term "chilling effect".  Too many have used it in this discussion and in the discussion in the other House.  To do so is almost the same as telling people that they should feel a chilling effect.  This is positive legislation.  We are bringing it forward to help people vindicate their rights.  If we constantly say that there will be a chilling effect, we encourage people to feel such an effect and to be afraid to use the positive laws we are introducing to vindicate their rights.  I am concerned about the tone and about the message that is going out.  I accept that people are raising the issue in a genuine way but it sends out a message that may defeat the purpose of the new law, which is to assist people.  There should never be any suggestion that employees should be negatively impacted by pursuing their right in law to pursue a case against their employer.  The Bill as drafted already provides for special circumstances, to be decided on a case-by-case basis.  Details may be anonymised and cases may be heard in private, where necessary.  For these reasons I cannot accept this amendment.</p><p>I am somewhat baffled as to how one would carry out a meaningful assessment of something that did not happen but could have.  The review can go as far as people wanted.  We will review everything but it would be hard to second-guess what might have happened in a different situation.  We will tease it out.  While I appreciate that employee bodies and employee representatives could provide some anecdotal assessments, I am not convinced of the value of such exercise.  However, I am happy to engage with everybody regarding the review.  On the last occasion, I made it clear that I will talk to anybody.  I have no doubt that whoever fills my job after I depart - because I will not be here forever - will also listen to anybody and go through a full consultation if it is within the 12 months.  My officials are committed to getting this right.  We all want to see the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, carrying out its functions in a positive way because it is there to vindicate the rights of employees.  That is what it is about.  That is our goal.  If the review throws up any issues, we will try to deal with them as best we possibly can in line with the Supreme Court judgment.</p><p>Over the years, trade union officials and employees themselves have told me that people will not take cases against their employers.  The reason for this inaction is because people, it has been said, are afraid of the repercussions of being seen as a person who complains.  These conversations took place before the Supreme Court judgment issued, at a time when all hearings were conducted in private and employment rights complaints were anonymised.  I accept that disputes are never easy, but they are sometimes necessary.  </p><p>We also know that, before the 2015 Act brought in by my colleague in the Labour Party which introduced private hearings, cases before the Employment Appeals Tribunal were held in public.  Equality legislation, covering both workplaces and the provision of goods and services, has never provided for anonymisation.  In the equality cases, discretion has been exercised in special cases and in consultation with the parties involved.  Regardless of these policies, numerous individuals have fought for their rights and significant changes have been brought about in our workplaces as a consequence.  Having such discussions often assists others in fighting for their rights, which can be of benefit.  It highlights employers that have a poor record and may encourage them to deal with situations a lot more quickly because they do not want to be in the public eye.</p><p>I have already given my commitment in the Lower House that this review is not going to be a mere paper exercise.  We will be consulting with all relevant stakeholders, as is appropriate.  To be clear, that will be done in 12 months.  That is included in the draft Bill because members of the cross-party committee asked for it.  I am happy to stand over that.</p></speech>

I said I would speak after the Minister of State.  He has comprehensively covered why this amendment is not necessary.  In addition, as I have said before, I believe the reporting and publication of matters at the adjudication hearing stage informs members of the public as to their employment rights.  You have to know your way around the WRC website.  It is really good and really thorough, there is very good advice on it and it provides good access to decisions and determinations but you have to know your way around it or know what you are looking for.  From that point of view, having journalists report on and speak about cases, which they will now be able to do, will make employment rights much more accessible to the public.  That is a good thing.  Since the year 2000, a statutory instrument has been in effect, which sets outs the procedures for dealing with disputes in the workplace, whether grievances or disciplinary matters.  I refer to SI 146 of 2000.  Over the years, that has been elevated almost to the level of primary law in how it has been adhered to.  It ensures that there is a proper internal mechanism for resolving disputes within companies and sets out how things such as the right to a representative are to be dealt with.  There has also been a trend to include penal clauses within legislation that witnesses before the WRC and complainants under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 who suffer any sort of consequence as a result of raising concerns can use.  There are, therefore, already appropriate safeguards.  The review, as set out, will be fairly comprehensive.</p> <p>If, as a consequence of the public nature of hearings, we find ourselves in a situation in which numbers drop, that may be a really positive thing.  It may not mean that people were fearful but rather that employers do not want the publicity and may be deterred.  The public nature of it reinforces the power of the employee.  I have often used the tactic of threatening to go public, to appeal to the Labour Court or to go for an injunction against employers.  Their need to maintain their reputations has given me a great weapon.  I say that cautiously but it is a weapon to use in all areas of litigation.  It is part of what you are taught when learning to negotiate.  I hope we will find ourselves with lower numbers as a consequence of better standards.  Even if the amendment were to be accepted, I am not sure how the question could be answered.  However, the Minister of State has already covered its purpose in the provisions of the Bill.</p></speech>

The Bill will assist people in coming forward.  We have to recognise that it is okay to pursue your rights.  It is not something that should be hidden away.  Employers should see it as a positive.  If, in the future, an employer reacts negatively to employees pursuing their rights, perhaps those employees might not want to work with that employer.  You have to look at it that way as well.  Again, the tone of the debate over these couple of days might give some employees the impression that they should not bring their cases forward.  To be clear, any employee who has a grievance should engage with our industrial relations team.  The WRC is there and does excellent work.  Employees should engage with it.  Again, if people do not want their cases heard publicly, they can make their case to an adjudication officer, who has the discretion to decide for it not to be heard in public.  If, at that point, people still have concerns or fears, they can always pull back.  However, they should not choose not to engage in the first place because of certain impressions people might get from this debate.  I hope they do not because this law is here to protect employees and to encourage them to come forward and pursue their rights.  We can adjudicate on that.  The review should pick up on any major concerns.</p></speech>

While I did not think it would happen this way, I am particularly pleased that these two amendments are being taken right at the beginning of the debate.  For many years I was a councillor on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  I know the Minister used to be a councillor, as have many Members of this House.  I took a lot of trouble to look at the record of the House and I am very happy to share all this with the Minister.  I want to be positive, as he is.</p> <p>At the outset, I say that I genuinely support the bulk of the Bill.  I have a strong record in supporting it.  I have always said I do not have any hang-up about the public sector working with the private sector.  Senator Cummins has emphasised that in his contributions.  I am a former Progressive Democrat counsellor who advocated for the private sector and I have never apologised for that.  I believe it is using all our resources and all our tools to get houses built.  This is one very important aspect of it.</p> <p>I think many things are coming right for the Minister.  I am sure he is looking forward to his summer holidays, as we are, because he is clearly getting a considerable amount of legislation tidied up and hopefully finished.  I genuinely wish the Minister the best of luck with his housing for all policy next week.  As a member of the committee, I will continue to actively engage with the Minister on its objectives and aspirations.</p> <p>The Minister might note that I did not pursue any of the other amendments because I wanted to keep the focus on this one.  If there was ever one single issue of importance, it is this issue.  I said previously that the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, drafted these amendments.  I share that body's concerns on these issues and it shared these documents.  Members of the AILG along with the Local Authority Members Association appeared before the committee.  They strongly voiced their concern over the disposal.</p> <p>We know what a section 183 disposal is.  For those who are not in the Chamber and would not be familiar with it, I will take two or three minutes of my time to explain.  There are reserved functions and there are executive functions in local government.  The executive functions are clearly for the executive and the reserve functions are for the elected members.  Section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, provides for a disposal notice.  It empowers the local authority members to have a veto, for want of a better word, over the disposal of leases that are over 12 months or freehold or disposal of properties.  They could be sites, derelict lands or properties.  It covers a range of issues.  The system has served the country and local authorities well.</p> <p>The manager, now the chief executive, is required to present a report to the elected members.  In that he is required to provide a map.  He is required to give a history of the thing.  He is required to set out if there are any encumbrances or difficulties relating to the disposal or any conditions prior to that.  To the best of his knowledge he must set out the history of how the property came into the hands of the local authority and the reason for now proposing its disposal.  Those reports are sent to the elected members.  They consider them and take their own soundings.  Invariably councillors have considerable knowledge because they are on the ground and live in these communities.  </p> <p>One of the great things about section 183 is conditionality.  Next week Sligo County Council will consider a section 183 proposal.  Quite a few of them are being considered by other local authorities.  I took on the task of looking at the ones this year and last year.  I took a particular interest in Fingal County Council and Dublin generally because these are big places where the bigger issues are.  I also looked at Limerick and D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is interesting to see the trend in the political people and parties involved who rightly opposed them.  That is their prerogative and is provided for in the legislation.  Invariably they do not oppose them but try to apply conditions.</p> <p>One of the provisions relating to a section 183 disposal, as the Minister knows, is that elected members may apply conditions to the sale.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Without going into the matter, the Oscar Traynor site exercised the Minister and many other people.  Today, however, I looked at a debate in March in Dublin City Hall and noted the correspondence and the engagement surrounding the debate.  I printed it all off.  Fine Gael had a very strong, concise view, and most of that was channelled and discussed through James Geoghegan, who is one of the party's councillors there.  Fine Gael was very clear and there was no ambiguity as to where it stood on this.  Fianna F&aacute;il discussed the proposed land development agency, LDA, and expressed serious concerns about it <i>per se</i>, and that is absolutely right.  RT&Eacute; covered this.  Cieran Perry, an excellent Independent councillor on Dublin City Council, said in Dublin City Hall that the Government may regard councillors as an inconvenience but that they are the democratically elected representatives of our communities.  Further, the Labour Party councillor of long experience, Dermot Lacey, said the LDA Bill amounted to a land grab and a power grab that repeated a 20-year pattern of weakening of local government.  Those are just some of the things that were said.<br/><br/>Fianna F&aacute;il expressed serious concerns about the Bill.  There were eight different motions that night.  They were debated at the meeting, with Sinn F&eacute;in and People Before Profit opposing the Bill in its entirety while the Green Party, the Labour Party, the Social Democrats and the Independents criticised the loss of councillors' control over the disposal of local authority lands.  Fianna F&aacute;il expressed concern about councillors' loss of power.  That is what was said at Dublin City Council.  I say this just to give the Minister a flavour of the debate and the concerns and because the AILG and the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, are made up of members of his party, Fianna F&aacute;il.  They are committed and have expressed a view, and those are their representative bodies.  The Minister is entitled to his view; I respect that absolutely.  This is not personal but political.  These organisations' memberships are made up of Fine Gael and all other parties, Independents, non-party councillors - everybody - and I wish to put on the record my enormous thanks to the president of the AILG, Mary Hoade, a member of Fianna F&aacute;il, who has done a lot of work on this, and Anne Colgan, who prepared these papers for the members.<br/><br/>Where does that leave us?  I take this opportunity to thank also our committee, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, for its work and engagement with these representative bodies.  We heard loud and clear what the elected members wanted and what these associations wanted.  I tabled 12 amendments, all in the name of the AILG, because it had done the work on them and presented them to me.  We moved four of them the other night.  The Minister came in and said he would not take any amendments, as is his right.  That is grand.  We can only put our best foot forward.  This is democracy and we are a bicameral Parliament.  It should be remembered that we are here not just to agree.  As the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, said when he addressed the House a year or two ago, we would expect in a bicameral Parliament that the Seanad would polish up and perhaps make amendments to legislation.  Indeed, the D&aacute;il took on board a number of Seanad amendments to the climate action Bill late last night.  That was important and represents a good and healthy relationship between the two Chambers, which are distinctly separate yet inter-reliant in many ways.  I also thank the Library and Research Service because it did a very extensive Bill digest on the legislation.<br/><br/>Where am I going with this?  It is right we should empower councillors.  I do not doubt the Minister's commitment in that regard.  I spoke to a number of Fine Gael people who asked me to take a look at the original Bill, which I did, and in the Bill there was no question of section 183 being watered down at all.  The Minister clearly took on board some issues and added the piece, which I acknowledge, whereby only zoned land would be deemed suitable.  I would go so far as to say the LDA in the future should have a bigger remit beyond residential.  It could be tied in with its relationship with Enterprise Ireland in this area, but that is another day's work.  I think there is future scope, but that is for another day.<br/><br/>We have heard a lot of talk about empowering and supporting local government, about mayors and about the plebiscite that took in place in Limerick in which they decided they would have a mayor.  Now it would appear even the mayor would have no veto.  The Minister has a good track record in how he has worked in local government but he has clearly had his battles in Fingal, and rightly so.  He represented the people out there.  Why are we going to empower unelected chief executives with this function?  Why are we taking this function away from the elected members?  I have had my own advice on this that tells me it is proposed the Government will take away this reserved function from the elected members in certain circumstances.  I do not know why.  What happened between the Minister, the change in government and the new Government with the earlier Bill, which contained no mention of taking away section 183?  Suddenly I am told the County and City Management Association, CCMA, thought it was a great idea.  Of course they think it is a great idea, but they are not elected.  Fianna F&aacute;il's councillors in the city and the county are elected and we are all equal here.  We all have a mandate to represent people.  I simply will not apologise.  I work hard, as everyone else in this Chamber does.  I engage with city and county councillors because I like to do so.  It is my full-time job, and I will always defend the rights of our democratically elected city and county councillors.  I am not in the business of eroding any of their powers.  I want to see them have more powers.  I want to see us devolve more powers.  I want to stop seeing these great announcements every day of the week in which the Government says it will throw money at this and throw money at that and about how it is funding projects around the country.  Let the local authorities make those announcements and those decisions.<br/><br/>The Minister will be aware of section 28A.1 of the Irish Constitution, which states:</p><blockquote>	The State recognises the role of local government in providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities, in exercising and performing at local level powers and functions conferred by law and in promoting by its initiatives the interests of such communities. </blockquote><p>It is important we support these people.  They represent us.  We talk about better local government.  We need to revisit that and support measures for better local government.  We talk about more powers for councillors, yet this initiative will take them away, despite what the Minister might say.  We talk about having mayors directly elected by the people and the communities, yet mayors will not be able to engage on this.  We talk in this legislation, which I want to stay focused on, about how we are taking away those functions from the elected members.  It is just not right or proper.  I would be failing in my duty and, more importantly, in my commitment to the people who elected me to this House, the city and county councillors and Deputies and Senators in this House, if I did not say this.  I have enjoyed cross-party support.  I have always tried to work with people because that is important.<br/><br/>I am not convinced the Minister has done the right thing here.  I understand the timelines and understand that the D&aacute;il is going into recess, but I had flagged this and many other people had flagged concerns about this legislation for a long time.  The Minister's party members, some of whom did not get elected to the D&aacute;il and some of whom came from councils, went door to door to speak to our city and county councillors, as did I.  They made commitments.  They know the commitments they made.  I am not necessarily aware of them but I know what commitments I made.  I committed that I would fight for the rights of local government and fight for city and county councillors because I thought it was important.  I sought to be a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government during the term of the previous Seanad and was happy to be put on it through these Houses and through the processes of the Houses.  I sought for the second time to be on the committee because I wanted to be on it and because I believe in local government, I believe in local democracy, I believe in our city and county councillors, I believe they need to be supported and I believe in better actions, subsidiarity and making decisions for our people on our homes, our communities, security, enterprise and all the issues that feed into what community is.<br/><br/>I make this case to the Minister today because I have taken the fight to the front line.  I have done my best; I can do no more.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It rests with the Members of this House.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#BB00200"><p>This issue is close to my heart as a former local authority member.  I am proud to have been elected and re-elected to the largest local authority in the country, Dublin City Council.  I also speak on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Seanad group.  All Fianna F&aacute;il Senators are close to the local authority members and many of them had the honour of being elected to their local authority and representing their local communities.  They understand in detail and value enormously the role of local authority members.  I thank on their behalf Mary Hoade, Anne Colgan and the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, for their submissions with regard to the Land Development Agency and their inputs to the other legislation we have been progressing, namely, the Affordable Housing Bill and the Planning and Development Bills.</p> <p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Seanad group has had many discussions with the Minister and our parliamentary party subcommittee on housing, which I chair, has addressed this issue.  We do not address the issue of local authority members' reserved functions in isolation.  We look at it in the round.  We are committed to local government and believe in strengthening it.  Most important, we believe in strengthening the powers of local authority members.  That is why the Minister made good on the promise that had been made for so long to councillors to address their terms and conditions and I commend him on that.  He has delivered on the Moorhead report, which was long overdue.  AILG and other councillors campaigned on it and the Minister delivered that.</p> <p>On top of that, the Minister acted when it came to the development plans.  The most important reserved functions that local authority members have, arguably, are the ability to make strategic policy and to own the plan for their local authority area, be it a city or county plan.  They undertake the work with pride.  It takes a lot of their time and energy to engage with the executive function and with the other stakeholders, including, most importantly, the communities they represent.  When it comes to county and city development plans, the Ministers has given the local authority members, rather than the executive, the power to extend those plans and to delay the making of new plans.  The Minister understands and we understand the pressures all local authority members have been under.  They have been in the front line during Covid and have tried to bridge the gap between the executive and the local communities.</p> <p>I commend the Minister for the further powers he has given to local authority members.  He has given them in the Affordable Housing Bill the power to build affordable homes to purchase and rent.  He has proposed and passed the biggest housing budget, which gives money and funds directly to the local authorities.  He has empowered them to continue to support businesses in their communities with the waiving of commercial rates.  When it comes to housing, he has given democratic powers back to the local level in terms of reserving 50% of any new housing developments for social and affordable housing.  He has doubled the 20% social and affordable on any private development, giving powers to local authorities.</p> <p>The strategic housing development, SHD, process completely failed our local authority members in representing their communities.  The Minister is bringing that to an end and replacing it with a planning process that will give decision-making back to local authorities.</p> <p>It is fair for Senator Boyhan to ask what has changed.  A number of things have changed in the Land Development Agency and all for the better.  The one change in the real world is this: the housing crisis has got significantly worse and, in a small minority of important local authorities, certain councillors have sought to exploit the housing crisis for their political benefit.  They have voted against housing in Tallaght, Clondalkin and Malahide.  That is not acceptable in a housing crisis.  I accept and will defend the reserved functions of local authority members to my death but I cannot stand over the abuse of those powers.  Those powers are being used to delay solutions of our housing crisis and the provision of social and affordable housing.</p></speech>

I look forward to the Minister's response.  I believe he values our local authority members and is doing all he can to give them more powers.  It is an incremental process.  This is being limited to lands being zoned for housing between not being developed.  It will not apply to any other lands.  I see that as an improvement.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Senators are determined to increase local authority member powers but, in this instance, we must make the priority the provision of housing and we cannot stand by while some local authority members vote against and block the provision of housing by the State.  These are social and affordable homes that are desperately needed by our people.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that and notwithstanding that I am Senator from a Government party, there is a tradition in this House, when we have constructive criticism to make of a legislative provision, to ventilate that and share it with our fellow legislators.  Otherwise, the House would be bland.  It would be impossible to lump in all Senators from Government parties 100% on every issue.  I am proudly a member of a party that is in government and I believe in the work of this Government but that does not mean I do not have my own view on different issues.</p> <p>While my view is different to that of the Minister and Senator Fitzpatrick, I do not question their dedication or the value they place on the work of local government.  In this instance, I ask Government Senators to discount the maxim "Attack is the best form of defence".  I thank the Government for making moves to restore terms and conditions for councillors but the amendment proposed in the names of Senators Boyhan and Craughwell goes to the heart of an issue of local government, namely, the section 183 reserved power.  It is one of the last vestiges of power for county councillors.  Urban district councillors were abolished.  It and the power of rezoning are the two biggest powers left to country councillors.  As Senator Boyhan said, the report is drawn up by the CEO to advise councillors in the operation of their reserved function.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P. Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=VincentPMartin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Regrettably, as I have said in the House before, it does not automatically include a written independent expert valuation to assist councillors in the most momentous of tasks.  They are not selling their own land.  It is a much higher threshold since they are selling the people's land.  I have written to dozens of local authorities and they were at sixes and sevens.  My written inquiries date back some years.  There was no uniform approach to that.</p><p>I am trying to look at this positively.  I see a few small but important balancing checks.  They are small crumbs that I spotted in the legislation.  Despite taking the power of section 183 from the councillors in certain circumstances, which I disagree with, I understand that at least the Minister must be in the signing off position.  The Minister of the day, in the absence of taking that power away, plays an important role in that he or she must ultimately sign off and approve it.  Another safeguard has arrived in recent weeks which protects local public lands in Cork and Dublin where this Government has delivered 100% public housing on public lands.  I am a passionate believer in decision-making at the lowest effective level.  No one knows better than local councillors, who have valued experience.  Notwithstanding that, there is a safeguard for whatever is done in Cork and Dublin.  It was the manifestation of a long-held view of the Green Party.  It will hopefully be in the form of a cost-rental housing model.  That is the second safeguard.  It is open to councillors to rezone that land before it is wrestled away from their decision-making powers.  I am not advising that as a knee-jerk reaction but it is possible, if they fear that the land is going to be taken from them and they need more consideration and time, that they could put the land beyond the remit of this if it has a zoning designation other than residential.</p><p>At the end of the day, what has happened here?  I know the legislative intent behind this.  I know it is noble and that we are in a crisis.  This is an extreme reaction to a local authority, duly elected to represent the people, with which I cannot agree.  Perhaps Senator Fitzpatrick is right that some people are exploiting the issue but I do not believe that it should just be removed from the councils.  It is like a child in a playground not liking the way the match is going, so he runs away and goes home with the ball.  I am not sure if this is a proportionate response to unseemly disagreement in our local authorities.  People are possibly playing party politics with the fundamental right for people to put a roof over their head.</p><p>Even at this late stage, much thought and consideration has clearly gone into the wording of this amendment.  It has been tabled in the utmost good faith.  I have heard today that it has been tabled after much consultation with people in local authorities.  The people in local authorities are the heroes of the hour.  They are underpaid and overworked.  They are the heartbeat of local democracy and where it all begins.  Many of those people will feel put out, that we do not trust them and that if CEOs do not like how it is going, they can just dispose of the land on their own.  Section 183 was sacrosanct when I was an elected member of local government.  It would be unheard of for the CEO to ever say that he or she did not like it and to act on it alone.  It is the people's land and might have been in the parish for dozens of years, but it would be unheard of for the CEO to guillotine the debate and hand the land over to what is, in this instance, a well-intended agency, which I have significant hope, faith and confidence in.</p><p>The biggest role that I see for this Land Development Agency is probably with public lands which are in the ownership of the HSE, Defence Forces or different State agencies.  I know that every house is invaluable but the number of instances where this would cause a Minister concern that it is not moving fast enough fades into less significance and it is not worth watering down the power of a county councillor.  At face value, this is a diminution of the power of a county councillor.  County councillors do not have too many powers and they will take offence at this.  It is not on their own behalf since this is not an ego hit, but that they feel that their local communities, which they serve to the best of their abilities with their unique knowledge, have been bypassed because people do not like outcomes, results, debates and arguments.</p><p>I am happy to vote for this in its entirety and I urge everyone to do so.  I know people have strong feelings on section 183.  There is so much good in this.  I will proudly support it.  The Government has to get its business done.  Government Senators have a large majority in this Chamber.  As we approach the end of our first year, we should take on board more of the Opposition's constructive amendments and, in the good spirit of this Chamber, allow Government Senators to table amendments.  We are not going absent without leave or off-script.  When I address legislation, it would be bland if I agreed with everything.  I hope that in the next year, we will see more of this constructive debate.  How I vote is a different matter but the least that I owe the people and this Seanad as a legislator is to remain objective and to offer what I see as constructive criticism.  It is not a matter of kicking things around for the sake of it.  This is an example of where the diminution and dilution of section 183, although I except that it is in certain circumstances only, is unnecessary and a bridge too far.</p></speech>

It is a good reminder and comes at a crucial point.  It would anchor the purposes of the Bill and recognise the essential involvement and contribution of members of local authorities.  It is an appropriate place for this strong amendment.  The Minister will be aware that I tabled amendments on Committee Stage which I have not reintroduced because they have been pressed.  I would like a section of the Bill to be stronger and clearer about public, social and affordable housing being central rather than a subsection of housing, which is the language used throughout.  I knew we had limited time so I have not introduced more amendments to that section.  I will fully support Senator Boyhan's amendment and know that Senators Black, Flynn and Ruane are also supportive of it.</p> <p>We have a number of amendments of our own in the same grouping.  They all relate to section 183.  Amendment No. 23 effectively seeks to undo the impact of section 58 of the Bill.  It would mean that sections 183 and 211(2) of the Act of 2000 would still apply.  We have removed the word "not" and state that it shall apply, not that it shall not apply.  We insist that this is important.  It is perhaps more important in this area when we are looking at potentially large volumes of disposals of land over a short period.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Amendment No. 24, which I tabled, is a compromise amendment that, in my reasonableness, I had to produce.  It proposes that if that power is to be removed in any one instance, it should only be removed if a majority of the councillors in the area agree for section 183 not to apply.  They should have to agree to that in respect of any given land.  That is an extremely reasonable amendment.  I will be clear that my preference is to leave section 183 as it stands.</p><p>Reference was made to the reserved function.  It is a reserved function and what the Bill is doing is removing that function in particular circumstances which are, I am afraid to say, still very wide.  Unfortunately, they are not, as Senator Fitzpatrick stated, confined to circumstances in which the land is zoned residential and not being developed.  That is not what the Bill provides.  It refers to land that is zoned for solely residential use or a mix of residential and other uses in the development plan.  It does not state that it is land that nobody has agreed to develop.  There may well be plans, proposals or ideas coming forward through a local development or local area plan.  It is not just residential, but a mix of residential and other uses.  That is the land in the context of which section 183 is being waived.  Section 183 is incredibly important.  This is not to say that the vendor will not dispose of the land, it is that when the land is disposed of, it comes with covenants, conditions and agreements which reflect the understanding, wisdom, knowledge and local information of local councillors.  For example, where the land is a mixture of residential and other uses, there may well be conditions in respect of public amenities, such as whether there will be a playground, levels of accessibility, the connectivity of the site and how it is planned.  I still regard the reservation for social and affordable, to which we will come at a later stage, to be overly restrictive.  It may be the case that local authority members and councillors may have specific suggestions on how that breakdown between social and affordable or cost rental might most appropriately be reflected in their area.</p><p>When I encourage people to get involved in politics, I tell them not to be cynical, that they can do things and that politics matters.  I tell them that policy is ultimately just the decisions we make about how we want to live together.  Councillors and those who put themselves forward for the gruelling task of local election are not doing it for all the long meetings or the often-noted poor pay.  They are certainly not doing it for the pay, although it is good that the pay has improved.  They are doing it because they have something to bring to the decisions on how we want to live together.  They have something they wish to say because they care about their local place.  This is one of the key ways and reserved functions for local councillors to input their ideas and wisdom, to highlight something that is important and to remember a cohort that might otherwise be forgotten in terms of how we live together.  They may agree to dispose of the land but only with conditions, ideas and insights attached.  I do not believe the Government, the Minister, the Land Development Agency or anyone else should be afraid of having conditions attached to the disposal of land from local councillors because those conditions will be useful and more likely to lead to projects that are successful.</p><p>In the context of the strategic housing development project initiative not having succeeded, I and others warned of that possibility at the time but were told it was needed because there was a requirement to bypass local councils as they were the problem, which was why there was a need to skip the councils and go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That has not worked out very well, first because a majority of those that have received strategic housing development planning permission have not built.  That is not just as a result of Covid.  I was in the Seanad when the Bill relating to strategic housing development and fast-track planning was passed in 2016.  Such development has not started.  In the cases where An Bord Plean&aacute;la has granted planning permission, it did so without local knowledge and constantly came up against information it did not have because, to be generous, it is a national body and did not realise the kinds of conditions and factors that local authorities and local authority members can bring.  That is the kind of knowledge that makes projects work.</p><p>I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 2, tabled by Senator Boyhan, and to listen to local authority members around the country because they are rooted in their communities.  The Minister should not cut himself off from the roots.  I also ask him to accept my amendment No. 23 which would reverse the impact of section 58 and ensure that section 183 and those covenants, conditions and agreements and the right to have an input, give ideas and suggestions and attach them to disposal would continue.  If the Minister cannot do that, amendment No. 24 adds a third condition.  It provides that the conditions may not apply if the land is in a local authority area and is zoned for residential or a mix of residential and other uses and where a majority of local authority members agree to the suspension of section 183.   That is a reasonable caveat and condition to be attached.  That is the compromise amendment and I hope that if the Minister does not accept amendment No. 2 tabled by Senator Boyhan or my amendment No. 23, he will accept amendment No. 24 tabled by me, Senator Black and Senator Flynn.</p></speech>

Looking at the purpose of the Bill, we have to realise what we are about here.  For example, one of the stated purposes of the Bill is "to enable urgent measures to be taken to increase the supply of housing in the State and in particular affordable and social housing".  I hear every Senator remarking on that need almost every day.  The Bill aims "to ensure that public land which is not being utilised or is under-utilised is made available for housing in the State".  I could go on and on.  Housing is the biggest crisis in the State at the moment, along with Covid.</p> <p>I respect the right of every Member to give his or her opinion.  That is very important.  However, while I take on board the comments regarding section 183, of all the Ministers with whom the House has dealt through the years, the one thing the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, does not wish to do is to in any way dilute the role of local authority members.  I know from our action through the councils that we have weekly and fortnightly engagements.  In future, local authority members will have a greater role because of the recognition by the Minister of the important role they play.  Reference has been made to "in certain circumstances".  I know that concerns some councillors and I respect that.  I am sure the Minister is good at listening and will be able to answer for himself.  He is very keen to acknowledge the role of local authority members.   He is very strong in that regard.</p> <p>I refer to the Ballinasloe area of County Galway.  Senator Dolan will support me in this regard and will probably speak on it.  Ballinasloe is the second largest town in County Galway.   In 2016, its population was approximately 6,500 or 7,000.  The target growth in the new county development plan from 2022 onwards is for an extra 2,000 people, bringing the population to 8,500, which will still be fewer than 10,000.  Ballinasloe has a history of very environmentally damaging developments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I spoke to Councillor Evelyn Parsons about the issue.  She is a native of Ballinasloe and represents the people there.  The councillors wish to highlight the history of Ballinasloe in relation to the dump and the High Court ruling on the issue.  The High Court ruled in 1999 that the dump had to be closed. I think it was closed in 2005.  There were compensation issues.  It was a huge issue.  It did a lot of damage to the Ballinasloe area.  In recent times, and Senator Dolan will probably want to say more about it, there have been two attempts to put a transfer station there on a 70-acre site.  It is a vast area.  I can see why councillors there would like to retain their right to have some say in that situation.</p><p>All I ask today is that the Minister takes that on board.  I know he has already consulted with me on the issue and there will be further consultation.  However, it is a specific case.  It is that type of case that we need to be careful of.  Certainly, in respect of Ballinasloe, it is a critical issue.  Despite the fact that the court judgment said that there was to be no type of transfer station there, two applications have been made to Galway County Council to put a transfer site right in that area, one of which was turned down.  That is not acceptable.  I ask the Minister to take that on board.  I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

He was worn a path here.  I welcome also the LDA.  It is a big improvement on what we had before.  We can always talk about what we have done in the past, but it is good to stay in the present.  We need to move forward.  There is not one Member in the House, of all political parties and none, who does not want to solve the housing crisis.  I do not think anybody is motivated in any other way but to try to solve the issue.  It is something we are all unified on.</p> <p>The LDA will provide services, as directed by local authorities, in order to assist them in the performance of their functions relating to the development of sites for housing in urban development in population centres of more than 30,0000.  That will not impact the primary role of local authorities as housing authorities.  We should have a debate based on the facts.  The LDA will establish a register of relevant public lands.  To me, that is massive.  Finally, we will know all the land in every county that is owned by the State.  That has not been done properly in Ireland to date.  It is really important.  If we do not know where the land is, we cannot even start to begin to solve the housing crisis.  </p> <p>On the Green Party's win on this, it is important that all parties in government agreed with the proposal that went to Cabinet that 100% of housing built by the LDA on public land will be social and affordable.  That is huge.  It is a great success.  In other local authorities, it will be at least 70%.  Today is a good day.  It is a positive step forward in dealing with the housing crisis.  It is only the beginning of sorting it.  We have so much to do now in getting people to come to terms with the fact that there is a shortage of the tradesmen who we will need to build these houses.  There is a huge body of work to do to promote the work of tradesmen and to encourage young people to move into the trades so that we can get these houses built.  There are also 220,000 empty houses in the State that we need to look at getting back into use so that we can increase people's opportunities to have homes again.  The serviced sites that were promised in the town centre first policy, that we all agreed in the programme for Government, need to be delivered.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill.  I look forward to progressing it, rolling up my sleeves and getting the houses built that we need.</p></speech>

I was listening to the debate in my office.  It is the first time I have spoken on this legislation.  I know the Minister has come to the House a few times.  It is the first time I have spoken when the Minister has been in the House.  I wanted to come to the Chamber to say that I strongly support Senator Boyhan's amendment.  I am very concerned.  It is most important that we restore the power to local authorities.  They have a strong role in relation to section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001.  They have a huge say in relation to the disposal of land.  To address the housing crisis, we need strong local authorities that are best able to serve their local communities.  I have travelled the length and breadth of this country meeting with councillors.  As Senator Martin said, they are the heroes of their communities.  I have no doubt the Minister knows that himself.</p> <p>I have travelled with councillors who work until all hours in the night, going around houses, making sure people, including the elderly and lone parents are okay.  I met one councillor at Christmas time when it was really cold.  A young single mother with a child was going to be evicted due to having no finances.  The councillor I met blew me away.  She made sure that the mother got the money she needed.  She did a big fundraiser and made sure that the family had a good Christmas.  As the Minister knows well, it is a thankless job being a councillor.  To take the power away from councillors is wrong.  There should be no dilution of section 183.</p> <p>I ask the Minister and all Members here today to support this amendment.  It is a vital and important amendment.  If they are not going to support Senator Boyhan's amendment, I ask them to support our amendments.  That is all I ask.  This amendment is most important.  It is not something that I say lightly.  That is all I have to say.</p></speech>

I do not know what it is about the current state of Government that it seems almost paralysed by the legislation it brings before this House.  I am not speaking about the Minister personally, but the Government has rammed through legislation using the guillotine procedure.  It has a massive majority in this House and the Lower House.  It takes no cognisance whatsoever of anything any Member of the Opposition has to say at any time.  As Senator Martin said a few minutes ago, there is nothing wrong with listening to the Opposition.  There is nothing wrong with taking on board some decent amendments.</p> <p>This amendment seeks to protect the people at the bottom of the political spectrum, the county councillors who will be out on the hustings for Government party Members in two or three years' time, canvassing for them.  They are the people who will work hard for the Minister's party.  He is stripping them of power and he is doing it for cynical reasons.  I have known the Minister since I came into this House.  I have always held him personally in the highest of esteem.  I have always regarded him as a really good politician, but this is not good. </p> <p>Senator Martin is slightly wrong insofar as he said that he has to vote for the legislation because he is part of Government.  He does not.  He can vote for and support this amendment.  The only result will be that the Bill will be delayed for a short while when it goes back to the D&aacute;il.  That is all that will happen, at the end of the day.  It is just wrong, in every way, to be stripping away powers from local government.  I have seen it happen in every organisation, not just local government.  We have seen it happen with education and training boards over the years.  </p> <p>I am so frustrated that what will happen here today.  Those  who genuinely believe that this is a good amendment will vote it down because they are subject to a party whip.  It belies the value of the Seanad and what we are here for.  As Senator Boyhan said eloquently, we are here to polish up legislation and improve it.  Why is the Minister so afraid to accept this amendment?  It is a simple little amendment.  It should be taken on board.</p></speech>

The Minister would not bring this legislation to the House if there was not good reason for it, and we must take that into account.  There is nothing to prevent councillors providing and approving a housing scheme before the LDA even gets involved in it because the Minister has given members and administrations the tools to bring whatever housing proposals they have, and he will support them.  Put the onus back on the local authorities.  The Minister has given them the tools to build housing on the land, so let them get in ahead.  The LDA will not be needed if the administration and councillors act in advance.</p> <p>It is equally wrong to say the LDA will not understand the community need and the local need.  It is my understanding that it will have to go through the planning process like anyone else.  It will have to conform to local area plans and county development plans, with all the criteria in respect of schools, playgrounds and open spaces.  They are all included in the plans and it is up to a planning authority to make that decision based on them.  It is members who adopt local area plans and county development plans.  The Minister has probably given more powers back to local authority members than anybody else has.  Only recently, he gave power to local authority members to suspend the county development plan process in order that proper public consultation could take place.</p> <p>This is not the Minister's preferred option - it is not my preferred option - but at the end of the day, there is a reason it is included in the Bill.  We need to get housing built on key land.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#FF00600"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I refer to the submission received from the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, a representative group for councillors.  There are some proposals in it that I would be happy about, and I think I have mentioned them to the Minister.  Section 183 of the 2001 Act will remain.  The Minister has acknowledged that for any areas not zoned for housing, that section will remain in place.  Councillors will still have the right, under the county development plan, to outline areas for housing.  Therefore, councillors themselves will still have the right to designate what areas are for housing and what areas are not.  This is crucial.  It means the Minister has taken into account the role and the reserve function of councillors in every municipal district and county council in the country.</p><p>As someone who was elected a first-time councillor in May 2019, and as a native born and bred and Ballinasloe, I intimately know the importance of zoning in the area.  As someone whose family for generations has fought for Ballinasloe, whose father was on that 1999 High Court order, I know it intimately.  As someone who was on the court order of 2019, I know how important it is to fight to ensure that areas are zoned appropriately for the community and that they protect the community they serve.  This legislation, however, is about housing and the lack thereof.  According to <i>localauthorityfinances.com</i>, a website run by the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG ,Galway County Council is able to allocate only &euro;80 <i>per capita</i>.  There are 200,000 people in the second largest county, geographically speaking.  The national average <i>per capita</i>is &euro;400, while in Galway we have &euro;80 per head, with 200,000 people.  Many people have come to me, as someone who was elected councillor, regarding the lack of housing and the fact they cannot get anything to rent, and even I was somebody who was renting.</p><p>The Government is fighting for housing and using every tool in its armoury to ensure that housing is available for people who need it.  There is no way we are going to step back or be part of a group that does not vote to get housing across the line as soon as possible.  In every way, I will protect the rights of councillors and their reserve function.  Section 183 of the 2001 Act still protects councillors' rights in that way.</p><p>I have spoken about this previously.  Some elements of the AILG submission that I would like to mention again relate to supports to councils with urban centres of under 10,000 people.  In County Galway, there are more than 200,000 people.  What supports are going to be given for our urban centres, such as Tuam, with 8,000, or Ballinasloe, with 6,500?  What housing project teams will be offered to those local authorities to support them to deliver what we want them to do in the next year or two under the Housing for All strategy?  We need resources.  The AILG is a fantastic representative body and the Minister might enlighten us as to what engagement he has had with it to date.</p><p>I thank the Minister for his contribution.  We will speak again about zoning different areas, but the deadline for the county development plan for Galway County Council is 30 July.  Anyone who has any interest in the zoning of Ballinasloe, or in any other area of east Galway or County Galway, has until 30 July to make a submission.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently highlighted that the Bill - both Fine Gael's original version and now Fianna F&aacute;il's proposal with the support of Fine Gael - will remove power from local elected councillors in regard to land transfers, and that these flaws, among others, are why we cannot support it.  It will curtail the democratic oversight of elected members in regard to the disposal of land.</p> <p>We have one of the most centralised governments in Europe.  Whether in the context of water or waste, power has consistently been taken away from local authorities, with our council buildings and county halls having been hollowed out continually over decades.  The LDA will be unaccountable to local public representatives.  It can deal with council officials without the oversight of public representatives.  If we are republicans, which I suspect most Senators would say they are, we should stand for decisions that are made as closely as possible to people and communities.  In Ireland, what is good for Donegal is decided in Dublin, and what is good for Belfast is decided in London.  I am a republican because I believe in decisions being made as closely as possible to the people they will affect.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> As I said, we are one of the most centralised states in Europe.  Central government spends the highest proportion of total government spending of almost all EU countries.  I have just checked the figures and the most recent year I can find is unfortunately 2014.  In that year, local government spending as a proportion of total government spending was 9%.</p><p>I hate to break it to Senator Fitzpatrick, but Sinn F&eacute;in is not to blame for the failure of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to address the housing crisis.  Blaming the Opposition is a desperate attempt to deflect from the housing policy failures of this Government, and previous Governments, which have had ten years to deal with the housing crisis.  People see the Government parties are trying to deflect and shift the debate from their failures and our alternatives to fight over a series of council votes.  Local government is manager-centred.  We all know it; most of us have been there and experienced it at first hand.  Let us not insult people's intelligence by saying we believe in more power for local authorities but then pass a Bill to remove council powers in respect of land transfers.</p></speech>

It is true that this measure was not in the original Bill.  I sat on Waterford City and County Council for 11 years and always took that role exceptionally seriously, as does every councillor in the country.  It is also true that I have reservations about this section 183 change.  However, it is also true, as Senator Fitzpatrick referenced, that much has changed since the original Bill was passed, not least the housing crisis getting worse but also the fact, though Senator Warfield may want to wish it away, that his own party has objected to 6,000 houses in Dublin.  As recently as a couple of weeks ago, it opposed 18 public houses on public land in County Wicklow, something we hear the Opposition calling for day in, day out in this House, on the airwaves and in the D&aacute;il.  Much has changed and I have, therefore, an appreciation of where the Minister is coming from with the changes that have been made to the original Bill.</p> <p>A number of changes have been made in recent times to the original proposal, which would have seen the section 183 apply across the board to all lands rather than residential lands.  That has come as a result of engagement on behalf of my Fine Gael Party colleagues, by Senator Fitzpatrick, on behalf of her Fianna F&aacute;il Party colleagues, and by the Green Party, including at the Oireachtas housing committee.  The impact of the changes will be that section 183 will only apply to residential land, that is, land which councillors have already decided is suitable for residential development and land the council has decided it will not develop.  That should never happen in my view.  Councils should not own land zoned as residential which they are not progressing.  The Government is empowering and resourcing local authorities to build social and affordable houses on their own land.  In recent months, the Affordable Housing Act 2021 underwent about 40 hours of pre-legislative scrutiny and Seanad and D&aacute;il debate.  The Act will allow local authorities to build social and affordable houses on public land.  I would like the Minister's opinion on this but in my view this provision should not actually have to be used if councils take on the role of building housing on council lands they have already zoned.</p></speech>

It is important we do not present it in a way that is a wholesale stripping of the powers of local councillors.  The factual position is that in certain local authorities housing is not being built on lands zoned for housing as a result of decisions by certain councillors from a certain party.  As a Government and as legislators, we must ensure that, in the midst of a housing crisis, we use all tools at our disposal.  The Land Development Agency will have a role to play in that.</p> <p>One of the main concerns that councillors, particularly in the Dublin area, raised with me was that lands zoned for recreational purposes or open spaces could in some way have been disposed of to the LDA by a chief executive going over councillors' heads.  That cannot now happen.  This measure only applies to residential land.  That is a welcome move.</p> <p>My local authority in County Waterford has significant land which is used as a public, municipal golf course, Williamstown golf course.  The chief executive of Waterford City and County Council cannot decide in the morning to transfer that land to the LDA because the councillors have zoned the land for recreational rather than residential purposes.  That land is not zoned for residential purposes.  Councillors have full control of what land is zoned in the context of the development plan.  It is probably appropriate and timely that those development plans are actually happening at this time.  I therefore encourage any council and councillors to ensure the zoning is appropriate for the purposes they wish to see over the coming months, in the context of their development plan.  The Minister has facilitated the extension of the development plan process if councillors wish to extend it.  That was a welcome move which everyone in the House supported.</p></speech>

Why do we have local government?  It is vital to the functioning of this country.  Why do we have people elect local councillors?  Local councillors understand local wants and needs.  Why should the people bother to elect councillors to their local government if the national Government then passes laws which undermine their councillors' place in our democracy?</p> <p>A key reserve function of local councillors is outlined in section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001.  Land owned by the local authority cannot be disposed of but with the consent of its elected council members, who are elected by the local people and taxpayers who own land.  Now, under section 58 of the Land Development Agency Bill, the Government wants to waive section 183 of the 2001 Act and remove the key function of local councillors.  It wants to disempower councillors and locals as to the determination of the land.</p> <p>I stand with the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, which is just as abhorred by the idea of this as I am.  Primacy of county and city councils' development must be protected.  Local elected members are best placed to decide the future use and deployment of local land.  They have the most knowledge of local circumstances and are democratically appointed.  The Land Development Agency is none of these.  Section 58 disempowers councillors and thus disempowers locals as to the determination of the lands.  I strongly oppose this section.</p> <p>I spoke this morning about grassroots politics and I cannot believe-----</p></speech>

The Minister is very welcome to the House on this very important legislation.  At the outset, I compliment him on the vigour and determination in the way he has undertaken his role as Minister.  I know there is a determination within him to deliver as many sets of keys to as many people as he possibly can during his term.</p> <p>One thing we all or perhaps should have in common in this House is that we should do all in our power to deliver as many house to as many of our young people as quickly as possible.  That should be all of our main goal, aspiration and ambition.</p> <p>I acknowledge the changes the Minister has incorporated in this legislation.  The Minister met with the AILG under the stewardship of its president, Councillor Mary Hoade and I know for a fact he listened to its concerns.  Perhaps in his contribution later he will outline where he has included those concerns in this legislation.</p> <p>I speak as a former member of a local authority.  I proudly served on Monaghan County Council for a number of years.  The Minister might correct me if I am wrong but as we speak today, and will speak tomorrow, my understanding is that there is nothing to stop any local authority in this State putting forward proposals regarding housing development.  That is the first point we must make.  Unfortunately, whether we like it or not, there are many agendas out there.  There are many agendas in this House as there are in the Lower House.  Occasionally, those agendas come to the fore.  The key message we must hammer home is that this legislation refers only to residential lands.  It is important that this message goes out to every local authority in the country.  I know the motivation behind county councillors throughout the length and breadth of this country to deliver for the people in their localities.  I would suggest that very few councils will need the Land Development Agency coming in and acting the heavy on a local authority.  As we speak, the vast majority of those local authority members are looking at lands in public ownership and coming forward with plans to deliver much needed houses for the young people in their localities.  We cannot lose that point.</p> <p>It is important not to think that when we take a vote on this today, local authority members will have no say or control with regard to delivering houses for the young people of their localities.  That is simply not the case.  I am sure every local authority member would agree that if local authorities sit on their butts, which they do not, and do not deliver housing then that is not right either.  I am glad to say that is not the case in the vast majority of local authorities throughout the length and breadth of this country.  I know that will continue to be the case.</p> <p>I am all for local authority members and I am all for - never mind the diminution of powers from local authorities - adding to the powers of local authority members.  By this Bill and by different pieces of legislation introduced by this Minister, local authority members will have more power now than they ever had before with regard to delivering houses for their young people.  Not alone will they have the opportunity to deliver social housing but for the first time in many years, they will have the opportunity to deliver affordable housing to that cohort of people who are outside the local authority housing financial guidelines that would enable them to get housing in the first place.  Those people who are working hard five, six and seven days per week to provide for their families too will be looked after here.  It is important that we look after everyone with regard to this issue.</p> <p>I will not hold up the debate.  I understand that a review mechanism is contained within this legislation, however.  The Minister might outline what form that review takes and when will be the first opportunity to have a look at how this legislation is progressing.</p> <p>As I stand here, if I thought for one minute that in six, 12 or 18 months or two years' time that local authorities were being trampled on, I, for one, would not be shy in coming forward to table amendments to correct that.  I am sure many of my colleagues in this House would do likewise.  For now, however, young people are sick and tired of politicians talking about housing.  We have gotten to a point in this country where we must deliver housing.  The gentleman in front of me this afternoon and everyone in this House will be judged on how many sets of keys we can deliver to people over the next number of years.  That is only right.  I wish the Minister every success in his goal and determination to do just that.</p></speech>

Time and again, as we have heard this afternoon in this Chamber, we hear about the importance of the role of local authorities with regard to city and county development plans and all the other great work they do.  The reality for many of us who have sat on a local authority, however, is that very few powers are available to the councillors and elected members of local authorities.  Section 183 is one of those powers.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher made an important point when he said there is nothing to stop a local authority bringing forward a proposal with regard to housing.  That is absolutely true.  The key difference, however, is that they can be bringing forward all these proposals but may not have the power.  There are two sets of power here.  There is power in terms of accessing funding, which we know local authorities have great difficulty in doing in respect of housing, but there is also the issue of councillors on local authorities controlling their land.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is what this amendment is about and we support Senator Boyhan's amendment also.  </p><p>Senator Martin made an important point.

I thank Senator Boyhan for his amendment.  It is well-researched and he has put forward an argument.  He has gone through it and it is based on fact unlike a couple of the other contributions that supported his amendment.  I know from the Senator and from the work he has done and continues to do in the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage that he feels very strongly about housing delivery and is supportive, in broad terms, of the Bill.  </p> <p>I will say one thing at the start before I address the specific issues, in that a comment has been made erroneously that I have not accepted amendments to Bills here.  I have probably been in the Seanad more often in the past number of weeks than the Senator who made that charge.  He may not realise that I have taken on board a number of amendments, both Opposition amendments and indeed changes and amendments from Government Senators.  I have also done that in the D&aacute;il.  I do not want to be too precious about this but I want to set the record straight.  There are multiple changes in this Bill itself which are reflected by the work of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  </p> <p>The previous Bill, incidentally, in the last Oireachtas was only a general scheme, as has been said by Senator Casey.  This is a revised version of what we are doing, agreed by Government and brought forward to the Oireachtas in the interests of using State land productively for the provision of homes for people.  If people want to support that and if people believe that State lands which have been lying idle for years by State agencies - not council lands which I will address in a minute - should be used productively for the provision of affordable or social housing, they should vote for this Bill.  If they do not vote for this Bill, they do not believe that.</p> <p>In fairness, Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s D&aacute;il spokesperson on housing made a point, and he is entitled to that view, which is that his party does not believe that a Land Development Agency of the State should be involved in residential building and should not build any homes.  He went further than that where Sinn F&eacute;in also said that the Land Development Agency should not even plan for the building of homes.  I accept what Senator Warfield has said he is not supporting the Bill, which is fine.  The Land Development Agency then should not be involved in master planning or in any of that lending of its expertise to local authorities if the local authority requests it, as has happened in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown in Shanganagh where there is partnering on bigger sites.  To be fair, that is a political position that a party or an individual is entitled to have.  The fact then is that the main Opposition party only wants a Land Development Agency to just bring land together, have a look at it, put it on a register and farm it back out again.  We need greater thinking and action than that to deliver the thousands of homes that we need.  </p> <p>Parking even the Covid-19 pandemic for the moment, we need on average of a minimum of 33,000 homes a year.  This year we will probably deliver 20,000.  Last year it was just 20,000 because of the Covid-19 disruption.  Around half of those homes, to be fair to this Government and to the councillors across the country who supported housing schemes, were public and social homes.  Other parties will have to stand over their record of what they have really done at council level in the provision of housing.  </p> <p>On some of the points that have been raised, we are putting councils back at the centre of delivering homes.  I want them to be the main deliverer of not just social but, as Senators Casey, Cummins, Fitzpatrick, Dolan, Seery Kearney and all of my colleagues, together with Senators Gallagher, Murphy and McGahon in their contributions have stated, affordable and social homes.  Councils will be delivering both and rightly so.  We have given them the biggest budget in the history the State to empower them to deliver housing.  </p> <p>The Housing for All plan which the Government will bring forward in a matter of days will be a multi-annual plan for delivery.  One will see the targets in that for social and affordable housing delivery and, for the first time ever, for cost-rental delivery.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government, made up of three parties, has, within a year, delivered a new form of housing tenure that has been talked about for years.  I am saying that because any measures we take are taken not just for the sake of it but to give us a basis to improve on delivery.<br/><br/>I respect the points and concerns some Senators may have in thinking there may be a diminution of powers.  There absolutely will not.  Section 183 is not affected.  It stays.  My colleagues have explained the situation.  The section 183 exception would only apply <i>in extremis</i>where residentially zoned has not been developed.  That will only apply for the Land Development Agency, LDA.  Section 183 is not set aside for anything else.  As a part of this legislation, by the way, any State agency or State body will have to offer land it is selling to the LDA first, and rightly so.  Section 183 applies for all other non-residential lands.  The local authority members will make the decision, absolutely and rightly.  There may be an extreme situation, of which we have seen some rare examples, involving an obstructionist council.  That would be a case in which the section 183 exception would be triggered.  Let us be very clear on this.  Section 183 will only cease to apply where land has been zoned for housing and has not been used for that purpose.  In all other instances, it will apply.  There is no desire, in any way, shape or form, to supplant local authorities in the work they have to do.  I want the LDA to supplement local authorities in the delivery of homes.  It is as simple as that.<br/><br/>Within a matter of months, the LDA will break ground for the first time in Shanganagh Castle to deliver hundreds of homes.  That is being done in co-operation with the local authority to deliver, in particular, cost rental housing.  More of that building is going to happen.  I do not think we need to elevate things and imagine that a bogeyman will come in, rip asunder all the powers of local authorities and assume those powers.  Everything I have done will ensure that is not the case and will not be the case.<br/><br/>Let us remember, as Senator Casey said earlier, that the LDA will have to comply with the zoning of the land.  It will need to get planning permission on the land because it is not a planning authority.  The planning authorities remain the same.  If a portion of land in Fingal is sold to the LDA, it will have to go back to Fingal County Council for planning permission.  I want local authorities to bring forward schemes and more of them will be doing that.<br/><br/>A couple of questions were asked about delivery, especially in Galway.  The LDA will operate in population centres of 30,000 and above.  Some Senators may have been trying, in one respect, to raise concerns with councillors throughout the country that the LDA will affect every town and village in the country.  It will not.  Its application is clearly set down in the legislation, for those who have looked at it.  The Government has already decided to put housing delivery teams into each local authority.  I have made that announcement and told the chief executives.  We want to build up the resources within the local authorities.  Under section 15 of the LDA Bill, a local authority can direct the LDA to provide services and master planning expertise on urban design and development for large-scale sites.  That will only apply for centres in areas with a population of 30,000 or more.  Sites will predominantly remain in local authority ownership after development and I would see that happening in the vast majority of cases.<br/><br/>It is envisaged the majority of the LDA's work on local authority lands, as I said, will be done by co-operation.  I believe in local government and I always have.  I was a councillor.  We have exceptional councillors throughout the country who know their areas better than anyone.  At the end of the day, we need to make sure we are delivering more homes above and beyond the levels the local authorities will achieve.  The provisions of this Bill are proportionate.  I have made changes since its publication, having listened to both Opposition and Government Senators, and my own colleagues, to make sure it is even more refined.  The provision is proportionate.  It will be effective for the fact of it being in that space.<br/><br/>I understand the views some Senators, including Senator Martin and our Green Party colleagues, hold about the matter.  However, they want to see us deliver homes, including cost rental accommodation and affordable and social homes.  We all know of State-owned lands in our own counties, towns or cities that have been unused for decades.  That is not going to happen anymore.  That is why we need an agency to develop those lands.  We have tens of thousands of young and not-so-young people paying rents they cannot afford and trying to save for a home.  We need to use these lands to increase supply.<br/><br/>This Bill and the Affordable Housing Bill will run in tandem.  They are the two pillars to delivering affordable, social and cost rental homes at scale through our local authorities and the LDA.  I do not doubt anyone's bona fides at all, but if my colleagues want to deliver homes at scale, we need an agency such as this one to do it.  We need that agency to have teeth and powers.  I cannot accept the amendments that have been tabled but I thank the Senators for tabling them.  The debate has been useful.  There is no threat to the reserved function of councillors in any way, shape or form.  This is about housing delivery.  To be fair, as Senator Fitzpatrick and others mentioned earlier, I and the Ministers of State, Deputies Burke and Noonan, have seen significant movement on the programme for Government commitments around the powers of councillors since we came into office.  That is true not only of terms and conditions, which are important, and their remuneration, which we dealt with within a year, as we said we would, but also of provisions on planning.  They have additional powers with regard to development plans.<br/><br/>I have accepted one amendment from this House.  I am not sure if Senator Craughwell was present for the debate on the issue.  The original planning Bill required that 75% of members would have to agree to an extension to the development plan.  Senators asked me to look at that and reduce it to 50%, which I have done.  I was happy to do that in the D&aacute;il.  That is one of a number of examples.  I could give the Senator many more examples but I do not think there is any point.  Let us get on with the business at hand.  I thank Senator Boyhan and the co-sponsors of the amendment, Senators Hoey, Moynihan, Sherlock, Wall, Craughwell, Ruane, Black, Flynn and Higgins, for taking the time to table the amendments but I will not be accepting them.  I hope I have explained my rationale.<br/><br/>There is a review built in under section 9.  Any legislation is kept under review and I will do that in this case.  The Minister may at any time require an agency to provide a review that can be debated.  In the legislation, a review is tied in for 31 March 2024.  A formal report from the agency will have to come forward for review by that date.  At any stage that I feel, or any successor of mine feels, a progress report is required to be submitted to the Oireachtas, that can be done.  The relevant committee can also request a report.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for engaging with us.  I also thank the Senators who have engaged in this debate.  It has been a good debate.  People are passionate about housing but they are also passionate about local government.  As I said at the outset, the powers and functions of our elected councillors are important.  I am not going to dwell much longer on the issue because I have made the point.</p> <p>I acknowledge the work of Mr. John Coleman, chief executive of the LDA.  He is an amazing man and a good guy.  He has done a good job so far.  He has engaged with our committee and that is important.  I have always supported the LDA.  I am particularly delighted it will come to Shanganagh Castle in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  You can look at the statistics, figures and costs relating to the council's acquisition of that site from the Department of Justice.  Substantial money was involved, although that is another day's work.  It is for somebody else to look at the value for money that was achieved, considering the price for which the site was acquired by the local authority and all of the fallout from that.  That is not for today.  Today is about the fact we are going to get more houses.  Nobody in this House is against the building of houses in any shape, form or mix.</p> <p>I will touch on Oscar Traynor Road project.  I have engaged with some officials about that project.  The councillors had a right to stop the development on that site.  They secured a better deal that will include the provision of more homes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, we will not go into all that now.  That is for it the elected members of Dublin City Council who took those decisions legitimately.  It is about better local government and empowering our councillors.

We will have an opportunity to discuss that in subsequent legislation.  </p><p>I thank the staff in the Library and Research Service.  Based on its briefing, it is clear that the elected members will have some of the reserve functions removed.  The Bills Digest, Land Development Agency Bill 2021, No. 11 of 2021, prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, is an excellent document and sets out independently all the issues.  Before I leave this evening, I will send it to all the 990 councillors.  It casts an independent light on the matter.</p><p>I thank the Minister for his engagement.  I thank also the elected members for their engagement.  I am happy to put the amendment to the House for a vote and put on record where we stand.</p></speech>

My amendments concern the review and are intended to try to strengthen it.  This amendment asks that "Not later than 31 October 2022" a report be provided breaking down the numbers of social, cost rental and affordable houses in each local authority area.  We hear social and affordable housing being bundled together constantly.  There are, though, many different aspects contained within those categories.  I refer to social housing, which is public housing that stays as public housing and that is rented to those on the social housing list.  In addition, there is public cost rental.  That model describes housing which is rented at a reasonable and affordable rate - we will leave aside for the moment the issue of how affordability is determined - and where that property remains part of the public housing stock in the long term.  I refer to a situation where the cost to the State or a local authority of building that housing is recovered over a long time.  One could argue that is what all social housing is anyway, in essence.  It is a concept where rent is paid over a certain period of time according to what can be afforded.  Many social housing estates across the country have been paid for over time.</p> <p>Overall, then, categories of housing include social housing and public or approved housing body, AHB, cost-rental housing.  The overall goal though is to provide housing.  Another model then, is private cost rental for commercial equity returns.  This Bill also provides for that concept.  It is a different approach, because in that case we are dealing with a situation where profits are made each year through the equity return.  In addition, an asset that was originally built on public land will go to the private investment firm in the end.  We also have the category of affordable housing that is directly purchased by individuals and families.  While I have some concerns in this regard, because we have seen problems arise when we lose public land, at least that housing is going to individual householders.  Other Members have amendments seeking to secure and copperfasten that aspect.</p> <p>Therefore, there are many differences across this area of housing delivery.  My amendment would require that by October 2022 the agency would tell us exactly how many social and cost rental houses have been delivered.  It would also provide a breakdown of what kinds of cost-rental housing have been delivered, as well as a breakdown of affordable housing.  In addition, that report from the agency would detail where the costs are being incurred.  It will be important to have that information before October 2022.  I state that because, as I said before, we have a limited moment of opportunity now.  We have a window during which the European Union's fiscal rules have been suspended and where the State can spend money and support local authorities in building housing.  It was disingenuous for it to have been stated that this mechanism will only be used where local authorities will not build.  Many local authorities have wanted to build houses, but they have been denied those opportunities.  Instead, they have been told that they must lease houses.  That is a fact.</p> <p>This, then, is the window we have.  Probably from about 2023 or 2024, we will see hawkish narratives coming from Fine Gael Ministers, and it is there already in a European perspective, about the necessity of austerity returning and then the window for State funding will close.  The question then is what will we have achieved from this moment when we have zero interest zones and other incentives to act.  When we look back, what will we have used this window of opportunity for?  Will we have used it to build up housing stock for the State on public land?  Will we instead have used this time to channel this opportunity through private investment firms with different goals that will get the long-term dividend in 25 years?  This is the chance and the opportunity we have now.</p> <p>Those of us urging that this fiscal opportunity be made use of are also saying that it should be used wisely for the public good.  It should be used to ensure the long-term resilience of the State in the face of future shocks and market speculation, and that is what the recovery and resilience funding from the EU is intended for.  Previous market speculation has caused great damage to security of tenure and housing provision in this country.  It is for that reason that it matters how this window of opportunity is used right from the outset.  That is why my amendment requests that a breakdown be provided on housing delivery from October 2022.  I also suggest that general reporting in this regard should be provided within three years instead of five years.  We have talked a great deal about how the Government has allowed local authorities to delay their local development plans.  In doing so, that has also created a situation where some of those local authorities may well miss out on this window of fiscal opportunity when they do come to create their local development plans.  It will then be the Land Development Agency which steps in, because the local authorities may not have the new development plans in place in time to allow them to seize the fiscal opportunity and be supported with funding from the State.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is for each local authority to consider, but they should consider very carefully whether to delay their plans and for how long.  They should be at the table in accessing this fiscal space and in leading the ideas in regard to what comes forward.  That is the concern about the timing.  I have tabled other amendments, although I know we will not get to them, that sought to provide that it would be the latest development plan, that is, that which was published in the past three years or which has been delayed and is going to be published now.  The amendments would have provided that the LDA would have to work and engage with the latest thinking, given that many local authority members are aware of very different issues and big changes that have arisen in the past five years, and that is important.  Flood plains are an example.  It would be better if new and current local development plans did not just lead to the delivery of housing under this legislation but also influenced how we use this fiscal moment for investment in housing.</p><p>I will probably have time only to press amendment No. 3 and the Minister of State may wish to respond.  I regret that, yet again, the debate will be guillotined and we will not be able to speak to all the very good amendments tabled by me and others in respect of this area.</p></speech>

This will be the largest investment in the history of the State in terms of capital spend on housing and it is a significant move by the Minister and the Department.  I note the points about outgoing and new development plans and the fiscal opportunities.  Those opportunities for local authorities will still exist through their annual capital programmes and departmental funding, and that is important.</p> <p>The Senator raised significant points regarding the two amendments.  I will not accept the amendments but I will outline my reasons with regard to each of them.  Amendment No. 3 seeks to amend section 9 to provide that the LDA will also report on the delivery of housing by the LDA.  I do not consider this provision necessary, given that there will be a report under this section on the LDA's progress in achieving the purposes of the Bill and it will include details on housing delivery.</p> <p>Amendment No. 4 seeks to substitute the provision in section 9 such that the report the LDA will be required to submit to the Minister regarding the achievement of the purposes of the Act should be prepared every three years instead of every five, as currently provided for.</p> <p>I will oppose the amendments because the acquisition and development of land can take time, as the Senator will appreciate.  It is not appropriate for this report to be produced more frequently than every five years.  Section 9(2) provides that an LDA report, produced not later than 31 March 2024 and every five years thereafter, will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  In addition, under section 9, the Minister can require the LDA to report to him or her on the LDA's progress in achieving the purposes of the Bill.  The LDA will be required to report to the Minister on its progress periodically, with the first report due in 2024.</p> <p>Under section 48, the LDA is already required to furnish the Minister with an annual report by 30 June each year.  This annual report will be drafted in line with the provisions of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  As the provision of section 48 already requires the LDA to publish an annual report, the report furnished under section 9 is appropriately requested every five years.</p></speech>

I pushed for this urgency of reflection because although we will be using State land, once the land enters the LDA's stock it will no longer be State land.  Section 59 states that it will no longer be State land but land owned by the LDA, a commercial entity in which two Ministers are shareholders and they may dispose of those shares.  That is the concern.  By having a three-year plan, we will see what has happened up to that point.  Of course not everything will have been transferred but some land will have been.  It will inform local authorities and make it easier for them to engage constructively in the next phase-----</p></speech>

Since I was appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people last July, updating the fair deal legislation to enhance protections for family farms and business owners has been a priority for me.  I thank Senators for the opportunity to present the provisions of the Bill in the House today.</p> <p>The nursing homes support scheme, also known as the fair deal scheme, is a system of financial support for those requiring long-term nursing home care.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the rest.  The scheme has a gross budget of approximately &euro;1.4 billion in 2021 to support up to 22,500 people.</p><p>Although there is broad agreement that the fair deal scheme operates well, concerns have been raised about the impact of the annual financial contributions assessed under the scheme on the sustainability of family-owned farms or businesses.  This amendment seeks to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset.  The intention is to ensure that the viability of the family farm or business is protected when its income is relied upon as a principal livelihood and it is being handed down to the next generation.</p><p>I have also introduced an amendment to the Bill that effectively extends the existing three-year cap on contributions from a principal residence to the proceeds from the sale of that residence.  As well as introducing further fairness by treating the home and its proceeds in a similar way, in the context of the housing crisis it removes a disincentive to selling a vacant home when someone moves to long-term care.</p><p>Other amendments were introduced in the D&aacute;il to resolve technical issues with the Bill or to address concerns raised on Committee stage.  This is a long and technical Bill, which comes to 60 pages in total.  I will take the House through it section by section to clarify its provisions, including the amendments made on Report stage in the D&aacute;il last night.</p><p>Section 1 is a standard provision to clarify the principal Act to which the amendment applies.  Section 2 amends section 3 of the principal Act to provide definitions for certain key terms used.</p><p>Section 3 provides for the appointment of a family successor to a farm or business asset which the person in care, or his or her partner, owns or previously owned.  Section 4 provides for the creation of a charge against a farm or business asset.  This charge acts as security for relief advanced in case a recoupment has to take place.</p><p>Section 5 provides for the duties of the HSE when determining whether the three-year cap will apply in respect of farm or business assets.  Section 6 mandates the HSE to calculate the revised state support that will be payable following a determination that the three-year cap applies.  Section 7 provides for the review process for all appointed family successors.</p><p>Sections 8 to 10, inclusive, provide for certain circumstances that may occur with regard to the family successor, for example, if the family successor passes away before completing the six-year period during which he or she is required to work the asset.</p><p>Sections 11 and 12 provide for repayment events.  This may occur where the family successor does not comply with his or her obligations.</p><p>Sections 13 to 15, inclusive, provide for certain situations that may arise in the case of a second partner entering care.</p><p>Section 16 makes it an offence for any relevant person to knowingly or recklessly give the HSE information that is false or misleading.  Section 17 amends section 21 of the principal Act to extend the powers of a care representative if a person in care does not have full capacity to make decisions regarding an application to the scheme.  Section 18 amends section 24 of the principal Act to require the appointed family successor to provide written notice of any material change in circumstances of the person in care to the HSE.</p><p>Section 19 mandates the person in care, his or her partner and the family successor to inform the HSE of any material change in circumstances of any family successor.  Section 20 amends section 27 of the principal Act to allow the HSE to request that the assets of an estate are retained to repay any moneys owed as a result of a repayment event.  Section 21 sets out the administrative process relating to the discharge or release of the charge made against an asset.  Section 22 refers to a charge or charges to be made under section 14B against farm or business assets which are under joint ownership.</p><p>Section 23 amends section 32 of the principal Act to extend the circumstances under which appeals against certain decisions of the HSE can be made.  Section 24 allows the Minister, by regulation, in respect of any difficulty which arises during the period of three years from the commencement of the Act to take any necessary action to bring the amendments to the principal Act into operation.  Section 25 expands the HSE's duties with regard to the storage, retention and disposal of applications and notifications made under this Bill.</p><p>Section 26 requires the HSE to produce an annual report for the Minister for Health detailing the effects of the new provisions of the scheme.  Section 27 provides for the Minister to carry out a review of the operation of the amendments to the principal Act not later than five years after the Act comes into operation.  Section 28 amends section 47 of the principal Act to clarify that, in the context of the key provisions under this Bill, only a care representative can officially act on behalf of a person in care.  Section 29 creates a right for any person, when attending an interview under the scheme, to be accompanied by another person over 18 years of age.  This reflects the concerns of Deputies raised on Committee Stage.</p><p>Section 30 provides for the proceeds of sale deductible amount, as set out in section 31, to be accounted for in determining a person's contributions to care.  Section 31 amends Schedule 1 to the principal Act to repeal the availability of the three-year cap on productive assets as a result of sudden illness or disability.  This section introduces additional provisions that allow for the three-year cap to apply to farm and business assets following a positive determination under this Bill.  This section also extends the three-year cap on the principal residence to the proceeds of its sale.  Section 32 provides for transitional arrangements and amends certain paragraphs in Part 3 of Schedule 1 to the principal Act.  Section 33 is a standard provision dealing with the Short Title and commencement arrangements.  It also provides that the Act will come into operation 90 days after enactment, a measure which I agreed with D&aacute;il colleagues.</p><p>I thank Senators for considering this Bill.  I understand that it is complex with several highly technical provisions.  I hope I have set these out with sufficient clarity and I look forward to hearing the contributions.</p></speech>

She has done so in a comprehensive manner and I thank her for that.  I pay tribute to her because I know how committed she is to this issue.  She has brought this Bill, which should be wrapped up shortly, to the House a little over one year after coming to office and this is to be commended.  It shows a great focus and commitment to the issue and a commitment to the job.  It is remarkable that she has brought forward this Bill and we commend her on her work, especially given the unprecedented year we have had in the Department of Health.  All her colleagues and officials in the Department are to be commended.</p> <p>This overhaul of the fair deal scheme has been long awaited.  It is delivering upon a commitment in the programme for Government and it shows that the Minister of State and the Government mean business.</p> <p>The pandemic has brought the issue of care into sharp focus.  We will need a radical overhaul of the care system, especially in respect of care for our youngest, vulnerable people and older people in society as well as in respect of how we pay for that care and how we pay the people who deliver that care.  These are all important issues and I am sure the Minister of State will address them during her tenure.</p> <p>I am happy to see the measures aimed at protecting the family farm.  This is an important measure for rural Ireland and for the communities that make up rural Ireland.  It is also important for those of us who live in urban Ireland because the viability of the rural agricultural sector benefits all of us.  These days we are all talking about sustainability and food security.  It is vital that the farms in rural Ireland, which make a significant contribution to the economy and the well-being of our rural communities, remain intact.  We must allow them to be passed down to other generations to care for these lands.  I know plenty of farmers and farming families who say they are merely custodians of the land.  They are there to protect it for future generations and to work it and deliver for their communities.  That is what this Bill does.</p> <p>I am happy to see the disincentive relating to vacant homes being removed.  When people have gone into nursing care there has been a disincentive in respect of a vacant home and this has been removed.  When knocking on doors throughout north County Dublin, I often come across vacant homes.  We hear that so-and-so is in a nursing home and that is why a certain house is vacant.  When we go back to the same area over the course of a couple of years we see the same houses lying vacant.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am sure this will have a significant impact on the available housing stock in Ireland.  I wish the Minister of State the very best of luck with this Bill for the duration of its time in the Seanad.  We in the Fianna F&aacute;il group in the Seanad will certainly be giving it great support.  I hope that we will get cross-party support in both Houses because this is progressive legislation from a progressive Minister of State.</p></speech>

Every time she comes here, she engages with us fully.  Over the last 12 months, I have been most impressed with her openness, her dedication to her role in the Government and the progress she has made.  It has not been easy.  The last 12 months have seen the worst pandemic in living memory and yet upgraded legislation on the fair deal scheme comes before us today.  The fair deal scheme has been a great success in giving people the opportunity to get nursing home care and, while they must make a financial contribution, that contribution is in no way punitive.  The scheme has been designed in such a way that it provides access to proper care for older people.  The upgraded fair deal legislation that is before us today represents a natural progression in improving this scheme, which has run successfully for a number of years.  I commend the Minister of State for bringing this legislation before us.</p> <p>We have a long way to go in terms of providing the standard of care we all want for our older family members and which we will want for ourselves when we get old.  There is significant work to be done.  There will be a significant increase in the number of older people in our society.  We should be thankful that we will be living longer lives.  The age to which people can expect to live has increased dramatically.  Someone aged 80 is not old now whereas, a number of years ago, 80 was considered a significant age.  People now have a legitimate expectation to live to 90 or beyond.  That means that the State has a responsibility to provide high-quality care for people reaching the twilight of their lives.  </p> <p>We all want to see older people looked after in the best possible way our society and our communities can provide.  The most ideal way in which to look after old people is in their own homes.  Unfortunately, that may not be possible when people reach a certain age and, unfortunately, they may have to get care.  The State provides significant support through local authorities, such as housing aid for older people and housing adaptation grants.  We would all like to see more money provided for those schemes because they upgrade homes to allow people to continue living in them by, for example, making bathrooms and bedrooms accessible.  That is what we want to see.  However, when people can no longer live at home, the fair deal scheme can kick in.  The few unintended consequences of the scheme are largely addressed in this legislation, which is very welcome.  We all know that old people can suffer from anxiety, worry and stress when they reach a stage at which they require residential nursing home support.  It is incumbent on us to streamline the system, to make it easy to understand and to give older people reassurance that the scheme will not destroy an asset that has been built up over a lifetime.  This legislation goes a long way towards addressing that.</p> <p>As time goes on, as the Minister of State evolves into her brief, as the population of older people in the country continues to increase and as the commitment of the Minister of State and her Department continues, it is possible that she will be back in the Seanad with further upgrades to the legislation.  It is an evolving process and there will be further amendments and further legislation in this area.  That is welcome because, as we go forward, we are going to have to continuously upgrade and invest in services for older people.  I wish the Minister of State every success in the work she is doing.  The last 12 months have seen major steps forward with regard to supports for older people.  I have no doubt that will continue.</p></speech>

I thank the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I welcome this Bill and its introduction of a three-year cap on the assessment of transferred assets to protect the viability of family farms and businesses.  I also welcome the fact that a successor will be appointed to assets and that rigorous safeguards will be put in place to ensure this is done for the purposes of running a family farm or business.  Section 5 sets out how the HSE will determine eligibility for the cap to apply.  This only happens after someone has been in care for three years, which may put in doubt some of the certainty which is being looked for and which would allow people to plan ahead.  Section 14 allows for a care representative to make decisions in the event of the incapacity of the person in care.  However, it is important this is overseen appropriately and carefully to ensure there is no abuse of these powers.</p> <p>We welcome the amendments the Minister of State brought forward in the D&aacute;il, especially the ones that arose out of concerns some Members had with regard to dealing with second partners and issues around family successors.  The Minister of State spoke about the provisions in the amendments that will allow the Minister to make regulations in the future and my colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Cullinane, outlined his concerns and the importance of giving us more detail on the type of regulations that can be brought in by the Minister in that regard.  We accept these amendments are being tabled in good faith.  However, on a more general point, when we are being asked to support amendments that will give powers to the Minister to make regulations, it is important that we are given a better and clearer sense of what those regulations might be.</p> <p>I will take this opportunity to address the wider issue of nursing home neglect and deaths during the pandemic.  Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a motion on this topic in the D&aacute;il this week.  It is a scandal that needs a full public inquiry.  This is a crucial issue which has devastated many families.  At the very beginning of the pandemic, fatal flaws were exposed in our health and social care services.  We must take the necessary steps now to identify these problems and ensure they do not arise again.  I commend the many nursing home staff who worked so hard under considerable pressure and stress during the pandemic to do their best to look after those in their care.  However, it is clear the sector as a whole was unable to cope effectively due to chronic understaffing, weak governance arrangements, poor safeguarding provision and a lack of investment.  Many nursing homes were unprepared for any infectious disease outbreak and, as we know, the consequences were devastating for the families who together have lost more than 2,000 relatives in these institutions alone. </p> <p>One important change we feel is needed is that an independent safeguarding authority must be established within an appropriate State agency.  Adult safeguarding legislation must also be expedited.  Mandatory reporting of suspected neglect or abuse must be the norm across the sector and workers who come forward should be supported and protected.  Accountability at an organisational level, with appropriate penalties including criminal sanctions, must be put in place where a failure to govern safely results in harm or death for residents.  Along with a public inquiry, this is the only way to deliver truth and justice for relatives and friends of those who have died or who have been neglected by care homes during the pandemic. </p> <p>Families and social workers need to be at the centre of this reform.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to standing with families and supporting their calls for truth.  Residents of nursing homes deserve to get the best possible care and to know they are safe.  The mistakes of the pandemic must be learned from to ensure that they are not repeated.  We must deliver a high-standard and fully public model of care for older people.  The statutory home care scheme needs to be expedited.  It was reported at the end of last year that the scheme had been pushed to 2022 because the IT system and a new assessment process had yet to be developed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Once again, IT systems are a problem.  It is not a result of cybersecurity in this instance but of the fact, which we have seen throughout the pandemic, that our health system does not have a modern IT infrastructure.  This impacts on the State's ability to respond to new systems, policies and processes when needs be.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill, insofar as it goes.  The three-year cap on assessments of transferred assets to protect the viability of family farms and businesses is welcome.  I commend the Minister of State on introducing the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1684" speakername="Mark Wall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#VV00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Labour Party will support the Bill.  I am sure like many Members, not a week goes by when I do not deal with families and their applications for the nursing home support scheme.  These meetings are often difficult as the families have done so much to keep their loved ones at home but, given the medical need of their father, mother, brother or sister, they are left with no option but to avail of the scheme.  The need to help with the scheme has extended to relatives and friends.  These are difficult times and decisions for all families but, thankfully, there is a scheme, which I hope we will see extended today.</p> <p>It might not generate headlines in the same way as other, more emotive topics that we deal with, but passing this Bill will have a massive impact on the lives of families across the country.  It is important we get it right, particularly because we know the demographic reality coming down the line.  According to EUROSTAT, Ireland has one of the lowest proportions of people over 65 in the European Union, at 14.4% compared to an EU average of 20%.  It is as high as 23% in Italy.  However, we all know and it has been flagged by NGOs working in the area that we will not be immune to the pressures of an ageing population in the near future, as the Central Statistics Office, CSO, estimates that the number of over-65s in Ireland will rise by more than two and a half times to 1.6 million people by 2051.  Given the huge rise in numbers who will need residential care and may not otherwise be able to afford it, it is important we act now.  We need only look at Britain and the endless frustrations that campaigners in that country have come up against in trying to reform social care to see the dangers of getting it wrong.  Ireland can be proud of instituting the fair deal when it did.</p> <p>This Bill will have many benefits for farming families, in particular, and we as a party welcome those changes.  We know many farmers are not far from poverty.  They usually have low debt but, unfortunately, with low incomes.  In this context, the costs of nursing home care can be onerous and this is filling families with fear and apprehension.  According to Teagasc&rsquo;s 2019 national farm survey, released last December, the average age of Irish farm holders is over 55 years and this rises almost to 60 years among cattle and other farmers.  Given how close to retirement so many farmers are, this Bill will be of great importance to a large number of farming families.  Some 23% of full-time farms have farm family income below &euro;20,000.</p> <p>We must remind ourselves of the damage caused by institutional approaches to care in this country.  We saw it with mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries and industrial schools; we see it today with direct provision.  If we can implement policy that allows older people to live independently with the dignity they deserve for as long as possible, we should always take that chance.  Nevertheless, we need to provide just, equitable and affordable access to nursing home care to all who need it.  There is a time in everyone&rsquo;s life when it becomes the best option but just as important, in providing a system that allows older people to live independently and with dignity for as long as possible we must look at other forms of independent living.</p> <p>While speaking on independent living, I will take the opportunity to raise the need for reform of the housing adaption and housing aid grants administered by the local authorities.  I and Labour Party colleagues have raised this with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, who informs me that there is a review under way but we need this to happen urgently.  I bring this up because I am continually coming across cases where families cannot afford the rising building costs of adapting their house for their loved one, given the level of grant funding available.  I find myself chasing down community welfare officers to try to obtain the balance.  In one case, the cheapest quote was &euro;30,000 above that offered by the grant.  If we do not reform those grants, we will see a lot more applications for the scheme we are discussing here this evening.  </p> <p>Yesterday saw the launch of the healthy age friendly homes programme under Sl&aacute;intecare.  It aims to provide 4,500 homes for older people to live independently with the appropriate supports as an alternative to nursing home or hospital care.  We need to move faster with the roll-out of this kind of model, which can allow so many to continue living in their communities without families searching for the nearest nursing home or hospital in order that they may remain close.</p> <p>We should bear in mind our climate commitments as they pertain to agriculture.  We should emphasise a model of small-scale, sustainable farm holdings, rather than allowing our agriculture to be swamped by unsustainable practices and corporate agribusiness.  In order to allow family farms to remain in the family, we should support farming families more and not force them to be driven down by the costs of care.  </p> <p>The Labour Party welcomes the changes, thanks the Minister of State for her work on the Bill and looks forward to supporting it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1632" speakername="Frances Black" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#VV00300"><p>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  It is great to see her.  She is doing a great job in her role.  I thank her for her recent support in helping with a young woman who had an eating disorder.  The family is grateful to the Minister of State for her intervention.</p> <p>I support this Bill's aim to address a long-standing issue affecting business owners and farming families under the fair deal scheme.  It is an issue that has been long recognised as needing to be addressed.  However, I have some concerns.  We have this legislation on the fair deal scheme but there are a number of pressing issues related to nursing homes that it fails to address.  There are many broader issues it ignores and we need to look at those issues, including the issue of adult safeguarding.  Before I delve into the importance of tackling the urgent human rights violations that occur all over our country at every hour of every day, I will mention a number of issues I have with this Bill specifically. </p> <p>The Bill fails to tackle the over-reliance on private nursing home care and the tendency to see nursing home care as an investment opportunity and a business, rather than a critical element of the social care system in the country.  The over-reliance on the private sector has clearly failed adults at risk in more ways than one.  It has led to a situation where nursing homes are largely unregulated and nursing home care has been seen as an opportunity for profit and investment.</p> <p>The Bill fails to make any attempt to reorientate the social care system towards the community.  We agreed through Sl&aacute;intecare to orient people away from institutional care to services in their community.  This is a noteworthy absence. </p> <p>We have learned many vital lessons during the pandemic.  One is that concentrated care of our older people is far from ideal.  The reality is not good.  The number of deaths is deplorable.  By May 2020, nearly 1,000 nursing home residents had passed away from Covid-19, accounting for more than half of all virus-related deaths at the time.  When the third wave of Covid-19 peaked in Ireland in January, outbreaks claimed the lives of over 2,000 people in nursing homes.  That is more than two thirds of all deaths in nursing homes linked to outbreaks of Covid.</p> <p>Adults across Ireland are being abused or neglected or both every day.  In 2019 alone, the HSE safeguarding and protection teams received more than 12,000 allegations of abuse and neglect.  The vast majority of these allegations related to abuse, be it physical, psychological or financial, at 40%, 33% 10%, respectively.  The stories are many and all too familiar.  They include the harrowing Grace case, concerning a woman with an intellectual disability who was left in a foster home for 20 years despite allegations that she was being sexually abused.  Social workers, civil society organisations and academics all agree that legislation is urgently needed to address the gaps in our safeguarding framework and ensure that such tragic events are never repeated.  More can and should be done as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>The "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme, which aired two weeks ago revealed some shocking evidence of neglect and ill treatment in nursing homes. They spoke to a whistleblower who was sent into Cahercalla nursing home as replacement staff.  We heard heartbreaking stories of awful, horrendous neglect.  It is inhuman and deeply concerning.  We cannot stand back as it continues to occur.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Since then, I have progressed my new Adult Safeguarding Bill, which will build on the incredible work and research that Senator Colette Kelleher carried out with dedication during her time in the Seanad.  I will bring forward this new Bill with the Civil Engagement Group in the next few months.  The Bill will aim to provide for robust and effective measures to prevent abuse and neglect, to support people to protect themselves when harm occurs and to put human rights at the core of our safeguarding framework.  Throughout this process, I will listen carefully to the views and unique perspectives of individuals with lived experiences, and their families, front-line social workers and civil society.  </p><p>I have been in consultation with members of many non-governmental organisations, NGOs, social workers, academics and experts who said that the RT&Eacute; documentary barely scratched the surface of the inhumane treatment of some of the adults at risk in care settings in Ireland, which extends beyond nursing home settings.  There are no two ways about it, this is an urgent human rights matter that needs the involvement of everyone in every part of society.  The whole of society and the whole of government must come together on this issue to be the voice of the voiceless.  </p><p>I hope the Minister of State will support this legislation.  I apologise that I have to leave the Chamber.  I cannot stay as I have another commitment to the RISE Foundation.  As I am sure the Minister of State is aware, I facilitate some group work for families whose loved ones are in addiction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#WW00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State.  It is a very proud day.  I am proud of her so I hope she is proud of herself.  This legislation has been worked on for more than five years but she was the woman to get it over the line with great help from her civil servants, some of whom are in the Chamber.  It is a great day for rural Ireland too.  We often get accused, as a Government, of being very Dublin-centric, which is obviously not the case.  When the Minister of State got into the House, this legislation was a priority for her from day one.  It is always important to celebrate wins because there are so many negative stories, problems and issues in Irish society, especially since the Covid pandemic.  It is very important that we acknowledge and celebrate wins when we get them.  To put it simply, this legislation is an amendment to the fair deal scheme but it really helps the family farm, which is very important.  The scheme will enhance and protect family farms and small businesses.  The proposed amendments to the scheme extend the principle of the three-year cap to contributions based on family owned and family operated farms and businesses.  I thank the Minister of State for that.</p> <p>The lack of appropriate home care help for elderly people is another issue.  This is the beginning of the Minister of State solving all the problems and she has a lot of work ahead of her.  Home care help is the issue I have got most phone calls about since I became a Senator.  So many old people have rung me who wanted home help in their houses but could not get it because they were not eligible or could not afford to go into a home care centre they felt comfortable with.  Older people have many fears about going into home care centres.  We have a lot of work to do on this issue.  </p> <p>Originally, back in the day, older people were seen as our elders and the wise people of our communities.  They were the centre of communities and everything revolved around them.  They passed on their wisdom to us because with age comes wisdom.  We listened to our elders and that is how communities and societies then decided what was best.  Unfortunately, we have moved away from elders being the centre of society.  However, this is a very good day for elderly people living on the family farm in rural Ireland.  We need a proper assessment of the housing needs of older people in Ireland.  It is probably the next matter we will have to look at because older people do not always put their hands up to say they have a problem with where they live and that they need to move into a home, village or town because they are too rurally isolated.  </p> <p>One major thing I have learned in the past year is that if an older person does not have any medical ailments, as such, it is very hard to get home help.  Many old people have rung me purely out of loneliness.  They just wanted someone to come to visit them.  Families are getting smaller and the days when one had a cluster of siblings all around the place are gone.  There were seven children in my family and I have one son.  That is a big difference in one generation.  That is the way we are going now, so who will take care of old people when siblings are not there?  As a society, people are busier and do not have time to mind old people so everything has changed.</p> <p>I now realise that if one wants home help on mental health grounds, it seems one has to have a major mental health issue before it will be given.  Prevention is better than cure and if people ring me who just want home help, even for an hour twice a week because they are devastatingly lonely, I need to be able to say, "I can do this for you, you deserve this, you have lived on the planet eight decades, you have given a whole life to this planet and it is time to give back to you."  I have listed major challenges the Minister of State has but, overall, this is a very positive day and a very good day for farming families.  I thank her profoundly for that. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#WW00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and this legislation.  The Minister of State will recall that Senator Chambers and I brought a Commencement matter to the Seanad in April regarding this much-needed legislation on the fair deal scheme.  At that point, she made a very firm commitment to honouring farming families and I sincerely thank her for that.  This update of the fair deal legislation to enhance protections for farmers and business owners has been a priority for her since she took office just over 12 months ago.  I sincerely hope that this Bill receives cross-party support so that these hugely important changes can be delivered without delay.</p> <p>The increase in home care hours and supports that encourage older people to live at home as opposed to going into nursing homes is most welcome.  Again, that is something on which the Minister of State has worked very hard and is fully committed to.  Nursing home care, however, is crucial for many older people and their families.  The peace of mind in knowing that their loved one is being take care of and is receiving the help and care they need is a huge weight off many families' shoulders.  It is vitally important that the State supports that in cases where it is needed.</p> <p>One would think because of the name that the fair deal scheme is fair but, currently, it is not.  It is not fair to small business owners and farming families who currently risk losing a family farm or their small family business should a loved one need to access the scheme.  The current 7% annual levy is a major disincentive to these families and is preventing those who may need nursing home care from accessing it.  This is why it is so crucial that we have the changes the Minister of State is putting forward in this Bill.  The change to the scheme proposed by the Minister of State, which is to cap financial contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the asset, is a massive step in the right direction.  This will provide a huge sense of relief for many farming families and business owners.</p> <p>We all want to see our loved ones receiving the highest quality of care that they can.  We want to see them enjoying the highest quality of life possible for as long as possible.  This Bill absolutely supports that.  Nursing homes are not the right setting for everyone.  Many people want to stay in their own homes for as long as they can and if they are physically and mentally capable of doing so we should support them in that.  However, when, or if, the time comes that people require nursing home care, they need to be able to access care quickly and in a cost-effective manner.  This Bill will allow many people to do that.  </p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il warmly welcomes this Bill for which there was a firm commitment in our manifesto.  When the Minister of State spoke as an Opposition Deputy she was a very strong advocate of bringing this legislation forward so it is really terrific to see her acting on it once she was in a position to do so.  Not alone is this change important for those who need to access nursing home care, it is essential to the viability and sustainability of family farms as it allows them to be passed down to the next generation.  Again, it ensures that the fair deal scheme is fairer, more accessible and more affordable.  This is a very emotive issue for farm families in communities throughout the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I want to raise two other issues.  I thank the Minister of State for the work she has been doing with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  It is great to see day care centres starting to reopen, but it is very difficult for the centres dealing specifically with patients with Alzheimer's disease to do so.  Could a fund be put in place to accommodate them?  I appreciate that only a certain percentage of facilities are dedicated purely to the care of people with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Nevertheless, a fund needs to be established to ensure they can reopen as quickly as possible.</p><p>The housing adaptation grant scheme needs to be streamlined and made reflective of current building costs.  There must be an effort to reduce the large amount of red tape for people who need to access the grants to stay in their homes.</p></speech>

I join other speakers in welcoming the progress of this legislation.  There has been campaigning for these provisions for a number of years.  The Minister of State ran with the issue and has delivered on it inside a year.  That is what a good politician does.</p> <p>I have a number of questions on the provisions contained in the Bill.  Assuming the legislation is passed in the Seanad by tomorrow and goes on to receive the presidential signature, on what date is it expected to be enacted?  For somebody who is already in a nursing home and who appoints a successor, will the time that person has spent in care be taken into account?  For example, if a person in that situation has been in a nursing home for two years, will that time count in the calculations?  I am conscious there are particular criteria around eligibility and there is a plan for a five-year review.  It may be the case that when the scheme is up and running, issues will arise.  Is there the possibility of having a review sooner than in five years' time?</p> <p>It is important we have a debate at some stage on the broader question of care for elderly people.  Our elderly care model needs to support more opportunities for people to be able to live independently.  The discussion needs to go beyond the traditional nursing home model to look at ways in which older people can live within the community.  We also must accept we are an ageing society and we need to adapt everything we do because of that.  The facilities and resources must be in place to accommodate that.  A statistic that struck me in recent times was that one in five teenagers today will live to the age of 100 and one in three babies born this year will live to that age.  We must start thinking about a society in which people are living for much longer and in which more people are elderly.</p> <p>These are big challenges but I have no doubt, given what the Minister of State has been able to achieve in a year, not just in regard to older people but also in the area of mental health, that she will be able to achieve much more over the next four years.  I hope she will be able to address some of the major issues to which I referred.  I strongly support the legislation and join other speakers in commending the Minister of State and thanking her for her work.</p></speech>

I welcome the proposed changes to the nursing homes support scheme, which are long overdue.  I am delighted the Bill is being brought through the Houses prior to the recess.  It is in line with a commitment we made in the programme for Government and a commitment I gave personally to local representatives of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, in Longford when we met with them.  I am pleased the Bill will be on the Statute Book before long.</p> <p>For too many years, numerous family farms and businesses had to be sold to fund nursing home care for family members.  I welcome these changes to the treatment of farm and business assets in the financial assessment of the means of applicants for the nursing homes support scheme, which will extend the availability of the three-year cap to relevant family-owned and family-operated farm or business assets where a family successor commits to working on the farm or in the business within the first three years of the applicant's time in care.  This will safeguard the viability and sustainability of these farms and businesses, notwithstanding that, according to the IFA, only 34% of farms provide a viable income.  The family farm or small business is transferred from one generation to another as a means to provide an income return on the hard work involved.  It is not a nine-to-five job but seven days a week and 365 days a year.  Inheriting the family farm does not amount to a huge cash windfall as some people might think.  It is about providing for one's family and then passing on the farm to the next generation.</p> <p>The nursing homes support scheme represents an annual investment of &euro;1.4 billion by the State in the care of more than 22,000 people.  Senator Byrne gave figures regarding our ageing population.  We will have significant numbers of elderly people who need to be cared for in the years ahead, at a significant cost to the State.  I pay tribute to our former colleague and Minister of State, Jim Daly, for his work on the scheme.  As I said, these changes are long overdue.  The recommendations in this regard were made up to seven years ago.  During that time, many families have endured hardship in trying to meet nursing home charges, often having to sell land to do so.  Will there be a hardship fund to examine cases where this has happened or where, as Senator Byrne mentioned, people are already in a nursing home prior to the legislation being enacted?</p> <p>It is important at this time to thank the staff of all the nursing homes throughout the country for their care of people in need, particularly during the past 15 months.  Many of them put their lives on hold to keep our loved ones safe.  I experienced this personally when my late mother, Eilish, was in nursing home care during the Covid period.</p> <p>I have one issue with the scheme and it relates to the term "fair deal".  Our system of care for the elderly does not provide a fair deal for all families.  I am speaking here on a personal level.  Mention was made of care in the home.  We need to re-examine our model of care for the elderly.  Much of the emphasis when discussing this issue is on the fair deal scheme and nursing home care, when in fact the vast majority of families, including my own, would really like their loved one to be cared for at home.  It was just not possible for us to do that for my mother.  The option was not really there.  When she was diagnosed with dementia in hospital, we were given the option of five hours' care or the fair deal scheme.  That was the choice we faced as a family and we had to make a decision.  In fact, there was only one decision we could make.</p> <p>My mother received fantastic care in the nursing home in which she lived.  I compliment the staff of St. Joseph's care centre on the top-class care they provided.  However, if that type of care could, in some way, be provided in a person's home and be topped up by family members, it would be of great help to people.  This is something we must examine as we move forward.  It is an option my family would have taken and I know numerous others would be more than willing to do the same if it were available.  If I ask only one thing of the Minister of State, it is that she look seriously at that option for the future.  It should be something families are able to choose.  As well as the likes of communal living, we need to look at providing one-bedroom or two-bedroom homes attached to nursing homes.  There is a place in County Mayo - I cannot recall which town it is - where that arrangement is in place.  A person can purchase a one-bedroom or two-bedroom house beside the nursing home, avail of the facilities, including medical and dining facilities, but still live independently.  We need to take a strong and focused look at the future of care for our elderly.  We need to give families a different option.  My family, unfortunately, did not have another option.  An offer of five hours of care for someone who was unable to walk and care for herself was quite unfair.</p> <p>Reference was made to the housing adaptation grant.  We need to look at cases where half a house has been signed over to a family member and the elderly person has a legal right to remain living there.  When it comes to seeking an adaptation grant, if needed, the person is not eligible because the house has been signed over to the relative.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Where that legal stipulation is in place in respect of those living in the property, I ask that it be taken into account and that they still be allowed to adapt the house.</p></speech>

It gives us a real sense of the challenges that are faced by families in deciding whether to try to cope at home or put a loved one into a nursing home that provides great care. I commend my colleague.</p> <p>I welcome my fellow Waterfordian, the Minister of State, to the House.  I compliment her on bringing forward this very important legislation, which will have a significant and positive impact on those families who have farm and business assets and are availing of the nursing home support scheme, commonly referred to as the fair deal scheme.  It should be noted that the scheme represents a &euro;1.4 billion investment annually by the State, and benefits over 22,000 people.  </p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware, it has taken a considerable amount of time for the Bill to get to this point.  I acknowledge the exceptional hard work done by my Fine Gael colleague, the former Minister of State, Jim Daly, on this Bill.  The changes were approved in July 2018 and the pre-legislative scrutiny was commenced in November 2019.  Obviously, progress on the Bill was impacted by the general election and Covid-19.  It was great to see the Bill pass all Stages in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  I am sure it will pass all Stages in the Seanad by close of business tomorrow.</p> <p>The review of the fair deal scheme committed to reviewing how productive assets are treated for the purpose of the scheme, and whether the sudden illness or disability condition should be removed and the three-year cap applied to productive assets.  Currently, the unqualified three-year cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses, except where a farm or a business owner suffers a sudden illness or disability, and as a result, requires nursing home care.  This can, and does, have a significant impact on the viability of family-owned and operated farms and businesses, as a large proportion of the asset's value is owed to the State.  As Senator Carrigy rightly pointed out, it has resulted in families having to sell businesses or farm holdings, which is unfair and counterproductive.</p> <p>Under the proposed legislation and the amendment to the scheme, contributions based on family-owned and operated farm or business assets will be capped at three years, where a family successor commits, within the first three years of the relevant person's time in care, to working the farm or business asset for a period of six years.  The intent of the amendment is to ensure that in cases where the productive income of the farm or business is being relied upon as the principal livelihood and the farm or business is being handed down to the next generation, the viability and sustainability of such farms or businesses are protected because there is a degree of certainty about the overall cost of the long-term residential care.  There is a dual benefit of the measure in terms of equalisation with other financial assets and also promoting the next generation of business and farm owners.  As we move to a jobs-led recovery in the coming years, it is important that this generational shift takes place and we support the younger generation of entrepreneurs that is coming to the fore.  A lot of knowledge within families can help to progress businesses and farms.</p> <p>I will touch on an element of my own brief in housing in the context of the fair deal scheme.  I ask the Minister of State to engage with her colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, on the issue.  I have spoken to the Minister about it.  It concerns the treatment of rental income under the fair deal scheme.  Currently, participants in the scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income.  That includes rental income, which means there is no incentive for families to rent out the property.  They go through what can often be a traumatic experience of packing up the belongings of their mother, father or relative and putting them into storage.  I appreciate that some concerns have been expressed about whether an incentive would push families towards putting older people into nursing homes against their will.  That would not apply in the vast majority of cases.  If we had a rate lower than 80%, for example, a rate of 20% or 40%, as currently applies to rental income generally, it would have a positive impact in freeing up much-needed housing and rental stock for individuals and families across the country.  I ask the Minister of State to take that suggestion on board and address the matter in the autumn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#YY00400"><p>Curim f&aacute;ilte riomh an Aire St&aacute;it.  It is not an exaggeration to say that the increasing care needs of our growing elderly population are probably one of the most urgent social crises looming over the Irish State in the next 30 years.</p> <p>Our ballooning national debt may be at dangerous levels, but it can be inflated away and renegotiated.  Climate change, for all the attention it gets, is a problem which will affect people in much poorer and lower lying countries long before it will affect Irish people directly in a serious way, although I do not make light of that.  We owe a great debt of solidarity to people in those countries.  Even the pensions time bomb, as it is described, is something which may well be manageable with proper State policies and responsible private provision by citizens.  However, the reality is that no matter what we do, the demographic make-up of the Irish population is not something that can be changed by legislation.  It is a fact of life that the proportion of the population that is elderly and in need of care is going to rise dramatically in the decades to come.  The inherent human dignity of our elderly population and the love and respect we feel towards our elders demand that we do the best we can to care for them in old age.  This moral duty will exist 30 years from now, as it does today.  </p> <p>Our collapsing birthrate will exacerbate the scale of this challenge, since there will be even fewer people of working age in 30 years' time than there are now, as a proportion of the population, meaning less resources to pay for increasing care needs.  The number of births in Ireland fell from 61,000 in 2018 to 56,000 in 2020.  We do not talk enough about the implications of those kinds of statistics for our planning of national life going forward.</p> <p>I welcome the provisions in this Bill.  They will go a long way towards alleviating the circumstances of families who face the prospect of their family farm or business being dissipated due to the contributions required under the fair deal scheme.  It seems fair to apply the same three-year cap to farms and businesses as applies to the principal private residence or family home of the person in care.</p> <p>Only a third of Irish farms are profitable and it is far fewer than that again in the west.  The same is true for family businesses in the west which, no matter what the sector, are less financially lucrative than in other parts of the country.  In order for a family to qualify for the cap, the family successor, who may not own the farm but is still working it, has to demonstrate a six-year commitment to the farm on his or her part.  Is that not a very high bar for many people to clear, given that two thirds of farms are not profitable and so many younger farmers now supplement farm work with second jobs?</p> <p>I have another question that perhaps the Minister of State can answer.  It is a question rather than a statement.  In terms of the ability of the family successor to qualify for the cap to apply to the farm, family business, country pub or whatever it is, does most of their income have to come from that farm, family business or country pub during that period?  The Minister of State is indicating that that is not the case.  That is important.  It seems that when people talk about rural life, one of the realities is that people have off-farm jobs.  The country pub might be a pastime or a means of keeping the family tradition alive and the rural community going.  The owner would not necessarily be in it for the money, but there may be all sorts of other motivations for wanting to keep the family business going.  The same applies to family farms.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The reality is that, for an off-farm job to work, most of the money will have to come from it, while most of the individual's time will be devoted to maintaining the way of life on the small family farm, which may not be so profitable.  I detect from the Minister of State's body language that this has been addressed.  I will be delighted if it has.  It is important that the criteria according to which a person qualifies take into account the fact that the bulk of the earning activity might be from the activity that is not the subject of the cap.<br/><br/>I read an excellent paper last week by Ms Maria Dillon, a solicitor in Galway who is an expert on the care needs of the elderly and vulnerable and their legal rights.  She points out several ways that the 2009 Act could be improved.  For example, she highlighted a 2016 judgment by former President of the High Court Peter Kelly in the case of M. L. <i>v</i>. D. W., a dispute that centred on the sale of a family home by the person who had enduring power of attorney over the affairs of an elderly person in full-time care under the fair deal scheme.  The house was empty, falling into ruin, and had been broken into, and there were still bills for insurance, property tax and so on.  The house could not be rented out without imposing further burdens on the owner's family, none of whom lived nearby.  The problem, as the Minister of State will be aware, was that selling the house would have converted it into a cash asset, thereby removing the three-year cap and exposing the proceeds to being eroded over time under the terms of the scheme, which was clearly an enormous disincentive to selling.  It occurred to me that there must be a large number of families in this position.  Surely we should make provision for such circumstances.  It is bad for the affected families and bad for society because houses that might otherwise be sold or rented out are lying empty to protect their value.  This appears to be addressed in an amendment the Minister of State has tabled but it is a matter I wanted to highlight as one that needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>Another problem, which has only recently begun to emerge, concerns what are called life loans, or what we would know from television advertisements as equity release arrangements.  Much of the activity in this area took place 15 to 20 years ago during the height of the most recent property bubble.  Essentially, individuals released equity from their homes to assist their children with house deposits.  This was called &quot;the Bank of Mam and Dad&quot;, but now Mam and Dad are reaching old age and require full-time care.  Equity release involves a legal charge being placed on the property, and the small print often requires that the house must be sold if the owner goes into long-term residential care.  Therefore, the same problem arises since the home would then be converted into a cash asset and the three-year cap could not be availed of.  I believe this is being addressed.  If so, I welcome it.  It is important to allow the principal private residence to be sold in such circumstances but for the proceeds to be subject to the three-year cap.  It is important that rental income from renting out an empty residence be exempt from consideration according to the criteria covering a cash asset.  These would be small changes that would not damage the financial viability of the fair deal scheme.<br/><br/>The cost of long-term care and the burden on the families of those in care are going to increase significantly in the years to come.  This will inevitably lead to greater contributions being sought from those in care and their families.  Therefore, we need to do all we can to alleviate pressure on the scheme and on applicants and their families.<br/><br/>I mentioned the &quot;Bank of Mam and Dad&quot;.  The caring role I shared in recent years with members of my family meant I saw a certain amount of daytime television at weekends.  I deepened my affection for Lieutenant Columbo and others who are regularly shown on certain channels.  I frequently saw advertisements for the &quot;Bank of Mam and Dad&quot;.  How tasteless I find it when I see individuals being encouraged to save up for their funerals so as not to be a burden on those they leave behind.  I wonder sometimes when watching some of the advertisements what kind of message they send to older people in society.  They are told they need to be selfless enough to make sure they will not cost their loved ones anything when they go.  While I accept it is not within the scope of this Bill or any other to deal with this, my observation was a cultural one I thought I would make in conclusion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#ZZ00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I congratulate her on her role, her advocacy for this Bill and getting it to this Stage.  It is certainly going to be part of her legacy.  I acknowledge, as others have, the work of her predecessor, Mr. Jim Daly, with whom I had much contact in my previous role as Government Chief Whip regarding the progression of this legislation as a priority.  As with other Bills, it has had a rather tortuous journey.  Its general scheme was approved by the Cabinet in June 2019.  The changes are outlined in the legislation before us.  I acknowledge the work of Mr. Daly.  It is important that we do not forget those who ploughed the fields before us.  I also acknowledge the work and lobbying of the Irish Farmers' Association, including Ms Maura Canning and Mr. Joe Healy, and others.</p> <p>I welcome the changes in the Bill and acknowledge the Minister of State's openness to examining issues raised on various Stages in the D&aacute;il and to tabling amendments, as she did.  It is a pity this is the last week of the term and that proceedings are a little more rushed than they should be.  This is the nature of things, unfortunately.</p> <p>I welcome the changes to the Bill because business people, particularly farmers, have a great affinity with and affection for the land.  It is not about what the land is worth financially but what it is worth emotionally and in the sense of its having been in the family for generations.  There is concern that some land could be lost or sold to pay for the care of loved ones.  It is quite an emotive issue.  Irrespective of what the land is worth, it is needed to generate enough income for a farm to continue in operation.  I welcome the cap that has been put in place for farmers and small businesses.  It will give peace of mind to people as they go about their business.  Very often, a person might have an elderly loved one to care for in addition to other dependants, including children, depending on the circumstances.  It was always a matter of the balance and sustainability of the scheme.  As Senator Mullen said, the question of who will look after us all will continue to arise.  It is a matter of timely access for those who need support. </p> <p>The appointment or nomination of a family successor is positive.  Does a person nominate a family successor when thinking about the fair deal scheme, or should every farmer or businessperson consider the matter in his or her fifties, if that is not too late?  One does not know what will happen in some cases.  Should the nominee be known within the family and go through a process?  Succession planning is important.  This could be considered.</p> <p>Rental income was raised by others.  It is an important issue.  There are vacant houses with weeds growing around them at a time we need houses in various areas.  I acknowledge that not all houses may be suitable, depending on the location.  A house may be in the middle of a working farm so it might not be practicable to rent it.  Where it is possible to rent a house, it should be considered.  Disincentives to renting should be addressed.</p> <p>I raised the issue of carers in the House previously.  There is a broader debate on looking after people at home, where possible.  My colleague has spoken about his circumstances.  My late father, whose case I spoke about in the House previously, had a debilitating condition.  My mother promised him that we would look after him at home.  There were seven of us in the family so we were able to do that.  My uncle had a stroke on 12 March.  He was 88 at the time and had never been in hospital in his life.  Just like that, he is now in a nursing home.  He is quite content.  We just never know when these things will happen, no matter how much planning we do.  We are all going to start getting sore knees and hips and eventually we will drop away.  Things can happen suddenly.  Families may have to deal with issues for which they have not prepared or planned and they may have to run around trying to find information.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I welcome this change, which will be important in giving peace of mind in respect of a very important scheme which most families, if not all families, will at some stage apply for and use.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is always very welcome to the House, but she is particularly welcome this evening with this legislation.  I compliment her on introducing this very significant Bill.  She and I spoke about the matter when she was first appointed.  It is very important to many people.  She deserves great credit for ensuring the Bill has been brought to the House in an expeditious manner.  I compliment her on that.</p> <p>I also acknowledge the work of the previous Minister of State, Jim Daly, who is a gentleman.  I had the pleasure of him responding to two Commencement matters I had raised on the issue in the previous Seanad.  I know the sincerity he had in trying to progress this.</p> <p>This is definitely a good news day.  A three-year cap will now be placed on farm assets or business assets of any kind.  As someone who was born and reared on a small farm, I know that sometimes it is a labour of love and does not provide any great financial gain.  In many ways the cost of maintaining land may exceed any income it might provide.  Five of us were reared on 20 acres of land in Donegal, not far from where Senator Blaney lives.</p> <p>I know the trauma and stress families face when a loved one needs to go into a nursing home.  For some families where income is limited the costs can be excessive.  I know of some people who had to sell land which was a very painful undertaking because that land might have been in the family for generations.  To be forced to dispose of it to pay for a loved one in care is very traumatic for any family.</p> <p>I acknowledge others, including the farm organisations, particularly the IFA, who played a role in trying to progress the matter.  Age Action was also very much to the fore in trying to find a solution.</p> <p>For some families the nursing home is the only option for long-term care.  Nursing homes deserve great credit for the role they have played in trying circumstances during the battle with Covid.  I acknowledge the role they played in that regard.  I also acknowledge the role of the Minister of State played in trying to steer those nursing homes through that very traumatic and stressful time for many people.</p> <p>As Senator Mullen outlined in his contribution, the population is ageing and caring for the elderly will put greater financial pressure on the Exchequer in the future.  In an ideal world, everyone would stay within their own family home, in their own community where their friends and connections are.  In some cases, unfortunately, there is no other show in town but the nursing home.  We are lucky to have them and they do an excellent job.</p> <p>If possible, every effort should be made to try to ensure that a person would be able to stay within their own home for as long as they would wish and for as long as they are medically fit to do so.  The home help service is excellent.  I welcome that significantly more funding has been allocated to that sector in recent times.  Every penny spent on that is money well spent.  Those few hours of home help are saving the State a fortune.  In some cases, it might be only 20 or 30 minutes in the morning and 20 or 30 minutes in the evening.  There is great scope to expand that scheme much further and to increase the role that those who call to people's houses might undertake.</p> <p>The last time the Minister of State and I discussed this issue during a Commencement debate, she said she was working to expand the home help service and was considering providing a fair deal for people who wanted to stay in their own homes.  Perhaps she might give the House an update this afternoon on the status of that.  I compliment her not just on this issue, but on all the work she is doing in her brief.  She is doing an excellent job.  Bualadh bos.</p></speech>

The Bill before the Seanad today marks an important step in the equal treatment for farmers who cannot realise the value of their assets.  The Bill will allow for the continuation of their farms when they are no longer able to work due to advancing age.  We must ensure fair treatment of farmers, not just when they are producing goods and feeding the island, but also when they can no longer work.  The extension of the three-year cap to cover family farm assets is very welcome in this regard.  The overall aim of the nursing homes support scheme is that participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  Farming should be covered in line with others who have different means of income.</p> <p>I commend the Bill for two reasons.  First, the Bill aims to support family farms and the continuation of family farming.  It removes some undue stress on inheritance of farmland.  Sustainability of farms does not simply include the sustainability of the environment; it must also include the sustainability of the farm's operation, ensuring that farms can be passed down through the generations.  Who knows the land better than those who have lived their entire lives farming on it?  We must ensure that the passing down of farmland and all that comes with it is fair and just.  </p> <p>Second, the Bill ensures affordable care to those who have contributed so much of their time and effort to this land.  State-subsidised care is a common good that should be offered to all based on means and farmers should be treated no differently.  A three-year cap on assets will help to put their minds at ease when it is time to pass their farm down to the next generation without incurring heavy financial cost.  State supports must be in place for those who need them and for those who deserve them.  Farmers certainly deserve Government support.  We cannot have a situation where farmers must decline nursing home support and the provision of quality of care because they fear for the financial well-being of their families if they choose to do so.  Farming is the lifeblood of this country.  Like Senator Gallagher, I grew up on a family farm in Donegal, which is still in my family's possession.</p> <p>I thank Senators Carrigy and Kyne for sharing their personal experiences.  I also have experience of what it is like to care for a loved one at home.  As my father, a former Deputy in the other House, passed away with Alzheimer's, I know what it is like to care for an individual in that position.  He and five of his siblings suffered from the same illness.  This Bill would provide welcome relief for many families throughout the country.</p> <p>Like many other Members, I spent countless hours working on farmland in my younger years.  Farming does not come easily.  It is a laboursome and difficult career for those who choose to pursue it.  Farmers should be given plenty of credit.  They should not be left behind in quality of life or care after farming.  Farmers cannot afford to be run down financially when the farmer needs provision of care.  The Government is sending a strong message of support to farmers.  The Minister of State today is providing a statement on equal and fair treatment of those who devoted their lives to the production of sustenance.</p> <p>The proposed amendments to the scheme are very welcome.  I look forward to the passing of the Bill to give farmers much-needed relief before the House takes its recess.  I commend the Minister of State on addressing the anomalies in the scheme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have no doubt about the Minister of State's determination and persistence.

This is about citizens, family members, neighbours and people.  I commend the Minister of State for her work in bringing this Bill through today.  I commend the former Minister of State, Jim Daly, for his term in the Oireachtas in the position that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, now holds.  This is about a fair deal, care and fair treatment of all citizens.  I am sorry that Senator Mullen is not here.  In advance of the debate, I was reading a submission made by European bishops to the European Union about care of the elderly.  It was interesting that they asked for intergenerational solidarity in the green paper on ageing.  Some 20% of people in the European Union are over the age of 65.  By 2070, over 30% will be over 65.  That means that the &euro;1.74 billion being spent by the State will increase.  All of us who have elderly relatives understand the need for them to be looked after in the comfort of their own home or in an environment that they are familiar with.</p> <p>To be fair, I know the Minister of State had a great interest in this long before she became a Minister of State.  The issue of care of the elderly, the provision of home care packages and of home help need to be examined on a fundamental level.  We need to have an honest debate about the care of our elderly citizens.  We must ensure that we always do the right thing.  I am not afraid to have a conversation.  We should have a conversation about how we can look after people better.</p> <p>Senator Garvey referred to a retirement village in Clare.  We have one in Cork city, in Lapp's Court and Hartlands Avenue.  I would love for the Minister of State to go to see it.  It is a small, predominantly Church of Ireland community.  Elderly people live in little one-bedroom or two-bedroom bungalows with a kitchenette and a sitting room.  It is a wonderful place to visit.  Senator Mullen was talking about television advertisements.  There is an advertisement on television about downsizing and encouraging older people to change from three or four-bedroom houses to different types of accommodation.  That is all welcome but it has a profound impact that we need to debate.  I hope that we can do that.</p> <p>My fundamental concern is the delivery of care in community, nursing home and hospital settings.  I go back to the remarks of the bishops about intergenerational solidarity.  We should look at and discuss it.  This is about ensuring that we are fair to businesspeople and the farming community, which we are.  I welcome the Bill and the debate.  It is also about putting in place a compendium of supports for wider care that can ensure that we provide real, meaningful care to those of our society who are elderly and need care and support.  It is one thing to be able to have &euro;1.74 billion on a balance sheet but quality and continuation of that care are issues.  All of our offices are dealing with families who are looking for a variety of home care appliances, home help packages and so on.  You name it.  I hope that through the prism of this debate and the work that we all do, we can help to inform and shape policy for the future that puts the person at the centre.  To be fair to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, she always does that.  I mean that genuinely.  I have seen her work in opposition and today in government.  The former Ministers of State, Jim Daly and Catherine Byrne, also did so.  I thank the Minister of State for bringing this Bill through the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#BBB00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and acknowledge her great efforts to make sure that this Bill has got this far.  I acknowledge my former colleague in Cork South-West, former Minister of State, Jim Daly, who worked hard to make sure that this legislation went through the earlier parts of scrutiny.  It is an important day for so many people.  My office, like many offices, has been somewhat inundated by people asking when this legislation was going to happen and be signed into law.  Will the Minister of State clarify her timelines regarding this legislation?  Will there be a 90-day lag or is there a proposed date in mind?</p> <p>In many ways, this legislation brings peace of mind to a farming and business community that unfortunately, since the set-up of this fair care deal, has felt disenfranchised and that it has been left with a legacy of debt because of the three-year rule.  This change to the three-year rule is an important step.  It sets out how a family can deal with the issues that so many Senators have mentioned today, such as family members who need to go into nursing care.  It gives people peace of mind.  People who are not in nursing care settings or are hoping not to go into them for a long time have a fear and worry about what if it happens.  This is important legislation because of that.  It brings clarity to an issue where there was a substantial liability on small family farms in particular.  We have all heard the horror stories about families having to sell portions of land because of exceptionally long-term care, which caused a legacy issue for the entire family.</p> <p>There are 700,000 people aged over 66 in Irish society.  By 2050, more than 1.8 million will be over 66.  That shows how the demographics and society are changing.  Scenario planning for the future will be a significant issue.  That is a big debate that we will have in this House and in the Oireachtas in future, about how we work with community and society to find a competent and caring place for our elderly.  I am interested in the Minister of State's view on whether we can amend other schemes in future to have a home care deal that might be a fairer care model and how that can be tied in.  People will probably do whatever they can, as my colleagues mentioned here today, to keep their loved ones at home.  How can the State help them during those troublesome times?  This is a positive step.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify those issues if she can.  I thank her again for her hard work in delivering an important Bill for society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#BBB00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who has responsibility for older people and mental health.  It is great to have the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021 here.  I thank my colleagues who have given heartfelt accounts.  They have spoken openly about their own stories.  Farming is a way of life.  It is a fantastic way to grow up.  My mum and dad gave me values, a love of where I come from, a love of the land and a hard work ethic, from sun-up to sun-down, sometimes.  There can be pure joy in it.  When I think about July, when I was a kid, growing up, if the silage was in, the hay was done and the turf was in before the Galway Races, that was really good.  There was joy in that.  Times are changing and our lives are changing.  Society is getting older.  Our way of life is changing in some of our rural areas, especially in counties such as Galway and Roscommon, where there are now many older people, with the number aged over 65 doubling in the 2016 census.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is such pain for farm families when a loved one may need to move to residential care.  Great efforts are made to keep our loved ones in our homes and to look after them but there is an impact when they have to go, and the impact on farm families is potentially the loss of land or issues with managing the break-up of a farm and a family home.</p><p>As the Minister of State noted and my colleagues have mentioned, a three-year cap on the financial contributions of family-owned and family-operated farms and businesses when calculating the cost of nursing home care is provided for in the programme for Government.  It was worked on a great deal by the previous Government as well.</p><p>My colleague, Senator Kyne, spoke about succession and inheritance, which is a crucial issue on which Teagasc does much work.  One of those tricky matters, although it is a conversation we all need to have within families, relates to writing a will and talking about what the future will look like.  On many small farms, the children grow up and may study in Dublin or abroad and go everywhere else to get jobs, and they will no longer be at home.  Could neighbours take over the farm or could other family members step in and help out?  It is about putting a plan in place and having those conversations.  The legislation is intended to support families in doing that and allow successors to come in and take over the family farm in order that there will be support for the older family members later in life.</p><p>Other colleagues spoke at length about their personal experiences of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  I worked on an Horizon 2020 project with the National University of Ireland Galway school of nursing and midwifery.  It concerned technology and how important it is for supporting people with dementia and Alzheimer' disease, as well as the chronic nature of the disease and how to support families.  I acknowledge another fantastic announcement the Minister of State made this week, relating to the healthy age friendly homes initiative.  It will be a pilot programme rolled out to nine counties including Galway.  It will target 4,500 homes and examine specifically how to support older people to live independently in their own homes for as long as possible, using technology such as telehealth and telecare to do that, in order that they can live with supports in place.</p><p>I had the opportunity to meet some representatives of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, including Mr. Tim Cullinan, outside the convention centre.  I acknowledge also Ms Caroline Farrell, chair of the IFA's family farm committee.  They have worked so hard, along with many other farming organisations, to ensure we have this scheme in place before the Houses adjourn for the summer.  We often talk about an ageing population.  As Senator Malcolm Byrne said, some of us will live to 100 years of age.  We are going to live longer but it is not about just that; it is about active and healthy ageing.  That is so crucial.  Farming, in many ways, is a fantastic way of life because it involves living outdoors and being physically active.  As many Senators noted, people who live such lives are at the top of their health, at least until perhaps something happens in their 80s or 90s.  They are so independent.  We need to support them living independently in their own homes or in residential units.  In my area of Ballinasloe, it is about one-bedroom or two-bedroom units in community areas, with supports in place.  Cl&uacute;id Housing has done a great deal for that as well.</p><p>How can we support Teagasc with succession planning?  I acknowledge that Sl&aacute;intecare and Healthy Homes Ireland are involved in the healthy age friendly homes programme.  How can we support succession planning through Sl&aacute;intecare and the health communities?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#CCC00300"><p>I thank all the Senators for their valuable and personal contributions.  The Bill is technical and complex in nature, so I appreciate the support of Senators in facilitating its swift passage through Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I thank the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the House and all the officials, given that there was much toing and froing in the past fortnight to see whether we could find time for the Bill.  We have debated Second Stage today and will debate Committee and Remaining Stages tomorrow.  I thank each Senator for facilitating that because it was so important that it would happen.</p> <p>Many Senators spoke about our former colleague, the former Minister of State, Jim Daly.  I will tell a little story that few people know.  My father and Jim Daly's father were reared beside each other.  They grew up together in the small townland of Derrynagree, one mile outside Drimoleague in west Cork.  From our very first meeting, Jim and I hit it off and worked very well together.  When he was handing over the reins to me, we spoke about the fair deal scheme, statutory home care and housing for older people.  I am honoured to carry on the mantle in the context of this Bill.  It is amazing our two fathers grew up beside each other in west Cork.</p> <p>Senator Lombard summed it up when he referred to peace of mind, while Senator Clifford-Lee did so too when she stated that the disincentive is being removed.  The Bill is complex but its core aims are straightforward, seeking as it does to ensure fair treatment for farm families and business-owning families, without impacting negatively on the sustainability of the scheme, thereby preserving access to care for those who need it.  It is important that we ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  It costs &euro;1.4 billion a year, a vast sum to support 22,500 people in nursing homes.</p> <p>That brings me to the issue of home care, which was raised by Senator Garvey and others.  We made a significant breakthrough in home care this year, with a total of &euro;632 million allocated for it.  There was an increase of 5 million home care hours, bringing the total figure to 24 million.  When I was sitting in opposition for the four years prior to the most recent election, I used to have a go at the then Minister in regard to home care hours.  Just before that election, the number of people waiting for home care throughout the country was 8,000.  Now, during Covid, the figure has fallen to fewer than 2,000, which is phenomenal.</p> <p>To respond to Senator Garvey, home care is delivered predominantly on clinical, medical grounds, unlike home help, which does not really exist any more.  Nevertheless, I acknowledge the point she made about rural isolation.  I have been working on such issues as a member of the loneliness task force and I accept what she said, but we have made substantial progress on home care.  The premise of Sl&aacute;intecare is the right care at the right time in the right place, and that is what we are trying to achieve.  I take on board the point the Senator made about having been offered a choice between five years and the fair deal scheme.  For some people, it is very difficult to make that decision.  I very much welcome the cross-party support for the Bill.  The support in the D&aacute;il was similar, where I worked with the Opposition on some amendments to get them over the line.</p> <p>I will now address a few of the Senators' questions.  On when the scheme will commence, I hope the Bill will pass Committee and Remaining Stages tomorrow and it will then go to the President to be signed into law.  An amendment provides that the Bill will then be enacted within 90 days.  The reason we have provided for the 90-day period relates to the cyberattack having slowed down matters.  The HSE has work to do on this, as does the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I wanted to be fair, so a 90-day period was provided for.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne asked about time served and when a successor should be appointed.  Once the Bill has been enacted, if a loved one is moving to a nursing home the successor should be put in place immediately.  Once a successor has been put in place, if a loved one - someone's father, mother, aunt or uncle, for example - has been in a nursing home for, say, two years, that time will count.  The person will have to serve only one further year in the nursing home to reach three years and he or she will have reached the cap.  In fairness, 37% of people spend only between six and seven months in a nursing home, although the average length of stay is approximately two and a half years.  If a person has been in a nursing home for four years and appoints a successor, the cap is applied immediately.  The period spent, therefore, is retrospective.</p> <p>To respond to Senator Mullen, we are trying to make this scheme as user-friendly as possible.  A person will not have to prove that he or she has an income.  The phrase used is a "substantial part of the working time", rather than it being based on a proportion of the person's income.  As Senator Dolan noted, many family members help on the farm.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They help with milking, silage, crops and various other tasks at different times of the year but they may not have an income from the farm.  In order to be a successor, one has to have shown an interest and been part of the farm for three of the previous five years but one does not have to show an income.  There are cases, for example, in which a son or daughter might have been in Australia or Canada but can come home and be that successor once the farm was in family ownership.  All we are trying to do is to make sure the farm or small business is sustained.</p><p>I will touch on some of the other matters that have been raised when we deal with Committee Stage tomorrow but I wish to address now the issue of statutory home care because it has come up frequently and we are doing a significant amount of work on it.  We hope to bring in a statutory home care scheme next year which will be like the fair deal scheme but in the home.  In budget 2021, I got funding for 128 assessors to roll out this international resident assessment instrument, interRAI, programme.  That means that those being assessed for their needs will undergo the same assessment no matter which part of the country they live in or the CHO they are in.  That will determine applicants' needs.  A significant amount of work is being done on that.</p><p>I know that we have to deal with Committee Stage tomorrow but I wish to acknowledge that I have received so much support from Ms Fiona Larthwell and Mr. Neil Kavangh, two of my officials who have been with me for the past seven months in driving on this initiative.  I thank them once again.  I thank the Acting Chairperson for her support.  I am delighted that we have reached this stage.  The push was on to get the Bill done this week.  I did not want to have to come to the Seanad with the Bill in September or October, with the Bill not being enacted until Christmas.  It is a positive story.  It is correcting an unintended consequence and an anomaly that was there since 2009.  It has taken some time to address it.  I acknowledge all the people who made representations to me on the issue.  I am delighted to get the Bill over the line.</p></speech>

It is very unusual, at this late stage of the parliamentary session, when all of the other matters before the House relate to legislation, for a report that was only published and released to the public at lunchtime today to be debated so quickly.  That highlights the importance of the issue to the Members of this House, but also to the Minister.  I thank him for coming back to the House with the report, as he said he would.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#JJJ00300"><p>I thank the Seanad for accommodating this debate on the report of the independent review group on Jadotville which was published today.  The group examined the issue of the awarding of military medals to personnel who served at Jadotville while deployed overseas on the UN peace support mission in the Congo 60 years ago.  When I announced the establishment of an independent review of this important matter in this House last November, it was broadly welcomed and supported by all parties.  On that occasion, I undertook to return to the Seanad once the review was completed and I am here today to honour that commitment to Senators, even though it is very late in the parliamentary session.</p> <p>Before I get into the detail of the report, I wish to personally acknowledge and sincerely thank all those who engaged with the review process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There were a significant number of people who did so.  In particular, I pay tribute to the 156 Irishmen who fought valiantly at the Battle of Jadotville in 1961 and to their families who supported them throughout and in the years since.  The review group acknowledges it is extremely indebted to the veterans of A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion, who have recounted their experiences, memories, pain and concerns with remarkable sincerity, honesty and authenticity.</p><p>The independent review group, convened by the Chief of Staff, brought together members with experience and competence in matters of military service, regulations and administration, as well as an academic of standing with an understanding of the historical context of the events in the Congo at that time and an experienced archivist who could access source material.  While maintaining its independence throughout the review process, the review group has presented its conclusions and recommendations based on a rigorous and objective examination and a thorough analysis of all material and evidence, including oral and written submissions from A Company veterans, their families and key experts.</p><p>I extend my sincere gratitude to the members of the review group who carried out this comprehensive review into this very important chapter in Irish military history using an evidence-based approach, which was conducted in an impartial and professional manner.  The report broadens the voices of those telling the history of the siege at Jadotville with direct testimonies of veterans, and gives a comprehensive, multidimensional and contextualised account of the Battle of Jadotville and, indeed, its aftermath.  Importantly, the report highlights a level of misunderstanding in relation to the particular recommendations made for consideration of an award for either meritorious promotions or military medals.  Through the comprehensive research conducted by the review group, these misunderstandings are addressed and the report clearly clarifies the factual position in relation to those recommendations made nearly 60 years ago.  I welcome the clarification and the historical accuracy that this research process and the report brings to this issue.</p><p>The report, perhaps most importantly, acknowledges the deeply unsettling aftermath of Jadotville: the vilification, the whispering campaigns, the complete breakdown of trust and the abandonment suffered by the men of A Company, which resulted in, as described in the report, the destruction "of their bond with the Defence Forces and the State which had sent them overseas in the cause of peace".  This meant many of them had nowhere to turn in the years and, for some, decades after Jadotville.  The report states, "the Jadotville experience was wilfully ignored, and knowingly silenced, initially in the 1960s, and then in subsequent years".  Many of the veterans did not cope well with the legacy of their experiences and I sincerely acknowledge the support that families provided to Jadotville veterans in the years that followed.</p><p>On behalf of the Irish State and the Government, I sincerely apologise to the men of A Company, 35th Battalion, who were not provided with the necessary supports or deserved recognition of their service on their return from Jadotville.  I also apologise to their families for the many issues that arose as a result, some of which had tragic consequences.  The lack of supports is extremely regrettable and should not have happened.  We have learned from this, and we have taken great steps in the intervening years to support Defence Forces personnel, their families and veterans through the work of the Defence Forces personnel support services, PSS, and, indeed, other supports.  Between July 1960 and May 1964, Irish Defence Forces personnel were deployed overseas on the UN peace support mission in the Congo, with more than 6,000 individual tours of duty at that time.  Tragically, 26 Defence Forces personnel lost their lives during the UN deployment in Congo.  These soldiers paid the ultimate price in support of peace and working for their country.  As Minister for Defence, I can assure the House that all are remembered with respect and honour by my Department and the Defence Forces.</p><p>I recently returned from a visit to Lebanon where I had an opportunity to meet with Defence Forces personnel while deployed as peacekeepers in UNIFIL and to pay tribute to fallen heroes linked to UNIFIL in the past.  Ireland will have the presidency of the UN Security Council in September, which also happens to be the month of the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Jadotville.  During this month, there will be a focus on Ireland's sustained contribution to peacekeeping since it first deployed with the UN in 1958.  It will offer us an opportunity to show our pride in those who served in our name, at the request of the United Nations.  It also offers the opportunity to recall the 87 members of our Defence Forces who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving the cause of peace overseas.</p><p>This substantial report makes a number of recommendations and I will be considering all of them, but time is needed to reflect fully on them and on the detail of the report.  Tonight, given the strong interest in relation to the awarding of medals, I will focus particularly on recommendations made in this regard.  The terms of reference provided that the review group "may consider the actions of individuals not already the subject of a recommendation [for a medal] ... in respect of Jadotville".  During the course of the review process, the review group considered that Commandant Pat Quinlan, company commander, A Company, who was not previously the subject of a recommendation for a medal in respect of Jadotville, merited further investigation.  The review group identified primary source evidence for the consideration of a recommendation for a posthumous award of the Distinguished Service Medal for Commandant Pat Quinlan.  I am happy to accept this recommendation and it is intended to establish a military medals board without delay to consider this recommendation.  While we should take care not to pre-empt the outcome of the deliberations of a properly constituted medals board, I have requested that it reports its findings to the Chief of Staff by the end of August.  The report is clear in that a medal for Commandant Pat Quinlan should be considered in light of the collective effort of all who served with him as well as in light of his leadership during the Jadotville battle.</p><p>When someone commits a career to the Defence Forces, medals really matter along with the recognition that comes with them, the precedence set, and how they compare with others who have also been honoured with medals.  This happens, as we all know, on the basis of a military assessment.  It should be noted that in the 1965 medals board, 360 cases were presented for consideration, and of those 65 personnel were recommended for the award of the distinguished service medal for service with the United Nations operation in the Congo, ONUC.  There are always dangers with recommending medals for some and not others.  This report notes that advocating for medals for some and not others in the case of Jadotville, has left some Jadotville veterans feeling that their contribution during the Battle of Jadotville was perhaps of lesser value.  Many veterans of A Company and their families, as evidenced in this report, reinforced the point that they value the integrity and status of An Bonn Jadotville, or the Jadotville Medal, as it is called, and therefore the report recommends that the status of An Bonn Jadotville should be retained and afforded due respect in recognition of the actions of A Company at Jadotville.</p><p>I recognise this is a report of 457 pages and many Senators have only just received it today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I advise them to take the time to read and review it.  I hope this wide-ranging and thorough independent examination finally addresses and brings some closure to the legacy issues relating to military medals for veterans of Jadotville.  Although the outcome of the review may not be what some might have anticipated or hoped for, there is no doubt that this rigorous review was carried out with an evidence-based and systematic approach and was conducted in an fully independent manner and certainly without influence or input from me.  With the historical accuracy that this report brings, I now appeal for unity of purpose in bringing some closure for many of the families affected and, in particular, for veterans who are still impacted by the issue. </p><p>In conclusion, I wish to recognise again the courage, skill and extraordinary contribution and sacrifice made by those involved at the time.  In the words of the report, "To all veterans of &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company, 35 Infantry Battalion and 1 Infantry Group, we salute your outstanding service as peacekeepers with the United Nations mission in the Congo in 1961".  During our presidency of the UN Security Council, I intend to hold an appropriate occasion and commemoration in September in New York for the service of all peacekeepers but, in particular, those who served in Jadotville.  Of course, we will also commit to holding a State event to recognise the 60th anniversary on 16 September.  It will probably be held on the following Sunday, as is traditional for Defence Forces events.  It will probably be on 19 September but we will certainly inform Members of those formal ceremonies and events in recognition of the extraordinary service of the men involved.  I look forward to hearing the comments of Senators.</p></speech>

Several months ago when he stated that the report would be initiated, he gave a clear and definitive timeframe in respect of when he would come back to the House and he has fulfilled that commitment today.  I thank him for that.  I also thank him and his officials for the engagement they have afforded me and every other Senator.  He is one of the few people in recent years who has put a significant effort into this issue and that is to be commended.  As regards the report, on one level it is quite disappointing that it is 480 pages long as it is difficult to delve into a document of that length and be able to debate and give a considered response on the issue five or six hours later.  I am sure the Minister will accept that.</p><p>I was struck by several issues in the report that I wish to address briefly.  The first relates to An Bonn Jadotville and the concept that some veterans or the review group itself believed Senators were trying to diminish its seriousness.  I wish to take this opportunity to put on the record that that is absolutely not the case.  An Bonn Jadotville was awarded in 2017, perhaps as a result of political pressure led by Senator Craughwell and other Members of this House several years ago who decided to get the issue back on the agenda.  That was a great job done well.  We were not trying to diminish the record of that medal in any sense; rather, we were trying to ensure that the other medals recommended by Commandant Quinlan in the 1960s were awarded and that all those involved get proper recognition.  It does not sit easily with me that parts of the report state that there was the potential to create a two-tiered system of veterans because that not the case.  I wish to take this opportunity to state that I certainly do not believe that claim to be accurate.</p><p>Another part of the report into which I delved in detail relates to the views of the group on the debate that took place in the Seanad on 11 November 2020.  The presentation of that debate in the report is quite selective.  It paints several Senators, including all those currently present in the Chamber, as glorified ambulance chasers pushing some sort of political agenda.  I thought about those words before I used them.  I have never had any political agenda whatsoever on this issue.  All Senators have political agendas but this is the one issue on which no Member had a political agenda.  It was a great example of coming together across party lines.  There was no one-upmanship or political agendas; it was about trying to just get this issue back on the table for discussion.  We did so and, thankfully, the Minister then instituted the review group, which is what all Senators sought.  I take offence at some of the language used in the report in respect of Senators and this House.  For example, it states:</p> <blockquote> 	rather unwittingly the Seanad debate seemed intent on sowing renewed division by creating two classes of Jadotville veterans ... [it] seemed to ignore An Bonn Jadotville, and showed little awareness that to award further medals would be a divisive act amongst the veterans still living. </blockquote> <p>Another point that struck me appears towards the end of the report, where it states: &quot;No politician cared enough about the Jadotville veterans to even discuss with the Independent Review Group the possibility of talking to the group or making a submission on behalf of any veteran or veterans.&quot;  That view is contradicted three sentences later, when the report states that no political parties or outside influences should have any input on this in the first instance.  All Senators who contributed to the debate last November made the point that the Government and politicians have no role whatsoever in deciding what medals are awarded, though I can understand how that may not be the view of the layman or the public.  Decisions relating to the awarding of medals are totally within the remit of the Army and the wider Defence Forces, which is the proper way to go about it.  Never in a million years would I have thought it acceptable for me, as a politician and a Member of this House who tried to advocate for an independent review group to be established and who, to be perfectly truthful, has little or no military experience, to decide whether the correct military procedure was followed.  I am not a military historian.  It would have been wrong or inappropriate for me or another politician pushing this issue to make a review or a submission or to appear before the committee.  I was more than happy to leave that to the professionals, namely, the people who have dedicated their lives to the study of Jadotville or to campaigning on this issue.</p><p>However, I would like to have made a submission after what I have read about myself or Senators Wall and Craughwell in the report.  I would love to have had the opportunity to respond to some of the points made in the report.  I have studied history.  I love history.  If I was not a politician, I would love to be a historian.  The references in the report to the Seanad debate would give a Martian or someone from outer space reading the report in 20 years the impression that the politicians involved did not know what they were doing, muddled the whole thing up and were motivated by some sort of nefarious political reason.  With all due respect, that is the view I got from reading the section of the report dealing with the Seanad debate.</p><p>The report includes quotes from veterans in respect of the debate and they are entitled to hold those views but the review group used selective quotes taken from hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of interviews to back up the narrative that what happened in this Chamber six months or seven months ago was wrong.  I would be more accepting of the section if it included a negative quote in respect of the debate followed by a positive quote.  I know from my own experience the number of people to whom I have spoken who were directly involved with Jadotville or have family members who were so involved and were delighted with and appreciative of what happened in the House last November.  It is perfectly acceptable to include quotes from people who did not like or accept what happened here last November but, in the interests of transparency and fairness, the views of those on both sides of the issue should have been presented for posterity so that historians or others looking at the report in the future can see it is a clear and balanced presentation of the issue.  That is my view on how the Seanad is addressed in the report.  Some of the language it uses in connection with the debate is politely condescending.</p><p>Another point I wish to note is that the report states, &quot;as evident in the Seanad debate and the political pressure coming from County Councils, and other bodies and individuals&quot;.  There was certainly no county councillor or anyone else pushing me to bring this issue forward; I just believed it was absolutely the right thing to do.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we had not pushed this nine months ago, we would not have this independent review board in the first instance.  I said in November, which is not acknowledged in this, that if the independent review board turns around, having acknowledged all of the information, and still says it will not award or recommend anything, that is fair enough.  I said it then and I say it now.  The Minister has done everything he can today.  On page 10 it states: "The veil of silence cast over the Battle of Jadotville for decades, and the stigmatising at all levels of those who fought bravely and survived Jadotville, does the Defence Forces no credit whatsoever.  This must never happen again.".</p><p>Let us pray to God that is the case.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work of his Department in the support it gave in every way.  However, the brave men of Jadotville, along with their families and loved ones have been dishonoured and treated abominably for 60 years by the Defence Forces in Ireland.  Nothing in this report of the independent review group on Jadotville published today addresses, seeks to undo or redresses the wrong.  Shamefully, it piles further pain, humiliation, and suffering on the surviving veterans of Jadotville, and dishonours the memories of the deceased Jadotville veterans.</p> <p>The comments I am making now come from a variety of sources that have contacted me today and last night.  The anger is unbelievable.  The Irish 35 Infantry Battalion in the Congo, to which Jadotville 'A' Company belonged, was part of a larger military UN military component.  The brigade was UN and Indian-led, at the time.  The whole UN force in the Congo was led by an Irish general of which the Indian-led brigade was a subordinate component part.  I am told that immediately prior to the fateful dispatch of 'A' Company to Jadotville, two other infantry companies - one Irish and one Swedish - had been stationed in Jadotville, but were quickly withdrawn by the Indian brigade commander.  He was a colonel who had credible intelligence provided to him.  Two companies of soldiers were hopelessly outnumbered by the assembling, combined forces of Katanga Gendarmerie and international mercenaries.  They were hell-bent on attacking the UN forces in Jadotville and reclaiming the town.  I understand that the sequence of events, and unorthodox orders, given directly to the Irish battalion by the Irish force commander, bypassing proper channels of command, and the Indian brigade commander, are at the root of this ill-fated deployment of 'A' Company to Jadotville.  Why the Irish force commander, in this instance, violated the proper chain of command when the Jadotville deployment of 'A' Company subsequently went wrong, became a centrepiece of not wishing to delve too deeply into Jadotville and the Defence Forces medals boards in the 1960s, lest the ugly truth be revealed.  </p> <p>Both the Irish force commander and the Irish battalion commander in the Congo at the time were close personal friends, and not just military colleagues.  Both were from the same rural part of Ireland.   I further understand that those who have erred in their flawed decision-making and subsequent issuing of unorthodox orders in the Congo, and who used personal friendships with Irish personnel then stationed in the Congo to have these flawed orders carried out, were subsequently in a position of high authority in Ireland when the 1960s medals board sat.  </p> <p>Given the so-called independent review group report we are now discussing and the Jadotville medals board in the 1960s, when the terms of reference were carefully crafted, and the membership of the boards were "friendly forces", to use a military term, then the required partisan findings of the group on boards by convening authorities can all but be guaranteed a tactic as old as time itself.  In the case of the so-called independent review group, another worrying factor-----</p></speech>

Even within these special friendships, there are always deeper friendships between a small number of fellow classmates.  The 44th cadet class of 1969 to 1971 was no different in this.  I must state that within the 44th cadet class, one of these deepest personal friendships was, and remains, between the son of the aforementioned Irish force commander in the Congo, and the chair of the independent review group, whose report we are now discussing-----</p></speech>

The process of investigating recommendations for the awarding, or declining of the award, of military medals falls exclusively within the statutory responsibility of the Defence Forces' leadership.  It is notable that the independent review group was not mandated or formed within the remit of the said Defence Forces regulations on the award of military medals.  It was a process that was ultimately brought about by the intervention of politicians.  It is risible, then, to note that unworthy comment in the report on politicians who were, and are, rightfully vocal in honouring the heroes of Jadotville.  On not engaging with the investigation group, no invitation was issued to me or to any Senator that I know of, to engage with the review group.</p> <p>The recommendation of the posthumous award of distinguished service medal, DSM, to Commandant Pat Quinlan, this charismatic and brave commander of 'A' Company 35 Infantry Battalion in the Congo, is noteworthy.  Incredibly, the group report does not agree with the award of medals recommended by Commandant Quinlan, for the other 33 members of 'A' Company for their valour and bravery in Jadotville.  This is quite astonishing.  The group sees fit to honour Commandant Quinlan, but somehow to dishonour him and his judgment when it comes to the field commander citing men for bravery.  One must surely follow the other.  It makes no sense, other than the unthinkable, that the group seeks to only applaud the Quinlan family, who have led the fight for proper honouring of these men and their families for decades.  Pat Quinlan was a man of honour.  He would be dismayed to be honoured to the detriment of his fellow soldiers.  </p> <p>I can tell the Minister that the Jadotville heroes that exist today, whether they are listed for medals or not, loved Pat Quinlan.  I have never met anybody who served who did not love Pat Quinlan.  The independent review group has veterans and members as advisers who are themselves veterans and members of three recognised Defence Force veterans' groups, the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers, ARCO; the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE; and, the Irish United Nations Veterans Association, IUNVA.  </p> <p>The negative and inevitably explosive consequence of this flawed report will cause upset and dissension within and between all three organisations.  It will also, sadly, cause unnecessary rupture and discord between serving and retired commissioned officers, their non-commissioned officers, NCOs, and private soldiers.  This is regrettable in the extreme, for those serving and retired.  At a time of great and increasing difficulties for the Defence Forces, it could and should have been avoided.  The award of a DSM, was at one time a badge of honour in the Defence Forces for those who carried out acts of individual or collective valour, bravery and decision-making of the highest order when faced with hostile actions; where there was imminent threat to life and limb; and on the saving of life on land, at sea, or in the air, at home or on overseas deployments.  Sadly, the award of DSM medal has been itself dishonoured in recent times, for being continuously awarded to most senior officers of the Defence Forces on their retirement, merely for having occupied the highest rank of the Defence Forces and for little else of note.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The citation attached to these recent DSM awards is a matter of public record and cringeworthy in the extreme.  By comparison, these flawed citations make the brave men of Jadotville seem like superheroes, which they were.  Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on 6 December 1941, before Japan's formal declaration of war on the USA, has been described in military history as a day of infamy.  Today's publication of this report is Ireland's day of infamy.  There is a proud military history to the siege of Jadotville.  Those associated with the report will soon be forgotten and we will be left to remember the personnel's part in the siege.  The heroes of Jadotville will live on in memory forever and rightly so.</p><p>Every time I go to Galway I meet Charlie Cooley.  Charlie was nominated for a DSM, and every time I meet him he says to me, "Craughwell, where's my feckin' medal?"  When I saw the report this morning, as one who served in that unit, I cried.  I cannot believe the Minister opened the door to allow the Defence Forces to undo the greatest wrong in the history of this State and I admire him greatly for that.  It took great courage.  What did the Defence Forces do?  They screwed it up and could not have done so worse if they had tried.  They have set officers against men.  A number of enlisted personnel and former enlisted personnel have contacted me today to say to me, "I always told you, Craughwell, it is only a feckin' officers' Army."  What am I going to say to them?  What can I say to them?  I told them about the parade in September the Minister was organising.  They said they wanted nothing to do with it.  It is such a heartbreaking day for 33 families.  Tell the Quinlans, whose brother killed himself, that he was not worth his DSM.</p><p>I do not know what to say.  I admire the Minister for what he did.  I am so desperately sorry because the allegations of conflict of interest on the board, which were there from the beginning, are coming at me left, right and centre: from Australia, Indonesia, America, England - you name it.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the fact that the Minister has stated that it is his intention to have two different ceremonies this year, one in New York, at the UN, to recognise all those wonderful men and women who served as Irish peacekeepers and Irish ambassadors throughout the world, and one on 16 September to remember those from the battle of Jadotville 60 years ago.</p><p>The last time we spoke about this in the Seanad, the Cathaoirleach - and I thank you once again, a Chathaoirligh - read into the Seanad record the names of each and every one of those who served in the battle of Jadotville in recognition of the respect and esteem in which these men are held right across the political divide.  We should remember that this was the very first peacekeeping mission in which a significant number of Irish soldiers took part.  It is only right that we should recall and honour the contribution of all who served in the various Irish contingents over the course of the long, difficult and complex mission.  Of course, we recognise those who have participated in all missions since 1958.</p><p>There is huge emotion attached to the Jadotville case and rightly so.  The men who served in Jadotville are responsible for extraordinary service to peacekeeping and to Ireland in what was, again, an incredibly complex, challenging and very difficult space.  They fought valiantly for five days, and the fact that they sustained only five injuries was a testament to the man who led them, Pat Quinlan.  Of course, we remember all those who have died overseas in the cause of international peace and security.  I wish to remember in particular Sergeant John Lynch, who died in Lebanon in 1997.  I was teaching his young daughter at the time and I have very strong and fond memories of him.  The last time we discussed this the Minister mentioned that any awards that would be recommended must be seen as having been awarded in exceptional circumstances.  The siege of Jadotville was certainly exceptional, and the bravery and courage shown by these men was absolutely exceptional.</p><p>The report before us today, as the Minister says, is a long one, and it is regrettable that we have not had the opportunity to go through it in detail.  We certainly join in the tributes to the 156 Irishmen who fought and their families who supported them.  It is good to see the report highlight both the deeply unsettling aftermath and the huge lack of personal welfare supports afforded to the men following the events at Jadotville and their period in captivity and on their return home.  I acknowledge that the Chief of Staff has said the veterans of &quot;A&quot; company, 35th infantry battalion, and their actions are the embodiment of our Defence Forces' values of respect, loyalty, selflessness, physical courage, moral courage and integrity.  While I certainly do not agree with many of the report's 19 recommendations, the conclusion is important:</p> <blockquote> 	The veil of silence cast over the Battle of Jadotville for decades, and the stigmatising at all levels of those who fought bravely and survived Jadotville, does the Defence Forces no credit whatsoever.  This must never happen again. </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, the recommendation that only one medal be awarded to these men does the Defence Forces no service either.</p><p>The recommendations under &quot;Veterans' Affairs&quot; are important and we have to acknowledge them on a day and an evening that is disappointing for all of us who have a particular interest in the siege of Jadotville, as I do, coming from County Kildare, the heart of the Defence Forces.  There is a recommendation that &quot;[t]he Defence Forces should now [and only now] engage with ... veterans, focussing initially on those who served with the 35 Infantry Battalion ..., to identify, to offer and to arrange support to those requiring it&quot;.  The recommendation that &quot;[t]he Defence Forces should review, with a view to expanding, its Mental Health and Well-being Strategy to support the wider Defence Community of serving personnel, veterans, and their families&quot; is very welcome and long-overdue.  The recommendation that &quot;[b]oth the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces should enhance their financial and material support for Veterans' Centres and Drop-in Centres operating under the auspices of the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel (ONE) and the Irish United Nations Veterans' Association&quot; is also very welcome.  I think we have all engaged with the ONE right around the country.  It is a group of incredible people and I am really glad to see it included.  &quot;The Independent Review Group recommends the Government appoints a Commission for Veterans' Affairs, who ... would act as an 'ambassador' for veterans.&quot;  That is hugely important.  Coming from Kildare, I see the many challenges and issues that veterans have, from housing to welfare supports, and the recommendation that there be a collaboration across Government Departments and local authorities to provide transition support is, again, hugely important to veterans and their families.</p><p>I will turn to what my colleague referred to in respect of the comments in the report about public representatives and their comments both in the Seanad and more widely.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I take grave exception to the language that was used.  It is an insult to every single one of us here and to the 18 county councils that passed motions in support of the veterans and their families.  I will mention some of the language used.  I refer to terms such as "downplaying", "purposeful" or "in ignorance", which is basically saying we were speaking in ignorance.  It refers to public representatives having a "lack of understanding"; "confusion" over what was mentioned; "a tendency to inflate the numbers"; "exaggerated claims"; "unsupported claims"; "a lack of interrogation of the facts in favour of easy comments uttered"; public representatives demonstrating "a lack of an informed understanding"; and the Seanad debate being "characterised by groupthink, incorrect information, misleading statements and the denigration by those present of An Bonn Jadotville."  This is an absolute disgrace and I take grave exception to it.</p><p>I thank the Minister, however, for his work and his apology.  I commend his commitment to doing his best both in terms of the two events we will have this year and in progressing the recommendations for the veterans.</p></speech>

Like other Senators, I am genuinely taken aback by this report.  At the same time, I am conscious that the Minister said it is very detailed.  I have not yet read it as thoroughly as I would like to but I went through as much as I could in the time available this afternoon.  Like previous speakers, I was genuinely taken aback by the language.  I appreciate the Minister is in a difficult position and I do not want to make that position any more difficult.  I believe he has come here in an honourable capacity this evening, and I want to acknowledge that.</p></speech>

I pay particular tribute to Senator Craughwell because I know how passionate he has been about this issue for so long.  I also mention my colleague who is now in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, who has spoken passionately about this issue on many occasions, and, equally, Senator McGahon.  It is rare that we all agree on something.  I believe the Minister will acknowledge that.</p> <p>The more I read, the more taken aback I was by the tone of the report.  It is mocking, patronising and insulting.  I must ask the Minister to comment.  How does he feel about the phrase "Jadotville bandwagon" that is used?  In all the engagements on this matter, I have only seen politicians genuinely trying to make a case for the heroes of Jadotville - nothing else.  No one has played party politics on this issue.  We have come together to try to see these men honoured in the way they should be.  The truth of the matter, unless I am reading the report wrong - I will take time to read it more thoroughly - is that it is an attack on this institution.  I must say that.  That is how it looks to me.  I do not believe that is in any way justified.  This is not what I expected to be saying this evening.</p> <p>Having seen the headlines, like others, I want to express my huge disappointment that this report does not recommend that the heroes of Jadotville receive medals.  There is an irony, of course, in the fact that the report rightly recognises the heroics of Commandant Pat Quinlan and then disregards entirely his recommendations.  I am being honest with the Minister in saying that from my reading of the report, it seems to have the deliberate aim of holding entirely to the position of the previous military tribunals on the issue of medals.  It does not seem to move one inch from those tribunals, apart from recognising the amazing heroics of Commandant Pat Quinlan which, of course, it is important to do.</p> <p>The tragedy is that there was an opportunity to undo the wrongs that were committed by the State against these troops for so long.  They have been traumatised, stigmatised and victimised.  At least six veterans took their own lives on their return in the aftermath of the battle.  I cannot imagine the sense of disappointment the veterans and their families must be feeling this evening.  I am sure everyone else present was struck, as I was, by what Senator Craughwell said about the reactions.  I have been monitoring the reactions on social media as much as I can.  The word "disappointment" does not even begin to describe them.  I almost sense a perception of betrayal with regard to the language and dismissive tone of the report concerning the genuine, sincere, and in my view, absolutely correct call for these men to be recognised and given the medals Pat Quinlan wanted them to get.</p> <p>I am conscious not to say much more at this point.  I will take the time to go back and read the report fully, from start to finish.  I acknowledge and recognise the importance of the apology given by the Minister this evening.  It is very important that is on the record.  I must say, however, that the language of this report is political and targeted.</p></speech>

What is motivating that?  This honestly does not look like a balanced report to me.  I do not think anyone would disagree.  I am interested in finding out whether the Minister stands over the language used in the report.  Does he stand over the very dismissive comments aimed at Senators from all parties?  I must be honest here, and I am only offering an opinion, but it looks as if there was a predetermined agenda in terms of major aspects of this report.  I say that not with accusation but with regret and disappointment.  That is how it reads to me at this point.</p></speech>

I share the bitter disappointment expressed by colleagues about this report.  I will address the language used as I proceed but I think it is important that we all get a chance to read the full 500-odd pages.  When I raised this matter on the Order of Business this morning, the Leader stated we would have the report in our inboxes by 12 noon.  In fairness to her, we did have it by noon but I have only had a chance to look at and take in the headlines.</p> <p>In saying that, I will refer to a number of statements made in the Department's official press release, some of which also featured in the Minister's speech.  According to the press release, the report concluded: "In relation to the possible awards of medals, the ... [Independent Report Group], having identified primary source evidence, recommends that Comdt. Pat Quinlan, Company Commander, &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company, should be considered for a posthumous award of the Distinguished Service Medal."  It noted, and the Minister confirmed this, that the Minister "intends to establish a military Medals Board to consider this recommendation without delay."  It goes on to state that the independent review group "also considered all previous recommendations for military medals with respect to the events at Jadotville."  Unfortunately for so many here tonight and listening in, the press statement then stated that, based on the research conducted by the independent review group during its review, the group "is strongly of the view that there is no merit to the reopening the recommendations of the 1961, 1962 and 1965 Medals Boards."</p> <p>As with previous speakers, I welcome one aspect of the Minister's statement, namely, his apology in which he mentioned the deeply upsetting aftermath of Jadotville and the lack of personal welfare supports afforded to the men following those events, during their period of captivity and upon their return home.  Speaking in the debate in November last, I noted that many of these men were scorned and ridiculed.  They were called "Jadotville Jack" on their return home following their engagement in the Congo.  As the Minister said, many of them had to live with that scorn for most of their lives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important to acknowledge the apology the Minister has given to the men of A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and, indeed, their families.  In this regard, I also acknowledge the comments of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, who concluded: "The veterans of A&rsquo; Coy, 35 Infantry Battalion and their actions are the embodiment of our Defence Forces".  Yes they are.  He said those values are "Respect, Loyalty, Selflessness, Physical Courage, Moral Courage and Integrity".  He went on to say, "It is a matter of much regret to me, that the values which we hold so dear, were not evident in the manner in which &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann failed to embrace the veterans of the Battle of Jadotville on their return from service in the Congo."  The Chief of Staff also said valuable lessons have been learned from this experience, and that he "trust[s] it will never be repeated".</p><p>Much has been written about what happened in 1961 and the Minister's own notes went through the timeframe of the battle exactly.  Nobody has argued with that from what I have see today, but there are 500 pages.  I thank the Cathaoirleach personally because he took our motion from November and we also had a very comprehensive debate, which the Minister himself attended.  At that debate the Minister advised us there would be a review group to examine the case.  As has been said by other speakers, over a long period of time many public representatives, from D&aacute;il Deputies to fellow Senators to county councillors, have raised their concerns on this matter and sought a review of the engagement.  I genuinely believe they did so out of a sense of public duty and public duty only.  They wanted to recognise the contribution of those brave men to the Defence Forces and indeed to the UN, the flag of which they fought under.  These public representatives also advocated for this out of loyalty to the families of those involved, many of whom contacted the same representatives we have spoken about tonight.  Since November, a number of colleagues from the House, many of whom are here and have spoken tonight, have taken part in events commemorating those from A Company who fought at Jadotville.  Most recently, we all met at the memorial in Merrion Square last month to take part in the Jadotville Challenge in aid of homeless veterans of the Defence Forces and organised by &Oacute;glaigh N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na h&Eacute;ireann, ONE, the national organisation of ex-service personnel.  Such is the legacy of A Company that its memory and its deeds continue to be remembered and celebrated by public representatives and the public to this day, as they should be.</p><p>The Minister has been asked, and I ask as well, that he join in thanking all those public representatives who felt it was their public duty to bring to him the need for a review of this engagement.  As I said last November, while I support the Minister's comment that politicians should not award medals, I am sure he will agree that when we are brought information about incidents such as Jadotville and about our heroes, we should bring it to his attention as the Minister for Defence in order that we can go through the due process of awarding those medals.  For me, this was, and can only be about those from A Company who boarded that aeroplane to the Congo to serve their country and the UN.  I make no apology for trying to represent those Jadotville families who contacted me to ask me to bring this matter into the public arena, as so many of my colleagues have done.  These men are heroes and will always be heroes to so many.  They, under their commanding officer, Commandant Pat Quinlan, have created a proud legacy for the Defence Forces.</p><p>I too bring up the language used in the report.  I welcome the Cathaoirleach's intervention that he will write to those involved in the independent review to ask them to consider the language they have used.  The language used is an absolute disgrace.  Other Senators have mentioned various aspects of it, including the "Jadotville bandwagon".  Who came up with such a term?  Maybe the Minister might be able to tell us because I again stress my only intervention in this was to try to represent Irish heroes.  That is all any of us was doing here.  When we spoke in the Chamber in November, it was to represent those heroes who fought in Jadotville in 1961.  We, and this is the important point, had no other agenda, and the question of whether other agendas were at play has been asked and is being asked again, and maybe that is the detail we must get to.</p><p>We have a situation tonight.  I pay tribute to Senator Craughwell for the work he has done over recent years.  We all joined him, as I said to him a year ago, to support that work and to get recognition for those who fought at Jadotville.  I have had calls, as other Senators have said they have had, from people throughout the country, asking them what has gone wrong here.  They ask why they are seeing a report where there is no recommendation of Pat Quinlan's own recommendations, which he fought for, for his comrades who fought with him in the siege of Jadotville.  That is the bottom line.  We are recognising Pat Quinlan as a commander but we are not recognising his own recommendations.  To me, the question is why we are not doing that.</p><p>I cannot accept this report as it stands, a Chathaoirligh.  I ask for another debate when time allows so we can go back here again.  The Minister has said we all need to read it and I agree, but we must come back to this House.  We must come back for one reason and one reason only, namely, that the heroes of Jadotville want us to come back and to get to the bottom of exactly what happened here.  Time is against us.  The sooner we get back here and debate what is in this report, the better.  I thank the Cathaoirleach, and thank the Minister for coming to the House tonight.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the very sincere engagement by colleagues from right across the House and from every party who have spoken about this issue.  I speak tonight on behalf of Senator Black, who has engaged very closely with many of the families of the survivors of Jadotville.  She regrets she cannot be here.  As somebody who has watched these debates and not been the key speaker in them in the past, there is no doubt in my mind of the real and genuine sincerity of Members on this issue and the lack of political division, motivation or point-scoring.  This sits with a record in this House that where we deal with issues of international human rights and of decency, such as the murder of Pat Finucane, there is sincere and cross-party engagement from Members.  The Minister will be aware of that because he has often been here for such debates.  It is important to note that.</p> <p>I regret the report does not identify and recognise the tone and motivation of the Seanad's engagement.  However, we should be glad of that engagement because the Seanad debate did contribute to the forming of an independent review group.  Some of the very important recommendations on welfare, counselling and supports for those who exit the Defence Forces would not have got centre stage without the review group and the press on the issue from the House.  I hope the recommendations will be acted upon.  There are very important issues of welfare, health support and counselling for those traumatised not simply by the events of Jadotville but how they were treated subsequently and indeed the trauma visited on their families by how society treated them.</p> <p>While those are part of what is at issue, the real core here is still that question of recognition.  The report itself acknowledges, "The Jadotville experience was willfully ignored, and knowingly silenced, initially in the 1960s, and then in subsequent years."  Interestingly, the Minister himself pulled out this quote.  Having had the experience of being silenced for so long, what people want now is that it be heard first of all and that it does not become invisible.  That is why it is a concern for eight living members of the 33 who were recommended by Commandant Quinlan for the distinguished service medals and indeed the five recommended for military medals for gallantry.  They felt seen by their commander and I am sure it was an important thing for them that he saw what they did and their bravery in extraordinarily difficult circumstances.  As well as that collective recognition, it is very important to remember there is no question about that being deserved by all who received An Bonn Jadotville.</p> <p>However, we must consider those specific people and their families.  Senator Black is often better at reading the personal stories than I am.  I tend to go to the policy.  She shared with me the correspondence she has had with some of the people.  Mr. Noel Carey talked of going in as a young man to be a peacekeeper and finding himself fighting for the survival of his friends, colleagues and those in his group.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was correspondence from a woman, Helena Quinn, who writes about her father, Corporal Tadhg Quinn, and the impact it had on him all his life and what it meant for him.  She wrote about the specific role he played with mortars and digging in defensive positions.  All of that work was seen by their commander.  That is why he recommended them and that is why it is still difficult.</p><p>It is appropriate that Colonel Pat Quinlan is nominated and that there is a recommendation for him to be awarded the distinguished service medal.  He could also be honoured by recognition that, as a commander, he recognised the gallantry of those who served with him.</p><p>Neither those of us in the Seanad nor anyone else sought to make submissions or to in any way engage with the work of the independent review group because it is an independent review group.  The independent review group has now made recommendations.  There will now be a new potential medals board.  The medals boards of the 1960s made their decisions but this medals board will also be independent of the independent review group.  It will make its own decisions.  It is perhaps important that we do not close the door in terms of what the medals board can do, should a new one be constituted, as the Minister has suggested.  It will of course be looking to award the appropriate award to Colonel Pat Quinlan but it could and should be free to make decisions about what it might do in future.  Again, the medals boards of the 1960s are fine and I know the suggestion is that they should not be revisited but I believe that door should not be closed.</p><p>UN peacekeeping is something that we are all proud of.  Ireland has the longest unbroken service with the United Nations of any country.  We have lost many people in peacekeeping, including 26 people in Congo alone.  UN peacekeeping is different from other kinds of military service because it is not for interests or for benefit.  It is in the service of peace and the protection of life.  It is in the service of the support for civilian society and protection of civilians.  We have played a particular role.  It was regrettable that the narrative was placed in terms of the framings and was undermining.  The work over five difficult days and over weeks of captivity in preserving and protecting the lives of colleagues was part of that peacekeeping mission and that sense of humanity.  These soldiers served humanity and one another.  They did not serve any interests.  This was very much in spirit with the way they were directed to act and the way they bravely fought under the leadership of Colonel Pat Quinlan.</p><p>It was appropriate for the Minister to mention that Ireland is on the UN Security Council.  It is important for us to remember the reason we are on the Security Council.  One of the things is our role in disarmament and other reasons include our role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding.  The role of Ireland in being a champion for peace and in not being subject to military interests is relevant as are the United Nations values of humanity and peace.  It is appropriate that the Minister mentioned that he will look to find other ways to honour the men of Jadotville as part of our leadership of the Security Council in the autumn.</p></speech>

It is disappointing that this is the third attempt at trying to address this issue.  Unfortunately, for many, I am saddened to say, it falls sadly short of their expectations.</p> <p>These 156 people fought side by side.  There was no distinction between any of them.  They all had a job to do and they did it to the best of their ability.  The manner of the events subsequent to their experience and their experience upon their return home have saddened so many.  Many Members have talked about it eloquently this evening.  It is sad that this is the third attempt at this since 1961.  We end up with a 500-page report that falls short, disappoints and saddens so many people.  That is most disappointing.</p> <p>I welcome the sincerity of the Minister and his formal apology this evening to the survivors and the families of those who are still around.  I honestly do not know where we go from here.  Normally, when reports are written there is an appeal mechanism built in whereby people who are disappointed or angered about the outcome have an opportunity to make comments or a submission.  I am unsure whether the door is closed in respect of that process.</p> <p>I note President Higgins is the supreme commander.  Perhaps some form of recognition through the President, who is highly respected by so many in this country, and rightly so, would be of some comfort to the families.  Perhaps some form of memorial would be adequate.  I do not have the answers but I call on the Minister to see what the State could do to finally bring closure and to recognise the bravery of the 39 people who sadly lost their lives and to all the other people, families and survivors who are still with us.</p> <p>It is very sad.  Other Members have spoken.  Senator Craughwell spoke passionately about the content of the report in respect of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and local authority members throughout the country and the question mark put over their sincerity.  I honestly did not think it was necessary in the comments.  To put it mildly, it was highly disappointing.</p> <p>We have not had much time to digest the 500-page report.  Senator Wall outlined this in his contribution, as did others.  I hope that with the passage of time over the summer we can revisit this.  I have every confidence that the Minister will come forward with proposals that will go some way to satisfying the needs of those who campaigned so hard and who have been involved in this sad affair from the get-go.</p></speech>

I thank him for his fulsome apology and I hope it gets into the public domain because it is important that we send out the message.  I wish to acknowledge that the Minister is initiating the review and the ceremonies he proposes to hold in the autumn.</p> <p>I wish to acknowledge the work of the former Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  He recommended to Cabinet the presentation of An Bonn Jadotville and was the first Minister of State to do so.  He presented the medals to those who served in Jadotville.  I wish to acknowledge the good work of the former Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, in that regard.</p> <p>I have spoken to some men today and I will come to that.  No criticism of today's report is aimed at Colonel Pat Quinlan and there is no implied or explicit criticism of him.  I salute the fact that the Cathaoirleach brought the names of the veterans into the roll of honour of the Seanad.  That was great.  I wish to acknowledge the pioneering work of Senator Craughwell in this area and his real, emotional, genuine and cerebral commitment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The review group was considering giving distinguished service medals to 33 personnel and military medals for gallantry to five.  Those people held out for five days between 13 and 17 September 1961.  They only surrendered when overwhelming odds made anything else a suicide mission.  That should never be off the record.  I share the disappointment of my colleagues at the outcome.  Commandant Pat Quinlan recommended the awarding of medals.  The veterans of Jadotville have been viewed in a certain way in some circles for many years.  They have been looked at ignominiously.  They suffered pain and there have been suicides and issues with alcohol, and many other problems have arisen.  This is certainly not a political issue.  It is a bad situation.<br/><br/>A distinguished member of my local community, Quartermaster Sergeant Sean Gregory, was in the field of operations at that time and was policing the airport at the time of the Jadotville siege.  He has testified to me and others about his recollection of the bad treatment of the men, particularly when they come home and since.  He had been on three peacekeeping trips.  He was in the area of operations, was a distinguished officer and knew what happened.  He said the way those veterans were treated was disgraceful.  There was a lot of collateral damage.  <br/><br/>I hope that the welfare recommendations, at a minimum, are adhered to.  I hope we do that welfare bit.  I hope the Minister's letter is strong in its response to the disgraceful insinuations about the motivation of political people from county councils and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Those insinuations are beyond contempt for publicly paid people.  It is a sinister type of thing.  Senator McGahon brought up that matter earlier.<br/><br/>I fundamentally hope we will have good ceremonies in September.  I hope we will do the welfare bit in a good, big and wholesome way.  I hope the Minister will intervene to make sure that happens.  I would like to hear him say that he will ensure that will happen.  It is regrettable that the report has not recommended the distinguished service medals.  I personally regret, as we all do.  It is a sad outcome.  However, we will hold these people and their families as heroes.  It is great that the Minister apologised to them.  I should apologise to them and do, as we all should.  What happened to these heroes and their families was disgraceful.  It is one of the great shames of our history.  It is a shocking indictment of the country that people could be treated like this.  Those people were unable to do anything other than they did unless they were to commit <i>hara-kiri </i>or collective suicide.</p></speech>

I join colleagues in thanking him for the sincere apology he has delivered on the part of the State.  However, I too am disappointed, like others, that the motivation of those of us who have raised this issue has been somehow questioned.  Particular language is used.  The report states: &quot;Unfortunately, recent events have shown that evidence-based historical accuracy has become a casualty in the evolving narrative for the memory and ownership of the Battle of Jadotville.&quot;  The report suggests that &quot;some views ... are the product of incorrect information and grandstanding for effect&quot;.  That language is insulting because there was unity within this House and at local authority level.  At a meeting of Wexford County Council, the motion in support of the veterans of Jadotville was tabled by Councillor Garry Laffan.  In Kilkenny, the motion was tabled by Councillor Joe Malone.  They are former members of the Defence Forces and that is why they tabled the motions; it was not for a political reason.</p><p>My interest in this matter was sparked by the Reverend Mark Hayden in Gorey, where I am from.  He organises a remembrance service every year for all those who served in uniform.  He brought down Mr. Declan Power in 2005, soon after his book had been published.  That engaged people.  The film directed by Richie Smyth, based on that book, engaged the public far more.  I accept that poetic licence was taken in the film.  However, the story of those men had to be told.  This was not done out of any bad motivation.  It was about telling a story about our peacekeeping tradition, a story of which we are all proud.  I know from talking to some of the veterans of Jadotville, and members of the Defence Forces and veterans more generally, that they feel passionately that this story should be told.  This State tried to suppress that story for a long time.  </p><p>Credit should also be given to Mr. Ronan McGreevy of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He was one of a number of journalists who continued to raise and tell that story.  All that anybody here ever wanted was for that story to be told, that bravery and gallantry to be recognised, and the State to apologise and give some form of recognition to those veterans.  I am disappointed at the basis of the findings of the report.</p><p>We can take learnings, going forward.  The apology is important, as are the welfare issues.  I take it that the Minister will sincerely work to address those issues.  How we treat our Defence Forces more generally is an issue about which people are passionate.  I look forward to the Minister ensuring that our Defence Forces and peacekeepers get the recognition they deserve.  More than anything else, what is coming out of this House during this debate, as has come out of the House in previous debates during which many of us have raised this issue, is that we can say to the brave men of Jadotville that regardless of whether this report recommends medals, we recognise their gallantry and bravery.  We are forever in debt to the contribution those people made to Irish peacekeeping and in ensuring that the strong role the Defence Forces have played internationally will always be recognised.</p></speech>

I thank him for coming to the House.  It is important to welcome the apology he gave on behalf of the Government in his opening statement.  I acknowledge the effort he has made previously in commissioning this report.</p> <p>We live in a democracy and the Defence Forces are there to defend our democracy.  Senators, Deputies and councillors are elected to represent the views of the people within our democracy.  I take issue with comments in the report.  I went back to the comments I made during a debate last November.  I was one of the last people to speak at that time.  I said I agreed with the numerous comments that had been made and that it was up to the military, and not politicians, to decide the matter of who receives medal.  "We need to right a wrong", I said, "it is as simple as that".  The common theme when we last discussed the matter was that we politicians were not there to interfere.  The comments in the report are disappointing.</p> <p>There has been disappointment in my local constituency, particularly in the Athlone area from which many of the men came.  I welcome the recommendations to erect a plaque in Custume Barracks.  I welcome the State ceremony that is to take place on the 60th anniversary.  I welcome the supports that are going to be put in place, particularly for &Oacute;glaigh N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na h&Eacute;ireann, ONE.  I wish to recognise the work it does across the country, particularly in my own county.  It is also important to remember the 156 men from A Company and thank them for their service to our country.  I particularly thank Private Sean Dowler from my own parish who was one of those 156 men.  It is important to remember all the members of the Defence Forces who have given their lives to serving the country.  </p> <p>I was asked by Senator Joe O'Reilly to add a comment he did not have time to make.  Former soldiers have said to him that they feel medals should only be given to officers.</p></speech>

I believe the Seanad should have a special debate, as has been proposed, on the 60th anniversary of the siege of Jadotville in September.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Cathaoirleach:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The terms of reference of the report, issued by the Minister's Department, are as follows:</p><blockquote>	a. The Review Group will consider ONUC&rsquo;s operational environment in Katanga, and in particular Elisabethville and Jadotville;<br /><br />b. The Review Group will consider the historical evidence and processes in relation to all recommendations for military medals received with respect to the events at Jadotville or encompassing Jadotville;<br /><br />c. The Review Group will engage with national and international stakeholders (including Jadotville veterans) as appropriate, with a view to uncovering any additional or new evidence in this case;<br /><br />d. The Review Group may consider the actions of individuals not already the subject of a recommendation for a medal in respect of Jadotville;<br /><br />e. The Review Group will report its findings to the Chief of Staff.  The Review Group may make recommendations in relation to possible awards in respect of Jadotville. </blockquote><p>Such were the terms of reference.  I go to page 360 of the report and I see the heading: &quot;A new public and political campaign for medals&quot;. It states that: &quot;A campaign to lobby local and national politicians to award Jadotville medals began in earnest in February 2019&quot;.  In our job, we get lobbied all the time.  That is appropriate; people should lobby us.  Members often take up causes.  A number of current and former Members are mentioned in chapter 11.  They include Eamon Scanlon, Deputies Chambers and Keogh, as well as too many councillors to name.  It makes the following point: &quot;The rekindled medals campaign became a convenient way to attack the government and attack senior levels in the Defence Forces.&quot;  With regard to that comment and other elements of the chapter, the Minister can safely say that is not in the terms of reference of the review.  I am from County Kerry and so is Pat Quinlan.  There is a monument to Pat Quinlan between Derrynane and Waterville.  If the Minister is ever on the Ring of Kerry, I ask him to stop by.  I am sure Pat Quinlan would rather all his men get medals than he get one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-15a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071500002#SSS00200"><p>I thank all Senators for their contributions.  It is an emotive issue and many people have invested time and effort into raising concerns about Jadotville and, more important, how people were treated when they returned.  No Defence Forces member should be vilified upon returning from serving in an overseas mission but that happened to far too many in the aftermath of Jadotville.</p> <p>The State is making an apology this evening for how people were treated.  We are rewriting history in terms of the wrongs that were done and, at least in our words, we are recognising what should not have happened but did, and the lessons we have learned from that.  I hope the substance of what is happening this evening is not lost in the debate, despite the frustrations many have expressed about the report.</p> <p>It is useful that the House is committing to another debate in September or at some point in the future.  I ask people to take the time over the summer to read the report in full.  I am conscious of the fact that I only made it available today, a few hours before the debate.  Much of the criticism of the report, certainly that I saw on social media, was within 40 minutes of its being made available.  Clearly, people were disappointed some things were not in the report or that they could not find them, but I hope people read the report in full if they get a chance, rather than just the 45 pages of executive summary, which is a large executive summary.  I have read not all but a lot of the report.  There is a lot of substance in the report and a lot of direct language.  I understand that has made people bristle in this House.  There was criticism of some public representatives' approach and the suggested motivation of statements they have made.</p> <p>I appeal to people not to make this issue about us as public representatives, as a House or as local authority members.  I understand the criticism but the focus must be on the issue, the families and the veterans, so we learn lessons from serious mistakes that should not have happened and ensure we change systems in our Defence Forces and in our governance structures to make sure the recommendations in the report, some of which are outside the terms of reference, are given serious consideration.  We can learn lessons from the report.  It is an outlining of history as well as a blunt critique of some of the commentary around Jadotville.  The report questions the accuracy of what some have said at different times.  It does not surprise me that people have pushed back on some of that language.</p> <p>It is evident the report has not been written for political popularity.  I think it was written on the basis of trying to establish facts through a blunt use of language.  Some of the recommendations are strong and the criticism of the politicians, the Defence Forces and the way people were treated are equally strong and given in blunt terms.  Terms like "vilification" and "whispering campaign" are used and there are references to the destruction of the relationship between men and the Defence Forces and the State.  It is powerful, hard-hitting language and we can learn a lot from it.  Some will question and disagree with the recommendations, as is their right.</p> <p>I deliberately have not dealt with each recommendation in terms of how I intend to respond to it because a report of nearly 500 pages needs time to consider and digest.  We can take what is strong, positive and powerful from this report, question the areas that need to be challenged and questioned, should that arise, and, most important, learn lessons and adopt recommendations.</p> <p>A number of things need to be said.  The awarding of medals must be within a military system.  I think everybody agrees with that.  However, the treatment of men and women in the Defence Forces is not just about the military system.  It is my job as Minister for Defence to ensure we train, support and respect members of our Defence Forces past and present, in terms of the challenges we ask of them.  I will respond to the report in as ambitious a way as I can as a Minister in terms of learning lessons from the recommendations and, in particular, in how we treat our veterans, which has improved dramatically in recent decades.  This is not to say it cannot continue to improve.</p> <p>The recommendation in the report around setting up a commissioner for veterans is something I am discussing with our team in the Department of Defence and will discuss with the incoming Chief of Staff in a few months' time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Let us focus also on some of the positive aspects of this report.  This report asks some hard questions of us in some pretty tough language and, of course, it is our job to be constructively critical of a report of this scale, substance and breadth.  We have to focus on the substance of the issues, rather than on some of the criticisms of ourselves.  We must also focus on accuracy, which is important to the credibility of how we deal with this issue.  This is a significantly emotive issue but we must match the emotion and the responsibility that comes with that with historical accuracy.</p><p>I will happily interact with this House and it would be very useful were we to take the time over the next number of weeks - because we will get some time then hopefully - to carefully study this report.  I will be happy to speak to anybody individually on it as to any concerns he or she may have and perhaps we may come back as a collective to discuss it.  At that point, I as a Minister will be able to provide a great deal more detail as to how we can respond to some of the good recommendations in this report and what we can do, separate to this report, in having a State commemoration for those who served in Jadotville, which is also one of the report's recommendations.  </p><p>It is not fair to say there is nothing in this report that recognises the significant contribution of our Defence Forces in the battle of Jadotville.</p><p>The other thing to say is that this report makes a strong effort to try to create the context around Jadotville, which was not an isolated battle.  It was part of a much broader and extremely complex peacekeeping mission that resulted in much tragedy.  In fact, men trying to reach our Defence Forces personnel in Jadotville died while trying to cross a bridge but being unable to reach Commandant Quinlan and those serving under him.  There are many such stories that also need to be recognised in the context of this broader story.  There are many lessons to be learned.  This is undoubtedly a hard-hitting report and one that does raise the hackles of the political system and I ask people to take some time to read what is a detailed report and let us then come back and have an equally blunt conversation in how we respond to it as policymakers, and in my case, as a member of the Government and Minister for Defence.</p><p>Finally, to all of those who served in Jadotville and to their families who are now representing their interests, I say it is because we value their contribution and are genuinely sorry about what happened to them when they came home that we want to learn lessons from that, to ensure that it does not happen to another generation of Irish soldiers at any point in the future.  It is because we continue to take their stories seriously that I asked for this report to be produced, that we have produced specific medals for Jadotville in An Bonn Jadotville, as well as citations and scrolls that families and individuals have received.  I am aware that is not the same as a distinguished service medal, DSM, and I know what that means to soldiers.  </p><p>I also note that as we speak, the structures required to put a medals board in place to look at the potential awarding of a DSM to Commandant Quinlan are being set up.  Were he to receive that, he would not only be receiving it on behalf of himself and of the leadership he showed but would be receiving it on behalf of the contribution of all who served around him.  That is also made clear in this report.  In response to Senator Carrigy, I know and accept that is not enough for many people but there are positives in this report.  There are also things on which we need to reflect over the summer and I certainly look forward to coming back to this House at the appropriate time when we can continue this debate.</p></speech>
