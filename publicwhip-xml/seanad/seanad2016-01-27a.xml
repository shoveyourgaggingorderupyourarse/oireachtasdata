This issue relates to sewer pipes in very old estates.  Some estates were constructed as recently as 40 years ago, but others are much older.  I have come across examples in Ashbourne, Duleek and Drogheda.  The issue concerns sewer pipes that become blocked from time to time due to inadequate infrastructure put in place at the time in  the 1970s, 1960s or even the 1930s.  If the pipes in one house are blocked, the pipes in the whole street can also become blocked.  Until Irish Water was formed, the local authorities used to regularly clear sewer pipes on behalf of residents.  Since responsibility for water and sewage services was removed from local authorities, in general, Irish Water refuses to clear sewer pipes.</p> <p>There are cases in which people have to clear a blockage in their systems.  However, the blockage is not on theirs but on someone else's property and nothing can be done about it.  This is a very serious issue which tends to affect older residents who have been in their houses for a long time.  It is not a problem that affects newer estates as much.  This is a responsibility local authorities had taken on for many years, but it did follow through to Irish Water.  It is essential that some direction be given to it, specifically in estates where this work was always done by the local authority.  It is not possible for someone to deal with a problem caused down the street; it has to be dealt with centrally by the public authorities.</p></speech>

As the House will be aware, the Government, local authorities and Irish Water are continuing to deliver on an ambitious transformation programme in the water services sector.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provided for local authorities to act as agents of Irish Water, with this relationship being expressed through service level agreements.  Through these 12-year agreements, local authorities are utilising their experience and expertise in asset management and operations to provide services on behalf of Irish Water.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This expertise is being combined with the considerable network and utility management experience available to Irish Water.  The agreements are based on partnership, continuous improvement and the delivery of efficiencies.</p><p>Each service level agreement, SLA, in place with a local authority is supported by an annual service plan which reflects the required programme of transformation for that authority.  It also outlines agreed objectives and standards of performance, set against a budget covering headcount, goods and services and investment in the forthcoming year.  Annual service plans encompass a set of operational objectives, key performance indicators and a related budget, including payroll.  These plans set out the context for the delivery of water services for each local authority for a given year.</p><p>The Water Services Act 2007 sets down the obligations and responsibilities of water services authorities and property owners in respect of water infrastructure.  Sections 43 and 54 provide that a property owner is responsible for the maintenance and replacement of any water or wastewater pipes, connections or distribution systems connected within the boundary of his or her property.  This was the case also prior to the transfer of responsibility for public water services from the local authorities to Irish Water.</p><p>However, local authorities, at their own discretion, may have undertaken clearance works in respect of common wastewater infrastructure on private property in the past.  These works were not a requirement of the law pertaining at the time and not every local authority would have provided such services.</p><p>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 transferred responsibility for the maintenance and repair of pipes and combined drains under publicly owned roadways and pathways to Irish Water while responsibility for storm water sewers remained with local authorities.  The position, as set out in legislation, provides clarity on the responsibility for the maintenance of common sewerage pipes.</p><p>Notwithstanding the legal position, I recognise the importance of the local authorities and Irish Water working together to agree operational guidelines on this and other boundary type matters, so as to provide clarity to householders as to the services which they can expect to receive from Irish Water, working in partnership with the local authorities under the SLA arrangements.  Against this background, further legislation in this area is not envisaged.</p></speech>

Hopefully, the situation will resolve itself after the general election.  The Minister of State has come a bit of the way from what Ministers have said before.  It seems the Minister of State is not saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this but is not saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; either.  She is merely saying that local authorities and Irish Water should work together.  Is this not what the Minister of State and her boss, the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, should say to Irish Water, namely, sort this out with the local authorities where it was done before?  Clearly, there are problematic estates dotted around the country, usually at least 40 years old and some are ex-local authority and not all privately built.  They need this occasional service which was always provided to continue.  These people simply cannot understand, now that they are paying for water and sewage charges, why this is not provided.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State get the local authorities and the Irish Water - the staff of which will be transferred back to local authorities after the election - to knock heads together to get this done?  It is mainly elderly people in general who are affected by this.</p></speech>

The recent floods have thrown up anomalies in these areas and about who has responsibility for this and that.  When I was on Kilkenny County Council - it is the same in Carlow - the local authority did not have responsibility for water pipes on private property.  It was the owners who had responsibility in that respect.</p> <p>The Senator might speak to the director of services at his local authority to examine how this could work in the future.  If the Senator&rsquo;s party gets into government after the next general election and abolishes Irish Water, he could do all of these things in the future.</p></speech>

While not wishing in any way to undermine the Minister of State's position, it is regrettable the senior Minister is not here to take this matter.</p><p>This matter is to discuss the outcome of a report from the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces appeal of redress of wrongs, June 2015.  I acknowledge the work done by the senior Minister for the Defence Forces.  As was remarked in the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, <i>SIGNAL</i>magazine in December, the senior Minister has been recognised as an advocate, not just for members of the Defence Forces but for those who served in uniform in this country.  The Minister of State has been to many an event involving the Defence Forces and I know both Ministers hold the Defence Forces in high esteem.</p><p>Having said that, however, I find it regrettable that the same cannot be said of some of the Department&rsquo;s officials who seem unaware, even indifferent, to the needs of those who serve.  We are joined in the Gallery by the complainant in the case I have raised.  I am honoured and proud to represent him, given that he has given more than 40 years of distinguished service as a commissioned officer.  The case I am referring to is not of the Minister of State&rsquo;s making but arises from a simple but devastating administrative error.  It was a simple mathematical error, an error which forced a man who served this country with distinction to retire two years early from his post as a lieutenant colonel in the Permanent Defence Forces, when, in fact, he should have gone on to serve two more years at the rank of colonel.</p><p>The commissioned officer's service commenced in 1972 and he continued to serve until he was retired forcibly in 2013.  The case concerns a competition for promotion which was held in the spring of 2012.  At that time, the officer in question was serving in Kosovo as an acting colonel.  Following the interview process, the officer in question was placed 11th in the order of merit.  The top nine applicants were promoted.</p><p>As part of the interview process, candidates were awarded marks under several headings, one of which was length of service.  As was his right, the officer in question sought an analysis of the marks to be satisfied that all marks were awarded correctly.  On examination, he found that two of candidates were erroneously awarded marks to which they were not entitled.  The officer in question complained to his superiors that an error had been made with respect to the awarding of marks in respect of length of service.  Had length of service marks been awarded correctly to all applicants, two of the applicants originally placed ahead of the complainant would have been ranked below this officer and he would have been placed ninth.  As such, he would have been promoted to the rank of colonel.</p><p>The military authorities rejected the officer's complaint, stating it was without foundation and that all marks were correctly awarded.  Dissatisfied with this response and having completed the internal redress process, the officer in question referred the matter to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, as was his right.  Before his retirement, the ombudsman was a military judge, equalled only by a judge of the High Court.  Furthermore, the ombudsman had, prior to his appointment as a military judge, been Deputy Judge Advocate General, making him the most senior military legal authority at that time.  We can all agree the ombudsman was not only charged with adjudicating on the matter but was well qualified to do so.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

Two applicants were placed above this man and as a result, he was not promoted.  The ombudsman's recommendation was that the administrative error should be acknowledged with a suitable expression of regret, that appropriate acknowledgement and appreciation of the complainant's long distinguished service in the Defence Forces be offered to him and that a gesture in respect of the wrong suffered by the complainant would be appropriate, having regard to the consequences of the administrative error for the complainant and the range of discretions available to the Minister.  The consequences of the administrative error are massive for this officer.  He has lost two years service as a colonel with all the salary conditions appropriate to the post.  He has lost out on a considerable amount with respect to the gratuity difference between the lump sum for a lieutenant colonel and a colonel.  He has suffered an enduring loss of pension with respect to the difference between the pension of a colonel and a lieutenant colonel.  In addition, the officer would have been entitled to apply for and possibly would have served overseas at a rank senior to that of colonel, an acting rank, which would have had a considerable impact on his pension entitlements.  </p> <p>There is more that I need to say.  As I am under pressure from the Acting Chairman, I am not going to push my luck.  This is a very serious case.  I hope, once we have concluded our debate, that he will agree to meet the officer in question, who is here, and have a brief word with him.  I thank the Acting Chairman to whom I apologise for pushing my luck.</p></speech>

The submission was in the form of an appeal from redress of wrongs made under section 114 of the Defence Act 1954, on foot of the considered findings of the Chief of Staff that the complainant had not been wronged in the view of the Defence Forces.</p> <p>The complaint was made to the ombudsman's office on the 18 February 2013.  The complainant alleges that he was wronged by an administrative error in a promotion competition held in 2012 and as a consequence, he was not promoted to the next higher rank with consequential implications relating to retirement on age grounds, gratuity and pension entitlement.  By way of background, it should be noted that changes were introduced to the 2011 promotion scheme for officers which was held in March 2012.  These changes were introduced following detailed negotiation and agreement with the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers under Conciliation and Council Report No. 447, CCR 447.  This agreement, signed by both management and staff representatives, set out revised arrangements to be applied in respect of the application of length of service marks.  A key objective in concluding this agreement was the introduction of objective assessment for promotion on merit and the elimination of seniority as a primary basis for officer promotions.</p> <p>Changes in terms and conditions and procedural arrangements, having been agreed at conciliation council, are then transposed into the standing administrative instructions issued by the Chief of Staff.  As will be appreciated by Senators, the transposition of such agreed arrangements through the industrial relations process into administrative arrangements can take time.  Nevertheless, it is the agreement reached through the conciliation and arbitration process which must take precedence.</p> <p>In this case, the relevant accompanying Defence Forces administrative instructions had not been updated at the time of the competition.  While this may be a cause of concern, it is not without precedence.  However, I can reasonably say that the revised arrangements under CCR 447 were well signalled to all members of the Defence Forces and well in advance of the promotion competition.</p> <p>In his final report, the ombudsman concluded that the promotion competition process was administered in a procedurally unfair manner as, in his view, there was ambiguity in relation to the provisions regarding length of service marks.  In addition to his findings, the ombudsman made a range of recommendations arising from this case.</p> <p>The recommendations of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces are under active consideration.  I am advised that the matter may require obtaining advices from the Office of the Attorney General before any decision on the matter can be made and the issue of such advice is also under active consideration.  In the light of the above, the House will appreciate, it would be not appropriate for me to comment further on this particular case at this point in time.</p></speech>

It is grossly unfair that this man has had his life put on hold while he waits for an apology to redress the wrong that has been done to him.  He had 40 years service not only in this country but abroad where he served with distinction and bravery.  He came under fire in the Lebanon and in other parts of the world.  This man is entitled to full and prompt action.  This issue is going on since March 2014 and the final report is more than seven months old.

I was prompted by comments made by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs at the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child where he said that children who grow up in households where parents are effectively precluded from paid work will struggle to be included in mainstream society in any meaningful way.  We know that household joblessness can lead to the transmission of poverty from one generation to the next.  Good social policy and a strong expression of children's rights give every child the opportunity to realise their full potential.  Obviously, we know from our own experience, as politicians, and from all the studies carried out that lone parents - often the mother who struggles and makes a lifetime of sacrifices to rear the child, often without any support from the father - have more challenging, economic and social issues during their life because of that experience.  </p> <p>I am also prompted by the Minister's comments with regard to reducing the waiting time for a couple seeking divorce to be reduced.  This does not fit well with other comments the Minister has made with regard to the importance placed on marriage.  I think the position is that a couple must be living apart for four out of the last five years.  In this regard, there is a necessity to underpin marriage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jim Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1982"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1982&amp;amp;pid=JimWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To some extent it is surprising that two people, a man and a woman, might come together when young, fall in love, get married and spend their lives together.  It is a bit of a phenomenon in its own way.  It is a bedrock to society when this happens.  In the Western world there has been an increasing propensity for separation and divorce but in this country only approximately 250,000 people are separated or divorced.  The Minister might correct me if I am wrong.  We have not had the level of divorce and separation that we have seen in other countries and we should try to preserve that level.</p><p>The studies I mentioned are very interesting and I presume the Minister or her officials will examine them.  I just picked the one from Pennsylvania State University, whose scholars began the inquiry conscious of decades of research, producing evidence that parental divorce is negatively associated with offspring outcomes from early childhood through adolescence and into adult years.  It indicates that children who experience parental divorce before age seven, for example, manifest significantly more behavioural problems at age 11.  It is a good and balanced report.  The report of the Swedish university is quite interesting as it is research from a number of years back.  It indicates that during the 20th century, divorce rates have increased substantially in most cities in the Western world and it has been demonstrated that parental divorce is associated with several negative outcomes in children.  The research has demonstrated that children who experienced parental divorce generally reported lower psychological well-being than children from intact families.  The report also demonstrates that a cohort of women in their mid 50s coming from families of divorced or separated parents experienced greater challenges in that area when compared with those who came from intact families.  One finding illustrates that contrary to expectation, data do not show that the association between parental divorce in childhood and psychological problems in adulthood diminish significantly over time.  Particularly in the challenging times in which we live, society as a whole needs to try to underpin the importance of initiatives to preserve, support and incentivise this bedrock of society.</p></speech>

The Senator is aware that there are very substantial legal protections and recognition for the family based on marriage at both constitutional and statutory level.  These are recognised not only in our family law code itself but also in our tax codes and in a variety of State benefits provided to spouses.  The State recognises the value of a stable and loving marital family and the immense benefits that it brings to society as a whole, particularly to the children of the family.  However, it is a sad fact that serious marital differences may arise and cannot always be addressed other than by separation or, ultimately, divorce.  The Irish people decided in 1996 that there should be constitutional provision for divorce in cases of irretrievable marital breakdown.  However, as the Senator noted, it is interesting that 20 years later, our divorce and judicial separation rates remain low by international standards.  Annual rates of divorce and separation also appear to be relatively stable, which I welcome.  The data would not suggest a significant upsurge in demand for divorce in this country, and as the Senator indicated, that runs contrary to what is happening in many other places.</p> <p>The State undertakes a series of initiatives to support couples experiencing marital difficulties.  It continues to fund both marriage counselling services to assist couples in rebuilding their relationships, which are very important, along with mediation services.  There is much potential for mediation and I would like to see that service developed.  The mediation Bill is very close to completion and will be very important.  Many people are interested in seeing the development of that mediation service around the country.</p> <p>Where the relationship has broken down and the parties seek separation or divorce as the only viable option, mediation can also assist in reaching agreements on the terms of the separation or divorce, helping to reduce parental conflict.  I am familiar with many studies in the area and if we can reduce that level of conflict, no matter what the couple decide to do with respect to the conflict, there will be beneficial effects for children.  As the Senator rightly highlighted in the studies, we know that conflict in the home - marital or otherwise - has detrimental effects on children.  We need to do everything we can to help with difficulties if parents are staying together and if they are separating, we must help them to do so in a way that would have least impact on the children.  It is vital to maintain the best interests of the child.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, key elements of which I commenced on 18 January 2016, provides a new statutory framework to consider the best interests of the child and allow the views of the child to be taken into account, whether directly or through a report by a child's views expert.</p> <p>The question of income was raised by the Senator.  It is clear that post-divorce, many families will suffer some reduction in income.  There are many supports available, as we know, including the one-parent family payment, family income supplement or the back-to-work family dividend.  With regard to the reports mentioned by the Senator, it is difficult to transpose their findings directly to the Irish context and we have limited research in this country at this point.  I have no doubt that there will be more in the years to come on the impact of divorce on children.  We have the first wave of data from the Growing up in Ireland study and information on separated families became available in 2014.  There was a discussion in the document about the impact of the parental marital status.  The authors of the report indicated there are "important implications for policies which promote marriage as the key to child development as it appears that much of the benefits of marriage are not related to marriage ... but to the socioeconomic background of mothers".  That is an interesting point in the Irish context.</p> <p>The Government has undertaken a series of reforms of family law to respond to the positions of families across a range of situations, reflecting a very broad commitment to supporting families, which is very important.  Marital breakdown and divorce are realities of modern Irish life and there is a right to divorce enshrined in our Constitution.  We need to ensure that any negative impacts on the children are mitigated as much as possible.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned child poverty and the best way out of poverty is to have a job.  This Government's focus on the creation of jobs and supporting families is clearly one of the best ways of challenging poverty.  We have had success in the creation of more jobs and there has been a very high number of jobless families in this country, both marital and non-marital.  That puts enormous stress on people.  The focus on economic recovery and jobs is very significant, not just with respect to a family's material position but also in a psychological aspect.</p></speech>

Joblessness is certainly an issue and, unfortunately, it is often a consequence of divorce and separation.  One of the partners - it is usually the woman with children, especially if she has worked in the home - may find it difficult to cope financially.  The problem is that the cycle must be broken.  As the Minister correctly stated, children of jobless people or those in poverty are more likely to end up in poverty and jobless.  The issue must be tackled.</p> <p>The reports indicate that even where there are no financial issues for children and they are not affected by poverty, there is a mental scar nonetheless.  I know about the constitutional right to divorce and the Minister correctly indicated that if there is a large conflict between the married parties, keeping them together would not be a panacea for themselves or the children.  That is a reality.  Where young children are involved, it particularly behoves us to try to encourage couples to go for counselling and repair the relationship that may have broken down.  We should assist them as long-term consequences for children come into play if they break up.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jim Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1982"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1982&amp;amp;pid=JimWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have always held the view that once a person marries, he or she has a responsibility, in particular, to his or her children and partner.  People should strive to fulfil that particular obligation for as long as possible.</p><p>On counselling, it is important that services are improved and increased.  We should try to maintain Ireland's position in being well below international levels of marriage breakdown and seek to be a leader in this regard.  From a purely fiscal point of view, the cost to the State and the taxpayer of marriage breakdown is astronomical, be it in social housing provision, providing social welfare benefits or dealing with consequent behavioural problems that may arise as a result of marriage breakdown or divorce and children not having a father or a mother involved in their upbringing.  I encourage the Minister and her successor to do everything they can to ensure best practice in this regard is followed in this country.</p></speech>

The development of high quality universal services in child care can and will be extremely supportive of families.  Anything that reduces the pressures on individuals and families will be of benefit to the lives of children.  We must do all we can to improve people's economic circumstanes, but that is not to suggest this is a panacea to the problem because people can still have difficulties, even if there are no economic issues involved.  However, economic circumstances have been an extra pressure on families in recent years.  Continuing to focus on economic recovery and job creation will be of great support to families because the stresses associated with unemployment are a huge factor in accelerating the pressures that can lead to marriage breakdown.</p></speech>

We will have the opportunity tomorrow evening to debate the outcome of the report in the House but I wish to say at the outset that I was glad to have the opportunity to be involved in it and to work with Senator O'Keeffe, Senator Michael D'Arcy and Senator Barrett.  I thank specifically my own colleagues, Senator Bradford and Senator Norris, for their support for my nomination to participate in the inquiry.  At the time - not to open old wounds - we had an unseemly issue in the House where there was an attempt to have a different membership of the committee from that determined by the committee of selection.  Over the last two years or so the people on the inquiry have worked very hard in trying to produce today's report, which, it must be said, was done against a backdrop of an Act that was totally inadequate.  I hope that the Houses and the next administration in particular will take on board the many recommendations of the report in the context of what needs to be done to ensure that no inquiry is hampered in the way that this one has been over the course of the last number of years in terms of its ability to make findings, its investigative abilities and so on.</p> <p>It is worth noting that no Member of either House wore his or her political jersey in the inquiry.  However, from a Fianna F&aacute;il perspective, in advance of the inquiry, we called for it to be established in the manner of the Leveson inquiry in the UK, free from the electoral cycle, which, as we all know, ultimately played a part in the somewhat rushed finish to the banking inquiry's work.  Notwithstanding all of the difficulties relating to the process, the trials going on elsewhere which limited the capacity of the inquiry to carry out its investigative work and the restrictions of the Act itself-----</p></speech>

I have had concerns about the influence of external bodies on the inquiry process, the way in which a whistleblower's protected disclosure was dealt with and how the Houses of the Oireachtas Service then sought to throw that whistleblower under a bus.

I know we will have an opportunity to debate it tomorrow.  Many colleagues will be looking at the process of conducting the inquiry and recommendations that apparently will be in the report as to how the legislation could be improved to ensure the processes are more efficient and streamlined.  I commend the four Senators on the committee of inquiry along with their colleagues in the D&aacute;il on all their hard work.  Preliminary reports indicate that it is very critical of the ECB, the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.  We will have time to debate that tomorrow.</p> <p>I hope we will debate not only what led to this banking crash, but also mechanisms to ensure that a crash of this sort does not happen again, looking in particular at the linkage between regulatory law and criminal law.  Perhaps not enough attention is paid to that.  I am conscious that the Law Reform Commission is currently seeking submissions on the issue with a view to the possibility of introducing new criminal offences, such as that introduced in the UK in 2013, the offence of recklessness leading to a decision causing a bank to fail, and such as the practice of deferred prosecution agreements in the US whereby co-operation of individuals working in banking is sought and obtained in return for an agreement to defer any prosecution.</p> <p>We also need to consider the possible prosecution of a crime of financial treason, which was suggested by some Labour Party colleagues at the time of the crash.  This issue should be explored along with the text and recommendations of the banking inquiry report.</p> <p>I remind colleagues that Senator Cahill is hosting an event in Buswell's Hotel at 1 o'clock today to which all are invited.  It is a briefing from three organisations working on the front line of supporting victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence.  They are the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, One in Four and Women's Aid.</p> <p>I commend Senator Noone who yesterday on the Commencement raised the issue of a no-fry zone.  This is an issue that is getting a great deal of support, particularly from parents.  It seeks new planning regulations to ensure that chip shops cannot be located within 500 m of a school.  This is part of a drive for healthier living and healthier eating among children in order to tackle the very worrying levels of obesity.  I commend the Senator on raising it and lend my support to the many parents' groups supporting the no-fry zone campaign.</p></speech>

On the day when we are looking forward to the publication of the report of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, it is interesting that the advice of Mr. Birnie was that the design faults of the euro made it a currency that he advised the authorities in Northern Ireland not to join.  It is purely coincidental that he is here today, but his words will have a certain resonance.</p> <p>As Senator MacSharry said, all the members of the committee of inquiry co-operated.  I thank Members for the nominations the House gave to the four of us.  The Senate was well represented.  We dealt with widespread institutional failure in Dublin, Brussels and Frankfurt.  The final witness we had was the Minister, Deputy Noonan, who said he was warned that burden sharing would result in a bomb going off in Dublin.</p> <p>Would the banks do the same all over again?  I believe that concern is inherent in what Senator Bacik said.  The kind of regulation of banks that the new Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Philip Lane, explained to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday will be very important in the years ahead.  I fear that without a strong line being held by Professor Lane, the banks would do exactly the same all over again and I worry about the newspaper property supplements getting increasingly bigger.  There must be other ways for the economy to prosper than by buying and selling each other's houses.</p> <p>I express condolence to the family of Alex Ryan from Millstreet.  He was the young man who died in Cork last week owing to drugs being present at a party.  Yesterday the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, was in the House to deal with anti-drugs legislation pertaining to transport.  We must always be vigilant in that regard and support measures to protect our young people.  In expressing our condolences to his family, I praise their generosity.  Four other people will be alive because of their generosity in donating their son's organs for transplant.</p></speech>

The publication of its report today is to be welcomed.  As Senator Barrett has said, the report has highlighted widespread institutional failures, both internally and externally.  Hopefully, the many recommendations of the report will be implemented, resulting in a much more robust banking sector that will serve the State well.  I compliment everyone involved in bringing the report to fruition, albeit with its shortcomings as a result of time constraints.</p> <p>I welcome yesterday's announcement of the Government's commitment to investment in public nursing homes.  A total of 90 facilities will be upgraded and refurbished in the next five years.  It is probably the most comprehensive programme of investment in public nursing homes in the history of the State.  The plan provides for the replacement of 33 existing facilities and the refurbishment or extension of 57 others.  The programme of investment will deliver 215 additional beds in centres being built or refurbished.  The 90 facilities between them will have 4,723 beds.</p> <p>Of some that were in the news in recent times, I particularly welcome that the future of the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon has been secured as a result of the investment commitment.  I very much welcome the investment in the community nursing unit in Tuam, following lobbying by the people in east County Galway.  It is evidence that the Government intends to bring all the facilities up to HIQA standards by 2021 during the lifetime of the current capital investment programme.  We should support the programme and welcome it as a very positive development.</p></speech>

I know the Leader will be supportive of the publication of the national anthem copyright and related matters (amendment) Bill.  I would like that item to be taken before No. 1 to give leave for it to be published.  I spoke about the matter previously.  It is important that anything to do with the State and nation be protected and the national anthem is one of those.  I ask for an amendment to the Order of Business in that regard.</p> <p>I support my colleague, Senator MacSharry, on the banking inquiry report.  Many of its findings will make for uncomfortable reading in European Union institutions - its findings in that regard are strong and forthright - but also among the commentariat which had a singular view as to who was responsible for the banking crisis.  The narrative needs to change in that regard.  In reality we now find that the regulator, the Central Bank and most importantly the banks lied to the people.  The banks misled the Government and did not tell the truth.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If the truth had been told at the time and if the proper information had been given to the late Minister, Brian Lenihan, and the previous Government, then different decisions would have been made and there would have been a different outcome.  The blackmail to which the previous Government and the Irish people were subjected as a result of the treatment visited upon them by the EU will be remembered in Ireland.  Members should bear in mind that a day will come when there might be another referendum on the EU and the Irish people will have long memories in that regard.  They will not forget our treatment by the EU and there will be long-term consequences because people in this country have lost faith in the European Union as a result of its treatment of us.  We were treated as a very small player in a very big financial crisis-----</p></speech>

I congratulate them on finally managing to publish a report today.  Unfortunately, there are so many dissenting voices that the majority report may only reflect minority opinion.  It will not tell us anything new or anything we did not know already.  We are all well aware of the failings of both the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  We are also well aware that the inquiry was hamstrung by the legislation under which it was established in not being able to make any findings of fact or recommendations against any individual.  That said, I welcome the debate the Leader has arranged on the report.  Please God, there will be aspects of the recommendations made that will be useful in the future.</p> <p>I very much welcome the announcement of the details of the &euro;298 million investment programme for this year for regional and local roads.  The funding package will allow approximately 2,000 km of regional and local roads to be maintained and improved during the year.  I welcome, in particular, the inclusion in the programme of the long-awaited Dingle inner relief road.</p></speech>

I compliment my colleague, Senator Barrett, on his participation in this important report and also the other Members of the Seanad, particularly Senator MacSharry.  I was just out of hospital at the time the inquiry was established and it was my vote that put Senator MacSharry onto the inquiry.  I did it very deliberately in order to ensure that there was not a Government majority, that the inquiry could not be used for political purposes and that it would be fully independent.  I was astonished that the media universally picked up that it was a Fianna F&aacute;il plot.  Fianna F&aacute;il was open-mouthed in astonishment when I voted the way I did at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or whatever committee it was.  I would like to put that on the record.</p> <p>I am really saddened and shocked by the fact that certain documents are being retained out of the public view and that others will be destroyed.  That is completely and utterly wrong.</p></speech>

At the very beginning of the financial crisis, I suggested the establishment of a Minister for home security to look after the interests of Irish citizens in maintaining possession of their homes.  However, this was never done.  It is a pity it was never done, particularly in the light of a case in Cork about which I heard about a couple of days ago.  It is typical of a number of similar cases that have occurred.  A woman was a tenant in a house in which she and her husband lived.  Her husband had worked all his life but was injured a year ago and is out sick.  They have two children and assorted pets, animals and this, that and the other.  They had always paid the rent.  They were in receipt of rent supplement and the rent was slightly higher so they paid the difference themselves.  They were tenants in good standing.  There was no blemish on their record but there was a dispute between the landlord and the banks and now the banks are having the family evicted onto the side of the road.  That is utterly shocking.  There is all this blather about 1916 and all the rest of it.  Evictions had ceased in Ireland by 1916 but they have been reintroduced with the support of this Government.</p></speech>

They have put in the effort.  The result might not be exactly what everybody wants because we would all like to see inquiries being able to make findings of fact more than recommendations.  Senator Barrett has issued a separate paper which would make good reading.  I will bring it to the attention of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party because I respect his views.  His approach is preferable to those who jump up and down about the inquiry and say that it should have done something that it could not possibly do because, at every turn, the hands of members were tied behind their backs as a result of threats of legal or other action.  I accept that we must have a separation of powers between the State and the Judiciary but I believe it would be good if we could make available more powers for internal inquiries such as the banking inquiry.  That is something the next Government should consider.</p> <p>I rise today to bring to the attention of the House a problem that has arisen with the mosquito.  Members might not think that we have mosquitoes in Ireland but we do and it has been found that the Zika virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, can cause birth defects.  The virus was previously confined to South American countries but a new case has been found in Denmark and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has issued an alert because three cases have also been identified in the UK.  With the summer Olympics coming up in Brazil, everybody should be warned, especially women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant, who travel on holidays or for work reasons to countries in South America.  The virus can survive in water under plants and can cause birth defects.  Recently, more than 1,000 babies have been born with microcephaly in the countries affected.  A person in Denmark is currently being treated.  There is no cure but the condition can be prevented.  Caution is advised.  I raise this issue because there are mosquitoes in Ireland.  I do not intend to scare people, because the Zika virus in not present in this country, but there are three cases of the virus in the UK and citizens should be on the alert and make sure when they travel that they have protection against mosquitoes.</p></speech>

The least we should do is look towards the European Union Solidarity Fund to help to put in place proper storm defences.  We have had much debate about flooding in recent weeks but there was very heavy rainfall, in particular in the west, in recent days and the flooding and associated problems have not gone away.  I heard about many cases of people who have tried to apply for the humanitarian funds available through the Department of Social Protection who are having great difficulty with that.  They are being asked to jump through an awful lot of hoops and to provide a significant amount of paperwork.  I am informed that the process can be very cumbersome and even discriminatory in certain instances.  We also hear that after having a nice conversation with the Taoiseach about insurance for people in areas that are subject to flooding, the insurance industry has said it will not bother doing anything about the matter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I appreciate that we are in the dying days of this Seanad and Parliament.  However, we should ask for an update from the Government on what it is going to do about an application to the EU Solidarity Fund to relieve flooding in the places where it has occurred and also to put in place proper storm defences to ensure coastal erosion will not happen in the future.  We must ensure we do the work required during the year rather than wait for another winter storm.  We also need to know what can be done under the humanitarian fund to make sure it will be much easier for people who have endured great distress to access it to obtain the funding they need to restore their homes.  There is also the question of what the Government is going to do about the insurance industry.  It needs to take it to task to make sure it will also do its bit to ensure houses can be insured into the future.</p></speech>

Section 15 of the Environmental Protection Act 1992 provides for the immunity of the EPA, while section 16 provides for the indemnification of the director general, directors and other persons in it.  In its in-depth review in 2010 the EPA stated doubts had been expressed about the constitutionality of this immunity and whether it was compatible with obligations arising under the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, also said this immunity should be lifted.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, very kindly came to the House at the end of the debate on the miscellaneous Bill last July and assured me and other Members that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government had confirmed to her that the Department would expedite the completion of the current review and that a comprehensive report on this vital subject would be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas within 90 days of its commencement - 4 November.  There has been no such report presented.  The term of this Seanad is coming to an end and I am very disappointed something so serious was said by the Minister of State, yet I cannot get the Minister to react.  </p> <p>There are people in Aughinish who are miserable.  Only recently I heard from a man in Spanish Point, where the EPA has granted Clare County Council a licence to open a wastewater treatment plant.  Can the Cathaoirleach imagine what it would be like if it was his house?  In October, for the eighth time, raw sewage was running down the road, but because there has been an ongoing dispute, the EPA will not fix the problem.  Let the Cathaoirleach picture himself by the Shannon Estuary.  The ESB's coal-fired station at Moneypoint, County Clare, is one of the 662 most damaging industrial plants across Europea, according to the report of the European Environment Agency; Aughinish Alumina is in second place; while at the top of the triangle there is an incinerator in disguise, a gasification plant planned for the old dump at Gortadroma.  If Senator John Whelan was here, he could tell us about the "Prime Time" expos&eacute; on the plant in Portlaoise.  Every Senator will have witnessed such environmental incidents in his or her county or constituency.  Air quality is becoming a big subject for us and will continue to be in the future.</p> <p>It was stated in the House that the Minister would come to both Houses to present the report mentioned, which was due to be presented on 4 November.  Monday is 1 February.  May I, please, have an answer?</p></speech>

I support Senator Mark Daly's initiative.  I also suggest the decision of the Government on the expiration of copyright in 2014 led to an inquiry by a Department to the Irish Music Rights Organisation, which controls copyright in this country, and a request for further clarification.  I understand the response from IMRO was that it recommended that copyright on the national anthem, Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann, be reintroduced in perpetuity.  Therefore, the Government should move to protect the integrity of the anthem.  I hope this legislation which is simple but would be effective in its execution and content will be accepted by the Government without delay to ensure we protect the integrity of the anthem.  It is no mean proposal.  It is to ensure the anthem will not in any way be besmirched.  I have pleasure, therefore, in seconding the amendment.</p> <p>I also propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that Second Stage of the Corporate Manslaughter Bill 2011 be taken today.  This legislation was recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  I have no doubt, therefore, that it is a Bill the Government will accept.</p></speech>

The comprehensive report on the EPA was to be published on 4 November.  We request that it be published before the end of next week.  We know that once the general election is called, that will be the end of the report and that it will not see the light of day.  I agree with much of what Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said.  In 2008, when I was a county councillor, I said it was either the air or the water that was causing causing and I still believe it today.  That is why it is very important that this comprehensive report be published.</p> <p>I raise an issue I have been raising for five years, namely, medical cards.  It is still very difficult today for somebody to receive a medical card.  There are all kinds of problem when a person rings the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS.  Everything is grand if the person submits the required documentation and does not leave anything out and he or she will receive a decision in about two weeks.  However, if he or she leaves out even one document, the PCRS will send notification that it is required.  However, when it is sent, it goes to a different person.  Then, when we make representations on the issue, somebody from the PCRS will ring us, but it is not the same staff member with whom the applicant has been dealing.  I am dealing with one case in which I had been trying to explain to one PCRS staff member that the family in question were dealing with gambling issues, something about which the PCRS would not know.  However, the next time I looked for further information on the case, I had to deal with somebody else.  I have now dealt with five staff members.  All of the documentation has been sent, yet last week I was told that the PCRS still required more.  I sent the whole lot again and I am now told that the PCRS has enough information and that it can look at the case.  However, I can guarantee the House that when I ring again next week, somebody else will say all of the documentation required has not been received.  When applications for medical cards were dealt with locally, the applicant was dealt with by one person who gathered all of the information required.  Now, it seems, information is required all over the place in the PCRS.  Everybody has a bit of the application and there is no one to join everything up.  It is a serious matter and the Minister needs to sort it out.</p></speech>

I refer to Members who introduce legislation, Private Members' Bills or otherwise, which appears on the Order Paper and then appears to die.  The purpose in introducing Bills is that they will become law at some stage.  The legislative process is not to be used for any other purpose, although it is sometimes misused.  To that end, I have already attempted unsuccessfully to have No. 58 on the Order Paper taken.  Today I would like to have No. 57 on the Order Paper, the Harmful and Malicious Electronic Communications Bill 2015, debated before this term comes to an end.  I know that this is a well meaning and well intended Bill, but it is one which people of a civil libertarian point of view and free speech advocates have been consistently very troubled by because of the potential for abuse, perhaps by a more authoritarian Government than the relatively benign one we have in place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Crown:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2369"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2369&amp;amp;pid=JohnCrown&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For that reason, as the Bill has come this far in this Parliament, there is an obligation on all of us to see it through if it is really seen as important legislation.  If this is the case, let us go ahead and vote it through.  If not, let us vote it down.  Notwithstanding good intentions and everybody's desire to protect the vulnerable, many representations have been made to me from people who have told me that if correctly applied, existing legislation could provide the protection that is necessary and that there is the potential for abuse and the squelching of dissent within this Bill.  I took some fairly substantial criticism, some of it online, when I advocated this position when this Bill was first introduced some months ago.  I could have used this Bill to protect myself from some of this but I would not do so.  Freedom of speech is part of the deal with a democracy.  Part of the deal with free speech is that we hear things we do not want to hear.  People have the freedom to say things that I might not necessarily agree with.  For all of those reasons, I have been asked by people who are free speech advocates to make sure there is one ringing attempt before this Oireachtas is over to have a proper debate on this Bill and to either see it through or see it off.  That is why I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 57 be taken before No. 1.</p></speech>

For some reason, some of the names of Senators on the Government side, who agree with it, are not on it.  That is due to an administrative error on our part and I apologise to colleagues who support it but are not listed.  I hope all sides can support No. 79, motion 19.  The Irish Wind Energy Association is using the words of former US President, John F. Kennedy, when he addressed the Houses of the Oireachtas in a television advertisement.  It is extraordinary that any commercial entity can do that.  The wind industry is particularly contentious at the moment and for it to use the words of anybody in these Houses or any special guest or foreign dignitary in these Houses in television advertising is completely undignified, wrong and an abuse.  </p> <p>The motion calls on the Irish Wind Energy Association to cease using those words and on the Seanad to take action to amend its Standing Orders to prevent this happening in the future.  I do not know whether this issue has been addressed previously.  Clearly, what is said in the Houses is on the record but it certainly never occurred to me that this record could then be used for any commercial purpose, so I hope the Government will find a way to support this or to indicate that action could be taken.  </p> <p>I second Senator Mooney's amendment to the Order of Business concerning the Corporate Manslaughter Bill 2011 but I propose another amendment to the Order of Business that we deal with this issue.  Will the Irish Wind Energy Association stop winding people up by using the words of John F. Kennedy, which were made in a much more inspirational, important and sacred context than that of the Irish Wind Energy Association?  I seek support for this motion to be taken but also ask the Irish Wind Energy Association to take heed of what has been said by Members of this House about the issue.</p></speech>

It concerned environmental issues, particularly in County Meath.  The Senator made it perfectly clear that he was very unhappy with the answers he received this morning.  Councillor Bonner asked me to tell the Senator that there is another public meeting tonight to which he is invited.  </p></speech>

One was a comprehensive report on the greyhound industry while the other was a report on the horse racing industry.  I welcome a number of stakeholders from horse racing here this morning.  They include Mervyn Clarke from the Cavan Equestrian Centre and his friend and colleague, Martin Gaffney.  They are friends of Senator Wilson who has an interest in the report.  The industries obtain approximately &euro;55 million under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund so it is important that the Oireachtas scrutinises that.  No doubt, we will have a debate on those reports in due course.</p> <p>I second Senator Byrne's amendment to the Order of Business regarding the use of the words of former US President, John F. Kennedy, in an advertisement for economic gain by the Irish Wind Energy Association.  I think it is shameful and wrong and should be pulled from the airwaves immediately.  If the Irish Wind Energy Association has any conscience, it will do that forthwith by instructing the platforms to withdraw that advertisement.  </p> <p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business concerning the EU Scrutiny and Transparency in Government Bill 2013.  This is a very important area.  An OECD report commissioned on behalf of the Houses of the Oireachtas published before Christmas identified Oireachtas oversight responsibilities and shortcomings in that area in terms of budgetary oversight.  It also looked at European scrutiny of legislation which is impacting this member state.  Generally speaking, 97% of all the laws made in Brussels that impact on this State go unscrutinised through the parliamentary committee system because of time constraints on committee work and the workload of committee members.  A review of the way we carry out our political business would be a major step in the right direction.  This Bill should be accepted, so I propose that we take it today. </p></speech>

It shows how important the Members of this House are to the democratic process.  They were not in any way outshone by Members of the Lower House.  My office is just a few doors away from Senator MacSharry's and I witnessed the amount of work he put in to the inquiry along with his staff, particularly Mr. Aidan O'Connor.</p><p>I look forward to reading the inquiry's report in due course, perhaps in my retirement, but I wish to comment upon it now.  The Financial Regulator and the Central Bank obviously come in for quite a bit of criticism, which, I believe, is justifiable.  One of the big scandals which I criticised at the time was that the head of the financial regulatory authority walked away with &euro;600,000.  We need to bring culpability into our public service, particularly for people who are on exceptionally high six-figure salaries.  If a dereliction of duty occurs in the private sector - no matter at what level but especially at that of CEO - the individual involved would be dismissed and replaced.  We need to get that culture into the public sector in order to improve performance levels in key areas.  We have paid a huge price for this omission.</p><p>I am sure the report will cover the appalling decision made by the European Central Bank to take the side of bondholders over the interests of Irish taxpayers.  I pay tribute to Senator Barrett.  I read his very good and clearly set out minority comments regarding the report.  The report, and the Senator's comments, are worthy of debate in this House.  Even if the election is called next Tuesday, I hope the House will sit for three days next week to hold a debate on the banking inquiry and a badly-needed debate on housing.  That would form part of an input into policy formulation for the incoming Government.</p><p>I agree with Senator Daly.  If there was an EU treaty referendum in the morning, regardless of its subject matter, there would be major difficulties in getting the public to support it.  The banking crisis has left a legacy of hostility toward the EU and it has not come out of the situation in any sort of good light.  Even at this late stage, I ask that an attempt at burden-sharing be made.  There is no reason the Irish taxpayer should be singled out from all the taxpayers in Europe to take on the burden of what ultimately became the saviour of the euro currency.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to members of the banking inquiry which is publishing its report today and especially the Members of this House, Senators Barrett, D'Arcy, O'Keeffe and MacSharry.  They did tremendous work to ensure the publication of the report today.  I want that put on the record of the House.</p> <p>Could the Leader clarify, through his good offices, how money is allocated towards those who were victims of recent floods over the Christmas period and since?  I understand that the Irish Red Cross has been designated to deal with the allocation of grants to those poor, unfortunate people.  However, I also understand that unless a person is a ratepayer, he or she is not entitled to any compensation through the fund administered by the Irish Red Cross.  I am aware there is another hardship fund which is operated through the Department of Agriculture but, for the Government's information, there are people who live in rural Ireland who are not farmers.  Could the Leader clarify where these people stand?  They live in rural areas but do not pay rates because they are not businesspeople.  They are not farmers and do not qualify for the hardship fund from the Department of Agriculture.  Unfortunately, for personal reasons I was not able to attend the House for the statements on the motion on local government.  I applaud the all-party approach.  If some people try to break from the all-party-and-none approach then it is unfortunate.  It is the county councillors of this State who are in need of all our assistance and solo runs from anybody in this House or outside it is of no benefit.  There may be short-term gain for some Members of this House or the Lower House but the focus should be on ensuring that councillors who represent their local communities, and who are our electorate, are the beneficiaries of a much-needed and long-overdue package that can be achieved for them.</p> <p>I join Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill in welcoming to the Public Gallery Mr. Mervyn Clarke and Mr. Martin Gaffney, friends of mine and businessmen in my local town.</p></speech>

They did the House proud and we look forward to the report.  This House and the Lower House will today table simultaneous motions to allow publication of the report.  I have heard the remarks made by Senators on the report.  I cannot comment because the report has not yet been published.  Senators will forgive me if I do not comment on the remarks they made on the report, particularly in view of the fact that it has not been published and the motions to publish it have not yet been passed by both Houses.  I am endeavouring to arrange a debate on the banking inquiry tomorrow.  I believe the Lower House will also be discussing it tomorrow and it is fitting that this House should debate the inquiry on the same day.  I will revert to Members on the matter tomorrow.</p> <p>Senator Bacik made reference to the Commencement debate by Senator Noone yesterday during which he called for new planning regulations relating to a no-fry zone around schools.  She said she had received a number of representations from people on the matter of chip-shops' proximity to schools and so on.  I am sure this is a matter that will be considered in the future in the context of any new planning regulations to be published.</p> <p>Senator Barrett expressed his condolences to the family of the young man who died in Cork as a result of a drug overdose.  The Senator suggested we may need further drug legislation to deal with this problem.  It is dreadful.  Young people who are going to college for the first time certainly have to be vigilant in terms of the company they keep and in taking any substance that might damage them.  It is very regrettable that we have witnessed the death of a very young man in these circumstances.</p> <p>Senator Mullins welcomed the investment of some &euro;147 million in public nursing homes.  It is welcome that 4,723 extra beds are to be brought up to HIQA standards.  People will be able to go in to state-of-the-art facilities and acute hospital beds will be freed up.  My own city of Waterford has been waiting for this for some time and I see there is a &euro;20 million investment planned for St. Patrick's Hospital.</p> <p>Senator Daly asked about proposing an amendment to the Order of Business in respect of the publication of a Bill relating to the copyright to the national anthem.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have no problem in accepting the amendment proposed to the Order of Business seeking publication of the Bill.

I understand the Minister will at a later date make an additional allocation to repair roads damaged by flooding.  </p><p>Senator David Norris called for the appointment of a Minister with specific responsibility for home security.  He highlighted a particular case in that regard.  I am sure it is a matter the next Taoiseach will consider.</p><p>Senator C&aacute;it Keane called for vigilance in treating bites by mosquitoes, which can cause birth defects in babies.  This is an issue on which persons travelling abroad, in particular, should read up.</p><p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about problems posed by flooding that is clearly still evident in parts of the west.  He also called for investment in the provision of flood defences.  The Government has set aside a considerable amount of money for this purpose in coming years.</p><p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien spoke about the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  She is correct that a report due for publication by the EPA on 4 November last has still not been published.  If she gives me the details, I will raise the matter with the Minister.  If a report was to be published, I see no reason it should not have been published at this stage.</p><p>Senator Paschal Mooney supported Senator Mark Daly's amendment on the taking of the Bill dealing with copyright on the national anthem.  The Senator also proposed an amendment to the Order of Business to have the Corporate Manslaughter Bill 2011 taken today.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.  </p><p>Senator John Kelly spoke about the continued difficulties in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, in dealing with medical card applications.  I suggest to the Senator that if he has knowledge of a particular case, he should table it for discussion as a Commencement matter.  </p><p>Senator John Crown also proposed an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 57, Harmful and Malicious Electronic Communications Bill, be debated.

He will be aware that the report on Seanad reform by Maurice Manning envisages an input from this House in the scrutiny of EU proposals.  I do not propose to accept the Senator's amendment to the Order of Business.  I note his point about the reports on the horse racing and greyhound industries which were published this morning.  We will have a debate today on the Horse Racing Ireland Bill which I am sure will be welcomed by all Members of the House, as it was in the other House.</p> <p>Senator Jim Walsh spoke about the banking inquiry report.  As I said, I do not propose to comment on a report which has not yet been published.  </p> <p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson spoke about flooding and inquired about the package of benefits available for non-ratepayers.  He might consider tabling the issue for debate as a Commencement matter, at which time he would receive a full answer from the Minister concerned.</p></speech>

I would like to extend a warm welcome to the extended Friel family, especially to Brian's grandchildren who have made the trip from Donegal in his honour.</p><p>The tributes to Brian on his passing were wide and varied.  He was praised and eulogised by many, both here in Ireland and abroad.  He was described as a towering figure of stage and cultural life of this island.  Living quietly in Donegal, however, Brian was a quiet, soft spoken man who shied away from the limelight and let his writing speak for him.  Part of the first generation in Ireland to grow up with a new Border facing it, the Border came to play a significant part in Brian's life.  Crossing it regularly, it became a focal point of his home, work, leisure and life.</p><p>Brian was a prolific writer and wrote over 30 plays in all.  &quot;Philadelphia Here I Come&quot;, &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot;, &quot;Lovers&quot; and &quot;Aristocrats&quot; looked at familiar topics such as poverty, emigration, family relationships and social change in Irish society.  He also dipped his toe into political themes in dramas such as &quot;The Mundy Scheme&quot;, &quot;Translations&quot; and &quot;The Freedom of the City&quot;.  Brian shared the same <i>alma mater</i>of St. Columb's College in Derry as Seamus Heaney, another former eminent Senator.  Both of them distinguished themselves on the world stage, gave exceptional pride to the rest of us and bolstered Ireland's reputation as a great literary nation.</p><p>One of the nicest testaments to Brian's character I have read is that having followed his father's footsteps into teaching and years after leaving teaching to become a full-time writer, he continued to inquire of his former pupils and their educational development, particularly their progress in the literary field.  It is clear among all the great tributes and praise heaped upon Brian for his literary work that his home in Donegal, his leisure as a fisherman and his love for his family were the greatest works of his life.  I was delighted to see last week that a trust has been established to preserve the homestead of Brian's grandparents in Glenties in Donegal.  It is fitting that his daughter, Mary, is involved and I eagerly await a visit to the Brian Friel centre once it is established.</p><p>Ultimately, Brian was a private man.  The following quote from his self-portrait gives an insight into modern Ireland's leading playwright:</p><blockquote>I am married, have five children, live in the country, smoke too much, fish a bit, read a lot, worry a lot, get involved in sporadic causes and invariably regret the involvement, and hope that between now and my death I will have acquired a religion, a philosophy, a sense of life that will make the end less frightening than it appears to me at this moment.  </blockquote> <p>I hope he did indeed find an adequate version of all three.</p><p>I will finish by extending my condolences to his wife, Anne, his children, his grandchildren and his many friends.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I thank all those involved, especially those who travelled from County Donegal to join us in the House today.

I think that, with my friend and colleague, Senator David Norris, we are the only Members who served with him.  I was first elected in 1987 when he was nominated as a Senator by the then Taoiseach Mr. Charles Haughey.  It was a part of Mr. Haughey's make-up; he was a great patron of the arts.  At the time, it was widely welcomed that Brian Friel should be recognised and honoured through a nomination to this House.  From an historical point of view, it is interesting that he never actually sat in this Chamber because the Seanad met in the ante-room, as Senator David Norris may remember.  As one does, a Senator in the previous Seanad, between 1982 and 1987, was glancing at the wonderful ceiling, which is a feature of the House, and noticed that rather ominously it was cracking and that dust was falling from it.  The Office of Public Works was brought in and it decided to shut the place down.  As a result, when I first came here in 1987, the Seanad met in the ante-chamber.  There were Senators, including Brian Friel, who, while serving in that Seanad, did not physically get to sit in this Chamber, which in a way is sad.</p></speech>

It was just physical.  </p><p>When it comes to paying tribute to somebody of the stature of Brian Friel, I stand back in awe.  I could not help but reflect on the fact that there were little things along the way when I touched on his life.  As a young emigrant in London in my late teens, I always had a great interest in the theatre.  I remember when &quot;Philadelphia Here I Come&quot; opened on Shaftesbury Avenue I bought a ticket to go see the production which starred the late Patrick Bedford and the late Donal Donnelly as Gar and the other Gar.  I was absolutely enthralled by it.  The fact that it had been written by an Irishman and that it was being premiered in the West End was a great source of pride to me at the time.  To think that some years later I would serve in the House with him was awe-inspiring.  I cannot say I knew Brian Friel the man.  As happened in the case of many who were nominated for non-political reasons, his appearances in the Seanad, while important, were rare.  I do not think he was a politician <i>per se</i>, but I found him to be friendly, courteous and always willing to engage in the small talk one makes in the House between votes.</p><p>Brian Friel voted on six pieces of legislation during his tenure in office and it is rather interesting to look at the broad breadth of that legislation.  His voted first on the Adoption Bill 1987.  He subsequently voted, believe it or not, on Report and Final Stages of an abattoirs Bill.  He also voted on the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1987, better known as the Single European Act.  This was the the subject of the first contribution I made as a new Senator, not in this Chamber but in the D&aacute;il chamber, as Senator David Norris might remember.</p></speech>

I do not know what the reason for that was.  I made my first and last speech in the D&aacute;il Chamber on that Single European Act.  </p> <p>Brian Friel also voted on the video recordings Bill, in which he presumably had a particular interest.  He voted for the last time on Fifth Stage of the Single European Act.  While his appearances in the House were rare, he made an impact and took a keen interest in various pieces of legislation that were going through the House, as evidenced by the wide range of votes in which he participated during his two year period in the Seanad.</p> <p>It is very difficult to know where to start when one considers the extraordinarily successful career of one of our leading playwrights.  There is a little hero worship, as I was a fan before I was anything else and I still remain a fan of his works.  They are his greatest legacy to succeeding generations when one considers work such as "Philadelphia Here I Come" and "The Faith Healer".  There is also the famous "Dancing at Lughnasa" which, of all of his plays, resonates most strongly with the popular following across the world because of the wonderful portrayals by all of the actors and actresses in the film adaptation, led by Meryl Streep.  </p> <p>Apart from his prodigious output as a playwrite, the English-speaking world has hailed him as the Irish Chekhov, the universally-accented voice of Ireland.  His plays have been compared favourably with those of contemporaries such as Samuel Beckett, Arthur Miller, Harold Pinter and Tennessee Williams.  To be honest and lacking in total objectivity, he stands head and shoulders above even these distinguished individuals.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.  Like the Leader of the House, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I pass on my deepest sympathy to his wife, Anne; his immediate and extended family.  I applaud them for continuing the work of a wonderful man because the name Brian Friel will resonate long after many of his contemporaries have passed on to their eternal reward.</p></speech>

Like many others, I saw many of his plays during the decades and the one I valued the most and that spoke to me the most was "Translations".  It had the capacity to draw in so many difficult strands, so many parts of our life, culture and history.  To be able to create something engaging and lasting was quite an achievement.  We are deeply at a loss for his passing.  He was a great friend and colleagues of Seamus Heaney who we also recently lost and they were wonderful and inspiring men.  </p> <p>During the years so many people have written so much about Brian Friel and his work.  He extended around the world, as his works have been translated into many languages and performed in many places.  His work brought a piece of Ireland wherever it went but also a piece of humanity.  That is his greatest legacy and gift.  I know that his work will sustain and be remembered and performed for a long time to come into the future.  I know that the Sligo Drama Circle is opening its year of performances this year with one of his plays.  I simply wish to thank him and say we are all the richer for his great contribution.  I never had the pleasure or honour of meeting him, but I feel as if I did.  I feel part of what he said, what he said for all of us, will stay with me and I hope I am the better for it.</p></speech>

Sally, David and Mary are in the Visitors Gallery, as are some of the McLoones, the Friels and the Morrisons.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiach Mac Conghail:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2386"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2386&amp;amp;pid=FiachMacConghail&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I also wish to acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of the chairman of the Abbey Theatre, Dr. Bryan McMahon.  This is an emotional day for me as he was a friend, a critic and a mentor.  He was my referee when I applied first for the job in the Abbey Theatre and when I applied for it the second time.  To pay tribute to this great man, I find myself at a loss; the challenge seems too great.  I was uncertain where to begin to describe his contribution to Irish theatre, how to find an end to our gratitude for his work and his wisdom and in my confusion I turned to literature, as do we all.  I turned to the great character of Hugh, the schoolmaster in &quot;Translations&quot; who assures us that &quot;Confusion is not an ignoble condition.&quot;  Friel's work is a layer in our subsoil.  Any author who makes his or her way onto a school syllabus can become part of the weave of young minds and settle there but Brian Friel staged an extensive excavation on the site of the Irish psyche.  I can think of no playwright whose stories have better explained ourselves to ourselves.  Friel addresses weighty themes such as language and meaning, faith and authority through the quotidian of family life.  The work was thematically epic, the situation achingly local.  He wrote about the collective.  He showed us who we are, shining a light on dark moments of the public and the private past.<br/><br/>What I love about Brian is that his work exhibits a boundless humanity.  There are few victors in his histories.  He believed that every story had seven faces and he generously revealed them all without judgment.  His characters speak of relentless change and precious few constants, save for long golden summer afternoons, music and the eternal Ballybeg.  If Ballybeg was his canvas, memory, the greatest of all his muses was his palette.  He meditated on it and interrogated memory in all its forms including personal, the stuff of autobiography and cultural memory, exposing the make up of the collective consciousness of our race.<br/><br/>He knew the landscape of fact had limited value and that recollected moments held equal validity and sometimes greater significance than the truth of lived experience.  It was my joy and privilege to have known and loved him over 20 years and I consider each person present lucky to have lived in his time.  He was an artist of the highest integrity and the most rigorous craftsman I have ever known.  There are few instances where I can claim one-upmanship on him, except in this act today.  I am addressing Members here in the Seanad, something Brian never managed to do in his two-year term and I believe that was an active decision he made.  He is truly irreplaceable and the constellation of Irish literature seems to shine less brightly in his absence.  When asked why he had two birth certificates, one dated 9 January 1929 and the other dated 10 January 1929, Brian quipped &quot;perhaps I'm twins&quot;.  Indeed, it seems impossible that one man could have contributed so much.  It could not be true that a sole imagination yielded Frank Hardy, Casimir O'Donnell and Rose Mundy, that one mind convinced us that Yalta was the same parish as Ballybeg and that made the concerns of a 19th-century hedge school feel more urgent than today's newspaper but it is true.  They are all the work of a man to whom we pay tribute today, Brian Friel.<br/><br/>He gave us 24 plays in total and it has been my great joy to work on at least seven of them to date.  In addition, he wrote two short story collections, as well as three unpublished and eight published adaptations, mostly from Ibsen, Chekhov and Turgenev.  It is a formidable body of work as rich as it is varied.  With deep connections on both sides of the Border, which the Leader mentioned earlier, he was preoccupied with aspects of dualism, divided loyalties, tensions between fathers and sons, the two languages and the island's two political states.  In &quot;Philadelphia Here I Come&quot;, which is a play about exile Senator Mooney mentioned, it is about fathers and sons but is both a cultural touchstone and an astonishing statement of intent from Brian, just three plays into his career.  He split the theatrical atom when he created Gar Public and Gar Private.  The play demonstrated Brian's masterful understanding of the unique potential of the theatrical form.  It also showcased his great humour side by side with a nostalgic crushing melancholy.<br/><br/>In an extraordinary golden period of creativity in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Brian wrote &quot;Aristocrats&quot;, &quot;Faith Healer&quot; and &quot;Translations&quot;.  In 1979, &quot;Faith Healer&quot; had its world premiere.  The play's dedication, which I love, reads &quot;For Anne, again&quot; and for me, it is his masterwork.  It is a personal favourite and is a play to which I have returned throughout my own life and work.  One is presented with one story recounted by three tellers, unreliable narrators all.  Each has his or her own particular recollection told through monologue.  In its most basic reading, it is an extraordinary meditation on the distortions of memory.  For artists, it is a searing self-portrait, a complex metaphor of the artist with a gift over which he or she has no control and the consequences for those around that artist.  When Frank asks &quot;Am I a con man?&quot;,  we feel as though Friel is talking directly to us.  Frank continues:</p><blockquote>Was it all chance? &ndash; or skill? &ndash; or illusion? &ndash; or delusion?  Precisely what power did I possess? &ndash; Could I summon it?  When and how?</blockquote><p>Those questions are the abiding questions of all artists.  He is asking others to have faith in him but it is hardest to have faith in oneself.<br/><br/>The play &quot;Translations&quot;, which premiered at the historic Guildhall in Derry in September 1980, was written to launch Field Day Theatre Company.  Field Day's mission was to tour Ireland, North and South, and it was founded as the cultural and intellectual response to the political crisis in Northern Ireland.  Brian, together with Stephen Rea and others, set out to create a space, a fifth province, whose art would transcend the borders of the political reality.  Friel made the inspired choice to have all characters, Irish and English-speaking, speak the English text even though on stage, the characters cannot comprehend one another.  It takes a true master to wield language so beautifully and so deftly while convincing us of its utter inadequacies.<br/><br/>&quot;Translations&quot; dramatised the key transitional moment when Irish gave way to English and when our culture was forced to translate itself into a different linguistic landscape.  The Ordnance Survey map acts as a powerful metaphor for the transformation of cultural environment.  However, the play is also deeply funny and has the greatest love scene in Irish theatre history when M&aacute;ire and Lieutenant Yolland both pledge their love in a language the other does not speak and yet they understand, always.  It is one of the most translated and staged of all the 20th-century plays and has been performed in Estonia, Iceland, France, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Norway, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, together with most of the world's English-speaking countries including South Africa, Canada, the United States and Australia.<br/><br/>&quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; holds a special place in my memory.  After its world premiere at the Abbey Theatre in 1990 directed by Patrick Mason, the play transferred to Broadway, where it ran for a year and won three Tony awards.  I was the assistant producer in that transfer and worked closely with Brian for the very first time.  His keen ability to elevate and devastate is showcased in &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot;, which is set the year before the Constitution was established with all its limitations on women.  Friel expressed the agency of these five brave Glenties women to dance in an alchemic <i>coup de th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i>.  His ability to engage the intellect and the heart sets him apart as a playwright.  Seamus Deane, his Field Day colleague and dear friend, wrote &quot;no Irish writer since the early days of [the] century has so sternly and courageously asserted the role of art in the public world without either yielding to that world ... or retreating into art&rsquo;s narcissistic alternatives&quot;.<br/><br/>As e-mail took over, for the past ten years the Abbey Theatre's fax machine was maintained exclusively for Brian Friel and Seamus Heaney, who were committed to the medium of fax.  There was great excitement every time one of Brian's messages would arrive full of one-liners or well-wishes.  The Friel fax, as it came to be called, became increasingly hard to service over the years and it baffled IT department staff and repair shops around Dublin 1.  However, it was lovingly prized and maintained diligently by my staff at the Abbey Theatre.  Discontinued toner cartridges were sought online and carefully stockpiled and missives destroyed by paper jams were extricated with surgical precision and pieced back together.  It was with deep sadness that we noted in October that this fax machine is now silent but it remains in our office.<br/><br/>Finally, in 1996 Vincent Canby wrote in the <i>New York Times</i>that Brian must be Ireland's greatest dramatist having, &quot;dazzled us with plays that speak in a language of unequalled poetic beauty and intensity&quot;.  How could we ever express adequate gratitude to Brian Friel for Marconi, for Frank, for Teddy and Grace, for Screwballs versus Cannonballs, for poor Lieutenant Yolland, for casting W.B. Yeats as a cushion, for indelible Kinlochbervie in all its retellings, for the heart scalds and the big sore laugh and for building a home for our imagination in Ballybeg?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiach Mac Conghail:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2386"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2386&amp;amp;pid=FiachMacConghail&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->All tributes and thanks fall short in the wake of its mastery.

To quote Milton:</p><blockquote>Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail<br /><br />Or knock the breast</blockquote> <p>The family might agree with me that this is a moment for celebration of one of the great talents of Irish theatre.  It was a really imaginative use of the power of nomination by the late Charles Haughey to nominate Brian Friel to this House.  The current Taoiseach has continued this tradition in nominating the director of the Abbey Theatre, Senator Fiach Mac Conghail, whose very eloquent praise of Brian Friel we have just heard.</p><p>I knew Brian Friel but it is extraordinary the way one's memory plays tricks on one.  I thought I met him in this Chamber.  I remember very clearly that in 1987 we had to meet in the ante-chamber.  I have vivid memories of talking to Brian Friel during a division which I thought was in here but obviously I am wrong.  All kinds of odd things can happen.  I was intrigued to learn from the Leader's speech that Seamus Heaney was also a Senator.  I must have slept through that one because I have no recollection of it.  Perhaps that was an error of memory.</p><p>Fifty years ago or more, as a student in Trinity, I wrote the first review of &quot;Philadelphia, Here I Come!&quot; which I saw at the Gate Theatre.  As Senator Paschal Mooney said, Paddy Bedford and Donal Donnelly were in it and it really brought me alive.  It was one of the most exciting and thrilling moments in theatre that I can recall.  The idea of having two physical actors on the stage - one playing Gar private and the other Gar public - was just electrifying.  The acting was superb, not only by the actors playing the two principal characters but also by the man who played the father - a tragic, incoherent, isolated figure so familiar to me from my own experience of the poor people of the midlands.  The pub interior was also beautifully presented on stage.  The pub grocery and the old housekeeper are familiar from that period of Irish life.  There was something really haunting about it.  I wrote the first review in <i>Icarus</i>, the Trinity magazine, and when I met Brian here when he had been elected, he remembered it.  I was so pleased that a man of such extraordinary distinction would remember the admiring scribblings of an undergraduate.</p><p>He is, as I say, a great playwright and translator and his translations of Chekhov were remarkable.  He was a man of great humour whom I do not recall speaking at all in this House.  I think he was nominated by Mr. Haughey as an accolade to thank him for what he had done for Ireland and I do not think he was expected to speak.  I remember asking him why he did not and he said it was because they never talked about anything that interested him, which I thought that was a perfectly rational and reasonable argument.  He spoke outside this House and he spoke from the heart about the Irish people.  He also had a wonderful sense of humour.  &quot;The Loves of Cass McGuire&quot;, which I also saw, was terribly funny in some instances and had a pathos of exile.  There is a wonderful moment when someone in America keeps writing back home saying they got a promotion.  They say three times &quot;This is a feather in my cap&quot; and when they ask whether they should take the boat or plane home, one of the characters left at home tells them to stick all the feathers up their arse and fly home.  I thought that was pricelessly funny.</p><p>We remember the humour and the breadth of his understanding, not only of nationalist Catholic people in the North but also his understanding of Protestants and the English.  We remember his refusal to be narrowly judgmental in a republican sense, his breadth of imagination and lack of judgment, which was remarkable, as was his capacity to take apparently small, local and parochial things and turn them into the international and universal through the medium of art.</p><p>Many years ago, the late Frank O'Connor said to a group of us in Trinity that to be parochial was not dreadful because if one understood one's own parish, one understood everybody else's.  The bad thing was to be provincial.  There was nothing provincial about Brian Friel but he sure as hell was parochial.  He made the parish universal and, as a result, it was represented in theatres in the west end of London and on Broadway.</p><p>We stand in honour and awe at the career of a modest man who did not parade his genius.  There is no doubt that Brian Friel was a genius of the theatre.  We should be grateful and celebrate his life.  As I said at the beginning:</p><blockquote>Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail<br /><br />Or knock the breast</blockquote> <p>Brian was 86 when he died, I am now 72.  When one is over 70, one is in the departure lounge and might as well get used to it.  We are perishable goods and that is it.  I hope he found solace and absolved himself of the fear of death.  I am very glad to say I have no fear of death at all and I hope to God I do not acquire one on my death bed, which would be unfortunate.  I am grateful for the life of Brian Friel because he has enriched many evenings in the theatre.  Reading his remarkable short stories also enriched my life.</p></speech>

I welcome those in the Gallery, particularly Brian Friel's family, friends and colleagues to whom I offer sincere sympathies.  Others who knew Brian Friel have spoken eloquently but I will add a few words of my own.  While he was a Senator here between 1987 and 1989, which is the basis upon which we are paying tribute, he was much better known as a playwright and was described at the time of his death as the best-known Irish playwright of his generation.  Others have spoken of his many achievements.  He was incredibly prolific.  I have read through a list of his huge amount of work - 24 published plays, two short story collections, three unpublished and eight published adaptations or versions, most notably of the works of Ibsen, Chekhov and Turgenev.  His best-known plays are &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot;, &quot;Faith Healer&quot;, &quot;Philadelphia, Here I Come!&quot; and, of course, &quot;Translations&quot;, which, like Senator O'Keeffe, is my personal favourite.  It is a most beautiful evocation of the complexity of language, communication difficulties and mis-communications.  It has much resonance and there is a political undertone which has been discussed at length but to me it is a beautiful discussion of language.  Brian Friel has been honoured in so many ways, not only in Ireland, Britain and the US, but also internationally.  Senator Mac Conghail spoke eloquently about the international impact that his work has had and the staging of many of his plays in many other countries, as well as the English-speaking countries in which he was honoured.  He was honoured, by means of a Brian Friel season on BBC radio in the 1980s, in the Abbey Theatre in 2009 to celebrate his 80th birthday and through the bestowing of so many honorary doctorates by Trinity College, the National University of Ireland, NUI, and others.</p><p>One of the things I did not know about him until I read his obituary was that he had also been a writer for the <i>Irish Press</i>and <i>The New Yorker.</i>Of the handsome reward he was given by <i>The New Yorker</i>he said, &quot;They paid such enormous money I found I could live off three stories a year&quot; which I thought was a lovely phrase.  As Senator Mac Conghail said of Brian Friel's enormous achievements, it seems impossible that one man could have achieved so much in his lifetime.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Clearly that is why he is the best known Irish playwright of his generation.  That is why he was honoured so extensively on his death and regarded, as many wrote, as one of the greatest contemporary dramatists writing in the English language.  He was rather nicely described by Meryl Streep, who acted in the film adaptation of "Dancing at Lughnasa", as a tender dramatist and lovely man.  I wish to add my voice to those paying tribute to this extraordinary man.</p></speech>

I feel a bit overwhelmed by the challenge of trying to live up to the rhetoric of previous Senators.  One could talk about being upstaged before the final act.  Coming in as one of the last speakers it is very difficult to follow some of the wonderful contributions previously made and I commend the Senators who have spoken already.</p><p>Brian Friel is a man who needs no introduction; he was a titan of theatre and it is a privilege that he came from these shores and served in this House that we too now serve.  While he spent only a short time serving in the Seanad, he served Ireland and its people for decades.  In all, Brian Friel penned more than 30 plays, two short story collections and three unpublished and eight published adaptations or versions, most notably from Ibsen, Chekhov and Turgenev.  Other speakers have said that also.</p><p>I am sure that all Senators in this House have at some stage been influenced or inspired by Friel&rsquo;s works.  That in itself is a testament to the accessibility, power, and calibre of his works.  Particular works of Friel have left a deep mark on many people, not only in Ireland but across the globe.  His first major success, &quot;Philadelphia Here I Come&quot;, is still a timeless piece of drama, especially from an Irish perspective.  In itself, it challenged many traditional Irish societal norms of the time.  More importantly, it challenged and highlighted the negative effects of certain aspects of Irish society on its people and the difficulties that created in their ability for expression.</p><p>For me personally, two of his works stand out, namely, &ldquo;The Freedom of The City&rdquo; and &ldquo;Translations&rdquo;.  The play, &quot;The Freedom of the City&quot; had its genesis in Friel&rsquo;s own participation in the civil rights march on Bloody Sunday.  It was a response to the whitewash Widgery report on Bloody Sunday and it is one of the best dramas to emerge from the conflict in the North.  The play was a product of Friel at his most politically engaged period.  It was an exposure of the corrupt state authority in the North at the time and was critical of the British establishment <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the British army and Widgery tribunal.  &quot;Translations&quot;, one of Friel&rsquo;s most celebrated works, is a complex play about language but with many sub-themes running throughout, such as nationalism, republicanism, imperialism, emigration, culture, identity, acceptance, family, love, and many more.  It was powerful to me to see how it explored the use of language as an instrument of colonial power.  Mar dhuine a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge &oacute; l&aacute; go l&aacute;, bh&iacute; s&eacute; iontach speisialta ar an mbun&uacute;s.</p><p>The real power of Brian Friel&rsquo;s work was the emotiveness and power of themes and how his work spoke to people.  His plays, short stories, and adaptations have a timelessness quality and will endure in a way that only the greatest works of art and literature can endure.  Brian Friel is a loss to Ireland, a loss to literature and theatre and a loss to his numerous friends in many fields.  It is his family, however, who will miss him most.  On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I again wish to express my sincere sympathy to his wife Anne and all his family and friends who are with us today.  Go dtugfaidh Dia suaimhneas s&iacute;ora&iacute; d&oacute;.</p></speech>

I was attending with my then new wife.  Even today the play is still in my mind.  We are talking about the transience of life and the permanence of art.  It is said that Brian Friel was greatly influenced by Chekhov.  In "The Circus Animals' Desertion" Yeats said, "I must lie down where all the ladders start/In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart".  Chekhov said all art starts in the dunghill.  There is also the image from outside Kavanagh's house, the carn aoiligh as it is called in Irish.  That is the basis of the genre, the everyday, the local elevated to the universal.  As Kavanagh said, the local is far more important than the provincial because the local has a justifiable pride in its own achievements whereas the provincial tries to aim its efforts at its perceived betters.</p> <p>Brian Friel's school colleagues were Seamus Heaney and John Hume - the three wise men - the three whin bushes that looked across the horizon, to quote from Patrick Kavanagh's poem "A Christmas Childhood".  One is looking at something special, a unique communication.  An uilethacar - the universal set, which will live forever.  When, as the Leader outlined, Brian Friel said that he hoped "that between now and my death I will have acquired a religion, a philosophy, a sense of life that will make the end less frightening than it appears to me at this moment", I though he was a very lucky man because he only feared the end.  Most of us fear life.  I am sure there is no end as far as Brian Friel is concerned because he has moved through his art into that permanence that will last forever.</p></speech>

Whatever they knew before that moment becomes renewed, transfigured in another pattern.</blockquote> <p>We are doing that in the year of commemorations as we think more about the nature of this country and society and the need to expand on traditional interpretations of it.  That is echoed in Declan Kiberd's examination of Field Day and its expression here in this House and in the political and social life of Ireland.  He said that when Mary Robinson was elected President in 1990 and achieved that expanded definition of Irishness with her candle in the window reaching out to the diaspora, he felt that the artistic agendas of Friel and Heaney had at last found a political embodiment.</p><p>The idea of home, emigration, ancestry and exile are rooted in Glenties and Ballybeg.  They all come together in the beautiful and dramatic west Donegal landscape.  There is a very nice quote from Rosita Boland, quoting from Seamus Heaney speaking about Friel in the Glenties summer school of 2008, The Catechism of Friel - </p><blockquote>B was for Ballybeg, &ldquo;a place where the soul had no hiding place&rdquo;.<br /><br />R was for the risk he had taken in first deciding to write full time.<br /><br />I was for integrity.<br /><br />A was for Anne, his beloved wife of more than half a century.<br /><br />And N, Heaney told the packed hotel ballroom, was for &ldquo;a very important word in the Friel vocabulary: No. No to the cult of self-promotion&rdquo; &ndash; a reference to the fact that Friel did not give interviews.</blockquote> <p>He is looking down on us today from his heavenly abode and we are saying thank you so much to Brian Friel for all that he has inspired in this country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sean D.

Mention has been made of his reflection about making the end less frightening.  It is an appropriate reflection for the Houses of the Oireachtas over the next two or three weeks for many, or all, of us to try to make the end less frightening, if it is to be an end.</p> <p>I was fortunate to serve with the late Senator in that period 1987 to 1989.  It is a long time ago but we have nothing but the fondest memories of that Seanad.  It was an eclectic Seanad for me, to put it mildly, as I was a political novice just out of short pants.  To walk into the House and sit alongside figures such as Brian Friel, &Eacute;amon de Buitl&eacute;ir - who was another very interesting Independent appointment by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey - John Robb from Northern Ireland and John Magnier of Coolmore Stud fame was something I was in awe of, although on reflection, I treasure it greatly.</p> <p>The work, worth and fame of Brian Friel stretches much beyond this House and, clearly, he is known not for his political interventions but for his life of creativity.  From the perspective of a man of such creativity, one of the disappointing aspects of his membership of the Seanad was that the Seanad building in which we sit, the finest room of Leinster House, was under repair and reconstruction in that period 1987 to 1989, so it was not in this hallowed spot and on these well-cushioned leather seats that we sat but rather in the ante room, where we sat on chairs and benches like little schoolboys in a room.  Notwithstanding that, each Member, including Brian Friel, played their part in that Seanad. </p> <p>Senator Norris has posed the question of whether he contributed much by way of debate to the Seanad.  Most of us who entered the Seanad on that occasion were in awe of the building and of politics but any moments of silence were filled by the said Senator Norris, so there was very little time for the novice Senators to make their speeches.  Brian Friel was a mannerly, friendly colleague of those on all sides in the House.  If we recall, it was a time when the politics of this Republic and this island was very fraught with the divisions in Northern Ireland.  On an almost daily basis, certainly a weekly basis, we were speaking of death and division, bombing, murder and killing.  That was the big political backdrop at the time.  People such as Brian Friel and other colleagues like him, by their presence here and their gentle chats, not always within but also outside the Chamber and in the more social parts of the building, forced us all to try to look in a broader fashion at the conflict on the island and forced us all to try to accept that change, compromise and movement would be required.  Therefore, the Senator did play a constructive political role in that regard.  Different voices from the normal Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Labour Party voices, which we were traditionally more used to, were very helpful in making us look at some of the big problems in a new light.</p> <p>I have very pleasant memories of Senator Brian Friel.  While his fame is much greater than his political career, he certainly leaves a legacy in this House and way beyond it.</p></speech>

When I look around the Chamber, I wonder who is going to be here in 25 years' time.  It is quite a long time to be in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>I did not know Brian Friel but, by all accounts, he was an absolute gentleman of the highest standing.  He was a playwright, a storyteller and a teacher.  He was born near Omagh, County Tyrone, in January 1929 but ten years later, he moved with his family to Derry.  There he was educated at St. Columba's College, following which he spent two years as a seminarian in St. Patrick's College in Maynooth.  He trained as a teacher at St. Joseph's College, Belfast, and he began his teaching career in 1950.</p> <p>While I never met Brian Friel and did not know him, I can assure Members that from the contributions that have been made in the House today, I feel I knew him very well.</p> <p>I would like to be associated with the tributes to the late Senator Brian Friel, who was nominated to be a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann from 1987 to 1989 by the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey.  I extend my sympathies to his wife Anne, his children and grandchildren, his extended family and all his friends here in the Seanad today.  The House will observe a minute's silence.</p></speech>

At the outset I emphasise that this is a technical Bill that amends six existing statutes and does not involve any new regulatory policy.  It is a short Bill comprising just ten sections, as passed by the D&aacute;il.  Broadly speaking, the Bill amends the following Acts: the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to ensure that the National Transport Authority, NTA, has the necessary powers to develop and deliver public transport infrastructure which has been approved for funding; the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 which is primarily to provide for greater precision in the Act on certain provisions and more specific technical enabling powers for regulations made by the National Transport Authority, NTA, under the Act; the Railway Safety Act 2005 to change the name of the Railway Safety Commission to the Commission for Railway Regulation to reflect the broadening of its remit in relation to railway regulation; the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 to provide for certain procedural issues in relation to Transport Infrastructure Ireland's by-law making powers for Luas passenger services; the State Airports Act 2004 to clarify certain provisions relating to fixed payment notice; and the Road Traffic Act 1961 to address an implicit contradiction in its provisions relating to duties on occurrence of an accident as well as an omission relating to disqualification on conviction for hit and run offences.</p> <p>Before looking at each section in more detail, I emphasise that the amendments proposed are technical in nature and do not involve any new regulatory policy.  Section 1 relates to the public transport infrastructure functions of the National Transport Authority.  This section provides for the amendment of sections 2 and 44 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 in relation to the public transport infrastructure functions of the NTA and the insertion of four new sections into the 2008 Act in relation to public passenger transport services.  The proposed amendments to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 will ensure that the NTA can develop and deliver public transport infrastructure such as Bus Rapid Transit, BRT, in the event that it is decided to proceed with such infrastructure or other projects such as cycling schemes.  Under the capital plan to 2020, funding to support and improve bus services will be an important priority.  As well as ensuring a modern efficient fleet, it is essential that the bus routes and supporting infrastructure facilitate the provision of attractive services.  In this regard, the proposed amendments will address a constraint in the existing legislation which creates a differentiation between public roads existing before the establishment of the NTA and public roads which were developed after the NTA was established and provide that the NTA would have equivalent vires to provide public transport infrastructure on public roads constructed either before or after the establishment date of the NTA.  The purpose of this particular amendment is to ensure that the NTA has the necessary powers to develop and deliver public transport infrastructure which has been approved for funding.  </p> <p>Furthermore, the amendments will clarify that the NTA is required to engage in one statutory approval-permission process for development in accordance with whatever legislation applies to the particular public transport infrastructure development concerned.  The objective is to remove an anomaly that would leave the NTA subject to two different and parallel processes.  In addition, the proposed amendments will also enable the NTA to make by-laws in respect of public transport passenger services, currently provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann, which will be tendered to commence operations in the latter part of 2016. </p> <p>Section 2 provides for amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 to provide for greater precision in the Act relating to certain provisions, more specific technical enabling powers under the Act for regulations made by the NTA and punctuation, textual corrections and refinement.  The programme for Government contained the commitment to review and update the regulation of taxis to ensure that taxi drivers are recognised as a key component of the public transport system and to provide for a forum for discussion between the regulatory authorities and taxi providers.  The taxi regulation review report of 2011 identified 46 actions to address the key issues in the taxi sector in seven areas, namely, driver licensing, vehicle licensing and standards, accessible services for people with disabilities, compliance and enforcement, consumer and industry assurance, fleet management and rental controls and a rural hackney service to deal with very limited access in rural areas.  </p> <p>The Taxi Regulation Act 2013 was introduced primarily to give legal effect to recommendations of the taxi regulation review report of 2011 relating to increased enforcement measures, including a demerit scheme to deal with recurrent breaches of small public service vehicle, SPSV, regulations, the issue of on-the-spot fines for an increased range of offences and a proportionate system for mandatory disqualification from holding a licence on conviction for a serious criminal offence.  The 2013 Act also repealed and replaced the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The commencement of the 2013 Act and the introduction of new small public service vehicles, SPSV, regulations by the National Transport Authority, NTA, in tandem with that commencement has delivered a significantly greater level of compliance, improved and streamlined the regulatory regime for driver and vehicle licence holders.  It has also provided an enhanced degree of professionalism in the industry.  Customers of taxi services also benefit from greater transparency and the information available in respect of licensed services.  A range of quality of service actions have been initiated which have resulted in a renewed commitment to improve the utilisation of wheelchair-accessible taxis.<br/><br/>The substantive amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 provided for in the Bill are as follows.  There is a substitution of a new definition for dispatch operator to include a service allowing intending passengers to arrange the hire of a SPSV, so as to ensure the applicability of the dispatch operator licensing requirements to technological intermediaries.  The amendments will provide that licensing regulations made by the NTA under section 7 may provide for written declarations or undertakings to accompany a licence for a number of specified matters.  They will also provide that the licensing authority may only grant a licence to drive an SPSV to a person holding a driving licence to drive such a vehicle, the automatic revocation of such a licence on surrender of the licence by the licence holder to the NTA and that representations and appeal provisions under section 13 will not apply to decisions of the licensing authority to refuse to grant a licence or to revoke or suspend a licence as a result of a vehicle not meeting the required standard for SPSVs under regulations.  They will extend the period during which the nominated representative of a deceased licence holder may apply to the NTA for the grant of a licence of the same category from the current three months to nine months after the death of the licence holder.  The amendments will provide for the exclusion of the address of the holder of an SPSV licence from the details that must be provided when information is requested by the NTA with regard to a licence on the register of licences and amend the definition of &quot;appropriate court&quot; so as to confer jurisdiction on the Circuit Court for an application under section 30(8) of the 2013 Act by a person to allow him or her to apply for or to continue to hold, as the case may be, a licence notwithstanding a conviction for an offence specified in section 30(3).<br/><br/>Section 3 provides for the substitution of a new section 48 for the existing section 48 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, relating to fixed payment notices, primarily to prescribe the period during which payment may be made under the &quot;second payment option&quot;.  Apart from this change, the substituted section 48 effectively restates the existing section 48 but with greater precision.<br/><br/>Section 4 provides for the change of name of the Railway Safety Commission to the commission for railway regulation and consequential amendments to section 2(1) and section 14(2) of the Railway Safety Act 2005 to reflect its planned designation as the regulatory body under Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area to monitor competition in the rail services market.  Directive 2012/34/EU requires each member state to designate a regulatory body to monitor competition in the rail services market in the state to ensure non-discriminatory access to railway markets.  The regulatory body will have a monitoring function and a role to hear appeals made by railway undertakings and other interested persons.  The Railway Safety Commission was established under the Railway Safety Act 2005 to foster and encourage railway safety and to enforce legislation relating to railway safety.  It is proposed that the date for the change of name is to be appointed in an order to be made by the Minister.<br/><br/>Section 5 provides for the amendment of section 66, as inserted by section 134 of the Railway Safety Act 2005, of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001, relating to the making of by-laws for railways by Transport Infrastructure Ireland to require that notification regarding the making of by-laws for Luas passenger services and copies of draft and final by-laws be published online.<br/><br/>Section 6 provides for an amendment to section 27 of the State Airports Act 2004 to further facilitate the operation and administration of a fixed payment notice process that applies to alleged offences for contravening a provision of by-laws relating to the parking of vehicles at an airport.  Section 7 amends section 27A, inserted by section 51 of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, of the State Airports Act 2004 to provide that the fixed payment notice process that applies under that section also applies in respect of alleged offences under section 47 of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014.<br/><br/>Section 8 is technical amendment of section 106 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, which deals with duties on occurrence of an accident.  It was amended in 2014 to introduce new offences for hit-and-run incidents causing death or serious injury.  The Attorney General's office has since advised the Department that the amended version of the section contains an implicit contradiction.  The new hit-and-run provisions are indictable offences but they come under a section heading referring to summary offences.  The Attorney General's advice is that the intention of the law is clear in spite of the error and the Director of Public Prosecutions is continuing to take prosecutions under this legislation.  However, it is also the Attorney General's view that the error should be corrected at the earliest available opportunity.  Section 8 also provides for an amendment to section 26(3)(<i>b</i>)(<i>i</i>) and Second Schedule of the 1961 Act to rectify an omission when the new hit-and-run provisions were introduced in 2014.  When the new hit-and-run provisions were introduced, there should have been an associated amendment to state that there would be a consequential disqualification for those who were convicted under the new provisions.  As this was not done at the time, it is provided for now in this section of the Bill.<br/><br/>Section 9 provides for the force of law to be given to the protocol of 3 June 1999 for the modification of the convention concerning international carriage by rail, COTIF, of 9 May 1980.  The COTIF convention sets out rules and procedures for international rail travel.  Ireland is one of only a small number of members of the organisation yet to fully ratify this convention.  This failure to ratify has led to infringement proceedings being taken against us by the European Commission.  As a result, and following advice from the Attorney General's office, I have decided that Ireland should expedite the ratification of the convention by means of primary legislation.  Irish Rail has been fully consulted on this matter and it should be noted that the enactment of legislation in this area will not have any significant practical impact on rail operators or passengers in the State.<br/><br/>Section 10 is a standard provision setting out the short title and collective citation provisions for the Act.<br/><br/>This is a technical Bill but as is often the case with technical Bills, it is important.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to Senators' contributions and constructive discussion on this Bill.</p></speech>

I again thank the House for facilitating this.  I gather that all Stages will be taken today.  I will not be moving mine at any later stage as we did yesterday so I hope the Minister will be able to leave the House as he wishes.  </p><p>Is it possible for the NTA to be the regulatory body?  It regulates buses.  Could it take over the functions referred to by the Minister relating to railways?  In respect of the deletion of the section referred to by the Minister relating to the NTA and rail passenger services, including light rail and metro, I would make it more comprehensive.  Does it have advantages in terms of reducing the number of quangos and getting better administrative fit?  The Minister is a far better judge of that than I am.  </p><p>St. Stephen's Green received a Green Flag award.  The Green Flag is an international scheme that promotes the highest standards in parks and green spaces and the OPW is very proud of it.  I was seeking to repeal a section of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 which allows access to St. Stephen's Green.  Can St. Stephen's Green be protected given how much we value it as a wonderful neighbourhood facility and how much the OPW has put into it?  Does it need protection?  The original protection was from 1877 when the Guinness family donated it to the city.  Those protections were reduced in 2008.  Happily, nothing has happened.  It is as beautiful as ever but do we need to retain those protections?</p><p>Dispatch operations are in the world of Uber and Halo and so on.  Do we need to be involved in the regulation of that?  In respect of small public service vehicles, I understand that the application for a licence must be accompanied by a written declaration by the applicant for the licence concerning the roadworthiness of the vehicle and compliance with vehicle standards specified in the small public service vehicle regulations.  Is it necessary to have confirmation of that if somebody says they are compliant or is the documentation required to prove compliance?  Is there a full stop or comma in the wrong place that makes it implicit that they sign their application but they also independently provide advice rather than self-assessment?  If that strengthens things, I will leave it with the Minister for his consideration.  </p><p>We discussed safety yesterday with many contributions from all sides.  Should all safety be looked after by one safety organisation?  Rather than retaining the Railway Safety Commission and adding an economic function, why not put the economic function into the NTA and put the safety function in with road safety?  Rail represents probably about 2% or 3% of passenger movements in the country.  I think we have a budget of approximately &euro;15 million or &euro;16 million, which is far higher than its proportion of traffic.  Is safety an activity we could conduct under one body or two?  </p><p>I apologise to the House for being rushed but if those contributions are of use to the Minister and other Senators, that is the spirit in which they are offered.  When one is on a committee investigating a &euro;64 billion banking bailout, transport problems seem quite solvable and manageable so I wish the rest of the House every success in doing so.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-27a.167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012700002#BB00200"><p>The Minister is very welcome to the House.  As he stated, the Public Transport Bill 2015 is a technical Bill and does not involve any regulatory policy but we must pass these things through the Houses.  Section 1 amends the Dublin Transport Authority Act.  It aims to ensure that the NTA has the necessary powers to develop and deliver public transport infrastructure that has been approved for funding.  It is envisaged that &euro;884 million will be invested in public transport from 2013 to 2018.  The economy is picking up and if the Minister is still in office, he would like to see that funding increased.  It is important that we continue to improve our public transport, particularly as our economy grows and more cars come on the roads.  We need a new policy to improve the structure because people do not want to be stuck in traffic jams in the morning so public transport is the only way.</p> <p>Will this Bill give the NTA the powers to bring in a by-law involving congestion charges in Dublin city or Cork city?  In respect of planning, people say it takes too long in this country to provide infrastructure and that we must go through too many hoops.  I see this Bill clarifies that where the NTA is required to seek statutory planning approval from An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a particular development, it does not also have to engage in a similar process with the relevant local authorities.  Is it true that local authorities will be bypassed and the NTA will go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of the provision of major infrastructure?</p> <p>Other parts of the Bill concern rapid bus routes.  I see that &euro;650 million could be spent on rapid bus routes from Swords to the airport to the city centre, from Blanchardstown to UCD and from Clongriffin to Tallaght.  This is another way we can improve our public transport.  It is a good idea if we can put in proper bus routes that allow people to move around quickly rather than putting in light rail.  </p> <p>In respect of tax regulation, much of it concerns safety and the safety of passengers.  The fixed charge offences will be implemented immediately.  A taxi can be put off the road for offences.  If I went in with my car for an NCT as a private individual and there was a missing light bulb, a tyre was slightly worn or something small was faulty, I would not pass my NCT.  What must be wrong with a vehicle for it to be failed immediately and put off the road?  It is important that we have confidence.  People cannot be driving vehicles that are defective, particularly in the public transport sector.  How serious must a defect be before a vehicle will be put off the road and the person goes through the appeals process?  </p> <p>The Bill provides for an amendment to the Railway Safety Act 2005 to change the name of the Railway Safety Commission to the Commission for Railway Regulation to reflect the broader remit relating to railway regulation.  We have always said that our rail system is underused and many people find that it is too expensive.  People can get good value on our rail system with on-line ticketing.  As people look more to public transport and the Government tries to encourage them to do this, there will be more value in booking tickets.  </p> <p>The Bill amends the State Airports Act 2014 to clarify certain provisions relating to fixed payment notices.  It seems that airports are not complying with certain by-laws and this will bring certain by-laws into it.  This provision relates to the parking of vehicles, which I presume are cars and that Ryanair or Aer Lingus aeroplanes will be clamped in the area.  A fixed charge can be implemented.  </p> <p>The Bill amends the Road Traffic Act 1961.  I see that the Attorney General has some concern about provisions relating to hit and run incidents.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pat O'Neill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2364"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2364&amp;amp;pid=PatONeill&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Attorney General's advice is that the intention of the law is clear in spite of the error, and the DPP is continuing to take prosecutions under this legislation.  However, it is also the Attorney General's view that the error should be corrected at the earliest available opportunity.  I presume that the Minister or the next Government will try to correct that matter in the next D&aacute;il and Seanad session.  We need by-laws, in particular to deal with incidents of hit and run.

It is important that the law stipulates that there is an immediate disqualification from driving if one leaves the scene of an accident.  </p><p>I commend the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.  The Government is running out of time but this Bill will come into law very soon as it has gone through the D&aacute;il.  I hope that it passes through this House today.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-27a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012700002#CC00200"><p>I welcome the Minister back to the House and concur with all of the remarks made by Senator O'Neill in his respect.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the passage of this Bill, particularly the introduction of harsher sentences for hit and run offences.  We introduced our road traffic Bill 2013 prior to the Minister taking over his brief but I am sure he is familiar with our legislation.  We believe our legislation provided the impetus for the introduction of today's legislation because it sought to crack down on hit and run drivers by introducing a tougher penalties regime and extending the power of arrest by the Garda.  </p> <p>While we welcomed the Government's acceptance of our key recommendations on tougher sentences for persons convicted of hit and run offences, we were disappointed with its refusal to grant additional powers to the Garda to test individuals suspected of a hit and run offence for alcohol intoxication for up to 24 hours, citing legal investigation barriers.  Perhaps the Minister has a view on this.  Perhaps some of the legislation that we have talked about in recent times will address the matter.  For example, we have recently introduced drug testing.  If a lacuna exists then we urge the Government to reconsider as the law incentivises persons involved in a traffic accident to flee the scene of an accident to avoid being tested for alcohol intoxication.  I thought that loophole was closed.  I thought there was a time when one could refuse to be tested and leave the scene of the accident.  I raise the issue because I would like to hear the Minister's view.  </p> <p>I agree with the Minister when he said: "This is a technical Bill but as is often the case with technical Bills, it is an important one."  However, the devil is in the detail.  I shall refer to the transfer or change of name for railways but must first get all of my ducks in a row.  I welcome the changing of the name of the Railway Safety Commission to the commission for railway regulation because it reflects the broadening of its remit in terms of railway regulation.  </p> <p>I also welcome the Minister's commitment to provide Metro North.  He has a particular interest in the project because it would pass through his constituency.  I shall outline the only thing that disappointed me about the project of which I have been a great supporter and will talk about the economic argument in a minute.  I could never quite understand why the last Government and this one never grasped the nettle when it came to this project.  Dublin is the only major capital city in Europe that does not have a direct rail link to an airport so it is quite astonishing that we have done so well in terms of the number of visitors to the country.  Dublin Airport has had a massive increase in passenger numbers in the past year.  Unfortunately, it is still difficult to reach Dublin Airport despite the availability of alternative modes of transport such as taxis, private cars and buses run by various operators.  </p> <p>I am a huge supporter of railways and if I had been a Minister for transport I would have moved might and main to find some way to provide a railway link to the airport.  I know it is not an easy job to do.  There is a commitment to provide the link in 2017.  That seems like a lifetime away and goodness knows what the economic conditions will be like in the intervening years.  Perhaps the Minister will be re-elected.  Maybe I should say that when he gets back in and is appointed to a powerful Cabinet position, I would urge him to seek an earlier completion date and for the project to be given greater priority.  Not only will the rail link - and I particularly refer to the intervening stops along the route in north Dublin and areas such as Ballymun which has been economically downgraded - prove to be economically efficient and beneficial, it will also act as an economic stimulus.  The Minister knows all of the arguments in favour of the project.  I am sorry for going on about it but I had to avail of this opportunity to nail my own colours to the mast.  I am a big supporter of Metro North and the sooner it happens, the better.</p> <p>In the context of changes to disability access in taxis, I read an article on the subject that was published in one of the national newspapers last week.  I am sorry that I did not cut out the article and take it with me to discuss here.  On reading the article two things struck me.  First, the individual who wrote the article is a wheelchair user.  In her article she was highly critical of the lack of access on trains for wheelchair users.  I use the train whenever I can and I thought that there was wheelchair provision given that we have a modern fleet.  I thought further about the matter and realised that a wheelchair user would need help to get on and off a train due to the way that railway platforms and trains are configured.  I sometimes use the DART to travel to and from Connolly Station.  I have noticed that on arrival at the station one is immediately advised to mind the gap between the platform and the trains.  I can confirm that it is a big gap even for an able-bodied person.  Does the Minister have a view on the matter?  Can something be done to improve wheelchair access?  The author of the article also made the point that disabled people could not use their social security or protection card to get through the barriers.  I found her assertion strange because I have seen people use their cards to get through the barriers.  I am sorry that I do not have the newspaper article with me.  I do not want to lead the House astray on the matter but the author did say something about travel cards not working for disabled people who want to use the rail network.</p> <p>In the context of taxis, I welcome the section mentioned by the Minister.  I have read his statement twice but please correct me if I am wrong in my interpretation.  I have deduced from reading his statement that if a taxi is not up to the standards required under the regulations and a person's licence is refused then there is no right of appeal.  That provision is right.  A taxi should be compliant and it is either roadworthy or it is not.  This is a black and white issue.  Like the Minister and many of my colleagues here, I regularly use taxis to get around this city.  I have found that the overall standard of taxis is pretty good and I believe that they have improved a great deal over the past number of years.</p> <p>Another hobby horse of mine is the introduction of a standardised taxi for Dublin.  I remember that the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, who was the Minister for Transport when the first legislation on taxi regulation was introduced in the early 2000s, toyed with the idea of having a standardised taxi for Dublin city similar to the world renowned London taxi but his idea withered on the vine.  It is a pity that we do not have a more distinguished and distinctive taxi for Dublin city, using either colour or a particular model of vehicle, like many European cities.  Obviously a cost would be involved.  I have often wondered if the current Minister has given any thought to the idea.  A London style taxi is wonderful but expensive.  There are a couple of London taxis located around this city but not many.  In the context of the standardisation of vehicles, apart from the maintenance and condition of vehicles, the establishment of a Dublin taxi could be considered by the Department and rolled out at some stage.  The initiative would add to the identity of this city.  The same could be done for the cities of Cork and Limerick but a pilot project could be rolled out in Dublin.  Since the taxi industry has been deregulated taxis now come in all shapes and sizes.</p> <p>Another aspect of the Bill that I am interested in relates to the changes to the airport parking regulations.  Section 6 of the Bill deals with fixed payment notices at airports.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Section 7 sets out a declaration, which states:</p><blockquote>Section 27A (inserted by section 51 of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014) of the State Airports Act 2004 is amended in subsection (1) by inserting &quot;or an offence under section 47(4) of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014 for a contravention of subsection (1)(a) of that section where the person in apparent control of the vehicle concerned allegedly leaves the vehicle or the vicinity of the vehicle,&quot; after &quot;relating to the parking of the vehicle at the airport&quot;.</blockquote><p>In other words, the declaration states that up to now - please correct or clarify this for me - if a person drives to the airport to drop off or collect somebody and leaves the vehicle, it is not a statutory offence.  It is now being introduced that if a person leaves the vehicle it is an offence and he or she can be fined.  That is Big Brother government.  Most people comply, and there are people on duty at Dublin Airport who move the traffic along.  However, there are circumstances where people, particularly but not exclusively people coming from the country, may have travelled a long journey to collect somebody and they are the only driver and the person to be collected is not yet in the arrivals hall.  There is plenty of space to drop off and collect people, which is great, but there needs to be some flexibility built into the system.  That flexibility is currently provided for because I put my hands up and say that I have left my vehicle for about two minutes to dash into the arrivals hall to identify somebody and bring him or her out, but under this new proposal that will change.  It will mean that drivers can now get a fixed penalty.  They will now be fined.  It is a petty.  What has motivated it?  Did it arise from experience of operational procedures at the airports?  It applies to what is termed &quot;State Airports&quot; so it will apply to all of the State airports, namely, Dublin, Cork and Shannon.<br/><br/>Has there been any change with regard to the fixed payments, and this again applies to public service vehicles?  It does not seem to be in the Bill or in the wider Road Transport Bill.  The Minister knows that people who have been prosecuted for parking a car illegally have come before the courts and said that they never received notice of the fine.  The issue seems to be proof of postage of the notice of the fine, but the Bill does not address that issue of those who say they never got notice of a fine.  As the Minister knows, proposals have been made that notices of fines should be sent by registered post because the system is being flouted, and there is no question about that.  I am a little irritated by the fact that when I get a fine I pay it, and then I find that somebody will go to the courts and say they never got it.  Most judges will throw the case out because there is no proof that a person received notice of the fine.  I refer to fixed payments only in the context of their application to taxis.  I think I am right that the same principle would possibly apply here, so the Minister may have a view on that.</p></speech>

As he said, this is a technical bill, and both of my colleagues here have raised the areas of contention, which I will not go back over.  I wish to mention a related matter, and it is not my provisional licence issue, which I have raised on numerous occasions with the Minister.  I happened to be in the home of a hackney driver last week.  I noticed that on his mantelpiece he had a large amount of envelopes and he told me what they were.  He works with a hackney company and every time he goes on a shift he gets a letter from the National Transport Authority, NTA, to say that he is on duty, and when he clocks off he gets another letter from them to say that he clocked off.  Therefore, if he has four shifts of hackney driving for the week, he gets eight letters, and if he has five shifts, he gets ten it acknowledged that he was going on duty, and likewise, when he was finished, he sent a text message and it again acknowledged it.  It seems, considering the amount of hackney drivers there are, that thousands of these letters are going out every week, and I wonder about the cost factor, and why it is necessary.</p></speech>

N&iacute; minic a bh&iacute;mid ag caint lena ch&eacute;ile anseo, but it is pleasure to be here.  I do not normally take the transport brief but I look forward to raising a few points with the Minister.  This is a mainly technical Bill dealing with a number of technical aspects with which we do not have any great issues, but I wish to use the opportunity to raise a number of other issues regarding transport.</p> <p>At present the public transport services owned by the State are CIE, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  These companies have struggled through and survived the worst of the economic downturn but they now face many new challenges.  Some of these challenges are positive.  For instance, it is important that public transport companies are challenged by their service users to become more accessible, intuitive and reliable through the use of innovation and technology.  Despite a slow lead-in in the past few years, these companies have embraced the use of technology to make their services better.  Very few Dubliners under a certain age do not have the Dublin Bus app on their telephone or a Leap card in their wallet, and most people have used online features provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail.  The one failing we see is in the integrated information apps developed by Transport for Ireland, which feel like something created by someone who has never had to depend on public transport in Ireland.  Most people to whom I have spoken about these integrated apps have said they are not worth attempting to use.  Bizarrely, there are two apps provided by Transport for Ireland rather than one integrated app combining real-time information with journey planning.  The addition of the recent mobile top-up for Leap is welcome, but I have heard that many people have installation problems after card details are put in.</p> <p>High fuel costs are being tackled to a degree by the use of other fuel sources and technological innovations in vehicles but more could be done.  Public transport could be given a proper fuel rebate, for instance.  A major challenge is the Government's attack on the pillars of Irish public transport.  Subsidy for public transport, which was already far too low compared to other European states, has been cut by over 20%.  Rubbing salt into this wound, the Government has aggressively sought to undermine public transport companies by ignoring the concerns of workers and putting in motion a privatisation plan which will act as a thin end of the wedge.  Fine Gael and Labour have now driven through their privatisation agenda by planning the tendering to private companies of 10% of public bus routes and 100% of Bus &Eacute;ireann routes in Waterford.  This will not happen for some time but already it has damaged public transport provision.  Earlier this year Bus &Eacute;ireann began the process of removing some routes which received no subsidy from the State but were important in linking rural communities.  It did this because the company is attempting to streamline its services as much as possible so as to protect its public service obligation, PSO, routes from going into private hands in the coming years.  Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus know that the loss of one subsidised route will endanger another route and that with every route lost-----</p></speech>

If the Chair wishes I will turn to specifics regarding taxi drivers where many issues have been raised.  Particularly in Galway the ongoing issues of decals and older cars have been raised with me.  Senator Mooney has correctly noticed some of the wonderful cars in New York and London, the black cabs, etc., many of which are more than ten years old, whereas we have gone to a regime whereby cars of a certain age are decommissioned.  I know some people who had very good-quality, high-end taxis, for example, BMWs or Mercedes, and who have had to trade them in because of the new regulations.  The cars were passing all the tests so the drivers felt that this was a very strange thing to have to do.  They also find that decals are making them a target when they leave the cars at home at night.  There is the issue of them being a target for burglary, but also where somebody is dependent on the car for private use, he or she cannot have a dual use.  It has to be only a taxi.  I have been given the example of the wife of a taxi driver wanting to take the car to do the shopping, but the car is then seen as a taxi and she is given hassle in shopping centres.  This is a very practical issue.</p> <p>A more serious issue in Galway concerns regulations.  These appear to be applied on a nine-to-five basis whereas most of the infringements by taxi drivers who are not playing by the rules happen after hours.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is difficult to get the regulator to deal with issues such as taxis pulling up outside pubs where there is no  official rank; drivers jumping rank and vehicles being driven by people who should not be driving them.  These are the types of issue that are being raised with me on a continual basis.  While I had hoped these issues would be addressed in the context of this legislation, that does not appear to be the case.</p><p>We welcome the new fixed payment notice charges.  We need to ensure that in regulating taxi drivers, punishing wrongdoing and upholding standards we do not mistreat a group of hard working people who are trying to make a living and contributing to the public transport network with good levels of efficiency.  The recent removal across the State of taxi ranks and the failure to provide alternatives are not acceptable.  We need taxis in towns and cities and drivers to be able to ply for hire at ranks.  Construction work is part of a living, breathing city, but drivers have been uprooted by these works without much consideration being given to their needs in providing a service.  We need ranks for taxi drivers and where the customers are.  I understand this is often the role of the local authority, but it is not always easy for councils to respond in situations where there are such major works.  </p><p>The regulation and vetting of taxi drivers are essential in the development of a strong, safe service for the public.  However, while regulation is an obvious necessity, we must ensure it does not take place unfairly and impact unjustly on hard-working people who are trying to make a living.  On the utterly discriminatory attacks on the livelihoods of taxi drivers convicted of offences related to the conflict in the northern part of the country which raged from the 1960s to 2005, I remind the Government that under the Good Friday Agreement, republican and loyalist former prisoners are not to be discriminated against or barred from employment, yet the Bill seeks to do just that.  Drivers who have worked for decades, contributed to the State and provided a quality service without a problem have recently received letters informing them that they will not be allowed to renew their licences.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be working with such drivers to challenge this disproportionate attack on their right to make a living.  </p><p>The Rail Safety Act 2005 makes reference to fostering greater competition.  We struggle to imagine how, in practical terms, various private railway companies operating on the same railway lines will improve efficiency.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on this issue.  This practice evades the innate practical advantage that is a natural monopoly.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes competition should not be the absolute priority as a means of achieving high quality transport services, as it does not.  Instead, the focus ought to be on the reliability of provision and price stability.  The only competition  should be between public transport services competing with private cars as the best way to commute and socialise.  </p><p>I would welcome the Minister's thoughts on the many issues I have raised, particularly those to do with the taxi industry.</p></speech>

Given the broad range of areas covered by the Bill, unsurprisingly a breadth of matters have been raised by each of the Senators who have spoken.  I will try to respond to each of their queries in turn.</p> <p>Senator Sean D. Barrett spoke about the role of the National Transport Authority, NTA, and asked whether it might take on the role of regulatory body in respect of rail services.  I understand the Senator has tabled a number of amendments to provide for this, but he may not now get an opportunity to move them.  He makes the point that because the NTA is the regulatory body for other forms of transport, it would be appropriate for it to also perform that role in relation to the rail market.  That is not an approach that would be possible to take to the rail market in Ireland or more broadly, the reason being that under recent European Union regulations, each member state is required to have a single independent body with a regulatory function in relation to rail services.  We believe it is appropriate that this role be discharged by the Railway Safety Commission which I am satisfied has the expertise and ability to perform the function.</p> <p>Senator Sean D. Barrett also spoke about the impact of a potential metro project on St. Stephen's Green.  The Senator has long been voicing his concern in that regard.  I remain confident that when the project moves through the planning process, many of the matters raised by the Senator will be dealt with.  He also raised the more broader issue of the need for regulation in dispatch services within Ireland.  I am strongly of the view that there is such a need.  I do not believe competition and regulation are in any way incompatible.  Many of the operators involved in providing these services within Ireland accept regulation and understand it has a role to play in the provision of a better service for their consumers, while ensuring their industry is on a sustainable and firm footing.</p> <p>Senator Pat O'Neill made a number of points about the Bill and broader transport policy.  He referenced the fact that funding for public transport infrastructure was due to increase in the coming years under the Government's capital plan.  As a result of the current growth and change in the economy, the Government is able to fund this infrastructure.  Its availability will, in turn, facilitate more sustainable growth into the future.  On the Senator's question about planning applications and where they should be lodged, it is very much dependent on the nature of the planning application being made.  A planning application that falls under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act should be lodged directly with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, while planning applications for many other forms of transport infrastructure should be lodged with the relevant local authority.</p> <p>Senator Pat O'Neill also spoke about changes in technology and the increased number of bookings made online via devices and Apps.  The Bill seeks to ensure we will have in place a comprehensive definition of dispatch operations to reflect in law the type of change taking place in the provision of dispatch services within Ireland.  </p> <p>Senator Paschal Mooney touched on a number of points about the Bill.  He also articulated his support for the metro project and asked what could be done to enable it to commence sooner.  Provision is made in the capital plan, as drafted, for an interim review such that if the economy were to improve further, particular infrastructural projects could be reviewed and, I hope, brought forward.  However, this is dependent on what happens in the economy and the Government of the day.  The speedy delivery of the metro project is exceptionally important.  The Senator is correct in saying it is likely that the project, as planned, will not be open for use by commuters until approximately 2026.</p></speech>

Much of it is driven by how much time it will take to construct a railway order, the understandable work that will need to be done in the lodging of that order with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and how much time it will take the board to consider it.  The procurement process will take some time to complete owing to the magnitude of the project.  All of this must happen before the commencement of construction.  In this regard, I have previously used the analogy of the expansion of the Luas to Phibsborough and Cabra and the linking of the Red and Green lines which, by the standards of Luas, is a substantial project.  In comparison with other public transport projects across Europe and elsewhere it would only be a medium-sized project, but the timeframe involved, in terms of the decision-making process to allow the project to commence and become operational, is four or five years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The metro project is many magnitudes larger than that.  I have always acknowledged that it will take a long time for that to be built.  I hope it will be an option for the next Government, when the capital plan is being reviewed, to look at how that project and other projects could be brought forward or changed to reflect the demand we know is there for them.</p><p>Reference was made to disability access on trains.  I am very much aware of disability access across all forms of public transport and, to digress slightly, I am very pleased with a recent decision I made to make more funding available to Bus &Eacute;ireann to allow it to acquire more coaches, so that all its coaches will be fully wheelchair accessible.  Much work is being done on how we can make our entire coach and bus fleet as wheelchair accessible as possible and Dublin Bus has already done tremendous work in this area.</p><p>With regard to airports and the change planned there, I acknowledge the concerns on the application of that policy.  The main reason it is being brought forward is because of how busy our airports have become - Dublin Airport is case in point - and it is appropriate, in some circumstances, to have the ability to issue a fixed charge notice.</p><p>In regard to uniformity of taxi vehicles, as is the case of London and New York, because we have organised the availability of transport, in terms of taxis, through private vehicles for so long, that is probably not something we will be able to do at any point in the foreseeable future.  However, the uniform branding, the decals and some of the points raised are an important step towards making our taxis more recognisable by the public.  I agree that the quality of the service available has massively improved in recent years.</p><p>Senator Kelly referred to letters he saw in his colleague's home.  I have been getting some information on this but perhaps we will get more information from the Senator on the issue after the debate or during Committee Stage.  The NTA has launched an online service for small public service vehicle, SPSV, users which we believe deals with the need for hackney service drivers to be able to register, in a convenient manner, when they are on duty and for the service they provide.  It is online through a website.  An app and the text service, to which the Senator referred, are available as well as an information telephone line.  During the debate on the Bill, perhaps the Senator will respond back to what I have said in case there is any change.</p><p>I will now respond to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's broad points.  He referred to all the changes happening with regard to technology and the use of public transport.  Ireland was behind the curve on this for a number of years but we have made a fair bit of progress in recent years.  More than one million Leap cards are being used and progress has been made in the past 18 months in the roll-out of the Leap card well beyond Dublin.  The card is available in many cities across the country.  My objective is to extend the card nationwide in the next few years.  It will be especially important for Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail services that the Leap card will be applicable everywhere.  It will be of particular value to be able to use a Leap card when using the Bus &Eacute;ireann services anywhere in the country.  This will be an important improvement beyond where we are now.</p><p>The Senator is correct that there has been a reduction in PSO funding.  However, over the past year, the level of funding has been rebuilt from approximately &euro;200 million with an increase of &euro;28 million on top of that.  Nearly one third of all the cuts have now been rebuilt over the space of budget 2015.  I made the decision on the funding change in recognition of the fact that I want more bus services available across the year and in order for that to happen, additional PSO will be required.</p><p>On the privatisation of 10% of routes, which has been debated in the House for many years, I am sure I will not be able to change the Senator's mind today.  However, those routes have gone out to tender.  It is open to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to tender to win those routes they are currently operating.  That process is under way.  Those new services will be operational from the end of 2016.</p><p>Concerns were raised by constituents about decals and it is a point also raised by my constituents.  However, one of the reasons this is a good change is that while vehicles are privately registered and privately owned, they are providing, and are licensed to provide, a public service.  It is important to brand the vehicles in order to make it clear they are providing a public service.  It also indicates the expectations people might have regarding the level of service, the quality and cleanliness of the vehicles and so on.  There have been huge improvements in that aspect in recent years.</p><p>It is correct that because of the construction of the Luas cross-city project, there has been a reduction in the number of taxi ranks and a change in their locations.  I accept that this situation has been a cause of dissatisfaction to many in the taxi industry but it is our objective, when Luas cross-city is operational, that there will be an expansion in the number of taxi ranks available in the city.  The National Transport Authority has worked with the taxi industry on this.</p><p>I will conclude with the potential privatisation of rail services.  I have made the point publically, and to the European Commission, that due to the small size of our railway market, the mandatory tendering that may apply to other European rail markets do not apply in Ireland.  We only have a single rail network in the State and the interoperability between our rail network and other rail networks is quite limited and is confined to Northern Ireland, in particular, the Dublin-Belfast service.  The situation would be completely different if we were located elsewhere in Europe where national rail markets interchange at many different points at borders with neighbouring countries.  It is different for Ireland and this has been recognised by the European Commission in its recent decision on the fourth railway package now being reviewed and discussed in the European Parliament.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I think I have addressed all the points Senators put to me.  As I said in my opening contribution, this is very much a technical Bill that covers many different aspects of road traffic and public transport legislation.  In many areas we are looking to make some progress.</p><p>I have just been reminded that I did not address the point Senator Mooney made about the Bill Deputy Dooley introduced in the D&aacute;il to create a hit-and-run offence.  We dealt with some of the Deputy's proposals under the Road Traffic Act 2014.  I should have said that a proposal Deputy Dooley made in the D&aacute;il regarding not having the home address of drivers who are registered made public has been incorporated into the Bill.  I should have acknowledged that when I introduced the Bill in the Seanad.</p><p>The Senator asked whether it would be possible for specimens to be tested up to 24 hours after the incident took place.  The advice we received from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety was that it would not be advisable to extend the time for taking specimens to test for intoxication because it might be very difficult to correlate the result with the time at which the incident took place.</p><p>If I have missed any points Senators raised, there will be an opportunity to address them later.</p></speech>

Section 2(h) proposes to insert a subsection (15) into section 13, which would immediately revoke or suspend a licence where a vehicle fails a vehicle standards inspection test.  The effect of this would be that the vehicle that fails a vehicle standards inspection test cannot be used as an SPSV during that appeal period.  I asked how defective a vehicle must be before it is failed.  I trust it will not be over a lightbulb or something like that.</p></speech>

This Bill does not create the ability to do it.  Most of the discussion on congestion charging and multi-point tolling focuses on the M50.  I have said that until we substantially expand our public transport capacity, we would not be in favour of changing that and introducing a new tolling regime.  Given that, I have not made any provision on that area in the Bill.</p> <p>The Senator asked what could cause a vehicle to fail its NCT.  It could well be a lightbulb.  The NCT requires that a vehicle meets a variety of requirements in order to qualify for a certificate.  The change to the appeals mechanism over NCT certificates was mentioned earlier.  The Bill makes a change in that regard.  It became apparent to the NTA under the operation of the current regime that were a vehicle to fail, the licence would still be valid during the period in which the appeal would take place.  Such a vehicle should not be on the road because it has failed its NCT.  If during the period of appeal the vehicle is still on the road, that is clearly a problem.  The Bill changes that appeal mechanism.</p></speech>

There is an ongoing issue with bus transport in County Meath.  Over the past year, the NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann have been carrying out a review of bus services in the county.  About a year ago, people were invited to make submissions.  We did that and there were fears about one or two services.  Gradually through leaks and e-mails from Bus &Eacute;ireann, we have been finding out about extremely substantial changes to bus services in County Meath, which I presume have been organised jointly by Bus &Eacute;ireann and the NTA.  The difficulty is that we really do not know what is happening.  It looks like a cut to services for many areas in the county, including Duleek, Kilmoon, Ratoath, Batterstown and Kells.  There was a significant difference between the indication at the initial consultation seeking people's views on improving services and the proposals being leaked.</p> <p>I know we are discussing a Bill but it relates to public transport.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to grab these organisations by the scruff of the neck and at least let the people know what is going on.  If there is to be public consultation, which is a good idea when changing public transport services, the public should know what is proposed so that they can be consulted properly.  The fear is that many of these cuts are being left until after the general election - there is no definite date as to when they will be implemented.  There is no definite information about what exactly is being proposed.  There is considerable fear and concern in the community.  The Minister is in a good position to get these bodies that come under his remit, albeit not under his direct control, to serve the public and let the public know what is going on.</p></speech>

I am not aware of the specific issue the Senator has mentioned.  I will ask the NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide me an update as to what is happening and I will furnish that to the Senator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-27a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012700002#GG01300"><p>Two days ago <i>The Irish Times</i>reported that an application by Dublin Bus for funding to provide hybrid buses in Dublin had been rejected.  Coincidentally, yesterday I met some representatives, including Mr. Coyne, of Dublin Bus at a briefing that had been organised by my colleague, Deputy Dooley, our party's transport spokesperson.  They pointed out to me that the way the industry was developing in Europe was focusing on more efficient diesel engines.  I was somewhat surprised at this because some weeks ago, representatives of the non-fossilised gas industry made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  They stated that the motor industry particularly in Italy and France has been converting to this hybrid form of non-fossilised gas.  They expected that similar vehicles would become available in Ireland.</p><p>I declare a bit of an interest here in that in the 1970s, I had a liquid petroleum gas, LPG, tank installed in my car.  As pointed out, that was a fossilised fuel that came from oil.  However, the new gas is non-fossilised.  I took the point they made in response to the query I raised about the refusal of funding.  I understand that they have three buses on trial at the moment and they may have been looking for more.  In light of the heightened awareness of the adverse effect of carbon emissions on our climate and the whole issue of climate change, does the Minister not believe this is the way to go?  Was it because the industry norm for buses is different from that for private cars?  That was what they pointed out to me.  I was somewhat surprised that the bus industry was continuing with diesel, albeit a cleaner and more efficient diesel.  All I have read about diesel indicates that regardless of how efficient it is made, it still has a high CO content that adversely impacts on the environment.  I would like to understand this.  I know I am throwing the Minister a policy issue out of the blue.  Has he or have his departmental officials thought about this as the way forward for the public transport system in order to minimise carbon emissions?</p></speech>

I have engaged with Dublin Bus on this matter and it is considering all kinds of measures to make its fleet more environmentally friendly.  The particular challenge in obtaining coaches or buses propelled by alternative fuel sources is that they are much more expensive than the most efficient diesel buses.</p></speech>

We are considering the matter very closely with Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to see what further progress can be made.</p> <p>With regard to the overall public transport network, the answers are obvious but still worth stating.  We must try to make our buses as environmentally friendly as possible.  Services such as the Luas and a metro could have a very positive effect on the carbon-emitting potential of the public transport network.  With respect to the broader use of alternative fuel sources, the Minister for Communications, Energy an Natural Resources, Deputy White, and I have just launched a very short consultation period - it is short because we want action - on the changes we can make that would lead to the broader use of alternative fuels for private car use.  We would be able to make a gain with regard to emissions by making our transport system more environmentally friendly but a bigger challenge now is how we make use of private cars more environmentally friendly.  Some progress has been made with electric cars but it is not enough and their usage is still low when compared with what we hoped or expected.  As the technology relating to electric cars and hybrid vehicles improves on an almost monthly basis, we will review our policy in the area to see if there are steps that the Government can take to encourage more people to use those vehicles.</p></speech>

It is clear we are singing from the same hymn sheet, which is sensible.  I am thinking about the State's transport fleet of private cars.  The people promoting gas made a very convincing argument for the use of gas-fired cars.  Current petrol or diesel cars could be adapted to use that system.  I presume that is relevant to the comments between the Minister and his fellow Minister, Deputy White, and it is being considered as well.</p></speech>

Will the Minister consider magnetic signage?  Many other self-employed people who use their vehicles for work employ such signage so that when the vehicle is parked at home, for example, they can remove the signage and ensure it is safe.  I am informed that the implementation of the regulation is an issue.  Ostensibly, there are people who work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. regulating and policing an industry where work is done 24 hours per day.  Many of the issues brought to my attention arise late at night, so how will the section deal with them in particular?</p></speech>

I have worked with the National Transport Authority on this and the Senator makes a fair point in saying that the greatest use of transport services occurs in the evenings and on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights.  We cannot deal with this legislatively but it is a matter of making the right resources and funding available directly to the National Transport Authority so it can do that work.  We are working on that.  I have met the teams that do this work and that go to the taxi ranks to ensure that taxi regulations are being well administered.  I am also aware of feedback from the taxi industry that it wants to see more of that.  We need to respond by increasing the resourcing, with the NTA being more efficient with its resources, so more work can be done at the time needed.  That is instead of any change we can make in the law itself.</p> <p>The Senator made a point about the signage being magnetic rather than adhesive.  I am very reluctant to go down that path as we have made such progress in the uniform branding of taxi vehicles and in the context of increasing their quality.  I will pass the Senator's observations to the NTA and its chief executive and ask for a report on what it is doing with the issue.  I will share any feedback with the Senator.</p></speech>

If I interpreted those remarks correctly, he referred to the Dublin-Belfast line as being perhaps the only example that would be part of that integrated policy.  Before Christmas, as one of its members, I had the honour of representing the transport committee, along with its Chairman, Deputy John O'Mahony, and Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice at a seminar organised by the European Parliament on this matter.  All three of us made the same contribution in various ways but a common theme was that the policy adopted by Europe, which seems to have been agreed by the Irish Government, is based on population density figures.  This means that the vast majority of the rest of the country is not eligible for funding under this European rail network.  The Dublin-Belfast line is eligible because it is on the east coast, which has a larger population.</p> <p>We returned from Brussels and discussed just last week our visit in the context of the end-of-year report to the committee.  The committee agreed that it would write to the Minister directly and ask if his Department would encourage a change in the criteria that would allow for financial encouragement for peripheral areas in the country.  The development of the rail network will not stop; it may be piecemeal in nature but it will go on.  I have a great hope that a Minister for transport in the near future will reopen the western rail link, even if only for freight transportation.  Irish Rail is in favour of that and neither the Government nor the Department is against the proposal in principle.  It is a financial issue.  The development of a rail network will go on in different ways and areas.  If we remain party to this European policy that is based on high population densities, we will not get any financial benefit from Europe for the development of rail in the peripheral regions.</p> <p>I am not sure if the Minister has had the opportunity to read the correspondence, which would have been sent in the past week.  If he has not read it, I respectfully request that the Minister take the time to do so and, hopefully, respond.</p></speech>

I am sure it is on its way to me.  I assume the funding referred to by the Senator is the TEN-T funding stream.  In my experience of dealing with TEN-T funding, the criteria tend to be carefully set by the European Commission.  When I receive the letter, I will respond to the committee.</p> <p>The State faces a challenge in its further expansion of the rail network in particular but not so much in building it, although that is expensive in itself.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is why TEN-T funding can help and is helping with some exploratory works that are being done on the development of a freight line for the Shannon Foynes Port.  However, the great cost the State faces is in the maintenance of rail and then in the public service obligation, PSO, funding that is needed to provide the rail service itself.  In my experience in recent years, the capital cost has less to do with the construction of a rail network and far more to do with its maintenance.  Moreover, the current funding needs created by the maintenance of passenger services on the rail network are also extremely substantial.  I am sure that if any future Minister must make a decision on the expansion of the rail network, these concerns will receive as much weight, if not more, than the cost of expanding the network itself.</p></speech>

While I was aware he would be familiar with the European project, in the context of the rail network to which I referred and going back to our earlier dialogue, there is growing awareness of the adverse impact on the environment of CO2 emissions.  There is growing awareness that railways can make a valuable contribution and there may now be a rethink on taking more freight off the roads and putting it back on the rail network, which appears to have been neglected over a period of years, perhaps as much by Irish Rail as by any Government intervention.  This is why I am a particular proponent of the re-opening of the western rail corridor for freight initially.</p> <p>The argument may not have been put to the Minister directly - although it may have been at one of his presentations before the transport committee - but it certainly has been made by a group from the west of Ireland and it links in with the Minister's comments about the development of the Shannon Foynes Port, namely, it would be more economically efficient to run freight down the west of Ireland, linking up with Foynes and over to Waterford and out than the way it moves at present, which is to travel eastwards to Dublin and then downwards.  There is a powerful economic case, as well as a climate change case, and so on.</p> <p>I appreciate these are the dying days of the present Government and the Minister will not be able to pull rabbits out of the hat but in policy terms, the Department should not take its eye off the ball with regard to the freight issue in the overall context of what I have argued.  I appreciate the point about maintenance but having examined the costings from Irish Rail, I understand the maintenance costs would be considerably lower for freight than would be the case for passenger services, for which one would be obliged to re-open stations and so on.  As a first step, to maintain the rail network and to provide a more efficient contribution to the national economy, the Department should keep this proposal in its sights and on the radar as a policy issue.</p></speech>

It is mean-spirited and unfair to consumers at airports to introduce this new law, which I believe will impose an unnecessary burden.  I believe the current system is working very well, despite the fact that this issue has come up.  As I have seen it, even with the current flexibility in the system that allows people to leave their cars for a short period, the system is working well, certainly in Dublin Airport.  I do not believe there are major parking problems in either Cork and Limerick.  It may be more an issue at Dublin and in light of that, I intend to oppose the section.</p></speech>

Our group has used its time to consider this issue and I have spoken about it at every available opportunity, including in numerous Adjournment debates and debates on legislation, in an effort to bring the plight of children to the fore.  This is the critical issue of our time.  In fact, Dietrich Bonhoeffer has said the test of the morality of a society is what it does for its children.  I fear our failures and the treatment of children in the direct provision system will be the subject of a Ryan report in the future, but we have an opportunity to make changes now.  All too often we look back in shock at what happened in the past and say how desperate it was, but what we do now with that knowledge is on what we should be judged.<br/><br/>My entry point to the issue of direct provision is from a children's rights perspective.  My perspective has been informed by my previous work in the Children's Rights Alliance, the recommendations of the Government appointed special rapporteur on child protection, Professor Geoffrey Shannon, the concerns raised consistently by advocacy groups, my visits to two direct provision asylum centres as an independent Member of the Seanad and the recommendations of the working group.  It has taken me a long time to wade through the mire that is the political discourse on the direct provision system.  I have struggled to understand the distinction drawn - I still do not agree with it - between children cared for by the State, as children in the direct provision system are described, and children in the care of the State as those in foster care and other care systems are described.  I have argued strenuously that children are children, irrespective of their status, and that it is stretching credulity to claim that children in the direct provision system are in the care of their parents in circumstances where their autonomy to make even basic decisions about their children's care, for example, on what and when to eat, is so limited as to render it absent.  <br/><br/>The direct provision system is detrimental to the welfare and development of asylum seekers and, in particular, the 1,225 children residing in direct provision accommodation throughout Ireland.  There is a plethora of difficulties, including the dubious  legality of the direct provision system, the lack of an independent complaints mechanism for residents, the absence of independent inspection of centres in which children reside, the decision by Ireland to opt out of the EU directive to allow asylum seekers to enter the workforce if their applications have not been processed after one year and the fact that there are no prospects post-secondary education for young asylum seekers.  It is like hitting the pause button for an uncertain and, doubtless, lengthy period.  <br/><br/>I appreciate that we have made some moves, but for most of the children, there is this cliff, the fettering and erosion of normal family dynamics and functioning, the lack of autonomous decision-making and the negative impact on the mental health of adults and children in the direct provision system.  The ultimate failure lies in the length of time people remain in the system waiting to have their claims processed.  I note the efforts the Government has made to reduce the length of time involved through the International Protection Act 2015 by introducing a single procedure to deal with international protection applications, but the reality is that the average length of stay is four years.  However, a significant number have remained within the system for five to ten years.  Some 55% have been on the waiting list for more than five years.  I ask the Minister of State to think of all the things we have achieved in the past five years when he is on the election trail.  There are people who have been in the direct provision system for that period of time.  What a substantial loss of time it has been for the individuals, families and, particularly, children who have spent their entire childhood in direct provision centres.  They are waiting for their lives to resume.<br/><br/>I was saddened to read in the final report on the child care law reporting project by Dr. Carol Coulter and her team, presented in November 2015, that children born in 2007 were still in the direct provision system.  The only time they spent outside it was when they were placed in foster care while their mother received treatment for a mental illness.  <br/><br/>There are more than 17 recommendations in the report of the working group which are specific to children and young people.  I take the opportunity to thank the Children's Rights Alliance and its member organisations for ensuring the unique vulnerability of children in the direct provision system was not lost in the process.  I will cover briefly the first of those recommendations that we have cited in the motion.  My colleague, Senator Fiach Mac Conghail<b>, </b>will speak to the others.  <br/><br/>There is a need for child-friendly materials containing relevant legal information.  The reality for all of us in full health is that the system is very legalistic; as it can be intimidating, people need support, particularly children who are unaccompanied and seeking guidance on how to pass through the system and for what they need to apply.  We need to ensure the material is in a language they can understand in order that they can appreciate the ramifications of the decisions they will take.<br/><br/>The remit of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children should be extended to include complaints about services provided, transfer decisions and so on.  Ireland ratified the third optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which involves a communication procedure.  It allows individual children, groups of children and their representatives, including those in the direct provision system, to submit a complaint to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child about specific violations of their rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  I had the privilege of attending the hearing on Ireland before the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  The question was rightly asked how Ireland had in place a system that allowed children in the direct provision system to make a complaint to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child but yet they had no right to make it to the Ombudsman for Children.  How can this be the case?  Technically, the recommendation that the remit of the Ombudsman for Children be extended is supported in the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 which in section 69 includes a provision on the referral of complaints to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  Technically, it requires nothing more than a ministerial order or a statutory instrument similar to the one made in 2012 when the decision was made to extend the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to receive complaints from children in prison.  It is a question of political will.  It is absurd that one can report to a UN body based in Geneva but not to the Ombudsman for Children.  I know that the Ombudsman for Children is ready and willing to receive these complaints and wants to be there for all children in Ireland.<br/><br/>The lack of an independent complaints mechanism is completely out of step with the jurisdiction conferred on the office of ombudsman across the Continent.  In November 2014, in CA and TA - a minor - <i>v.</i>the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Social Protection, the Attorney General and Ireland, Mr. Justice Colm Mac Eochaigh found that the RIA's complaint procedure was deficient, not sufficiently independent, owing to the fact that it was the final arbiter in the process and that some elements of its house rules were unlawful.  I do not care what anybody says, I trust the system, yet I would not be comfortable in making a complaint to those who I perceive as being part of the asylum system.  We need to develop a welfare strategy and ensure all children have a named social worker based within the Child and Family Agency, not within the system in which a decision will be made on an application.  I have argued for the application of the HIQA national standard for the protection and welfare of children, for the involvement of the Health Service Executive's child and family services, particularly where a referral is made by the child and family services unit in the RIA to the HSE of a child.  It is shocking that there is still no independent inspection regime or national standards for direct provision centres, given that we know that there is a significantly higher referral rate for child protection and welfare cases from direct provision centre than among the general population.  In one in four cases at least one parent is from an ethnic minority or an asylum seeker or Traveller.  I implore the Minister of State to be cognisant of the consistent findings in child care law reporting projects that social exclusion, poverty, isolation, mental health issues and disability are common features of mothers and fathers facing court proceedings and the acknowledgement that minority groups, including asylum seekers, are particularly vulnerable.  <br/><br/>My colleague, Senator Fiach Mac Conghail, will speak in greater detail about the issues related to the weekly allowance.  There is also the issue of those seeking jobs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ireland and Lithuania are the only two EU member states that apply a blanket prohibition on asylum seekers entering employment or setting up a business in the state.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  This might be our last time engaging formally.  The Minister of State might be busy over the next while as we wait to be nominated or re-nominated.  I wish him all the best in the general election.  In his short time as Minister he put an impetus and full public support behind the report of the working group on improvements to the protection process.  I acknowledge the chairman of the Abbey Theatre, but more important the chair of the final report, which is an exemplary document.  This is the benchmark.  There is no need for us in either of these Houses or in any future Oireachtas to revisit the matter except to update the data.  Nothing else is required.  I would like to hear the view of the Minister of State on the matter.  </p><p>The report is an extraordinary document.  It is a historical document of anthropological importance.  It contains much detail.  All Departments and agencies, from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office to the Department of Social Protection and Tusla, were part of the working group.  It is an extraordinary achievement that there was no dissenting voice or minority report.  I accept there was one resignation.  Ultimately, this is a well lauded and well researched document, which has a considerable status in any way we might benchmark or judge the Government and future Governments.</p><p><font color="#4F4F4F">  The report took a while.  It was published in June 2015.  The Independent group in the Seanad has spent quite a long time addressing the issue.  I will never forget it.  To my shame, before I had the honour of being nominated and appointed as a Senator I was never in a direct provision centre.  My first visit was with Senator van Turnhout and Senator Zappone on a cold, snowy March afternoon in 2013.  That is already more than two years ago; it is almost three years ago at this stage.  It was a depressing time.  It was depressing to leave the Athlone direct provision centre.  There was nothing wrong with it except it was soulless.  It was devoid of humanity.  Everything was done legally that I could see yet what struck me centred around the basic ritual of cooking dinner &ndash; one might call it a human right.  How could anybody in this State define what a family is if they cannot cook around a cooking ring, gas fire or whatever else in a kitchen?  It took me a couple of days to try to articulate that.  In a way, that is why we wanted to include a reference to it.  It is chilling when one sees the description in the report and the reference to it in the recommendations.  Recommendation 4.75 describes the need for residents to set up a sandwich making facility providing a selection of yoghurts, juices and fruit etc. at breakfast time in the canteen, as is done in some centres.  That in itself is an extraordinary description of what is absent in many of the centres.  The report recommends the Mosney model as one that should be rolled out.  I would like to hear what has been done in that regard.</font></p><p><font color="#4F4F4F">  The Government has not come up with a counter-motion but it is important for us as Senators and legislators to hold the Government to account.  Families in direct provision cannot call themselves a family if they are denied the very ritual of making a meal in the morning or having the ingredients required to make a sandwich.  That is something on which I would like the Minister of State to comment.</font></p><p><font color="#4F4F4F">  The motion outlines that 1,225 children are still in direct provision.  Has the number decreased since the publication of the June 2015 report?  Are the numbers going down or up?  Family dignity also extends to another major recommendation in the report, namely, that the weekly allowance for adults should increase from &euro;19.10 to &euro;38.74 and for children from &euro;9.60 to &euro;29.80.  The Minister of State made an announcement that the latter payment should be increased by &euro;6.  Such an increase would bring the payment for a child to &euro;15.60, which does not go far enough.</font></p></speech>

As someone said to me yesterday a 15 year old is still a child.  There are demands on children on a weekly basis.  I have two daughters myself who were once teenagers.  Costs arise when they go to the party of a classmate or go out with friends.  Having seen the direct provision centre in Athlone I do not know how children could go from there to see a film or become involved in whatever cultural activities they might require to enhance and support their own emergence as young adults in this State.  The sum of &euro;15 is such a paltry amount.  What was the reason behind only increasing the payment by &euro;6?</p><p><font color="#4F4F4F">  The great thing about the report is that everything is costed.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Howlin, was represented on the working group.  I echo Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s statement.  The lack of political will is stalling the implementation of many of the recommendations.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on the weekly allowance and also the cooking facilities.</font></p></speech>

Given the day that it is in it there is much talk about the banking inquiry, the fiscal rectitude of the country and of policy makers, but very often we overlook the real issues affecting people who live within the State.  Those who live in direct provision facilities should, under the Constitution, given the year that is in it, have exactly the same rights, opportunities and level of equality available to every other child or citizen within this country.  We have accepted those people and we have provided them with a new opportunity but, unfortunately, that opportunity is very restricted.</p> <p>I commend what Senator Mac Conghail said.  I have not read all of the report but I read certain parts of it in preparation for today&rsquo;s debate.  The report is very detailed.  I understand the chairman of the working group is present this afternoon.  I agree that the working group has done the State and the asylum system some service.  The report has identified all of the shortcomings in the direct provision service and looked at the 7,937 people in the system on 16 February 2015.  Alarmingly, 55% of those people were in the system at that point in time for five years or more.  That is unacceptable.  Senator Mac Conghail has outlined the circumstances in which those individuals, children and their families have to live.  Those of us who are lucky enough to have a home in this country take it for granted that those facilities are readily available but, unfortunately, we know from the homeless crisis and those in direct provision that some people are living in circumstances in which many of us would not like to find ourselves.  The State has an obligation to intervene.  The intervention that is being provided is not being provided quickly enough or effectively enough.  Grave shortcomings have been identified in the report, which should act as a blueprint for the transitions that are required and ensure that the agencies that have not been fulfilling those responsibilities will take action.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A number of those agencies have been referred to and are outlined in the Private Members' motion that has been brought before the Seanad this evening.</p><p>As this Seanad goes into its twilight era, as we go into the final weeks before a general election, and as we approach the centenary celebrations of 2016 we have to reflect on what is really important as a society.  We have to decide whether it is more important to drive the economic recovery while allowing impoverished children, and others who are impoverished within our country, to stay in the position they are in.  It is important to drive economic recovery and to share and reap the rewards that it brings.  This country is a welfare state, as are most western democracies.  We are no different.  The welfare we provide in direct provision is not adequate and does not meet its purpose.  One of the recommendations I read was on the issue of school children and the provision of an educational initiative for principals and boards of management to enlighten them on the impoverished circumstances in which such children find themselves.  It should not have to happen yet it was one of the recommendations in the report.  Those children should have the same opportunity as every other child within the State.  We have taken them on board and given them a new life but that new life is not what it should be.  The recommendations, as has been said by the sponsors of the Private Member's motion, have outlined it much better than I could.  They are at the cutting edge and have done much work in this area over the last five years.  I commend them for putting it forward this evening.  It is unfortunate that there are not more Members present to debate this important issue which must be debated and must be taken on by Government.  </p><p>There are roadblocks, which there will be in every Department, but unless the political will is there to challenge those roadblocks nothing will happen.  I am not throwing a political charge at the Government on this issue because it is an issue that has been around for some time.  It must be addressed urgently.  It will be helpful if decisions can be made quickly before the election, through ministerial orders or otherwise.  Some work has been done on making this contribution but it is not nearly enough, given the expensive living environment in which we find ourselves.  My contribution is aimed at supporting the motion and I hope the Minister of State will have some enlightening words to say this evening.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has a great sense of social justice.  He is not afraid to express his view or to say that something is wrong when it is wrong.  That is refreshing in politics because while we might think we get a lot of it, we actually do not.  On that note, I wish him well over the next three to four weeks.  I hope it works out for him.</p> <p>I support this Private Members' motion and I am glad that an amendment has not been tabled because this is a serious issue for Seanad &Eacute;ireann, which has prided itself on its pioneering campaigning on issues of exceptional importance to the citizens of Ireland.  This is an issue of exceptional importance to the people of this country.  I say this country because the people who come here seeking asylum and shelter do so because they are escaping a very difficult situation in their native countries.  Let us not forget that millions of Irish people left here as a result of poverty and travelled all over the world.  While they did not receive a universal welcome everywhere they went, by and large they did.  When they were allowed to work, they made a significant contributions to the countries in which they worked.  We all know of famous people such as John F. Kennedy and others who were enormously successful and who were the grandchildren and great grandchildren of immigrants from this country.  There were thousands more who have repeated - perhaps not to the same extent - the phenomenal success in the areas to which they moved.</p> <p>What is the difference between that and people coming to this country now that we are a First World country, in spite of our recent difficulties?  There is none.  The people who come here seeking refuge should be allowed to demonstrate their talents, contribute to society, build our economy, be part of our future, help us to carve it out and sculpt how this country sees itself in future.  There is talent in the direct provision centres.  I have visited a number of them with my good friend Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh who has excelled himself on this issue and who often makes some of us question whether we are doing enough.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh never stops, which is to his eternal credit.</p> <p>The all-party working group with Senator van Turnhout and others has driven this issue.  It is an issue that has been driven by Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister empathises with the situation and, after being elected, set up a working group which made very fine recommendations that are being implemented, although not as quickly as we would like.  However, the political will exists and I commend the sincerity with which it is being driven.  There is much work left to be done.  I hope this Government is returned after the election.  If it is I would be very confident that the job will be finished.  In that case, we will put an end to the despicable situation regarding direct provision and will treat people who come here for refuge with some dignity and respect.  We will harness their talents, what is good about them and their culture and integrate them, their culture, their ways of life and their beliefs into our society to foster a better Ireland where everybody is equal.</p></speech>

I raised the issue of direct provision in October 2014 and was told in this House - I think by the Minister of State - that it would all be sorted out by April.  That was accepted by the House but it has not been addressed.  Will the Minister of State give us a progress report?  What has actually changed?  Apparently there has been some increase in the financial provisions for children but I am not sure that much else has changed.  It is incumbent upon the Minister of State to tell the House if there has been some change.  I accept his bona fides.  He is a good and conscientious Minister of State and, like Senator Conway, I would like to see him re-elected.  I agree with Senator Conway that he is the kind of person we need in public life.  However, there is the question of the delivery of his promises.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I note, on that occasion, that we would have won that legislation only for the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il jumped ship at the last minute, and its three votes collapsed the Bill.  I presume it assumed that something would happen and I do not think it has.  It was the usual dog in the manger party politics.  I do not blame my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues in this House for that.<br/><br/>It is noticeable that the motion before the House falls into three sections: the invocation of various international treaties; a concentration on children and their rights under this; and finally, the question of an inspectorate, the question of food and so on.  There are three distinct sections.<br/><br/>The history of this motion began in 1999, on International Human Rights Day, coincidentally, when the Government proposed a system of direct provision.  In 2001, the Reception and Integration Agency was formed.  However, there was no provision for paying asylum seekers any kind of proper financial provision.  In 2009, Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, successfully challenged the intervention of the Government which prevented these asylum seekers from accessing social welfare.  They won in the court.  What was the reaction of the Government?  It was to reverse this court decision by legislation.  That, I believe, shows the attitude, not of this Government, but of the Government of that time.  There has been a series of cases that I recited when I was introducing my Bill.  One example was presided over by Ms Justice Harding Clark, who said:</p><blockquote>Sometimes the court is called upon to review a decision which is so unfair and irrational and contains so many errors that the judicial review case seems an inadequate remedy to redress the wrong perpetrated on an applicant.  This is such a case.</blockquote><p>She sent it back to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which was completely unrepentant.  It was only on the third occasion that the gentleman in question had his application accepted.<br/><br/>Ms Justice Harding Clark talked about decisions being &quot;unfair and irrational&quot;.  I wish to second what was said by Senator van Turnhout about the extraordinary distinction between people cared for by the State and people in the care of the State.  I cannot see any rationale for a distinction.  What is worse, children can and have made complaints to the UN committee in Geneva, yet they are unable to make them to our own Ombudsman for Children.  That is a shocking situation.  I would say to the Minister that as he has a few days left in his current term of office - as we understand the Taoiseach is going to the Park on Tuesday next - he could make a ministerial order about this to empower and involve the Ombudsman for Children.  I ask the Minister to do that.  It would be a noble gesture as he leaves office.  The Ombudsman for Children has consistently appealed to the Government to be included in this system.  Therefore, there is absolutely no reason, with goodwill, this should not be done.<br/><br/>I turn to the question of the parents and family life.  Many people say that direct provision does not provide a normal family environment.  For growing children this is terribly important, as a prolonged spell living in this institutional setting can inhibit a child's healthy growth and development.  As a result of this, for most families, who are the majority of residents being accommodated in centres where food is provided on a full board basis, family interactions around food are dictated by strict meal times and limited food choice.  I raised this when I was introducing my legislation.  One of the things that consolidates family is the family meal.  There are also different cultural traditions.  The kind of food provided in direct provision is completely unsuitable for babies, toddlers and children.  It is high in salt, sugar and fat content and it disempowers the parents.  The parents are expected to hand out this slop to their children, without any intervention themselves.  They cannot cook themselves and there is no respect for their religious or cultural traditions.  What do the children pick up from this?  They pick up their parents' lack of empowerment.  That makes it critically difficult.  It can create a situation where children grow up without any memories of a shared family meal being cooked.  The report of the working group on the protection process has a section on the effects of this on family life and children, which includes the following:  </p><blockquote>Parents often cited their feelings of inadequacy.  Their authority as parents and capacity to act as role models for the children are undermined by their economic dependency and their lack of control over their daily lives.  They cite a lack of capacity to infuse their traditions and culture in their children due to the lack of private family living space and cooking facilities.</blockquote><p>One can understand that there is a feeling of cultural deprivation there.  The last time I spoke on this issue I quoted an asylum seeker saying, &quot;Frankly, I feel I am eating in Guantanamo as security people are standing there with walkie-talkie radios, talking to each other and it is not a place you would wish to eat.&quot;  I think we need to take this into account.  The idea that somebody feels as if they were in Guantanamo is rather chilling, and I would like to appeal to the Minister because we have this concept called the best interests of the child.  This Government, to its credit, has striven to implement the best interests of the child throughout Irish legislation.  I think the question of the best interests of the child should be taken into account when making legislation in this area.<br/><br/>I wish to put on the record some of the voices of people involved directly in the situation from the report of the working group.  One such voice says that the &quot;family has little control over decision-making regarding family life&quot;.  What does that do for parental authority?  Another is quoted as saying, &quot;Neither the parents nor the children can enjoy privacy.  It is also desirable to offer families a minimum of two rooms.&quot;  Another resident said, &quot;It is not normal for children to grow up in a situation where they have not seen their parents cook or where they are not sharing a meal in private.&quot;  Another is quoted as saying, &quot;When one has children, it is not easy to instil one's own cultural values on them, as they end up learning things from other residents.&quot;  The other residents may come from completely different cultural backgrounds.  The children, naturally, are imitative, and they pick up from these things rather than from their own cultural background.  Finally, &quot;Direct provision militates against children leading a life integrated in their schools and wider community - difficult to have their friends over to play.&quot;  We must think in terms of the education process and people growing up, doing their junior certificate and leaving certificate, while their lives are being held in quandary.  <br/><br/>I ask the Minister of State - and I am sure my colleagues on various sides of the House would agree with this - that he urgently make an order allowing children to make a complaint directly to the Ombudsman for Children.  I very much look forward to hearing him say to this House that he will enact this provision.  It would be a glorious way to leave office and I believe it would be in concert with the fact that, unusually, this Private Members' time has no amendment to it.  It is the will of the entire House.  I ask the Minister of State to listen to what we are saying today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-27a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Moloney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012700002#NN00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I would like to commend the Taoiseach's nominees on bringing forward this important motion.  It is a fair and balanced motion and seeks clarification and an update.</p> <p>As we are all well aware, the Government published a report on the protection process on the direct provision system last June and we are very honoured to welcome the chairman of the report group, Dr. Bryan McMahon, to the gallery.  This report contained more than 173 recommendations.  Any report that contains 173 recommendations clearly identifies that a lot of change needs to be made.</p> <p>Today's motion deals primarily with children currently living in direct provision centres.  While I appreciate that the Government has increased the payment made to children in direct provision from &euro;9.60 to &euro;15.60, it still remains a paltry sum when one takes into account the needs of children.  One can only imagine how dreadful it must be to live for years in a shelter, when at the outset that period was meant to be six months.  Many remain in direct provision for several years.  The needs of the families and, most importantly, of the children of asylum seekers have to be met.</p> <p>We must look at the right of a child not just to life, but also to life experiences, a concept which is limited not only to direct provision.  Children did not choose to be brought to this country, nor indeed to be born into direct provision, but many are.  Imagine going to school and never being able to invite your friend back to your home.  Imagine never being able to attend a school friend's birthday party because one simply does not have the money to buy even the cheapest of birthday gifts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Moloney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2356"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2356&amp;amp;pid=MarieMoloney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are never able to go to see a movie with a friend or partake in any activity that costs money.  I acknowledge the working group for its hard work, giving this minority group a voice to express its concerns.  Reports by the Immigrant Council of Ireland and the Irish Refugee Council have scrutinised the direct provision system and they found poor living conditions which could be damaging to health and mental health.  Ireland is one of two EU countries that does not allow asylees to work.  They do not have access to social welfare, rent allowance or social housing.  In simple English, they are unable to experience a normal family life which many of us take for granted.  I appreciate that asylum seekers are obliged to go through the process and take proper and legal steps to be able to remain in the country.  However, the length of time the process takes is frustrating for the asylum seekers and those who represent them and who are fighting for their rights.  Senator van Turnhout outlined data on the numbers of people waiting and how long they have been waiting.  I have made inquiries and am informed that each month between 60 and 80 residents in direct provision are getting leave to remain.  This great but not fast enough for most of them and I hope the process will speed up.</p><p>As outlined in the motion by the Senators, Ireland has ratified the optional protocol and a communications procedure of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which allows individual children, including those in direct provision, to submit complaints concerning specific violations of their convention rights.  There is, however, no provision to make a complaint to the Ombudsman for Children.  It is a very reasonable request that children in direct provision come under the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children has welcomed the proposal for the establishment of a committee to set standards for direct provision and an inspectorate to look at direct provision centres to see if the new standards are working.  This also gives the children the feeling of inclusion in an agency that would help improve their lives.  During its term, the Government has done a lot for the protection of children, such as the Children First legislation and the setting up of Tusla, but we must extend the same rights to children in direct provision.  Families should be able to at least try to keep life as normal as possible for children while they await their applications for asylum to be processed.  Nobody should have to wait for seven years or more.  For some asylum seekers, it has been seven years of totally inadequate facilities in which to rear a family - as has been clearly outlined by other Senators - such as no cooking facilities and meals at the same time every day.  Everyone must have the same meal as there is no variety on any given day.  There are different nationalities, cultures and religions within each direct provision centre and yet there is no facility to accommodate people with the foods they may need or are used to.  Children may have to live in a room with their entire family, possibly with young adults and their parents and share a bathroom with other residents of the centre.  With regard to education, children have access to primary and secondary schools but finance becomes an issue.  Children may not have funds to partake in such things as school outings or extra-curricular activities.  The Minister of State, as a teacher, knows the extra costs for families when it comes to education.  It is the little things the children cannot do because they do not have the money.  They probably cannot take a swimming lesson or go on outings other children can go on because their parents can afford it.</p><p>I acknowledge the work done by the Government to help students to access third level education, if they have been in the country for five years.  The students are very limited in what college they can attend as they would not be able to finance themselves through college.  Even if they receive the special rate of the SUSI grant, it would only barely cover the accommodation costs, so the students are obliged to stay near the direct provision centre and are limited in what college or course they can take.  The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, is doing its best to ensure all residents' basic needs are met.  However, we must go further than that or, as former Supreme Court Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness has predicted, one day maybe not in the too distant future, we will have a Taoiseach standing in the D&aacute;il making a public apology for the damage done to people during their time in direct provision.  Direct provision could have long-lasting adverse effects on the health and mental health of many residents.  </p><p>I acknowledge the work done to date by this Government but I urge whatever party is in Government after the next general election to continue the work to ensure anyone in direct provision is treated with dignity and respect and their applications are expedited as quickly as possible.  Most of these people have fled their own countries in fear of their lives to avoid poverty, torture and even death.  They do not expect Ireland to be the land of milk and honey but they would hope to receive fair and dignified treatment by the authorities and to live in a decent standard of accommodation while their application is being processed.</p><p>I will conclude by thanking the Taoiseach's nominees for tabling this motion.  It is a good motion and they have always brought forward good motions in this House.  They will probably be in the Lower House or in this House again in the future and that they will bring forward good motions again.</p></speech>

It is important to always state in this House that what is good about this Parliament is that when questions are asked about immigration policy and protection policy, they come from a position of compassion.  We are not having in Ireland what they are having in Denmark at the moment.  We are having a conversation in Ireland where Government is being pressed to have potentially a more humanitarian approach.  We do not have political posturing on an anti-immigration type platform.  That is something we have to hold on to and about which we do not become complacent.</p></speech>

I believe that is appropriate and I hope we can hold on to that.</p> <p>The term direct provision describes the system whereby the State directly provides accommodation and other ancillary needs for those who apply for asylum in Ireland.  When an applicant presents himself or herself for protection, this State is in the position to immediately offer an applicant a place to stay, shelter, a bed, three meals a day and other services on a voluntary basis.  The fact that Ireland, even at the height of its financial challenges, has maintained its commitment to a system of directly providing for applicants' needs is important and clearly demonstrates the State's commitment to support those fleeing persecution.</p> <p>The Government acknowledged that what was to be a temporary system of shelter and provision has evolved into a more long-term provision and it is here that many challenges have arisen.  This Government established a high level working group in October 2014 to report to it on improvements in the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers.  A comprehensive report, including 173 recommendations was submitted to Government by the chair, Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, and published on 30 June 2015 and it is good to see him in the House this evening.  This Oireachtas and those living in direct provision owe him a great debt of gratitude.</p> <p>The report's key conclusion was that the system of directly providing for applicants' needs had evolved from being a short-term measure into a long-term one primarily as a result of the multi-layered determination and appeals process.  The document held up by Senator Fiach Mac Conghail is the only document the Department is working off.   Anybody facing into this election should make the commitment that document is the only document that any of us, on returning to these Houses, and hopefully returning to Government, should be seeking to implement in its entirety.</p> <p>Applicants are currently involved in a sequential process where each element of their refugee application is considered, appealed or judicially reviewed and exhausted before any other information such as their qualification for subsidiary protection, can be considered.  The sequence of appeal and review is then possibly repeated and exhausted before any other humanitarian matters can finally be considered for permission to remain.  This sequential application system has meant that some applicants' needs are directly provided for by the State for long periods of time.</p> <p>The report urged action on addressing this length of time issue and the Government with the approval of this House, passed the International Protection Bill on 18 December 2015, addressing 26 of the report's 78 recommendations specifically in relation to the protection determination process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The successful implementation of this reform should ensure that in future, delays in the processing of applications will not be the cause of persons spending lengthy periods in direct provision.</p><p>While the International Protection Act's scope did not extend to what is called direct provision, it deals with the application process and by extension those in direct provision and the length of time they will spend there.  There have been calls for direct provision to be abolished but these are consistently made in a context of an absence of any alternative system being proposed.  As a Government responsible for protecting vulnerable people, we can not leave them to their own devices or to some unspecified system that those who call for abolition have never set out a practical alternative.</p><p>Regarding the operation of the direct provision centres, all contracts entered into by the Department follow approved tendering procedures.  We would welcome applications from groups or organisations which have expressed great concerns about the standards in direct provision to submit their proposals to provide, run and manage such centres.  As recently as last August, the Department invited expressions of interest from persons interested in providing accommodation and ancillary services for persons seeking asylum in the State.  The Department continues to welcome such expressions of interest.  It is my understanding that an open, transparent and competitive tendering process will commence shortly for the management of State owned accommodation centres.  For the information of the House, I have visited many of the centres, two in Waterford, three in Dublin, Mosney, Laois, Galway, two in Limerick, Clare, Mayo and Sligo, so I know what I am talking about.  The State funds the service providers and I reiterate once again that it is open to any group which feels a better service can be provided to make such a proposal and it will be processed properly through our approved tendering procedures.  In the meantime, it is clear from the working group report that the current system has challenges that must be met, especially for those who rely on this accommodation and support for longer periods than planned.  The working group was particularly concerned about the impact long-term institutional residency has on children.  Many of the contributions here were made in terms of the impact it has on children, rightly so.</p><p>The International Protection Act takes the reforming step of introducing a single application procedure which will significantly simplify the system of determination and allows for all information to be considered in the first instance without any dilution in best practice in proper procedures or due process.  This delivers on the commitment given in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016, "to legislate to reduce the length of time the asylum applicant spends in the asylum determination system and consequently in Direct Provision through the establishment of a single applications procedure."  The Act is in compliance with the United Nations convention relating to the status of refugees and with the related EU directives on asylum procedures and qualification into which Ireland has opted.</p><p>From the outset, the Department of Justice and Equality placed the "best interests of the child" at the centre of discussions with the Attorney General's office in preparing this Act and ensured that this value was placed in a number of specific provisions of the published Bill.  Both the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I repeatedly assured Oireachtas Members that this principle is at the heart of the Act and will be embedded in best practice in the protection process arising from the introduction of a new single application procedure.  These matters were given careful scrutiny by the Council of State and the President signed the Bill into law on 30 December 2015.</p><p>In the motion before the House, Senators have rightly drawn attention to the context in which we operate.  This Government through a referendum passed by the people ensured that children now have full constitutional protection.  This Act must be read in the context of the constitutional obligations set out in Article 42A(1).  It is also to be read in the context of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, including Article 24(1) which states: "in all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions, the child's best interests must be a primary consideration".</p><p>I acknowledge the serious and helpful engagement of Senator Jillian van Turnhout and the Children's Rights Alliance with Department officials and their combined efforts to ensure that children's best interests are protected in the Act and in our protection system.  This debate follows on from that co-operation.</p><p>The Department on publication of the International Protection Bill set out its commitment in this area and ensured the "best interests of the child" was placed in sections 24, 35 and 57 in the original Bill presented to the Oireachtas.  In the Seanad, the Department introduced a further amendment requiring Tusla to consider legal advice as well as its own information as to when a child in its care should become an applicant - section 15(4).</p><p>As a result of the constructive engagements in both Houses and with NGOs which engaged with the Department, a number of further amendments were accepted by the Government to the Act to give further assurance as to the Government's bona fides on protecting children in our protection process.  As a result, to offer further reassurance to advocates who rightly promote the best interests of the child, the "best interests principle" or child positive amendments have been incorporated in sections 15(4), 20(7), 24, 27, 35 and 52 to 57, inclusive.</p><p>The Government has also provided more resources for the processing of applications in the system five years or more and there has been a noticeable acceleration in grants of status and in addressing legal challenges arising in respect of older applications in the current system.  As Minister of State, during the summer, I completed the work of a task force designed to assist those granted status in leaving direct provision and I am pleased to report that despite accommodation pressures, 57% were found to be able to leave within three months and this rose to 86% within six months of being granted status.  I confirm the statistics as outlined by Senator Marie Moloney.  Since the publication of this report and because of the extra resources afforded to the Department in the last budget, between 60 and 80 people per month in direct provision are getting leave to remain.  I would add that more than 80 deportation orders have been revoked since publication of the report, which is welcome.</p><p>This is considerable constructive activity and welcome to all in the protection system or who advocate on their behalf.  The work is continuing and these matters are the subject of ongoing deliberations in the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  Important progress has been outlined above in implementing the report's recommendations notwithstanding the significant challenges faced by Ireland and the European Union arising from the migration crisis in the Mediterranean area occurring in the months following the report's publication.  The Department is involved in an audit of progress on the implementation of recommendations to update the Cabinet committee at present.  The motion asks for updates on specific recommendations of the working group which I will now deal with.</p><p>In response to the Senators' query on recommendation 5.30 that the direct provision weekly allowance for adults should be increased from &euro;19.10 to &euro;38.74 for adults and from &euro;9.60 to &euro;29.80 for children, I am pleased to inform the House that the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, jointly sought and obtained Government approval to increase the weekly allowance to be paid to children by six euro earlier this month.  This amounts to a more than 60% increase on the previous level, acknowledging that this allowance had not been increased since its introduction.  These recommendations remain on the Cabinet committee's agenda for further consideration.  The changes are good but I concede they are not good enough.</p><p>The Minister for Health's implementation of the waiving of prescription charges has also eased another serious financial pressure on parents who had to meet those costs from their direct provision allowances.  Senators referred to the potential oversight role of the Ombudsman for Children.  I confirm to the House that the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is meeting the Ombudsman for Children next Wednesday to discuss this and other issues.</p><p>In addition, I welcome the swift implementation by the Minister for Education and Skills of the working group's recommendations in regard to children living in direct provision to be supported to access third level education which positively impacted on children during this academic year.  In regard to recommendation 3.263, the International Protection Act's implementation will involve a thorough review of all materials, guidelines and agreements to ensure best practice.  Interviews with unaccompanied minors are conducted in specially designed child-friendly interview rooms in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, on Mount Street.  A representative from the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, attends the interview with the child applicant and assists them throughout the whole asylum process, including helping them with their initial application and with explaining to them what to expect in the protection process.</p><p>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal will become the International Protection Appeals Tribunal.  To date the tribunal has not had any appeals from unaccompanied children or minors.  The tribunal published a guideline on dealing with child applicants in the past year.  This followed extensive consultation with various interested parties, including the Ombudsman for Children, and a two-day inter-agency training course on dealing with child applicants.  The Legal Aid Board has an information leaflet, written in plain English, on the service it provides to asylum seekers.  This leaflet is translated into various languages and is also contained on the board's website.  The leaflets are made available to applicants in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on registration.  Specialised legal information including early legal advice is given to all unaccompanied minors in the care of Tusla via a dedicated unit in the law centre in Smithfield.</p><p>In regard to recommendation 4.199, the working group was fully aware that a welfare strategy already exists both in terms of liaison structures and also in terms of individual case management.  Tusla reports that a document outlining this strategy and a protocol governing same is currently being further developed jointly by themselves and the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, which is responsible for the centres.  This updated protocol will be available from mid-February.  It is important that we be clear and that the working group was fully aware that Tusla and RIA have had structures in place for several years to assist in collaboration on inter-agency communication, information and case management both in regard to the general population of children and families in direct provision and also with "aged out" unaccompanied minors.  Their recommendation was designed to ensure that this best practice would be embedded in the system and we are happy to offer such reassurance.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This collaboration is achieved both through organised inter-agency meetings and on an ongoing basis in respect of individual case management.</p><p>Tusla also advises that it is currently progressing the arrangement to identify a named social worker on its child protection team both internally within the line management structure and in collaboration with the HSE and RIA.  It is intended that there would also be linkage between the child protection social worker and the social workers on the mental health and primary care teams with the staff member in each centre who is identified by RIA as the designated officer for Children First.  This arrangement will be put in place by mid-February.</p><p>The HSE is in the process of strengthening links with its mental health division to ensure the mental health needs of people living in direct provision are adequately addressed.  The HSE sits on a high level group chaired by RIA comprising statutory representation from the Department of Social Protection, Tusla, etc., and it works collaboratively to address any issues emerging or that have been escalated.  These agencies were represented on the working group and the HSE is working towards enhancing linkages across the operational system so that there is a named person in each community health organisation to whom queries in respect of direct provision centres in that catchment area can be directed.</p><p>In respect of recommendation 4.226, inspections of direct provision centres are currently carried out by RIA and by an independent contracted private company.  These regular and unannounced inspections are made to ensure that services provided to residents are satisfactory and that all health and safety requirements are being met.  The services that each centre must provide to residents are also set out in the RIA house rules, which were revised around the same time the working group report was published and were distributed to all centres.  A new complaints system was introduced by RIA in 2015 allowing for complaints to be appealed to an independent officer.  Complaints made since have been addressed locally and the appeal officer has not received any request to intervene.  It is important to monitor the impact of these improvements and we are doing so as part of the report's consideration process.</p><p>Establishing another inspectorate or extending the remit of an existing body to carry out inspections in direct provision centres will require further operational consideration.  The establishment of any new body will naturally have resource implications while extending the remit of an existing body may necessitate a legislative change.  For these reasons, this recommendation remains under active consideration and the officials in my Department will continue to explore the available options as to how this might be progressed.</p><p>In respect of recommendation 4.135, I again note the progress being made by RIA's new and more independent complaints system to swiftly address issues that arise.  Extending the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman and the Office of the Ombudsman for Children may also require a legislative change in addition to having resource implications for staffing levels in both offices to deal with the increased functions.  Discussions between officials of my Department and the Office of the Ombudsman took place in December last.  It is expected that similar discussions will take place with the Ombudsman for Children next Wednesday.  I would hope that progress can be made quickly on this matter.</p><p>In respect of recommendation 4.75, while the recommendation of the working group that we should provide all families with access to cooking facilities and their own private living space is certainly desirable, it is not easy to implement in the short term.  The impact of a substantial increase in demand for accommodation which coincided with the publication of the working group's report cannot be understated.  We have seen a 120% increase in protection applications in 2015 and with our acceptance of a further 4,000 applicants under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, IRPP, this has brought a further demand on the resources available in the market place to meet the needs of increasing numbers and our commitment to establish emergency reception and orientation centres for the new arrivals under the IRPP.  We have no reason to believe that this trend will not continue in this and in subsequent years.</p><p>Reconfiguring the existing centres to provide communal kitchens and private living space at a time of rapidly increasing demand would, as I understand it, involve a significant restructuring of the property portfolio currently held by RIA in the Department.  It may also have the unintended consequence of reducing bed capacity at a time when the number of daily asylum applications being made in the country is increasing significantly.  We must also acknowledge that there is a shortage of accommodation in the State generally which also impacts on our ability to tender for suitable accommodation which may need to be procured.</p><p>It is important to note that 15 direct provision centres already provide access to a communal kitchen where residents can prepare their own meals and we are looking to extend and enhance such provisions, where possible.  Four of these centres have their own self-contained catering units for each family.  All accommodation centres have access to kitchenette facilities where residents can heat food or make tea and coffee.  The Department is currently examining logistical solutions in respect of existing property and is consulting with the Office of Government Procurement on the best approach to future tenders for direct provision accommodation.  In considering any changes to accommodation centres, special attention must also be paid to ensure continued compliance with all planning, health and safety and fire regulations, etc., as recommended in the report of the working group.</p><p>It is clear progress is being made and that we are meeting the challenge to considerably reduce the time applicants are dependent on the system of direct provision for their needs by that ensuring a quality-driven single application procedure - the most significant reform of our protection process in a decade - is deliverable through the International Protection Act.</p><p>Meeting the needs of those in need of protection requires more than one line solutions.  The working group did a thorough job in recommending changes in key areas of the protection process, including direct provision and support services.  Important progress has been made in six months, most especially in the key pillar of positive change and legislation for a fair and efficient single application procedure which addressed the matters raised by 26 of the working group's recommendations.</p><p>I am confident the current review of progress on the working group's recommendations being undertaken by my Department will yield further cross-departmental progress and that the ongoing deliberations by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform will agree more significant progress in an area which has been of concern to this Government.  In initiating the first review of this area through a high level working group, delivering on implementation of its recommendations and in passing the single most important reform of the cumbersome sequential application procedure - the root of so many challenges in the protection process - we have been a Government whose practical response to a system that has been unchanged for 15 years will yield progressive results in the years ahead.  We are prioritising the delivery of a protection system which is fair and efficient, providing for the needs of those in need of our protection at a time of challenge and change which we must meet across Europe and beyond.  It is to the eternal credit of this House that this issue has been constantly raised.  I thank Members from all sides on behalf of the children and those living in direct provision for their tenacity in pursuing this issue.</p></speech>

Is d&oacute;igh gur seo an tseans deireanach a bheidh againn san su&iacute; &aacute;irithe seo den Seanad &aacute;irithe seo leis an sc&eacute;al seo a phl&eacute;.  Mar sin, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an deis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo a bheith againn.  I welcome this debate as I welcome any debate on direct provision.  We do not oppose the motion as I do not see anything in it that is opposable.  However, I put on record my disappointment in all of us as a Parliament that we have failed over five years to abolish direct provision.  I am not saying this to have a go at anybody in particular but it is one thing I feel very passionately about.</p><p>The Irish Refugee Council said recently that:</p><blockquote>Several attempts have been made to reduce the potential harm to asylum seeking and refugee children, most recently in recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on the Protection Process, the increase in the allowance for children, the intention to speed up the decision making process in the International Protection Act 2015 and the establishment of new centres under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  None of these end the practice of requiring children to live in communal institutions alongside complete strangers.</blockquote> <p>It goes on to say that:</p><blockquote>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) in May 2015 found serious concerns in relation to child protection and welfare services for children in Direct Provision.  Their findings included: physical or mental illness of parents impacting on capacity to provide quality care for children; mental health issues for children and parents; lack of clothes and toys; parent(s) isolating themselves and their children from networks and support services.  In addition, amongst the protection concerns were proximity of children to unknown adults living on the same site and inappropriate contact by adults towards some children.</blockquote> <p>It is very important in the context of this debate to say that the issue is not just about the length of time people are in the institutions, the issues relate to the institutions themselves no matter how long those people are in them.  We cannot get away from that fact.  We have talked about the working group report.  The working group was precluded from putting forward recommendations on direct provision because it was not in the terms of reference.  It was specifically precluded because it was looking at the process so alternative models could not be proposed by the working group, which led to frustration and at least one NGO pulling out of the working group because of its frustration.  When this NGO tried to put forward positive recommendations about changing direct provision and coming up with a different model, it was told it could not do it because it was not in the terms of reference.</p><p>It is not fair to say that other models have not been proposed because they have.  We have proposed them in these Houses and the Irish Refugee Council has also made alternative proposals to the Minister in its document Direct Provision: Framing an alternative reception system for people seeking international protection.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Conway and I visited the Portuguese refugee council and the version in Portugal of a reception system.  While we noted on our return that one cannot simply take a system and superimpose it here, we saw a system there that certainly appears to be much more humane and is working a lot better.  It allows people the dignity of the right to work and the right to education after six to nine months and it processes applications in a much more humane and rapid manner.  Other models therefore exist and it will be incumbent on whoever is seeking election to not simply go to doors with the working group report but to state whether he or she wishes to abolish direct provision and the next Government will be obliged to return to that issue.  I fear the consequences of the passage of the International Protection Act and note that at the outset of the Minister of State's contribution, he stated "what was to be a temporary system of shelter and provision has evolved into a more long-term provision".  I believe this to be the first time I have heard a Minister actually state this because heretofore, it always has been claimed it was a temporary scenario and would be reformed.  However, it is quite obvious that in accepting the International Protection Bill, the system has been copper-fastened for years to come.  I put it to Senators on the Government side that when they accepted that Bill, they copper-fastened many of the problems with the rights and conditions in direct provision about which they are complaining.  I certainly place much criticism for the architecture of the direct provision system with Fianna F&aacute;il, which put it together.  I refer to how it is a privatised system, that &euro;53 million per year is being spent on these centres and there is very little oversight over many of the companies involved.  In a number of cases, they have their bank accounts offshore and there is no oversight of how the moneys are spent in a public forum or through these Houses and this is a question of serious concern to me and to many organisations with which Members engage on a regular basis.</p><p>Why are we not moving towards the international position of allowing a right to work and a right to education for asylum seekers, as is done in almost every other developed country in the world?  On the right to education, I note the Minister of State indicated there has been movement in this regard.  My understanding is a pilot project was put in place by the Minister for Education and Skills, who promised that no other children coming through direct provision would be discriminated against if they sought to go on to third level.  I have heard of instances in which people who wished to proceed to third level education have been turned down for education grants and I certainly seek clarification on that issue.  As children born into direct provision are not citizens of Ireland and are not cherished in the same way as every other child born in this country, how can one laud and applaud the work the Government has done?  It is completely unfair that those children would be treated as second-class citizens in this day and age.  Moreover, children in direct provision still are discriminated against because they are not eligible for children's allowance and issues remain in respect of family reunification.  As has been noted by previous speakers, there is an issue with regard to oversight and the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children have repeatedly called for such oversight.  If a meeting is held next week, I hope this can be conferred in some way, as that at least would be a move forward.  However, I also call for the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to be given independent oversight of direct provision centres, as this also would be really important.</p></speech>

Many people have worked in many ways to do that and I do not know where is the stumbling block.  I believe the Minister of State wished to reform the system but was stymied in some way.  I do not know whether this is because of the Minister of State's partners in government, whether it is for reasons within the Department or whatever but it certainly is an issue that will not go away.  I believe it will be our Magdalen laundry in the future and it is a scandal that we are not living up to the international human rights of the people in direct provision and we still have a great deal of work to do in that regard.</p></speech>

I commend Senators van Turnhout and Mac Conghail and their colleagues from the Taoiseach's nominee group on bringing forward this motion, which is being debated in the best tradition of the Seanad, that is, it is framed in a manner that invites a co-operative and cross-party approach.  This is helpful and I am delighted to support it wholeheartedly.  It rightly draws attention to and highlights particular aspects of direct provision as they relate to children and it is really useful for Members to focus on this, as they have not had the opportunity previously to focus specifically on children in direct provision.  I take the Minister of State's point that debates on direct provision in this House in particular but also, it must be said ,in the other House and generally in public discourse in Ireland have been focused on the need for compassion for those in direct provision and for those who are migrating to Ireland generally.  It is a very different context to that which obtains in Denmark or in our near neighbour in the United Kingdom, where a much more heated and polarised debate about immigration and migration is evident, and I greatly welcome this.</p> <p>I also welcome the publication of the report of the working group on the protection process, which lies at the heart of this motion.  Like other Members, I welcome the chairperson of the working group, Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, to the Visitors Gallery and thank him for producing the report and for being present for the debate and taking the time to attend.  Members had a specific debate on direct provision almost one year ago and Members debated it again in December in the context of issues arising in the International Protection Bill.  Clearly, however, one point that emerged through those debates was that until last year, the system had remained unchanged since its introduction, as everyone is aware, as a stopgap and temporary measure in 1999 and 2000 by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government as a way to ensure the immediate accommodation needs of those immigrating to Ireland would be met.  As Members are aware, the single biggest issue that has arisen and everybody's single biggest concern with direct provision, which was highlighted in the working group report, is that of delay whereby a system brought in as a temporary stopgap for approximately six months per applicant has become a place in which children have been brought up and people have spent years without resolution of their legal status.  This really has been the biggest issue and I therefore welcome that this issue was addressed for the first time in December of last year through the International Protection Bill.  This Bill responded to key recommendations in the report to reduce the length of time people will spend in direct provision, to try to address the aforementioned serious concern regarding the length of time spent and to establish a streamlined and single applications procedure, which will meet many of the concerns of many Members.</p> <p>I recall that when Members debated this subject one year ago, there was a much higher number of people in direct provision who had been in direct provision for a lot longer.  In examining the more recent figures from the Reception and Integration Agency, I welcome that the number of such people has reduced, although it is still too many people as approximately 25% of those in direct provision have been there for more than five years.  The position certainly is better than one year ago when the equivalent figure was 45% but speedier progress must be made on this issue of delay and time spent in direct provision.  While many Members had issues with aspects of the International Protection Bill, it introduced this hugely important reform and, as the Minister of State has noted, specifically referred to the need to ensure the best interests of the child were protected in a range of different provisions.  I commend Senator van Turnhout, in particular, who really pushed on that issue and secured amendments both here and in the D&aacute;il on it to ensure adherence to the best interests of children would be specifically required.</p> <p>After the issue of delay and time spent in direct provision, the next biggest issue identified by most commentators has been the impact on children and on families and on family life.  This subject again is at the heart of this motion and of many of the report's 173 recommendations.  Current figures show there are slightly more than 700 family groups and slightly more than 1,200 children still in direct provision.  I wish to refer specifically to some of the recommendations in the working group report, which again are highlighted in the Independent Senators' motion.  In particular, I refer to the recommendation on access to cooking facilities.  I also have visited these centres and, as other colleagues have stated, the absence of a facility for cooking probably is the point that stands out most starkly.  Cramped space is an issue and difficulty with having play and recreation facilities also is a subject of recommendations in the report but it is clear that the lack of cooking facilities really undermines a cohesive family life for those families who are in direct provision.  I note the working group's specific and tailored recommendation that all families should have access to cooking facilities, whether in a self-contained unit or through the use of a communal kitchen.  While the working group recognised it might take some time to reconfigure existing centres or bring new centres online, it suggested the end of 2016 as the date by which that recommendation should be implemented fully.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is of some concern, although I accept there are very difficult practical issues in putting that recommendation in place.  I accept that cooking facilities are made available in some centres.  I know from talking to some of the people who run the centres that they will have to provide cooking facilities for families if they are directed to do so.  It will be difficult to do in some of the buildings and it will clearly take some time to change.  It is one key recommendation that needs to be achieved.  I am heartened by the fact that tenders will be invited to provide accommodation and perhaps it might be built into a tender.  If people are tendering, they should include in their tender provision for independent cooking facilities for families.  We could require new facilities to be provided, while acknowledging the difficulty of adapting existing facilities.  </p><p>Others have mentioned the need for the Ombudsman for Children to be able to intervene and the safeguards to ensrue child protection.  I welcome the progress that has been made in that regard.</p><p>The issue of education is hugely important.  Like the Minister of State, I welcome the swift implementation of the recommendation made in that regard.  The Minister for Education and Skills moved very quickly to ensure children in direct provision centres had access to third level education.  That was hugely important and it will have a positive impact on many families.  </p><p>I commend the Senators who brought forward the motion.  I am glad that we can unite on it and hope the next Government will continue to implement the recommendations of the working group with speed.</p></speech>

I also thank Senators Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, Martin Conway, David Norris, Marie Moloney, Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Ivana Bacik.  It is great that the House is united on the issue.  </p><p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh is correct to ask what we have achieved.  For me, what is most depressing is that we can unite on an issue, but the question is whether we can really bring things forward.  Senator Fiach Mac Conghail is correct - as we have the working group's report, we do not need to have long discussions; we need to move to its implementation.  I would like to see the progress reports of high level groups published in order that the process is transparent.  </p><p>I have listened to the debate on the importance of cooking facilities for families.  There is the issue of costs because people need materials in order to be able to cook.  We can have that debate, but I will go home tonight and decide the time at which I want to eat and what I will eat.  I do not have to depend on a service that provides for me to eat at a specific time.  How many of us eat at the same time every day?  That alone is institutionalisation.  Friends have told me how difficult they find it when they are in hospital for one week.  I cannot imagine what it is like to be in a direct provision system.</p><p>On the issue of tenders, why are we allowing people to profit from the misery of others?  I have a fundamental problem with this.  Why is the State not providing the service?  Why do we not ask an NGO to do it?  There are some really excellent NGOs working in this area.  I am thinking of Crosscare, but I am sure there are others.  I have seen first-hand the work they do.  </p><p>On the remit of the Ombudsman for Children, I believe it could be done by statutory instrument or ministerial order.  It is, therefore, an issue of political will.  If one goes back to the debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas on the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, this issue was raised.  Would we leave an especially vulnerable group of children and young people outside the scope of the Ombudsman for Children's investigatory remit?  In response the former Minister Mary Hanafin said, &quot;The children of asylum seekers and refugees will have access to the Ombudsman for Children in the same way as every other child in Ireland.&quot;  That is what the Houses were told.  The only thing excluded is the administration of the law, that is, the procedures for defining and determining whether a person is entitled to a particular status.  She also explained:</p><blockquote>If, however, there are problems in relation to delays, the provision of accommodation, nutrition, housing, etc, those issues are covered.  This provision is only to ensure there is not a duplication of the actual process of the administration of the law.</blockquote> <p>Why does the Ombudsman for Children not have a remit to look at the application?  We live on an island, but we really are an island as far as the rest of Europe is concerned because children in other countries can go to their ombudsman for children.  It is enshrined in the Constitution that all children are equal, yet now we say we will interpret it slightly differently and that children in direct provision centres do not have the same rights.  The Ombudsman for Children and Mr. Peter Tyndall made a joint submission to the working group which clearly explained the benefits, from their involvement in the direct provision system, that their experience could bring and the ease with which they could move into that space if allowed to do so.  </p><p>The Minister of State has talked about the additional resources that would be needed.  It makes me more fearful because it means that he believes there would be lots of complaints and resources needed.  What is happening if we know that we will need all of these additional resources?  We would need some resources.  He goes on to say it is also important to recall that the working group looked specifically at the possibility of setting up a separate complaints procedure but rejected the idea in favour of extending the remit in order that the established offices could take on this role.  It is welcome that the Minister for Justice and Equality will meet the Ombudsman for Children next Wednesday.  I hope we will move on this issue because it is about giving people hope.  </p><p>I explain that my job is about nudging.  When one is in a direct provision system, it is difficult to understand the nuances in things moving forward and progressing.  People need hope and we need to see some big changes.  We need to see an increase in the amount of money given to those in direct provision centres in line with the working group's report.  Although a figure of 60% makes for a good news day, it has not risen in 15 years.  The people concerned cannot afford to do the normal things children do.  I want to be happy that we are moving forward and have a great report, but we are not doing enough.  I hope that when the House comes back, Senators will again unite and push firmly for change.</p><p>I thank the cross-party group and all Senators who have united on this issue.  In particular, I thank the working group's members, the secretariat, the different Departments that have come together on the issue and, in particular, Dr. Bryan McMahon.  We now need to stop the discussion and begin implementation.  We need to ensure hope for all citizens and that children are children first and foremost.</p></speech>

When the history of it is written, Seanad &Eacute;ireann and those in it who have advocated for children will be acknowledged.  Those in direct provision centres will be thankful for what has been said.  I remind Senators that the system was set up at a time when the people who came to this country seeking protection were living in parks and sleeping on benches, with no facilities available to them.  That was the reason the direct provision system was established initially as a short-term measure.  It should have been radically reviewed within five years, but during those five years there was a citizenship referendum which focused on those coming to the country from abroad.  I ran for election for the very first time at the time of that citizenship referendum and it upset me.  It was my first foray into politics and the emotions stirred at the time were quite despicable.  This should have been done an awful long time ago.  At the time we had 10,000 asylum applicants a year.  That was the nature of the system trying to cope.  The reality is that although we had a fantastic opportunity to do this a number of years ago when resources were available, it was not done.  Now we find ourselves in a situation where we are trying to sort out the situation as numbers increase.  In 2015 there were over 3,000 applicants, a doubling of the number the previous year.  We have committed to accepting 4,000 refugees from the Syrian crisis.</p> <p>I never made a commitment to abolish this system and do not believe it can be abolished.  Some Members of the House have said we should abolish the direct provision system and that there are alternatives being offered.  I have not seen one that is viable.  For me and people working in the Department who care about the issue deeply, abolishing the system would mean sticking 4,500 people on a housing list or asking them to find private rented accommodation for themselves.  That is not a viable option.  I would stand over a system in which people lived in an excellent centre for a number of months but not grew up or raised a family.</p></speech>

The tragedy of direct provision, as with other aspects of public policy that have failed, is that a short-term measure becomes a long-term solution.</p> <p>When given responsibility for this area, I did not just want to read reports and engage with NGOs, but wanted to see, smell and taste the centres myself.  I have seen, smelt and tasted the desperation in those centres and know exactly what is happening in them.  However, NGOs now tell me they see a change.  They see the letters being sent to people who have been in direct provision for over five years.  They know there is a sense of hope arising because of the report of the direct provision protection working group.  Now they can see, because of the resources that have been put in by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the most recent budget, that more people are getting leave to remain and more people are moving out of the centres and building lives for themselves.  Some 60 to 80 people a month are getting leave to remain and are moving out of the centres</p> <p>There is a challenge in that regard, because we had approximately 450 cases of people with leave to remain who were still in direct provision because they could not find accommodation elsewhere.  We had approximately 18 cases of people who remained in direct provision for a year after they had obtained leave to remain.  The solutions are not simple.  However, I agree with Senator van Turnhout that it is about nudging and edging our way out from a catastrophic policy disaster towards providing individuals, families and children with a sense of hope and expectation.  It is much more than throwing slogans around.  It is actually dealing with situations humanely and properly.  </p> <p>I contend and agree with everybody here that permission to work, the right to work, permission for individual payment, the right to education and the right to prepare food are necessary.  The right to prepare food may sometimes be dismissed as a trivial issue, but it is not.  It is central to parenthood and central to how a child understands connectivity within the family.</p> <p>The working group report is the only game in town.  It is the only document anybody is working on and is not sitting on a shelf but is live and being implemented.  I would love to have the opportunity to come back after the general election to work with others in these Houses to ensure we implement that report, because in this commemoration year, children living in direct provision centres need a commemoration that speaks of something better and brighter for their lives.  I assure Senators this is currently happening on an incremental basis.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-27a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012700002#VV00300"><p>I am pleased to introduce the Horse Racing Ireland Bill 2015 to the Seanad.  I should say at the outset that this Bill has been the subject of a very constructive process of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The final shape of the Bill before the House today has therefore been very significantly influenced by the view of Senators, Deputies and stakeholders throughout that process.</p> <p>The Irish bloodstock breeding and racing industry is of major national importance in terms of employment - especially in rural areas, and also in terms of exports and tourism.  The industry is estimated to employ approximately 18,000 people when breeding, racing, betting, and other elements are included.  It contributed almost &euro;1.1 billion to the Irish economy in 2012 and achieved exports of more than &euro;205 million to 37 countries in 2013.  It is also estimated to account for up to 80,000 tourists coming to Ireland each year.  Those tourists are among the estimated 1 million plus people who attend horse races each year in this country.</p> <p>The Irish thoroughbred sector has built a global reputation for excellence.  In sporting terms, Ireland can certainly consider itself to be among the best in the world.  Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, is a commercial State body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  It is charged with the overall administration, promotion and development of this very Important industry and sport.  These activities are funded to a significant extent by the Exchequer from the horse and greyhound fund, which comes within the ambit of my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</p> <p>HRI also provides funding for integrity services to the Racing Regulatory Body, namely, the Turf Club.  The Turf Club, including the Irish national hunt steeplechase committee, a private body, is designated as the racing regulatory body and is charged with carrying out these functions under the current legislation.  HRI provided &euro;7.1 million for those activities in 2015.  The independent role of the racing regulatory body is protected in the Bill I bring before the House today.</p> <p>Before dealing with the substance of the Bill, I wish to refer to the Review of Certain Aspects of the Irish Horseracing Industry by Indecon International Economic Consultants, which I commissioned and which was published in July 2012.  The Department facilitated a stakeholder consultation process as part of that review, and written submissions were sought from interested parties and forwarded to Indecon for consideration.  The resulting report examined the legislation, governance structures, funding and management of the industry, including the streamlining of functions assigned by legislation to HRI and the racing regulatory body.  It made a number of clear recommendations in that regard.</p> <p>Following the Indecon Report, HRI and the Racing Regulatory Body established a streamlining task force with a view to achieving efficiencies, and consultants Smith and Williamson were appointed to act as a facilitator in the discussions.  Smith and Williamson prepared a report which contained 18 recommendations and  it was estimated that the recommendations could result in savings of approximately &euro;1.8 million.</p> <p>Taking into account this general background, and the recommendations of both the Indecon and Smith and Williamson reports, my Department drafted the general scheme of the Horse Racing Ireland Bill 2015.  I have already referred to the pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I believe the committee heard from all the major players in the industry and departmental officials appeared before it on two occasions.  The committee produced a comprehensive report which was useful in finalising the Bill before its introduction to the House.</p> <p>As I proceed through the detail of the Bill, the amendments taken on board as a result of the process to date will become apparent.  I have accepted many amendments.  All political parties have been very constructive on the legislation, as have all the stakeholders.  However, I should say at the outset that I have agreed to the deletion of an entire section dealing with sanctions and appeals.  That was something both the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and Sinn F&eacute;in sought.  The section provided for detailed procedures for dealing with sanctions and appeals.  However, the sport is governed by the rules of racing, and the racing regulatory body is required to have regard to due process and the rules of natural justice in its application of the rules.  A broad spectrum of stakeholders, as well as Deputies and Senators from all sides of the House, were concerned that the creation of specific statutory provisions in regard to sanctions in a sport already governed by comprehensive rules of racing which incorporate the principles of natural justice, had the potential to create confusion and legal uncertainty.  I have taken those concerns on board.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I would also draw the attention of the House to a small but critical and urgent change to the Forestry Act 2014, which was not included the general scheme.  During the passage last year of the Forestry Bill the burdensome requirement for two separate consents for a forestry road was raised.  Under the existing regime, consent is required from my Department in regard to the construction of a forest road while an entirely separate consent is required from the local planning authorities for the entrance of a forest road on to a public road.  I am pleased to announce that in this Bill I am taking the opportunity to introduce an amendment to eliminate this duplication, following consultation and agreement with the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport, Tourism and Sport.  On enactment of this provision, only one consent will be required.  This will be administered by my Department and will cover both the construction of the forest road as well as its entry on to the public road.  While this is a small change, it will reduce the administrative burden on the industry and will make the consent process quicker and more efficient.  This is urgently required.  While this is not an issue relevant to racing we are using this vehicle to make this necessary change.  We appreciate the support of the Opposition parties in making the change, which makes a lot of sense.</p><p>In addition, I will be introducing an additional section on Report Stage dealing with the recognition of foreign vets and veterinary nurses for the purposes of transposing EU Directive 2013/55 on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.  This is being inserted following the advice of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  This directive is required to be transposed by 19 January 2016 and so it is most urgent that we enact this Bill.</p><p>Regarding matters relating to thoroughbred horse racing, this Bill builds on the recommendations of the Indecon report and is intended to strengthen governance and transparency within the administration of horse racing; clarify the respective roles of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and the racing regulatory body; improve accountability and control over State funding and provide a foundation for streamlining the functions of the two bodies.  I will now outline the detail on the Bill.  Section 1 provides the definitions for the Bill.  Section 2 introduces the new definitions of "jockeys and qualified riders" and "betting intermediaries" to be inserted into the Act for the purposes of defining the membership of the new statutory committees.  This section also extends the definition of "integrity services" to allow for off-course activities and of "racing regulatory body" to include limited companies established by that body.  The latter two changes are made at the request of the racing regulatory body.  Section 2 also amends the definition of "rules of racing" so that the rules explicitly apply to point to point racing.</p><p>Section 3 is a minor technical amendment providing for the updating of fines under the 1994 Act and the deletion of continuous offences in line with modern legislative practices.  Section 4 adjusts the composition of the board in line with the recommendations of Indecon to provide for three ministerial nominees.  While the intention had been to provide for this within the context of a smaller board, I have adjusted this provision to accommodate a representative of stable staff, following a recommendation from the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine during the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  The board will comprise 13 ordinary members and a chairperson, with three members nominated by the Minister, three nominated by the racing regulatory body and one nominated by each of the representatives of the authorised racecourses, racehorse breeders, racehorse owners, racehorse trainers, respectively; two from the industry service committee - one being the chairman of that committee and the other being a representative of the stable staff and one member from the betting committee, being the chairperson of that committee.  This section also explicitly requires HRI to have regard to Government policies and guidelines in determining the remuneration or allowances paid to its chairman and to comply with any directions given by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard.</p><p>Section 5 consolidates and clarifies the general functions of HRI by providing that HRI is responsible for the overall administration, governance, development and promotion of the Irish horse racing industry - other than the functions assigned to the racing regulatory body.  The independence of the racing regulatory body is not compromised and is explicitly provided for in section 11.  However, section 5 explicitly provides for the streamlining of certain administrative functions between the two bodies by ensuring that all charges, other than those going directly to the local hunt clubs that organise point to point steeplechases, shall be processed through HRI&rsquo;s administrative system.  This is a sensible streamlining of functions that should reduce administrative costs and lead to greater efficiency and transparency.  I have taken great care to explicitly exclude the funding of local hunt clubs from this provision.  This section also provides that HRI may use directives to set rules and procedures in order to guide its activities.  This is a reflection of existing practice but in addition, I am requiring HRI to consult with the racing regulatory body before issuing directives, other than in cases of urgency.</p><p>Section 6 provides for new statutory committees and standardises the structure of the existing statutory committees.  Subsection (1) enacts the provisions relating to the race fixtures committee and provides that the chairperson of that committee is appointed by HRI; that the number of ordinary members be reduced from six to five and that the membership of the committee is confined to members of HRI.  Subsection (2) provides for the establishment of an industry services committee to focus on the requirements of those employed in the horse racing industry, which I think is a really good development.  It provides that the members shall elect the chairperson of the committee, who will be a member of the committee.  This subsection also provides for a betting committee to focus on the requirements of the betting sector on the same basis as the industry services committee.  Subsection (3) increases the membership of the media rights committee to five and permits non-members of the board to be members of the committee.  This is to allow the committee have media rights experts as members.  I have amended this provision to require that the board of HRI and representatives of the executives of authorised racecourses must agree the terms of media rights contracts before they are finalised.</p><p>Section 7 is a reflection of current practice and provides that HRI may make deductions from monetary prizes in accordance with HRI directives.  Subsection (2) protects the interests of certain charitable trusts by providing that HRI cannot make changes to directives governing such trusts or funds without the poor agreement of the trustees.  Section 8 is intended to strengthen the governance of HRI and the industry in general by requiring HRI to provide information to the Minister regarding its compliance with the code of practice for governance of State bodies, issued by Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and in the event that the Minister is not satisfied with HRI&rsquo;s compliance, it provides that the Minister may direct compliance.</p><p>Section 9 is a sensible provision providing that the owner or keeper of a thoroughbred foal must pay the thoroughbred foal levy in advance of registering the foal in the studbook.  It is intended to strengthen compliance with the existing obligations to pay the foal levy.  Section 10 permits HRI to establish companies to carry out any of its functions and substitutes references to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with references to the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Section 11 explicitly protects the independence of the racing regulatory body.  It provides that the racing regulatory body is solely and independently responsible for making and enforcing the rules of racing; provides integrity services; licenses racecourses and participants in horse racing; sets charges for licences; is responsible for decisions regarding handicapping, doping, etc.; represents Irish horse racing internationally in respect of areas within its functions; and enforces rules governing point to point steeplechases.  I have agreed to the introduction on Committee Stage of an amendment to this section to make it clear that the racing regulatory body, through the Irish national steeplechase committee, remains responsible for maintaining the existing nature of point to point steeple chasing.  I believe this amendment deals with concerns expressed on all sides of the House in regard to the status of point to point racing.  In other words, it is working and we want to maintain the structure as is.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The section also provides that HRI must return to the Racing Regulatory Body, without delay, funds received and processed by the HRI as a result of administrative streamlining in relation to licensing, registrations and fines.  The Racing Regulatory Body must consult with HRI when making or amending the rules of racing.  I have amended this provision to allow for exceptions in cases of urgency, on the basis of concerns expressed on Committee Stage and in pre-legislative scrutiny.  Such consultation does not result in any binding obligation to take on board the views of HRI or compromise the independence of the Racing Regulatory Body in any way but is simply for the sake of consistency and good order.</p><p>Section 12 aims to strengthen accountability for public funds by providing that the Racing Regulatory Body must prepare accounts in respect of its statutory obligations.  The body must forward the accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit purposes.  Also, the chief executive of the Racing Regulatory Body must attend the Committee of Public Accounts of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann when requested to do so.  The section also replicates the onus on HRI to provide details of compliance with Government codes and policies.  The section requires the Racing Regulatory Body to provide information to the Minister on its statutory activities, including its compliance with Government codes and policies, so that the Minister may be assured as to compliance of the horse racing industry with the codes and policies.  Finally, the section provides that the Racing Regulatory Body must provide information to HRI with regard to future funding requirements and disposal of funds so that HRI may comply with its statutory obligations in accounting for funding for the industry.</p><p>I wish to make it clear that there is no intention whatsoever to change the status of the Racing Regulatory Body or the private nature of the Turf Club or its relationship with its members.  These provisions are simply intended to improve accountability for taxpayers' money.  I believe we have an obligation to do so.</p><p>Section 13 provides that bookmakers at point-to-point meetings will be subject to the same rules as authorised racecourses.  Section 14 provides that the Minister may withhold payment of instalments from the Horse and Greyhound Fund where HRl or Bord na gCon have failed to abide by the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, where strategic plans submitted are deficient or unreasonable or where either body has failed to progress its strategic plan.  It also ensures that moneys paid from the fund through instalments reflect the financial needs of HRI and Bord na gCon.</p><p>Section 15 is consequential on section 14.  Section 15 amends the Greyhound Industry Acts 1958 and 1993 to provide that Bord na gCon are statutorily subject to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies issued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  My Department is preparing the heads of a separate and more comprehensive Bill on the greyhound racing industry.  We conducted a similar Indecon-style report for the greyhound industry and we will bring in the appropriate legislation on the back of that work, just like we have done for the horse racing industry.</p><p>Section 16 is intended to provide for the sharing of data between HRI and the Racing Regulatory Body in accordance with the Data Protections Acts to facilitate administrative streamlining.  The provision includes a protection for existing data held by both bodies and ensures that information already held by either body may not be transferred without notice being given to the individuals concerned.  It also provides for a facility for the individual concerned to object to the data transfer, in accordance with data protection rules.</p><p>Section 17 amends the provisions for authorised officers in the Animal Remedies Act 1993 to allow the appointment by persons other than officers of the Minister.  The section also permits the Minister to set conditions within which authorised officers may utilise the functions set out in the Act.  It is intended that my Department will develop an agreement with the Racing Regulatory Body, similar to the one already agreed under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, to provide that the Racing Regulatory Body may utilise the powers under the Animal Remedies Act to ensure the proper use of animal remedies in horse racing which, in other words, means drug testing.</p><p>Section 18 amends the definition of forest road works in the Forestry Act 2014.  I have already explain the section in detail.  Section 19 amends the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 which I have also referred to in some detail.  Section 20 repeals the Horse Racing Ireland (Membership) Act 2001 because all its provisions are being re-enacted in this Bill.  Section 21 contains the normal provisions for citation and commencement of the Bill.</p><p>I believe this legislation will strengthen governance and transparency within horse racing.  It will lay the foundations for increased efficiency and cost reduction through the streamlining of administrative operations.  It will clarify the respective functions of Horse Racing Ireland and the Racing Regulatory Body.  It will also strengthen the Racing Regulatory Body's integrity functions and improve accountability and control over State funding in the horse racing and greyhound racing sectors.  We have been through a comprehensive process of consultation.  I am very grateful to Deputies and Senators on all sides of the House for their constructive approach thus far.</p><p>A small number of amendments have been proposed by two Senators.  I shall briefly refer to them, if I may, out of courtesy to the Senators concerned.  First, Senator Norris has raised, through his amendment, his idea that this legislation should be extended beyond horse racing or the thoroughbred industry.  He wants the legislation to cover showjumping, three day eventing, polo and another horse industry disciplines.  The purpose of this legislation is to follow through on a specific and detailed report and consultation process on the horse racing industry, and to implement the recommendations that have been generated by that process.  We have had very long discussions with all of the key players involved in the horse racing industry which included the HRI, the Turf Club, the many people involved in point-to-point racing, the people who run and operate racecourses, owners, trainers, etc.  We are trying to balance everybody's concerns while at the same time ensure there is a proper modern governance and transparent structure.  We also want legislation that protects the industry in those areas.  It is self-evident, at this stage, that we cannot simply extend the legislation to include a whole series of other sports that involve horses.</p><p>This is important legislation for the horse racing industry.  We plan to conduct a similar review of the sport horse industry, specifically on Horse Sport Ireland in terms of how it operates, spends money and raises money.  The review will look at how we can improve and strengthen the sport horse sector which involves a couple hundred thousand people of which most are volunteers and amateurs.  The sport horse sector is a huge industry in Ireland with a turnover of &euro;700 million a year which is little less than the racing sector.  We have a big piece of work to do but I do not think its for today's legislation.  </p><p>Senator Norris has also stated he would like to see a requirement that one of the five members of the media rights committee is a representative of the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners.  In other words, he wants legislation to stipulate that one of the five members must be a racehorse owner.  His amendment was debated and discussed at length on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  I did not accept it because I did not think it was good governance.  The HRI has quite a large board which is very representative of all sectors in the industry.  We have put a lot of work into making sure that is the case.  The media rights committee would be a sub-board of the HRI.  The media rights committee would make recommendations that then have to be approved by the HRI board.  Therefore, it makes sense that the HRI would pick the best five people for the job and, if necessary, get somebody from outside to be part of the media rights sub-committee in order to get specific expertise.  In all likelihood there will probably be a racehorse owner on the five person committee.  Those who are best placed to make that judgment are members of the board of the HRI because it must finalise the decisions on media rights.  The right thing to do is for us to trust the board to make the right and balanced decisions and to put the right skill set in place.  There is already a requirement for racehorse owners to be represented on the main board of HRI.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Of the other amendments tabled by Senator O'Brien, the first relates to the membership of the race fixtures committee.  It is proposed that this committee would not be limited to Horse Racing Ireland members and that others could be brought in.  Again, effectively, this committee will be a sub-committee of the HRI board that will go into the detail of fixtures, get it right and then make a recommendation to the full board to have it finalised.  It makes sense that fixtures are finalised by that group, which includes three turf club members, horse owners, trainers, stable staff, members involved in the betting industry, three ministerial appointments, one of whom is required to be from Northern Ireland and, of course, a chair.  It is a pretty broad committee which sets up the sub-committee from within its membership and the recommendations come back and are signed off on by it.  Everyone is involved in the process.  We want decisions to be made on the basis of consensus, in terms of fixtures in particular, which is a very sensitive issue for many race courses.  We need to try to ensure we keep that consensus.  Ultimately, the Horse Racing Ireland board as a whole is responsible for getting this right. </p><p>I have already dealt with the requirement in the legislation to consult with Horse Racing Ireland.  The requirement does not mean that the Racing Regulatory Body, the Turf Club, has to seek permission.  It just means that there needs to be some consultation except where they need to make a matter of change as a matter of urgency.  In that case, they will just get on with it.  If there is a change in the rules the racing regulatory body wants to introduce or a course of action it needs to take, we are requiring that it would consult with Horse Racing Ireland, which may well have to put some structures or accommodation in place to ensure the decision can be implemented effectively.  They are just required to consult, but "consult" does not mean "seek permission".  It simply means consult.  Likewise, we expect Horse Racing Ireland to consult with the racing regulatory body when appropriate.  </p><p>The amendments tabled raised legitimate issues but I hope I have given credible answers that will allow us to progress the Bill this evening.  I have shown a willingness to accept many amendments on Committee and Report Stages as well as taking on board the recommendations made following the pre-legislative stage.  I hope the Seanad allows this legislation to proceed in a way that we can get it finalised this evening.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-27a.266" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012700002#YY00200"><p>I thank the Minister for the comprehensive overview of the legislation and highlighting the importance of the Irish thoroughbred breeding and horse racing industry to the economy.  As outlined by the Minister, it is worth about &euro;1.1 billion in economic output terms to the economy, which is significant.  We will not be hindering this legislation.  Of the parties on this side of the House, Fianna F&aacute;il has formed the opinion that it is important that this legislation is approved and signed off on before the Taoiseach dissolves the D&aacute;il, whenever that may be, in order to allow the industry get on with the work required.</p> <p>Today also the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine launched its report, the Irish Horse Industry, which cited 44 recommendations on areas such as funding, breeding, welfare and harness racing, so it is an important day for the horse racing industry in that respect.  While not linked to this legislation, nonetheless some of the recommendations contained within the report are addressed in it.  I know from the work of the joint committee that the pre-legislative scrutiny was a wonderful success.  This is how parliamentary democracy should work and legislation should be scrutinised.</p> <p>I commend the Minister for accepting in the other House some of the worthy suggestions from all sides of the House which were tabled in amendments.  This brings about proper and meaningful legislation.  Rushed legislation makes bad legislation.  This legislation was not rushed.  We may want to finish it off this evening but that does not mean it is being rushed because we had the opportunity through the committee system and in the other House for extensive debate. </p> <p>The importance of the industry has been highlighted by the Minister in economic terms, including the 18,000 jobs it supports.  Irish horses are exported to 37 countries every year at a value of more than &euro;200 million.  There are almost 7,000 breeders in Ireland, 15% of whom are overseas investors spread across every county in Ireland.  It is interesting that racing festivals contribute some &euro;260 million to local economies.  For example, the Galway Races is worth an estimated &euro;60 million and the latest figures available to me show attendance at race meetings in 2013 grew to 1.24 million.  It is a vitally important industry, the bedrock of Irish sport and must be supported.  </p> <p>This legislation is coming against the backdrop of the Indecon report in 2012 which provided a comprehensive analysis of the industry.  It made 37 recommendations on funding, the board of Horse Racing Ireland, the streamlining of functions, the marketing and competitiveness of the sector and the governance and legislative changes required.  I am glad these recommendations have been brought forward in this legislation.  Corporate governance, internal controls, board structure, financial autonomy and the oversight role are vitally important, in particular when State finances and taxpayers' money are being used.  Strengthening those through the legislative process adopted here will provide the oversight the Exchequer requires.  We speak of the Exchequer because we have the horse and greyhound fund.  The thoroughbred industry is funded extensively by private investment.  I understand it is approximately &euro;400 million.  There is then approximately &euro;55 million, of which 80% goes to horse racing, available from the horse and greyhound racing fund.</p> <p>Time is against us but there are some main points I wish to make on the legislation.  As mentioned by the Minister, the legislation will increase the number of ministerial appointees to the board and will clearly assign governance and regulatory responsibilities.  I urge the Minister, or whoever the new Minister may be, to ensure those appointments are credible.  We saw a recent appointment to the Irish Greyhound Board raised a number of questions from within the industry and was made against the recommendation of the Indecon report.  It had recommended that board appointments would not be for more than two terms.  Someone was appointed for a third term even though the corporate governance structures within that organisation are questionable.  This organisation has a &euro;1 million deficit this year, despite receiving more than &euro;15 million in Exchequer funding.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that those appointed are fit for purpose.  I am not making any political charge in this regard because my party was at the coal face of many politically motivated appointments.  It is wrong and the system needs to be changed so that we ensure we appoint knowledgeable people who can provide substance while on State boards.  </p> <p>The transparency and new structural arrangements are very much welcome.  The new financial management in the industry must be welcomed.  Elimination of the duplication role and driving increased efficiencies along with the proposal around the establishment of a new statutory committee must be welcomed.  The respective functions of Horse Racing Ireland and the Racing Regulatory Body are clarified.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Having incremental payments under the fund is also to be welcomed.  We need to build in performance management, and payments cannot be made willy-nilly.  If payments are made they must be made with the performance criteria or objectives laid down.</p><p>Giving the Department the role of value-for-money audits is good.  Those value-for-money audits need to be wide-ranging and should not specifically focus on efficiencies because value for money is not just about efficiencies.  Many of the public sector value-for-money reviews and policy changes have focused on efficiencies without looking at equity and effectiveness.  Of course, value for money relates to the three e's - efficiency, effectiveness and equity.  In an industry such as this, it is important not just to look at the bottom line in euro terms, but to look at the overall picture as well.  Of course, the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is very definitive because he cannot look at the overall effectiveness of value-for-money reviews, which is a shortcoming in the role.</p><p>I very much welcome the Betting (Amendment) Act to apply the 1% tax on online betting.  As we said this morning, this industry can be self-financing with a betting tax that is fit for purpose to fund the industry.  I welcome section 15 of the Bill and the Minister's comments that this is the first step.  The second step will be to introduce long-overdue legislation covering changes to the greyhound industry.  The IGB requires intervention as well.  I know the Minister is committed to that and he will certainly have our full support on this side of the House, although the arithmetic may well be changed after the general election.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is back in the agriculture portfolio if Fine Gael is returned to power.</p></speech>

It is critical to follow through on the greyhound industry, as a report on that industry was launched today as well.  The Indecon report dates back to 2010.  We need corporate governance in that industry.  Taxpayers are calling for it, as is the industry.  The internal controls are very weak.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be fully supporting the Bill and we hope the President signs it into law as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The Bill amends the Horseracing Industry Act 1994 and the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, the core legislation on the governing structures for the horseracing industry in Ireland.  The Bill increases ministerial representation on the board of Horse Racing Ireland, amends the general functions of HRI, alters the structure of HRI&rsquo;s statutory committees and outlines the general functions of the Racing Regulatory Body.  It also provides for the reform of certain administrative functions and the related payment of funds from the HRI to the RRB.  Certain provisions relating to control and accountability apply equally to HRI and Bord na gCon.</p> <p>The Bill originated following an Indecon review of certain aspects of the Irish horseracing industry and a report conducted by Smith and Williamson that made recommendations estimated to save &euro;1.8 million.  The Irish sport horse industry is worth more than &euro;708 million to the economy per annum and provides more than 12,000 full-time equivalent jobs.  The horse industry is part of our heritage and tradition and we should do all we can to allow it to prosper.  For that reason I am delighted to see the Bill in the House.</p> <p>The Bill will change the composition of the board of Horse Racing Ireland, the commercial State body that is the national authority for horseracing in Ireland, responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the industry.  Currently the Minister only nominates the chairperson and one other member of the board.  The Indecon report highlights this as a matter of concern.  Owing to the level of governance, further ministerial control over the process of decision making on the HRI board is required.  Section 4 of the Bill allows for three ministerial nominees.</p> <p>The Bill also proposes that payments from the horse and greyhound fund will only be made on the basis of the implementation of satisfactory business plans.  Section 14 provides for greater scrutiny on the disbursement of State funds.  This is to be welcomed, as it will ensure there is no wastage of State funds.</p> <p>The Bill will also establish two new sub-committees to represent the betting sector and the industry services committee, representing the workers and employers.  Under the provisions of the Bill, HRI will be subject to a legal requirement to comply with Government directives on governance.  Other elements of the Bill relate to corporate implementation of the Bill.  For example, the accounts of the RRB will now be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and published.</p> <p>The Bill updates the functions of HRI.  As I mentioned previously, it is important we do all we can to ensure the continued success of the Irish horse industry.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine, and the committee frequently considers and discusses the industry.  Today we published the report on the Irish horse industry, which made many recommendations.</p> <p>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the Minister's further comments.  The Bill will make our horse industry and governing bodies more efficient and effective.  Ireland has the potential to maintain a world-class horse industry and it is important we do all we can to encourage this.</p></speech>

Like other Senators, I am looking forward to seeing it through this evening so that it can be passed by both Houses before the Taoiseach decides to call the general election.</p> <p>I hope the Minister returns.  While he might not want to be Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, he has my support in getting that role again.  This evening we have a great Bill.  This evening may be my last opportunity to speak to the Minister.  When I met him first it was at the Global Economic Forum.  I was smiling because we were talking about &euro;12 billion for agrifood exports.  That seemed to me as being a flash of an eye, but we got to the &euro;12 billion, 45% growth and now Harvest 2025 refers to &euro;19 billion, 85% growth.  Who would have ever thought it?  I know the Minister has brilliant officials in his Department; I have had a lot of dealings with them in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine.  It has been some achievement in the Minister's time.  I want to put that on the record.  I wish there were more like the Minister, Deputy Coveney, around the place; he has done a wonderful job.</p></speech>

I welcome the Bill and in particular the sections that strengthen the corporate governance, transparency and accountability, with clarification of the roles of HRI, the RRB and that they will come under the codes of best practice.  It is the only way to go for the industry.</p> <p>While the Minister has probably not had the chance to see it, this morning the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine launched the report on the Irish horse industry.  It contains some extremely good recommendations.  I hope the incoming committee and Minister take it up and run with it.  We recognise that Ireland has raw materials in terms of land, climate and knowledge to maintain a world-class equine industry.  As the Minister said, Ireland is near the top of the tree in world-class racing and breeding.  However, we need to continue to invest, grow and evolve to compete with our near neighbours in Britain, France and the USA.</p> <p>The Minister spoke about the 80,000 visitors and the 16,000 mainly rural jobs, which are so important to us all.  Some &euro;400 million is invested by owners, much of it foreign direct investment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Ann O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2389"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2389&amp;amp;pid=MaryAnnOBrien&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have a new American gentleman on the scene who has invested upwards of &euro;50 million in the past year and a half in Ireland.  Who knows how many jobs he has created?  He has two large stud farms and is planning to make a home here.  Why are individuals like that attracted to Ireland?  It is wonderful they are bringing their money here.</p><p>Sometimes it is claimed at the committee that horse racing is an elitist sport.  All Members here know we are not talking about an elitist sport.  I agree we have some high-end players in the industry who are world class.  However, there are many small breeders, small trainers and syndicates of owners with a collective interest in a racehorse.  I challenge anyone to go to Goffs or a race meeting and call it elitist because there is much fun and camaraderie at these.  That is why we spend so much time on this legislation and we all want to get it right.</p><p>I have several amendments that I intend to introduce on Committee Stage.  I want to delete the requirement that membership of the race fixtures committee should be limited to members of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  I was the do-everything man at the Phoenix Park racecourse for 11 years and race fixtures was one of my jobs.  I liaised with one of the most wonderful human beings I ever had the luck to work with, a gentleman called Sam Waller, who was part of the Turf Club and head of race fixtures.  To me, the term &ldquo;race fixtures&rdquo; also involves the make-up of every race meeting.  It is important if a race is five furlongs or six furlongs on 7 August at Leopardstown or the Curragh because it may have ramifications for the horse.  It could affect where the horse might run in England in the following month and whether it is a grade 1 or grade 2 race.</p><p>It is all about having somebody like Sam Waller who had a global perspective.  I do not know if he was even paid but he was passionate about the sport.  He would telephone me on a Saturday night at 11 o'clock about whether a race would be for two-year-olds, under five furlongs or over six furlongs for the following year.  It made much of a difference because it tied into the European and international pattern committees.  It is in that spirit I brought this amendment.  There are many passionate people who are expert and knowledgeable in this industry.  I could name many of them for the Minister.  However, they might be outside of the HRI board because they are in the Turf Club, an ex-owner or ex-trainer with amazing international horse-racing knowledge.  It could be somebody like Henry Beeby from Goffs.  There are so many good people around.  I found this provision in the Bill somewhat exclusive and I wondered if the Minister understood how vital it is to the industry.  I hope the term &ldquo;race fixtures&rdquo; used in the Bill does not simply refer to dates.</p></speech>

In business to me the word &ldquo;consult&rdquo; is very soft.  I am keen to have this legislation bring in new rules, transparency and accountability with the Turf Club making the rules while HRI doers all the other regulatory jobs.  It is great that we are going to save money with one Department collecting all the money.  Coming from my work background that amounts to what may be termed "lean manufacturing".  The rules and regulatory side of racing are vital and it is important we keep them watertight.  I might be wrong but the word &ldquo;consult&rdquo; seems soft to me.  I prefer the word &ldquo;inform&rdquo;.  If I were making the rules, I would feel stronger if I informed the board.  However, if I had to consult with the board, it means it could change what I had done.  It also affects the idea of retaining independence.  That is the spirit in which I will be introducing an amendment on Committee Stage.  In my line of work, to "consult" a little bit soft.  The Minister knows what consultants are like too.</p></speech>

I welcome the Horse Racing Ireland Bill 2015.  I followed the extensive debate on the Bill the Lower House last week.  The Bill strengthens governance and transparency in the racing industry, which is very important.  It increases efficiency and provides clarity of functions between the HRI and the Racing Regulatory Body, RRB.  It helps to control State funding in both the horse and greyhound industry.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill spoke earlier about the greyhound industry.  When the Minister spoke about the most recent round of funding for the greyhound industry, he spoke about ring-fencing funds for prize money to prevent funds going into the black hole of Bord na gCon&rsquo;s debt.  This is important because, no more than the horse industry, the greyhound industry at the lower end is going through a difficult period.  We know that from statistics and owners.</p> <p>We also know the horse industry is in difficulty.  While over 18,000 people are working in the industry and the headline figures are good, there are many people struggling at the lower end of it.  We should not lose sight of that either.  It is great to see breeders coming into Ireland, as well as well-heeled owners putting their horses into training here.  However, it is also important to remember that the small operator, who in many cases is a part-time trainer or farmer, needs to have some skin in the game to remain in the industry.  If they do not, they give up.</p> <p>I welcome the fact the Minister has taken on board the recommendations of the Indecon and the Smith &amp;amp; Williamson reports and included them in the provisions of the Bill.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister has broadened the board of HRI to include a member from the Irish Stablestaff Association.  It represents the largest number of employees in the business and it is important their voice is heard at the board.  For many years, it was not.  They are now better represented and their terms of employment have been greatly improved.  This is in no small measure to Bernard Caldwell.</p> <p>I welcome the provision on fines and the clarification of the functions of HRI, as well as the separation of the roles of the RRB and HRI.  I also welcome the deduction of part of the prize moneys for various funds such as the jockey and trainer pension trust and the welfare fund, which is very important.  This needed to be enshrined in legislation.  There was anecdotal evidence that sometimes the apportionment of these moneys did not find itself where it should have.</p> <p>The strengthening of governance has been referred to by many speakers already.  This is a very important area as people need to have trust and faith in the industry.  That can only be done through good governance.  We do not see this to the same extent in the greyhound industry.  If the Minister is back in office after the election I hope that will be his next task.  Senators Comiskey and &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the agriculture committee report on the greyhound and horse industry, which made 44 recommendations for the horse racing industry and 13 for the greyhound industry.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Denis Landy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2349"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2349&amp;amp;pid=DenisLandy&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Much of what was recommended in that report has been incorporated into this Bill.  The next area for address by the Minister if he is re-elected, and I hope that he is because as stated by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, he is doing an excellent job in this area, is the greyhound industry, which is extremely ill at the moment.  There is no point pretending otherwise.  If the difficulties in that industry are not grasped by somebody like the Minister, it will not survive.  I am glad to say that the prognosis is better in terms of horse racing, as evident from the already improving figures at race tracks across the country.  </p><p>I listened to the debate on this Bill in the Lower House, during which there was much interaction between the Minister and members of my own party and the Opposition on the point-to-point issue, which I enjoyed.  The Minister referenced in his opening speech today that he has taken cognisance of some of the issues raised at that time and has amended the Bill to take account of others.  I would welcome if he could clarify which of the amendments to this Bill arise out of the issues raised during the debate in the D&aacute;il.  I have a copy of that debate, 12 pages of which are a report of the interaction between the Minister and Members.  However, I am none the wiser as to what changes the Minister has taken on board.  </p><p>I hope that this Bill is passed by the Seanad this evening and can then be signed by the President within the next week.  The horse racing industry is in a good state.  My interest in it comes from my father who bred horses at the lower end of the scale, such that they did not qualify as race horses.  They were half-breeds as we would know them.  I have a great interest in point-to-point racing.  I first saw Faugheen in a point-to-point race.  He was later sold for &euro;10,000.  The nearest point-to-point race track to me is located across the road from where I live and it is run by Mr. Johnny Walsh, chairman of the Kilmoganny hunt in Carrick-on-Suir.  Racing takes place on the rawest and wettest winter days.  For me, the joys of Cheltenham and what happens there with horses, such as Faugheen, is what this industry is about.  I respect that the flat industry is the other side of the coin but I was never introduced to that and I do not know too much about it.</p><p>In terms of the introduction of this legislation, the Minister has done a great job.  I would welcome it if he could clarify the issues I raised.  As I said, I hope the Bill is passed by the Seanad tonight without any difficulty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-27a.281" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1122" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012700002#BBB00200"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  In 2012, horse racing contributed &euro;1.1 billion to this economy.  Its exports to 27 countries in 2013 were estimated to be worth &euro;205 million.  It is important, therefore, that we get this legislation right and ensure transparency and accountability in horse racing.  The entire horse racing structure must be democratised.  In that respect, I am concerned about the proposals on ministerial appointments and changes in the structure of the board of Horse Racing Ireland.</p> <p>The Bill seeks to change the current status of the Horse Racing Ireland board and the committee that submits policy decisions to the board for approval.  Since its establishment in 2001, it has been the policy of the HRI board to approve committee decisions and recommendations.  It could be argued that the primary reason for the proposed changes to the HRI board is to give more central control to the executive and to dilute the power of industry bodies whose representatives are elected to the board by members.  One could also argue that this has allowed large corporate bookmaking companies to exercise control over Horse Racing Ireland, which is a semi-State company.  </p> <p>Online gambling is worth approximately &euro;2 billion per annum while land-based gambling is worth approximately &euro;1.7 billion per annum.  As such, the gambling industry is worth almost &euro;4 billion per annum.  Many people will argue that vested interests in the bookmaking chains have a strong lobby and exercise considerable influence through Horse Racing Ireland and its connections.  This, we believe, sends out a dangerous signal.  The proposed changes in the Bill support my argument that the legislation increases the powers of the executive.  For example, it is proposed to reduce the number of elected representatives on the HRI board and increase the number of ministerial appointments to the board.  Powerful on-course bookmakers now have provision for a seat on the HRI board which they did not have in the past.  </p> <p>The change in structures for certain financial committees, including on media rights, that take power away from racecourses and traditional industry bodies means a move from three seats to five, two of which appointments will be made by HRI but may not be members of HRI.  This changes the balance of power in favour of the executive.  The Bill seeks to remove any independent financial support from the industry body, the Turf Club, and to give it to the executive of HRI.  This will control and further weaken the industry body.  Anything that reduces the integrity of a body, such as the Turf Club, or gives the impression of having done so, sends out a dangerous signal.  How can the racing and regulatory body be solely and independently responsible for making the rules of racing if it has a statutory obligation to consult with HRI before doing so?</p> <p>I note there is nothing in the Bill regarding harness racing.  The Irish Harness Racing Association recently made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I understand the association has also been in contact with the Minister.  I would like to see its interests forming part of this Bill, as, I am sure, would other members of that committee.  Many would argue that it has been left outside the loop because, as put to the committee by a member of the association, it is a working man's and working woman's sport.  That sector of the industry receives no financial support from the Department.  It has been ignored continuously.  The HRI has been preventing those involved from having access to privately owned race tracks.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify in his response whether he intends to take on board amendments to include harness racing in this Bill.  We believe this would be helpful.</p> <p>On forestry, the Minister said earlier that on enactment of this Bill only one consent will be required and that this will be administered by his Department.  Currently, consent is required from the Department in relation to the construction of a forestry road while an entirely separate consent is required from the local planning authority for an entrance from a forestry road on to a public road.  Sinn F&eacute;in reads this to mean that the Department will now bear sole responsibility in respect of consent which means that the Minister will give consent for a private road to go on to a public road.  We would like clarification on how this fits into the planning laws.  As every elected representative knows, be they local councillors or Deputies, planning rules and regulations must be adhered to and any access to a public road requires planning permission.  Is the Minister now saying that his Department will have the power to overrule these laws and allow a private forestry road access to a public road?  </p> <p>I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to the issues I have raised.</p></speech>

I also thank them for their briefings on the legislation during its passage through the pre-legislative stage and in the D&aacute;il.  This legislation is welcome on the basis that it should help in the long-term planning and funding of an industry that is integral and central to rural Ireland in terms of the jobs it provides and the sustainability of our rural economy.</p> <p>Horse racing is a sport in which Ireland is a world champion.  If horse racing was an Olympic sport Irish jockeys would be winning gold, silver and bronze medals.  I would appreciate if the Minister, on my behalf, would take up with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, whom I trust has some degree of responsibility for broadcasting, my disappointment at the lack of coverage of Irish racing and Irish racing results on the RTE sports news, particularly on Saturday and Sunday nights.  Some weeks ago, an Irish cross-country team returned to Ireland having won a bronze medal, to which significant and appropriate coverage was given.  I am sure that on that particular occasion there were significant Irish successes on the racecourses of Britain and beyond - I think there was a big meeting in Hong Kong that weekend - that went virtually unmarked by our national broadcaster.  Senator Cummins might recall the RTE "Airs and Races" programme some 25 or 30 years ago.</p></speech>

Attendance at race meetings has decreased.  The failure of a new generation to emerge as racing fans is a cause for concern.  We must push those State agencies over which we have some control to ensure greater coverage of this sport.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Bradford:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Whereas Ireland succeeds admirably on the international stage in horse racing, we should try to ensure it is covered from a media perspective.  I refer not merely to success and prize money but also to jobs created in virtually every county.  This is in passing and beyond the scope of the Bill, but the Minister might speak to whosoever has a say in that regard.</p><p>The Minister referred to the Indecon report, from which the Bill stems.  It was published in 2012 and work probably started on it in 2011 or thereabouts.  I compliment all concerned.  However, life moves on quickly and what is now needed is another such report on the broader aspects of the economic and other benefits of the industry to the economy, the rural economy in particular, as well as on how to plan ahead.  In a sense, the Bill pertains more to the structures, administration and mechanisms of trying to do things properly, but the next report, independently commissioned or, I hope, commissioned by the Department, must examine the future of the industry, its future funding and future participants, how more people are to be engaged in the industry and how to ensure it will continue to go from success to success.  One cannot be sure of the permanent success of the horse racing and horse breeding industry as new challenges are emerging.  Other governments and countries across the globe are learning from us.  I refer to Ireland's engagement to an extent with the Chinese.  An entire racing industry is probably about to be born in China.  All of these challenges will emerge and we must plan for them.  While this is legislation about regulation stemming from the Indecon report, it should be possible to commission a report on the future of the industry and how to ensure its growth, expansion and central relevance to the rural economy.</p><p>While I apologise for missing the commencement of the Minister's speech, I was listening to it on the Seanad phone-in service and heard the Minister responding in advance to amendments that had not yet been proposed.  I thank him for trying to assist Members in that regard.  However, I was taken by Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh's comments about what I still call the Turf Club side of the Bill.  My general view of the world is that when something is not broken, one should not deliberately try to fix it.  I note progress has been made and appreciate that arising from the Committee Stage debate, the earlier debate and, presumably, from representations the Minister has received and meetings he has held, he introduced further important Committee Stage amendments last week to try to ease the concerns and worries of the Turf Club that somehow this could be the beginning of a takeover.  Members must assert strongly that without the absolute independence, integrity and freedom of the Turf Club, the industry would not and will not receive the level of respect it requires.  A few months ago I had thought Members would be debating a slightly different version of the Bill and, to be honest, even though it might have been a single voice, I was committed to voting against it.  However, I acknowledge that the Minister has made amendments and gone some distance towards assuring the Turf Club of the absolute integrity of its services.  Nevertheless, it is necessary to continue to provide such reassurance and one does not need this Bill to be the first part of a five part takeover.  The industry has worked well and throughout the country, at race meetings and point-to-point meetings, thousands of people contribute on a voluntary basis, much of which stems from the services being provided by the Turf Club.  I was genuinely but pleasantly surprised to learn that the hundreds of stewards who worked across the country did so in an entirely voluntary capacity.  There was a time when one thought the same applied to the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, but it certainly applies to the Turf Club.  It is great that so many people are willing to be involved and give of their time and effort on an absolutely voluntary basis.  That is why the integrity and independence of the Turf Club must be central to the administrative side of the structure.  Point-to-point meeting regulation and management gave rise to a major argument at the pre-legislative stage when colleagues on all sides of the House expressed their views to the Minister in that regard.  Not being a legal expert, he has attempted to resolve the issue as best as possible.  Point-to-point racing has been the nursery of many national hunt champions and worked well, again on a highly voluntary, rural and community basis.  Members should try to ensure it will stay as close as possible to that model because it is not broken.  Therefore, they should be no attempt to fix it.</p><p>I have one question on section 9 of the Bill.  While Bills which have been published and passed and memorandums all get mixed up, presumably section 9 is still the provision which relates to the foal levy.  This is probably a question the Minister does not wish me to ask, but it is on liability for the foal levy.  While it may be extraneous to this legislation, he will be aware of the level of disquiet about the foal levy calculation.  It may be the subject of a number of legal interventions and I understand the Minister has had meetings or certainly considered representations on the matter of the calculation of the levey.  I am fortunate to be in this House by virtue of my nomination by the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, for which I am thankful.  However, it is fair to state many breeders believe their view of the foal levy is not being represented and presented sufficiently to the Minister, although I acknowledge that the IFA has been making inquiries and representations.  I may not have time to go into the issue in full, but there is a significant variation between what is being demanded in the foal levy in some cases and what the owners of foals believe they should pay.  It stems from the fact that, as the Minister is aware, the advertised fees for a particular stallion often, if not always, are at significant variance with the paid fees.  The argument concerns what the level of fee should be and who should be the final arbitrator.  While the Minister might respond to that point, overall I give guarded support to the legislation.  It is welcome that the Minister has moved to address some concerns about the regulation and integrity of the industry.  Perhaps Members might hear further from him on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I have been impressed by the depth of knowledge of the Bill and the horse racing industry of the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture Food and the Marine.  The contribution that surprised me was by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien as I had not realised she was so involved.  She really shocked me because I had not thought she had been born early enough to even remember the Phoenix Park racecourse.  I was aware of Senator Paul Bradford's knowledge of the breeding industry and no wonder he is asking the Minister about the fee for foals.</p> <p>As mentioned by other Members, the Bill seeks to build on the Indecon report on certain aspects of the horse racing industry in Ireland.  Its stated purpose is to strengthen governance and transparency within the administration of horse racing, to improve accountability and control over State funding in the sector, to clarify the respective functions of Horse Racing Ireland and the Racing Regulatory Body and to provide for the streamlining of certain administrative functions.  The regulatory impact assessment of the Bill, published in May 2014, of the general scheme, identified two policy options that were being considered at the time, namely, to do nothing or to implement the recommendations made in the Indecon report.  In the light of the industry statistics for the period from 2007 to 2011, the evident decline in the industry and the need to address issues that had the potential to enhance the governance issues and create efficiencies, the former was ruled out.  The Bill is so good because of the consultation that took place and the people who attended the Oireachtas joint committee meetings.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They included the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners, the Irish Stable Staff Association, the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association, the Irish Jockeys Association, the Irish Bookmakers Association, Horse Racing Ireland, Bord na gGon, the Association of Irish Racecourses, the Racegoers Consultative Forum, the Turf Club, the Irish national hunt steeplechase committee and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I am delighted that a member of the Irish Stable Staff Association is now on the committee.  People cannot say that there has been no consultation on this Bill.  The consultation has been good, which is why the Bill is so good.</p><p>The Irish horse racing sector makes a significant contribution to Irish agriculture and this can be measured in terms of the economic value, employment and tourism it generates.  The horse and greyhound industry receives Government support, which is provided under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  I do not think people realise how valuable horse racing is to the country.  It was estimated that the industry underpinned 14,000 jobs, &euro;1.1 billion in economic output and a value of &euro;205 million in exports to 37 countries worldwide.  This is a significant contribution to the economy.  </p><p>As this could be the Minister's last visit to this House as we are all expecting the Taoiseach to call an election soon, I compliment him on his attendance in this House over the past five years.  He has always been on top of his brief when coming into this House.  This legislation is based on research and consultation, which the Minister has always valued.  I commend the Bill to the House and wish the Minister every success for the future.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  I obviously appreciate those from my own crowd as well.  They are always welcome.</p> <p>I will answer some of the questions people have put because I want to reassure people about a number of things.  People need to realise that the horse and greyhound racing fund is now &euro;74 million per year.  We have dramatically increased that in the past five years.  We had reached a point in racing looking from the outside in because when I became Minister and took over political responsibility for the racing industry, the first thing it was important for me to recognise was that the people in the industry know an awful lot more about breeding and training horses than I do, even though I take an interest in horses.  My role was really about ensuring that this industry was properly funded and legislated for so that we had the right structures and the experts could operate and run a world-class industry and sport with the protections that proper legislation can provide, and with the necessary resources to be able to provide prize money and investment in this sector to ensure it can compete with other countries like the UK, France, Australia, Japan and the US, which are our big competitors in terms of attracting breeders, owners and big race meetings.</p> <p>We always said that as soon as we could afford to do it, we would start increasing the funding again for the sector, which had been reduced very dramatically due to a very difficult economic period for Ireland.  We are back up to the height of the fund.  We have a new revenue stream coming from online betting.  I would like to see the levy on that increase but we have a very healthy funding package for the sector and a very good piece of legislation to protect the sector in terms of the transparency and accountability needed in any modern agent of the State or one working for or partly funded by the State, regardless of whether that is providing integrity services or management and marketing of this great industry.</p> <p>The reason I say that is because when I get questions around the changed board structure in HRI, one of the reasons I believe it is not enough for the Minister to only have the capacity to appoint the chair and nobody else on that board is because I believe that if &euro;60 million or &euro;70 million of public money is going into a sport, the Minister must take responsibility for that.  It is necessary to have qualified, smart and informed people representing the State, Government and essentially the public purse on that board.  One of those appointees must be from Northern Ireland in terms of representing racing interests.  We are talking about three people being appointed by the Minister out of a board of 14.  The rest requires a balanced representation of all of the stakeholders.  </p> <p>We have really listened to people in terms of who they should be, including the committee.  I was delighted to ensure that stable staff were represented on the board.   One thing I have tried to do during my period involved with the racing industry was to raise the profile of and support jockeys and stable staff, many of whom are unsung heroes in this sport and who wake up at 5 a.m. preparing to ride out and exercise horses and take the bumps, bruises and breaks that come with that because these are highly charged athletes in terms of the animals.  We read about the superstar jockeys and they take the bumps and bruises too but there is an entire ecosystem in the racing industry that involves thousands of people and it is important that they feel part of the representative body that is there to promote and grow this sport.  </p> <p>I do not agree with the criticism that somehow a ministerial appointment is tainted and that it is less democratic to have somebody on the board representing the State that is putting in significant amounts of money.  People can give examples of bad appointments in the past.  I stand over all the appointments I have made.  I think they have done a pretty good job over the past five years, including my appointment to the chair of HRI.  People should not forget that we have a PAS system that tests people before appointments can be made to ensure no inappropriate appointments are made.  </p> <p>I have a lot of sympathy with people who have been asking the Department and I to look in a more proactive way at how we could help harness racing to grow in Ireland but it is not the same as racing as we know it currently.  One cannot simply say that because harness racing involves horses and thoroughbred racing involves horses and jockeys, we should all of a sudden lump them together in the one piece of legislation and the one sport.  It is not the same.  We need to build a well-run and properly-regulated, structured and funded sport in Ireland if we are going to build a harness racing industry here.  It is a huge industry in France and the US.  We have some really good breeders here and people who are passionate about this sport.  We want to help them but it would be very unfair on many other equine sports, be they showjumping, eventing or a whole series of other equine-related sporting activities, to simply say that we are going to take harness racing and plug it into the funding stream that the racing industry gets.  It would be wrong to do that without going through the proper assessment processes and taking independent advice in terms of how we grow the harness racing industry in a way that supports and guarantees welfare, excellence, proper regulation, integrity and so on.  We can do that and I hope we will do that.</p> <p>I have given a commitment that we will pursue and prioritise that within the Department but we cannot simply say that because we would like to see this industry develop, it must be forced into this legislation.  To be fair to Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael representatives, I think everybody is at one here about the need to do this properly and not rush it.  I have intervened to ensure that Dundalk has been used for a harness racing meet.  There are other venues as well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Let us build this in a proper structured way, so we can stand over what we are doing, and let us look at the funding models, just as we have to look at the funding models for the horse sports sector.  At the moment, harness racing is under Horse Sport Ireland not Horse Racing Ireland.  There will always be competition for resources and we need to assess how best to do this in a way that is balanced and fair to everybody but we will do it.  I have given a commitment on that and I will follow through on it if I have the opportunity to do so.<br/><br/>I wish to provide reassurance and clarity on forest roads.  We had a ridiculous situation whereby people who wanted to build a forest road had to go through two different permitting systems that were totally unconnected with each other.  It was a very frustrating process, a little bit like when someone is trying to develop &ndash; Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill will know this &ndash; something on the coastline and one must get planning permission and a foreshore licence.  I am pleased to say we are changing the system with the foreshore Bill but in the past, they were not connected to each other which meant it took a long time to do a basic piece of construction work.  We said we would fix that and allow the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which has responsibility for forestry, to permit the building of forest roads.  Of course, it requires consultation with local authorities to ensure that it is done in accordance with all of the rules and regulations concerning access to roads in terms of lines of sight and all the other things that are required.  We will go through that with the local authority and make sure it is done properly.  This is a sensible practical legislation to try to make it easier to build forest roads and to reduce the cost but at the same time make sure the regulations are followed appropriately.<br/><br/>There was never an intention for us to undermine point-to-point racing or to change the way in which it operates or for there to be some form of take-over of local hunt clubs and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee or the Hunt Club by HRI.  That was never my intention.  That was the reaction to this because people felt threatened.  They felt their sport was being threatened by a change in legislation, so we have moved to reassure people that was never the intention.  Accordingly, following animated interaction between Deputy Penrose and me, it was agreed that we would stick with the wording agreed at the committee meeting as opposed to the wording I proposed on Report Stage, which I felt strengthened the wording.  People were happier with the other wording, which I am also happy to go with.  The reference now states:</p><blockquote>(i) to maintain the existing nature of point-to-point steeplechases, including making and enforcing the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Regulations for point-to-point steeplechase as made by the Stewards of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee).&rdquo;.&ldquo;</blockquote><p>In other words, there is no change.  The only thing that is changing is the streamlining of the payment to get hunter certificates.  When one registers one&rsquo;s horse as a point-to-pointer, one pays to get the certificate and that payment goes through the single administrative office run by HRI but the money then goes into the Turf Club or the Irish National Steeplechase Committee as it always would have.  The functions of local hunt clubs do not change at all in terms of their charging system and decision making system.<br/><br/>I hope we have put that issue to bed and we have reassured people.  I am impressed by the fact that people are so passionate about point-to-pointing that they see any change as a threat, which in IFA language, must be resisted.  That is what came back to me, often in very passionate language.  I had one meeting where there were tears in the eyes of the person making the case that we must not change anything in point-to-points at all and that it was undermining the independence of the sport among other things.  There is a reality that we cannot talk about point-to-points as if it is not horse racing.  We cannot have bookies turning up to point-to-points with no regulation at all in terms of how they operate, behave and take money from people.  We must have some rules and regulations in legislation without changing the nature of point-to-points, which is this free sport run across rural areas with lots of volunteers doing great work.  Members should not forget that we provide prize money for point-to-point races as well, which is also public money, and we must also ensure there are safety requirements for jockeys and so on.  The racing regulatory body, the Turf Club, is responsible for the integrity of point-to-points just like it is for the integrity services within race meets at race tracks.  I hope Senator Bradford and others who raised the issue have been reassured.<br/><br/>I accept the point made about television coverage.  I do not know whether I am right but my inclination is to believe that ten or 15 years ago, there was probably a lot more racing on television than there is today but I do not know that for sure.  I will raise the issue with RTE to see what it has to say.  Sometimes RTE provides great coverage but only for the big races.  The coverage of Cheltenham, for example, is often really good.<br/><br/>On the protection of the integrity and independence of the Turf Club, my position is that this is really good legislation for the racing regulatory body or the Turf Club, as we know it.  It enshrines in modern legislation its independence, how and where it gets is budget, the process by which that works and the conciliation body that is in place if a problem arises.  The Bill outlines in a very clear way the role and functions of the Turf Club.  I have also been careful to ensure that in factoring in the budget for which the Turf Club applies from HRI, that other functions must be factored in outside of simply providing a purely regulatory function.  Getting the wording for that was difficult because the Turf Club does other things, such as raise the profile of racing and get involved in the operation of the Curragh.  It also holds events as an organisation.  There needs to be some recognition of the extra activity, which is difficult to define in legislation, in its income streams and the budget it seeks.  We have catered for that in a sensible and practical way.  People who understand how racing works in Ireland know exactly what I am talking about when I say that.<br/><br/>What we are doing with the legislation regarding the foal levy is saying that before a horse can become registered, the foal levy must be paid.  That is all we are saying.  We are not determining how the foal levy is calculated.  I do not have any problem with having a discussion about that in the future in terms of listening to what people have to say and looking at how the levy is calculated and whether it can be made fairer.  The issue is that it needs to remain simple to calculate.  It is much easier to calculate a foal levy on the basis of advertised fees as opposed to having to go after people to find out exactly what was handed over after the deed was done in terms of the paperwork.  There have been moves to change the foal levy in recent years to make it fairer.  We can examine the matter again.  I do not have any problem with that but it does not affect the legislation.<br/><br/>In terms of Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien's amendments and comments.  On the fixtures committee, the legislation states:</p><blockquote>(2) The race-fixtures committee, when considering race-fixtures for a racecourse, shall, before recommending the removal of any existing fixture from that racecourse, consult with the executive of the racecourse concerned and seek to agree with such executive how such removal may be achieved having regard to the economic importance of the fixture to that racecourse&quot;.</blockquote><p>In other words, the whole point is that the members of the fixtures committee, which is a subcommittee of HRI, speak to people, the kind of people to whom the Senator referred, whose life is racing, the detail of racing and the fixtures concerned.  They get the right feedback and then they bring recommendations back to HRI to make decisions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is accountable and answerable for those decisions to the industry, to me and to the Oireachtas committees if it does not get them right.  I believe what we have in the legislation at the moment is sufficient.</p><p>There was quite a long discussion on the issue of "consult" versus "inform".  We have taken advice from the Parliamentary Counsel on the wording.  Let us suppose the Turf Club is going to make a change.  If the legislation requires it to inform HRI, it could simply write to HRI the hour or day beforehand to inform it.  However, a response may be required from HRI to facilitate that change.  Therefore, the word "consult" means someone has to pick up the phone to say that the change is to be made and that there will be a knock-on effect for HRI from a management, cost and resource point of view, so the Turf Club is letting HRI know this is what will happen and is finding out if it is okay with that and whether the change should be phased in or not.  The decision remains with the racing regulatory body but it is being asked to consult.  However, it is also the case that if an urgent change is required, it can just press ahead.</p><p>The reason I believe "consult" is the better word is that we are trying to have a relationship between the people who are applying and setting the rules and the people who are responsible for managing the functioning of racing.  There needs to be a practical discussion of changes when they are being made.  As I said, we had a long discussion on this, following which I considered "consult" to be preferable to "inform".</p></speech>

It goes back to some of the initial comments we made and which the Minister heard in the earlier stages in regard to drawing the regulatory body closer to the bosom of HRI through the legislation.  Is the Minister satisfied the drafting of this section gives a fair and balanced opportunity to the regulatory body to maintain its financial independence, notwithstanding the fact that where taxpayers' money is concerned, we must ensure it is spent in a proper fashion?  It seems a lengthy set of requirements and rules.  Is it one which the Minister has reflected on or requested representation about?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-27a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012700002#FFF01500"><p>I am glad the Senator asked that question.  The brief explains it quite well.  As the Senator knows, I go off script a lot but the script looks to be accurate in this case.</p> <p>Section 12 aims to strengthen accountability for public funds by providing that the regulatory body prepare accounts in respect of its statutory obligations and forward the accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit purposes and that the chief executive of the racing regulatory body attend the Committee of Public Accounts of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann when so requested.  The section also replicates the onus on HRI to provide details of compliance with governance codes and policies by requiring the racing regulatory body to provide information to the Minister in regard to its statutory activities, including its compliance with Government codes and policies, so the Minister may be reassured as to the compliance of the horse racing industry with the codes and policies.  Finally, the section provides that the racing regulatory body must provide information to HRI with regard to future funding requirements and disposal of funds, so HRI may comply with its statutory obligations in accounting for funding for the industry.</p> <p>What we are doing here is applying best practice in terms of modern governance.  If we are giving &euro;7.1 million a year to the racing regulatory body to perform integrity functions, then it is only a matter of time before somebody raises the question of how it is spending that money, whether we are getting full value for money, how it is being accounted for and where is the transparency.  I am not going to allow a situation where the Turf Club gets pulled in front of an Oireachtas committee unfairly, given it is doing a pretty good job at the moment, because of some perception of a lack of transparency in terms of how it spends and accounts for its money.  As I said, I think it does a pretty good job and, in fact, I do not believe this section is of significant concern to the Turf Club because it is pretty confident it does a good job.</p> <p>I have had no real requests to change this section.  This is a protection that allows the chief steward to say at any public forum that the Turf Club has to comply with all of the standards any other body that is predominantly funded by the State has to comply with and that it does that and is happy to do it.  That is what this section is about.  One of the reasons this legislation is so important for me is that I do not want what we have seen other charitable entities go through in terms of getting dragged over the coals due to a perception of a lack of transparency or inappropriate decision-making around how money is spent.  The racing industry does not need that and it is not going to have that.  We are putting in place proper and modern governance structures.  Just as we are demanding of HRI, within reason we also have to be demanding of the Turf Club in terms of complying with the appropriate codes of practice and laying its accounts before the appropriate bodies that are available to the State.</p></speech>

There are many good people in the industry and many good people on the board of Bord na gCon, who are trying to change the industry for the better.  They need help to do that and strong legislation would help in that.  We will take the opportunity to ensure that the board must, like Horse Racing Ireland "respond to a request coming from the Minister".  It gets its funding from the State and needs to be able to respond to the appropriate codes of practice and governance applying to it, just as they apply to other bodies that are funded or partly funded by public moneys.  It is no more or less than that.</p><p>I would not see a conspiracy around this corner, although we are making changes.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, has primary responsibility for the greyhound industry.  There has been significant change in the past number of years, but there was a lot to fix.  There is a need for that approach to continue to ensure we have a healthy and growing sport that is properly financed for the future and to ensure we deal with some of the legacy debt issues, which are a big problem for the industry.</p></speech>

I know that is not normal practice.  Normally we would have Second Stage, followed by a break for about a week and we would then return and take Committee and Report Stages.  I thank Members for the pragmatic approach they have taken towards getting this done.  Most people would accept that all the amendments that needed to be made to this legislation have been made and that it is time to pass it and move on with it.  It would have been a frustrating night's work for me to have this pushed to a new government to finish.  I thank Members for accommodating the Bill, particularly Senators who put forward amendments but decided not to push them.</p> <p>This is definitely the last time I will get to speak in the Seanad under my current responsibilities.  We have had a number of good interactions in terms of legislation, particularly on animal welfare where we had approximately ten hours of debate in the House.  We have also had good interaction on fishing and broader farming and agrifood issues and each time that has been a rewarding process for me.  I want to wish Senators who are candidates in the upcoming election well and I hope we will all see each other again soon.  I expect that in the next few days we will get on with the more raw side of politics in a very competitive election campaign.  I thank Senators for their co-operation this evening and believe we have done a very good job on this piece of legislation.</p></speech>
