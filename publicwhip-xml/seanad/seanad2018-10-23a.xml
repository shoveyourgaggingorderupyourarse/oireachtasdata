We are delighted to see the Minister here and he is very welcome.  I also extend the congratulations of the Labour Party group to the Minister on his new post.  I thank him for taking this matter.</p> <p>The question we have raised, on foot of representations to both Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and me, is to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to inform the House why children with Down's syndrome are excluded from the July provision scheme administered by his Department and if he will explain the rationale behind the specific criteria being applied by the Department for this exclusion.  The Minister may be aware that this is of serious concern to many parents throughout Ireland who have children with Down's syndrome.  There is an online petition on the issue of July provision which has been signed by about 5,000 parents to date.  The issue they raise is what seems to be an irrational exclusion of children with Down's syndrome from a scheme of July provision which provides supports to children with certain intellectual disabilities over the summer months.  July provision is not available to children with Down's syndrome who have a mild or moderate intellectual disability.  This seems strange, given that children with the same level of intellectual disability with different conditions are able to access the programme.</p> <p>The parents who have come to us have told us eloquently how their children would benefit greatly from the programme for many reasons, in particular that the summer holidays are very long, their children crave routine and structure and are unable to participate in the majority of mainstream summer camps.  They fall behind in their schoolwork and their educational development as a result of not having access, through the July provision scheme, to educational supports in the summer months.  Their children also tend to be absent more often than other children during the teaching terms and they miss valuable learning time during those months which could be made up during the summer when they tend to be at their healthiest.</p> <p>Letters have been sent to the Minister's Department and officials and there does not seem to be any rational basis offered for the exclusion of children with Down's syndrome from the July provision scheme.  They should be provided with support and would definitely benefit from it.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, has also been approached on this issue, as was the previous Minister for Education and Skills.</p> <p>We are seeking some explanation from the Minister as to the basis on which children with Down's syndrome are not given access to this important programme which would give so much benefit to them and their parents and families.</p></speech>

I thank Senators Bacik and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for raising this matter.  I assure the House that ensuring that all children with special educational needs are supported and given the opportunity to reach their full potential is a key priority for the Government.  Funding for special education provision in 2018 will amount to &euro;1.75 billion, up 43% since 2011 and equivalent to almost 19% of the Department's overall budget.</p> <p>The July provision scheme provides funding for an extended school year for students with severe or profound intellectual disabilities and students with autism spectrum disorders.  The scheme was developed to reduce potential regression in learning associated with these specific categories of special educational needs over the summer holidays.  The scheme does not make provision for children with other categories of special educational needs.</p> <p>The National Council for Special Education's policy advice on education provision for children with autism spectrum disorders was published in July 2016.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the course of preparing the advice, the NCSE consulted widely with a range of stakeholders, including parents, teachers, academics, experts, psychologists, HSE officials and others.  The NCSE also reviewed relevant national and international research.</p><p>The policy advice, which is available on the NCSE's website, includes a review of the July provision scheme.  The NCSE review found that in general parents value July provision because it provides daytime respite for families and a structured day for students.  However, the review found a number of problems with the scheme as currently organised.  This includes concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided to all students with complex special educational needs.  The NCSE advised that in general the scheme is not meeting its original objective which was to reduce possible regression in academic learning.  The council recommended that the relevant Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs.  The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe social environment for all students with complex special educational needs, which might include some children with Down's syndrome.</p><p>My Department has convened an implementation group with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the inspectorate and representatives from other Departments and agencies to ensure the report's recommendations are fully and appropriately considered.  There are no plans to change the July provision scheme coverage until this work is complete.</p></speech>

Similar answers have been given to individual parents who contacted the office of his predecessor.</p> <p>It still appears that there is no rational basis for the continued exclusion of children with Down's syndrome from the scheme.  It appears that the policy is indirectly discriminatory as between different conditions or disabilities, particularly in the inclusion of children with ASD, whatever the level of learning disability.  That is a key issue.  Issues may arise in that regard under the European Social Charter and it certainly appears to many parents that it is inequitable.</p> <p>I take issue with one aspect of the Minister's response where he states the NCSE review found "parents value July provision because it provides daytime respite for families".  The parents who contacted Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and me have made very clear this is not about respite but about ensuring their children do not fall behind in their educational and intellectual development over the precious summer months.  For them, it is about meeting the educational needs of the students.  That is a very important point to make.</p> <p>I ask the Minister again whether there is any rational reason that children with a mild to moderate learning disability who have Down's syndrome cannot be included in a scheme that includes all children with certain other diagnoses, particularly ASD.  I ask him for a response.</p></speech>

The NCSE makes its decisions based on evidence in its own research.</p> <p>I am informing myself in my new brief and I will be happy to take on board the Senator's recommendations, suggestions and observations.  I note in particular that she is voicing the concerns of up to 5,000 parents who have signed an online petition.</p> <p>I hope the implementation group, which is considering the recommendations of the NCSE, will soon complete its work.  I do not have a timeframe for completion, however.  There is a suggestion that the implementation group will also consider the issue of children with Down's syndrome.  I will seek to inform myself about the issue the Senator raises regarding the reason for the exclusion in the first place.  I note that the focus of summertime provision was to prevent regression in education.  From my earlier work with people with special needs, disabilities and different challenges, I am aware that any forum for providing any education, formally or informally, is good and important for their continued engagement with education.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue.</p></speech>

Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; leis sa phost nua t&aacute;bhachtach seo at&aacute; aige.</p><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to take this.  The lack of secondary school places in Rush and Skerries is a huge concern for parents.  Fingal is one of the fastest growing parts of the country, if not in Europe.  We have a very large young population and this is not changing but is likely to rise.  We found ourselves with the extraordinary situation where children in both villages, or towns as they are now with a population in excess of 10,000 each, cannot be guaranteed a place in their own secondary school in their own town.</p><p>St. Joseph's is the only secondary school in Rush and has a student population of approximately 740.  It opened its doors to new students and 220 people turned up on the day.  As a consequence of this, we have 102 children on a waiting list and 102 families terrified about their child and not knowing what to do.  There is a similar situation with a long waiting list to get into the secondary school in Skerries.  These are all in one catchment area.  Not only can they not now go to school in their own town, they cannot go to school in the next town over.  They will be forced to go to God knows where.  It is not satisfactory.</p><p>We have known that this growth has been taking place and that more houses are planned, yet here we are in this situation.  For the next five years, St. Joseph's will have to limit the intake of new students to 120 when it is getting in excess of 200 applications.  Some 89% of the 102 on the waiting list are from Rush.  The trend will continue for at least five years, as I said.  There are not alternatives in the immediate area.</p><p>I have a formal request for a meeting with officials from the Department of Education and Skills to meet members of the board of St. Joseph's to progress the purchase of approximately 14 acres for a new school and playing pitches in Rush.  Will the Minister arrange that meeting next month because the school site needs to be bought now?  The road access will be resolved in early December when the compulsory purchase order, CPO, is completed.  Two weeks ago, the board put in a formal application for emergency accommodation so that we can accommodate as many of these young people as possible, yet we have had no response.</p><p>Skerries community college has encountered the same problem, as I pointed out.  We are getting emails from frantic, worried parents in Skerries who cannot get their kids into school in their own town.  This never happened before.  This problem has been highlighted in the local newspaper, the <i>Skerries News</i>, and it is causing turmoil.  People are very worried and we need to have this new emergency accommodation put in place as soon as possible to give people some certainty.  They do not know where they are going to send their kids next year and that is not good enough.  The community college has planning permission for a permanent extension of five classrooms and other key facilities granted by Fingal County Council in 2017.</p><p>This problem is not going away.  We need to get this temporary accommodation put in place in Rush, we need the prefabs for Skerries community college, and we need an outline of the future for both of these schools.  This problem is only going to get worse.  We have the best of teachers giving the best of education to our young people, preparing them for the world, in surroundings that are utterly unsatisfactory in the case of Rush and which provide utter uncertainty for parents, which is grossly unfair.</p></speech>

As the Senator may be aware, my predecessor, Deputy Bruton, announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years, 2019 to 2022.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department to assess the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.  The four-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p><p>The announcement includes three new post-primary schools to be established in the Fingal area, as follows: a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school to serve the Donaghmede, Howth and Dublin 13 school planning area, to be established in 2019; a new 800 pupil post-primary school to serve the Blanchardstown West, Dublin 15, and Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, school planning areas as a regional solution, to be established in 2020; and a new 800 pupil post-primary school to serve the Donaghmede, Howth and Dublin 13 school planning area, to be established in 2021.  </p><p>In addition to the new schools announced, my Department&rsquo;s capital investment programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms in existing schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified.  The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and, in particular, have regard to the increased roll-out of housing provision, as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>With regard to St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school, Rush, my Department recently received an application from the school for additional accommodation.  The application is being assessed and a decision will issue directly to the school shortly.  I will make sure it is kept very firmly on the radar.  The Senator will also be aware that a major building project to provide a new replacement school building at St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school is included in my Department&rsquo;s six-year construction programme.  A site is required for this purpose and currently being pursued.</p><p>In addition, the Senator will be aware that in September 2013 my Department established a new 1,000 pupil multi-denominational post-primary school, Lusk community college, under the patronage of Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, to serve the Rush and Lusk school planning area.</p><p>With regard to Skerries community college, my Department has been liaising with the school&rsquo;s patron, Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, on the applicant level for school places.  I understand the school has indicated that it has been unable to offer a place to all applicants in September 2018.  I advise the Senator that, in response to an application for additional accommodation from the ETB, my Department approved in principle the provision of additional permanent accommodation consisting of three general classrooms, one science laboratory, one art room and three special education teaching rooms.  I am aware that the provision of additional accommodation on the site must be carefully planned, considering the limitations of the site.  In that regard, my Department&rsquo;s professional and technical staff will shortly be visiting the school site to determine how the project can be advanced.  As an interim arrangement, my Department has approved the rental of temporary accommodation to the school, pending the delivery of the permanent accommodation solution.  My Department will continue to work with the ETB to address the school&rsquo;s interim and long-term accommodation needs.</p></speech>

However, as whoever wrote it speaks about Howth and Donaghmede and places miles away from the area I am addressing, I will say no more about it.  The bottom line is that additional accommodation has been approved for of one portacabin in Skerries when three are badly needed.  That is what the school applied for.  I am glad to hear that a more permanent solution will be forthcoming.</p> <p>In regard to St. Joseph's secondary school, we have been pursuing the site at Rush for some time.  All that is required is for the Department to instruct Fingal County Council to purchase the site.  It happily does this on a regular basis for the Department on the basis of shared facilities after school hours.  It needs to be done.  The CPO to open up the road and the lands is to be completed in December.  However, we are facing a delay because there was a misunderstanding between CEIST, EDUCENA and the Department about who was going to purchase the land.  CEIST and EDUCENA made it very clear they were not in a position to do it; therefore, it falls to the Department.</p> <p>With regard to Lusk community college, it is very welcome that we will have a secondary school, the second half of which is being built, but it is very clear to all concerned that it will not be able to accommodate the increased demand for place from pupils in both Skerries and Rush.  It just will not wash.  I am told by Councillor O'Leary who is in the Visitors Gallery and many constituents that all of the local cr&egrave;ches are full and that the problem will just keep building.</p> <p>We need a serious signal from the Department that it is going to take action in purchasing a site for St. Joseph's secondary school which has been identified for well over a couple of years.  The school is just waiting for the order from the Department to enable the local council to act.  I appeal to the Minister as I know that parents in both schools are extremely upset and very angry.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While the next academic year, 2019-20, may seem a long way away, they have applied for places and have been declined.

I take very seriously the issues the Senator raised, and there are obviously concerns in very heavily populated areas.  I get the concern of parents and understand the need to progress matters as quickly as we possibly can.  I am also conscious, however, that we have been dealing even today and over the weekend with legacy issues of schools having been fast-tracked over too short a period.  We learned many lessons from that.  We are looking at longer lead-in terms, but this cannot be used as an excuse for not dealing with the immediate pressures.  I get the Senator's concerns.  As I said, a request for additional accommodation has been submitted.  We will make a decision on that and ensure that the officials are proactive in this regard.  As for the Senator's observation on the inclusion of Donaghmede, and in defence of the officials who prepared this answer, the first part of the question referred to Fingal, although I acknowledge the Senator's interest was in the two areas to which he referred.</p> <p>Walking the corridors of this House and bumping into colleagues from every constituency, I am finding out about the increasing pressures, demands and populations in their areas.  These are issues, but the only way we can do this properly is to have a trajectory of a long-term plan.  For this reason, the Government has provided funding of &euro;8.4 billion in the ten-year capital plan.  It is the first time in the State that we are working on a ten-year plan.  I understand that news of ten-year plans is no good to parents whose children are going to school today but we must manage this.  In raising this matter today, the Senator has highlighted the need to deliver this as speedily as possible while adhering to new policies and guidelines, which are also necessary to provide the right solutions and buildings.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimhe.  As we are running a little late, I ask Senator Mulherin, without further ado, to proceed with her inquiry to the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-10-23a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018102300002#F00600"><p>I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter.  While I welcome the Minister of State, I was hoping to see the Minister, Deputy Madigan, here.  This is a very serious issue which is compromising and crippling development in rural Ireland.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, which comes under the aegis of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is charged with the protection and conservation of habitats and species in designated lands around the country.  However, there is substantial evidence to show that infrastructure development has been delayed in recent years owing to this environmental designation, especially in the west, where most environmental designation is.  I will outline some of this evidence.</p> <p>In 2010, An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused stage 2 of the N26, the road from Mount Falcon to Bohola, which is basically the road between Swinford and Ballina.  It runs through the River Moy special area of conservation, SAC.  The project was denied on account of over-design and whooper swans.  A minor upgrade to this same road has been sought at Cloongullaun to replace the bridge, and solutions have been sought on how to overcome the environmental issues since 2012.  A sum of &euro;4 million has been spent on this.  A sum of &euro;5 million was spent on the previous project and we still do not have planning permission.  I hope An Bord Plean&aacute;la will issue planning permission in the coming weeks.  If it does not, the alternative is not one to contemplate.</p> <p>Consultations on flood defences for Crossmolina town, also in an SAC, have been ongoing since 2013 or 2014.  On the positive side for Crossmolina, it is listed as one of the projects to be financed under the flood defences capital programme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, there is still no planning permission.  Even a more minor job, that of the dredging of the River Deel to protect people's properties in the short term, has been refused permission.  One of the reasons cited was the presence of freshwater pearl mussels.  The same issue arises at Cloongullane Bridge.  Equally, the much-needed work on Glenisland Bridge on the R312 between Castlebar and Bellacorick has been allocated funding but has been delayed on account of freshwater pearl mussels.  On designated lands in Galway, the N59 works between Galway and Clifden have been delayed for years, notwithstanding the 17 or 18 consultations on it.  All of these areas fall within the auspices of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.<br/><br/>We are reaching a point where Government agencies charged with the delivery of vital infrastructure projects are living in fear when proposing them.  For example, instead of seeking a major scheme for the worst section of national primary road in the country, namely, the N26, Mayo County Council is seeking a series of minor schemes because it believes it will fall foul of the environmental designation.  That is crazy.<br/><br/>The NPWS needs to undertake a major body of work.  Other than that, every planning application in a given SAC is dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  There is a lack of forward planning and schematic approach, as most SACs do not have management plans.  This is key.  It means that there has been no examination of the competing interests of conservation and socioeconomic objectives.  The need to be able to build bridges and roads and to farm land has not been balanced with the conservation objectives in any formal way.<br/><br/>A case for legitimate development has been identified.  Under Project Ireland 2040, there is a plan for 500,000 people in rural areas.  If we can get planning permissions, we can get developments through without having to wait years.  We have been left very far behind.<br/><br/>I welcome the recruitment steps taken in recent years to plug the science and biodiversity staffing gaps in the NPWS.  There was an increase of 15% in this year's budget to &euro;54 million, but that amount covers built heritage as well as natural heritage.  The culture budget has been increased to &euro;190 million.  There will be no culture or heritage in rural Ireland unless we get our act together.  This situation will impede Project Ireland 2040 and must be taken seriously by the Government.  The NPWS must be funded if it is to have a schematic approach to developments in designated SACs where there are already substantial settlements and roads.</p></speech>

I will talk to the Minister about the issues outlined.  Reading the answer before Senator Mulherin spoke, it might be approaching the question in a different way than the Senator addressed the matter.</p> <p>In 2018, the Department allocated &euro;11.982 million to the NPWS, which represents a more than 7% increase from 2017.  In addition, the overall budget for the heritage division in 2018 of &euro;47.146 million increased by 4% from 2017.  A further increase in funding of more than &euro;7 million, or 15%, in the overall budget for the division was announced earlier this month as part of budget 2019.  This investment represents a significant proportion of the Department's overall budget and reflects the continued commitment to the NPWS.</p> <p>Some 14% of the terrestrial area of the State is designated.  This includes many remote and inaccessible areas.  Most of the land in SACs, special protection areas and natural heritage areas is in private ownership.  Through the NPWS, the Department directly manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks, nature reserves and other conservation or recreational properties of approximately 87,000 ha.  This comprises 69,000 ha of diverse landscape within our six national parks and more than 18,000 ha within our other 80 plus statutory nature reserves and other heritage properties.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Killarney National Park comprises over 10,000 ha.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service manages and maintains over 485 km of trails across these properties.  Approximately 4 million people visit these sites annually and while 50% of the national parks are in the western region, more than half of all visitors are to the Wicklow Mountains and Killarney National Park.</p><p>Staff levels across the Department are kept under regular review in line with emerging business needs and Government policy on public sector pay and staffing as advised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Of the Department's total staff, approximately 335 work in the area of natural heritage through the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  In addition, the Department takes on in the region of 70 seasonal staff during the year to assist the NPWS.  Front-line conservation rangers are deployed through a regional structure and assignments are determined in light of departmental business needs and priorities.  As well as more senior regionally-based officers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, there are 62 NPWS conservation rangers stationed around the country who deal with enforcement matters under the Wildlife Acts.  As the Senator may be aware, the rangers are involved on a daily basis in a range of enforcement activities.  These duties are not based upon a county basis.  For operational reasons, I cannot provide the House with specific levels of detail with regard to the exact number of rangers in a particular geographic area as such information could serve as an incentive for wildlife crime and compromise us from an operational point of view.</p><p>The Department is working towards increasing the overall number of rangers to 84, subject to constraints.  Any further appointments will be made across the country taking account of business needs and financial resources to meet pay costs in the context of Government policy on public sector pay and staffing.  As I said earlier, staff levels across the Department are kept under regular review in line with emerging business needs and Government policy on public sector pay and staffing, as advised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NPWS endeavours to fulfil a comprehensive and valuable role in the conservation and protection of our natural heritage and delivers an excellent service to the public.    </p><p>Capital funding is allocated by individual project as opposed to specific regions.  As the Senator may be aware, the Department entered into a strategic investment partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland last year.  The first project under this partnership is a &euro;2.1 million investment in Wild Nephin-Ballycroy National Park to develop a continuous 53 km walking-cycling trail from Newport to Ballycastle on the Wild Atlantic Way through the national park.  This follows on from a number of key strategic investments in Mayo, including the expansion of the Wild Nephin-Ballycroy National Park with the &euro;850,000 purchase of some 1,200 acres at Altnabrockey and the transfer of Coillte's Wild Nephin holdings to the national park.  These acquisitions not only consolidate the national park area, they provide excellent opportunities for the future development of the park, including improved access and trails, as well as other significant enhancements to the visitor experience at Wild Nephin on the Wild Atlantic Way.  They also build upon the recent designation of the area as Ireland's first gold-tier dark sky park.  A gold-tier award is the highest possible accolade, meaning that Mayo is now internationally recognised as one of the best places in the world to view the wonders of the night.  Mayo Dark Sky Park is a great example of collaborative projects between our communities, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Coillte, GMIT Mayo campus, South West Mayo Development Company and Mayo County Council. </p><p>Between 2017 and 2017, the Department invested in excess of &euro;7 million capital in the development of Ireland's network of six national parks and more than 80 nature reserves and other conservation and recreational heritage properties.  Under Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027, capital investment of &euro;50 million has been earmarked for the national parks and nature reserves.  This investment ensures long-term protection of the national parks and reserves, and the Department is delighted to have this opportunity for investment and implementation of measures to protect our habitats, landscapes and wildlife.    </p><p>The Minister, Deputy Madigan, has asked me to assure the House that into 2019 and beyond the Department will continue its ongoing programme of maintenance works to safeguard the continuing management and operation of the national parks and reserves not just in the western region but nationwide.  I acknowledge that the response fails to address the issues raised by Senator Mulherin in terms of the necessary staffing levels to ensure that infrastructural projects in Mayo can proceed and I will ask the Minister to revert to her in writing with a more pertinent response.</p></speech>

The staff of 180, some of whom have given up to 25 years of loyal service to the factory, look set to lose their jobs.  The dogs on the street knew for some time that things were not right.  Appeals from staff for clarity about the future intentions of the company fell, unfortunately, on deaf ears in recent months and weeks.  The Unite trade union, the representative body of the workers, was conscious that the firm appeared to be in very choppy waters.  Local management, unfortunately, appeared to be sidelined and left in the dark.  We know there are no jobs in a closed factory and the union knows that as well.  On that basis, the Unite trade union did the responsible thing and formally contacted the company's parent operation in the UK.</p><p>As any responsible trade union would, Unite sought on several occasions to meet the key decision-makers from the company formally.  The union sought to establish the nature and extent of the problems at the Dundalk plant and to offer to work with the company if it needed to engage with the union to change course and ensure the survival of the operation.  Time and again, however, the union's approaches were rebuffed and stonewalled.  The union was, frankly, given the two fingers by the operation.  Against this backdrop and as the clock ticked towards the appointment of a provisional liquidator last week, workers at the plant reported the transferring of profitable production lines from the Dundalk facility to the parent company's facilities in the UK.</p><p>Given what we know and the Dundalk company's refusal to engage with its staff and the union, I can only conclude that the operation in Dundalk appears to have been deliberately run down.  Last week, the parent company in the UK pulled its support.  The Irish operation is a subsidiary of the UK parent.  The Minister of State and, more appropriately, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, need to take a close look at this. The behaviour of the Irish arm of the company and the activities between it and its parent in the UK need to be examined formally and forensically.  All too often we have seen workers left on the street as companies hide behind the protection of the courts in deemed insolvencies where fancy footwork and sharp practices are used to put assets beyond the use of redundant workers and other creditors.  Those are assets that should normally be used to pay decent redundancies and moneys owed to small businesses.  We have to be vigilant.  After the debacle of Clerys, we said that the law would and should change to protect workers better in insolvencies.</p><p>The Duffy-Cahill report, entitled Expert examination and review of laws on the protection of employee interests when assets are separated from the operating entity, was brought to the Government in April 2016 but no action has been taken since.  Now, 180 workers in Dundalk are in a desperately uncertain set of circumstances.  They have not formally been made redundant and they are not legally entitled to the 30 day redundancy notice period to allow them work with their trade union on an enhanced or improved redundancy package.  They have not earned any money since the plant closed and, despite the great support they have received from officials in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the area, without a P45, entitlement to social welfare is moot.  They also cannot or will not take up alternative employment because they hope that, somehow, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland or other State agencies might find an alternative operator for the facility in Dundalk.  In the meantime, life goes on, mortgages and rent need to be paid, bills need to be paid and families need to be fed.</p><p>The law needs to be changed.  Does the Government intend to change the law as it applies to workers caught up in insolvencies like this?  Will the Minister of State and his colleagues support the workers and the union in their efforts to seek social protection support for the workers and trade union members in that plant over the next short period?</p></speech>

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection received notification of the proposed liquidation of TAFC Manufacturing Ireland DAC on 22 October 2018.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers that are proposing collective redundancies, including an obligation under sections 9 and 10 to engage in an information and consultation process with employee representatives and to provide certain information in relation to the proposed redundancies.  Section 11A of the Act provides that where an employee believes the employer to be in breach of sections 9 or 10, he or she may pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  It is an offence under section 11 of the Act for an employer to fail to comply with sections 9 or 10.  Following contact from the Department, the joint provisional liquidators of the company have advised that the consultation process with employees began on Friday, 19 October and will continue for 30 days.  The Department will continue to engage with the provisional liquidators as required.</p><p>The Social Insurance Fund provides a safety net for the employees in cases of employer insolvency.  It is the responsibility of the liquidator to seek, on behalf of employees, payment from the redundancy payments scheme in respect of statutory redundancy and from the insolvency payments scheme in respect of wage-related entitlements.  An eligible employee is entitled to a statutory redundancy payment of two weeks' pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week.  Compensation is based on the worker's length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  In order to qualify for a statutory redundancy payment, an employee must have at least two years of continuous service, be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts and be over the age of 16.  Entitlements covered under the insolvency payments scheme are arrears of wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice and certain pension contributions.  Payments are calculated by reference to an employee's wages and are subject to a limit of &euro;600 a week.  Arrears of wages, sick pay, holiday pay and minimum notice are limited to eight weeks.</p><p>The Department will ensure the affected employees receive advice on jobseekers' payments and other income supports that may be available to them.  It will provide support to them on returning to work or accessing appropriate education and training and development options.  Staff of the north-east division of the Department met employees of the company on Monday, 22 October to give them information on the Intreo services available locally.  An information and recruitment event for the workforce will be held in the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Dundalk on Thursday, 1 November next.  This event will be supported by other key service providers.  Local employers with job vacancies have also committed to attend.  The key message for employees is that the Department will provide any redundancy, insolvency and jobseeker payments to which they may be entitled in a timely manner and will proactively help them to access available opportunities for employment.</p><p>The WRC's customer service section provides information on the rights and obligations of employees and employers under employment rights legislation.  WRC information officials are available to meet the staff concerned individually or collectively to discuss their employment rights, including matters related to redundancy.</p></speech>

Many of the details he has put on the record are available to the trade union and the staff.  I reiterate my appreciation of the efforts made by the staff of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to assist workers who find themselves in a dreadful position.  They were aware for some time that something was not right in this plant.  As I said, efforts were made by the union to engage constructively with key decision-makers in the parent company in the UK.  It is right that people are deeply suspicious about the circumstances around this.  It is incredibly important for the Unite trade union to be represented at the formal liquidation hearing in the courts on 12 November to make sure there is a robust forensic examination of the relationship between the Dundalk company and its parent company in the UK.  I have been told by workers and the trade union involved that some of the activities in the plant in recent months have left them very sceptical about the motivations of this company.  In the meantime, there is a human cost.  People do not have jobs or social welfare payments.  They are wondering whether they should find alternative employment.  People have bills to pay and children to feed.  We are very close to Christmas.</p> <p>The larger and wider issue at stake here relates to the point at which employment law and company law interact in this country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Nobody will ever forget the position in which Clerys workers found themselves in June 2015.  We swore we would never again allow workers to be thrown on the side of the street without entitlements or security and not knowing what their entitlements were.  We would no longer allow companies to use corporate restructuring and fancy footwork to avoid their obligations to employees and get away with this type of activity with absolute impunity.  I produced the Duffy Cahill report which proposes some very strong measures, including, for example, to provide for a right to a minimum 30-day period of consultation for workers caught up in insolvencies, regardless of whether the firm was insolvent, and to introduce important sanctions on employers that refuse to comply with their obligations on the 30-day consultation period.  Serious sanctions and disincentives need to be levelled at employers who engage in this type of activity.  They expect to get away with this scot free and if the law goes unreformed-----</p></speech>

It outlines that it is more difficult to access a home help today than it was ten years ago.  Care Alliance Ireland also indicates that there seems to be a disparity between areas within the country and describes a "postcode lottery", whereby people seeking a home help in some areas will have to wait for up to two years for one.  I have made representations for a couple living on the south side of the city in Walkinstown.  They are aged 85 and 87 years, respectively.  Their family are looking for another four hours of home help per week to help them to stay in their home in order that they can stay together.  If they cannot receive this help, it looks like one of them will have to move into a nursing home, which would be more costly to the State.  We need to have a proper discussion on the provision of home help.  I know that my colleague in the Lower House, Deputy O'Dea, has a Bill in progress that would apply the fair deal scheme system to the allocation of home help hours in order that people would be able to live securely in their home without having to move into a nursing home.  We need to think about this issue, especially because of the ageing population.  I, therefore, ask for a debate on the allocation of home help hours and provision of care in the home. </p> <p>The second issue I would like to raise is that of domestic violence.  It is incumbent on us to be more aware of it, especially in the light of recent cases which are in the public eye.  We should learn the signs.  As policymakers, we need to ensure more supports will be available to men and women suffering domestic violence in the home and that there will be avenues of escape in order that they will be able to leave situations where they are suffering physical or mental abuse.  We have to forget about paying lip service to the issue and have a proper discussion on it to make sure the correct supports will be in place. </p> <p>This is Epidermolysis Bullosa Awareness Week.  Sometimes children with the condition are known as "butterfly children" because their skin appears to be more fragile.  We all have two layers in our skin and most of us have an anchor which keeps the two together.  However, children with epidermolysis bullosa do not have that anchor and their skin appears to be more fragile.  We should take a minute to look it up to create greater awareness of it because it is a condition that affects many children in this country.  They are very brave children, many of whom are coming out this week to create an awareness of the condition.</p></speech>

I know that some of the Leader's colleagues are in the constituency.  The question on my mind is whether we will pay for the mistakes of the Celtic tiger era a second time, as we find ourselves tearing apart brand new schools, or schools less than ten years old in order to repair structural faults.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say this morning that the cost of the work will be subject to litigation that will take place in due course.  I compliment Mr. Paddy Lavelle, chief executive officer of Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, on taking rapid action and keeping the safety of students and teachers foremost in his mind in making a decision to close part of the school.  As the Leader knows, being a teacher, this is a serious decision.  We do not close schools or parts of them very easily.  It was rapid action on the part of the Minister and the CEO who are to be commended and complimented.</p> <p>I cannot let this session pass without discussing the Defence Fores.  Recently the Minister of State with responsibility for defence matters told us that the Public Sector Pay Commission would meet on 23 October with a view to releasing in the first quarter of 2019 a report on the issue of Defence Forces pay.  I cannot pre-empt what the commission will find, but there is an awful lot more wrong in the Defence Forces.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

Senator Nash raised the issue during the Commencement debate earlier.  Staff in the company were treated deplorably by management.  Its parent company has its headquarters in Manchester.  A total of 180 people were employed at the facility in Dundalk, most of whom had given a lifetime of service to the company, yet when they arrived at the factory on Friday, there was no work for them to do.  My colleague, Deputy Adams, wrote to the managing director on 21 October following the making of representations to his office.  Attempts were made to contact management, but there was no response until a letter arrived giving notice that liquidators had been appointed to the company.  I am also aware of unsuccessful attempts by Unite to speak to management to gain clarity on its intentions.  Staff should have access to the full redundancy arrangements contained in their contracts of employment, but they have no idea if the company will honour them.  Its conduct to date does not inspire confidence.  The staff are owed wages; some of them are owed a month's pay and shift premium payments, as well as their annual leave entitlements.  Technically they are still employed, as they have not yet been issued with their P45 and cannot access social welfare benefits.  The matter will be raised in the D&aacute;il Chamber by Deputies Gerry Adams and Imelda Munster shortly.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation must secure the sale of the business.  She must also take steps to ensure companies will not be able to use tactical liquidations to circumvent their responsibilities as the staff have been left in dire straits.  It is not the first time we have seen this happen.  It is reprehensible.  Workers and their families have endured the injustice of companies pulling out of the country without any explanation being given and certainly without showing any care for the workers who had worked for them for a  long time.</p> <p>It is only a few days to the presidential election.  I wish all of the candidates well, in particular, a certain female candidate from the rebel county of Cork.  I alert citizens to the blasphemy referendum which is being held on the same day.  The confusion caused is obvious when one canvasses on the doorsteps.  We need a "Yes" vote to support freedom of religion, belief and speech, as well as the separation of church and State, to respect our international human rights obligations.  People need to vote "Yes" to allow Irish media outlets to deal objectively with religious issues without having to self-censor.  People need to vote "Yes" to support those facing persecution in Islamic states.</p></speech>

Apart from the requirement to ensure the staff will receive the entitlements they are due, there is a bigger issue at play - showing respect for workers caught up in insolvencies where organisations simply believe they can get away with impunity, putting staff on the side of the street and directing them to the State insolvency fund for the redundancy payments to which they are entitled.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some workers in the plant have worked for 25 years and built up certain rights and entitlements that employers are dodging and not fulfilling through fancy corporate footwork.

There are former school sites in four areas in my constituency, namely, Trim, Athboy, Kildalkey and Kells.  Last week, the old convent on Patrick Street, Trim, caught fire.  In Athboy, a company is interested in buying the old site.  I got involved with the board of management.  We sent an email to the Department which replied that it is doing a survey on the needs of the local school community.  I believe it is dragging its heels in that regard because I can provide it with those figures.  There is ample space for pupils in the two schools.  The interested company would bring jobs to the local community.  A new school has opened in Kildalkey.  We have a site but it has been vandalised already.  We have the new Eureka secondary school in Kells, and there is an old site in that location.</p> <p>These sites are being left vacant but surely we can give them to community groups under Government schemes which might use them to run coffee shops or community centres.

I asked for the assistance of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to make it clear to Irish Water that it needs to meet with the Oireachtas Members from Donegal and the councillors in the north Donegal area.</p> <p>We have a water supply that continually bursts because it was built to a substandard level back in the day.  Rather than address the issue and repair this huge pipeline, Irish Water is going to extend the supply to Letterkenny, the major town in Donegal.  It is incredible.</p> <p>In a separate issue, earlier this year, the public representatives asked Irish Water to meet us.  Irish Water refused.  It gave us assurances about a &euro;5.8 million project to make water safe in north-east Inishowen, particularly for the community of Greencastle.  Irish Water refused a meeting, gave us assurances and has not honoured those assurances.  I am sad to report to Senator Buttimer that this is the second time that a meeting has been turned down.  We have been referred to a one-hour clinic at the end of November where all the individual issues affecting consumers will be addressed.  One can imagine the number of councillors who want to see Irish Water.  Irish Water wants us to go to a clinic at the end of November, along with all the other councillors about all the other issues, rather than address this serious issue of public concern.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to intervene and bring this issue to the attention of the Minister.  I can email him all the details.  We cannot accept this for the second time this year.  It is making a mockery of public service that public representatives cannot meet with them about serious issues.  I ask for a solution.</p></speech>

I have a particular interest in this because Roscommon is one of the locations that will be upgraded to a full volunteer centre, which is important.</p> <p>Pobal was before the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development recently and much of the discussion was about ensuring we support volunteers to get involved and support them in the face of challenges around governance, the importance of promoting best practice and challenges around paperwork and making applications.  It is extremely positive that &euro;1.2 million is being allocated to eight centres across the country, Roscommon being one, because, without volunteers, many community facilities, services and activities would not happen.  We need to support the volunteers that we have and try and encourage more to get involved.</p> <p>When will this funding be available to the eight centres and what will be allocated for each of them?</p></speech>

It has called for a new, properly-resourced white-collar crime agency to work in close conjunction with the new white-collar or corporate crime agency in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The LRC is also calling for regulators to be able to fine and impose sanctions upon companies.</p><p>The former Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, pointed out that criminal convictions - and there have been some for white-collar crime - were not related directly to the question of reckless trading.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He said that, like many commonsense people, he had assumed that reckless trading was a criminal offence and should be prosecuted.  However, he was told by the responsible authorities to dream on and that there was not sufficient case law for this to be sustained.  This is nonsense.  It shows the utter laziness and dereliction of duty of the prosecution service.  What do they mean that there is not enough case law?  There will never be enough case law until they start bringing cases.</p><p>I was chairman and managing director of two companies that were formed for charitable purposes but were registered as limited companies.  I closed one of them down for a period because I was afraid of being charged with reckless trading.  There is an offence of reckless trading.  In my opinion, particularly in the wake of the financial crisis, this should be prosecuted and it is just not good enough to say that there is not enough case law.  Case law must be build up and it is about time the authorities got their act together and did so.  I also agree completely with the suggestions of the Law Reform Commission that this special agency should be created and that regulators should have the opportunity to impose financial and other regulations.</p></speech>

Several of these schools are in Cork, including one in Clonakilty.  This is a cause of serious concern.  Speaking to parents and teachers from that part of the world, they were genuinely concerned about how this could have happened and what recourse will be available.  Will this issue affect the education of their children?  What plans have been made?</p> <p>Clarification is required sooner rather than later regarding the reasons the schools are in this condition and the plans in place to ensure this cannot happen again.  Children attending these schools need to know if their schools are damaged and, if so, how bad that damage is.  I hope the Leader will get clarity for the thousands of children and hundreds of teachers who are affected by this issue.  They need assurance that their school is a safe location and they can do what they are supposed to in school.</p></speech>

In my area, the planning permission for an endoscopic unit in Naas General Hospital is rapidly running out and we want to see that proposal developed as quickly as possible.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss the &euro;700 million overrun, in particular, whether it will increase further by the end of the year, and how much additional funding we will have to allocate for health in next year's budget?</p></speech>

The remains will be forensically examined and, most importantly, there will then be a respectful burial.  This issue has been widely debated and discussed.  I understand the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, presented the proposal to Cabinet this morning.  It is the right decision and the Minister deserves our full support.</p> <p>I raised previously the need to establish a central database for unidentified human remains.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Today, it was announced a body discovered over 17 years ago, washed up on Quay Island in Clare, was identified as being that of a person reported missing a number of months previously.  He was reported missing in February 2001 and I may be wrong on the dates but the body was discovered a number of months later.  There was no identification until recently.  The family had to wait for 17 years for a decision on this matter.  I have given a detailed proposal to the Minister for Justice and Equality for a central database in the country about unidentified remains so that there would be a co-ordinated effort with regard to information about missing persons and human remains.  This has not been done.  Each coroner's area keeps the information and there is no connection between one coroner's area and another.  We need to do that.  I ask that the Leader again raise this matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I had a Commencement matter dealt with here but I do not believe we should delay in bringing forward this proposal.</p></speech>

We should not be in this position.  I had the Minister here in the House earlier today to address accommodation issues in Rush and Skerries and he alluded to this problem in Ardgillan too.  We have new schools built in the last ten years and we find that some of them are not safe.</p> <p>I understand that there was a failure in this instance to ensure sufficient ties between the outer and inner walls.  If this is true, it is gross neglect.  The builder has to be held to account and no further contract should issue to that builder until the full facts are available and the costs are recovered.  One wonders if there are other buildings outside the 30 identified that could have other problems due to this old pre-2014 habit of builders certifying the buildings themselves through their own agent.  We need to look at our new regulations from 2014 and ensure there are no other loopholes that would allow this sort of behaviour.</p> <p>I thank the Minister and the Department of Education and Skills for acting so swiftly to protect our children and teachers from an unsafe building.  Our children are our future and they are getting the best education from excellent teaching staff.  Both our children and teachers are entitled to a safe and excellent environment, to allow teachers to give our children the best education to prepare them to compete in a very challenging and modern world.  I will continue to work for the parents and children of Dublin Fingal to ensure there is adequate, safe accommodation for our students.  I will be very happy to work with the Minister to ensure that we achieve this goal.  There is no point in having a situation where people, having fought long and hard to have accommodation for their child at school, find that the accommodation is not safe.</p></speech>

I agree with Senator Ardagh that we all need to take time to become familiar with the issue of the epidermolysis bullosa awareness week and the impact that it has on children.  The Senator beautifully described them as butterfly children.  We should all join with her in her advocacy and ensure that there is a pathway of care for young children with rare diseases and conditions.  I commend the Senator for raising the matter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On the allocation of home help hours and home care packages, we all share the overarching desire to see people's quality of life improve, in particular older people.  That is why the State values the home support service which is at the core of what the HSE is doing for older people.  It is worth indicating that, in monetary terms, the home support service budget has grown from a base of &euro;306 million in 2015 to over &euro;420 million.  In saying that, it is important to acknowledge that the need is growing and that more people are looking to have home help hours allocated to them, as well as extensive home care packages.  The 2018 HSE service plan provides for the allocation of over 17 million home help hours to 50,500 people.  The Minister for Health has also secured a significant increase in the health budget.  I hope, therefore, that the Department and the HSE will continue to improve existing services.  If there is a blockage - to be fair, many of us understand there is a delay in the approval of some home care packages - there is a need to streamline the application process to make it user-friendly.  I hope we can make that happen sooner rather than later.  The point made by Senator Ardagh is valid, but it is worth noting, as I said, that there has been a significant increase in the budget for home care services.</p><p>I join the Senator in highlighting the issue of domestic violence.  While she did not reference the decision on sentencing in one of the courts yesterday, we must always encourage the victims of domestic violence or child abuse to come forward and speak with clarity and authenticity.  While the ordeal of having to go before a court can be horrifying, it is important that all of us involved in public life support victims who as citizens of this republic deserve our support and empathy.  They have a story to tell and need support to tell it.  It is important that we encourage them to do so.</p><p>Senators Craughwell, Reilly and Lombard referred to a number of schools, in particular Ardgillan community college which is a source of major concern.  I, too, commend the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, his Department and the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board for being proactive in dealing with the matter.  It is of huge concern that a school built between 2007 and 2010 is today a source of worry in terms of the health and safety of the students and staff.  The Minister's first priority is to ensure their welfare and safety.  We all hope it was not a case of corners being cut or a compromise being reached in terms of the structure of the school.  As Senator Lombard rightly said, parents and staff want to know promptly about the issues involved.  It is welcome that the Minister having carried out a programme of safety assessments at the different schools, one of which is in my constituency.  It is a source of worry and the utmost clarity is required.  It is welcome that the Minister and the Department have engaged the services of a project manager and a full technical team to organise and oversee remedial works required arising from the assessments.  I hope the cost will not be borne by the State, but that is not a matter for me to decide today.</p><p>Senator Craughwell referred to the Defence Forces.  As he knows, in 2015 the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, commissioned the White Paper on the Defence Forces.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was a comprehensive review of the Defence Forces and defence policy and involved a major engagement with a variety of stakeholders.  I welcome the proactivity of the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, who acknowledges that the Defence Forces face challenges in recruitment and retention.  He does not operate in an ivory tower but is a hands-on Minister of State who is acutely aware of the importance and value of the Defence Forces.  A public pay commission was established for this reason and it is also why members of the Defence Forces are rightly having their pay restored under the FEMPI legislation and some of the other pay agreements.</p><p>The Minister of State has also pushed for a White Paper to be published expeditiously to target the skills gaps in the Defence Forces.  I think Senator Craughwell will also agree that the extra &euro;47 million for the Defence Forces in budget 2019, of which &euro;6 million is for the pay and conditions of our Defence Forces personnel, is to be welcomed.</p></speech>

Senator Nash also raised this as a Commencement matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan.  The Government's concern is for the workers directly affected by the announcement at this very difficult time for them and their families.  Many of us have seen in our own work people who have been similarly treated.  It is most upsetting and distressing.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is working across Government with the workers in the transition to find new employment.  It is also important to recognise that the reply Senator Nash received from the Minister of State recognises that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will provide the workers with "any redundancy, insolvency and jobseeker payments to which they may be entitled in a timely manner and will proactively help them to access available opportunities for employment".  I think we all agree this should not have happened in the way it did and that the way the workers were treated was wrong.</p></speech>

A report of the Law Reform Commission by Dr. Patrick Honohan, former Governor of the Central Bank, was launched this morning.  It recommends the establishment of a corporate crime agency to work directly with the new corporate crime agency in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I have gathered that this Bill does not actually address these matters.</p> <p>The report also calls for the Financial Regulator to be able to impose fines and other instruments on a company or individual that has behaved badly.  Interestingly, Dr. Honohan said he had taken the commonsense approach that reckless trading was a criminal offence that could and should be prosecuted.  However, he was told to dream on, that there was not sufficient case law to establish a case against these people.  That is an absolutely appalling statement from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  If there is not sufficient case law, it should be established.  The only way to establish case law is by taking cases.</p> <p>Dr. Honohan has pointed out that reckless trading formed no part of the convictions of individuals for white-collar crime.  That is appalling.  I served as chairman of several companies that were working in the charitable field.  They were limited companies.  I suspended the operations of one of them because I was afraid of a prosecution for reckless trading if we went on.  It seems to me that in light of the financial crisis that we went through eight or ten years ago, we really should establish a method of dealing properly with white-collar crime.  I do not see any reason reckless trading should not be a prosecutable offence.  It is time that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was told to get off its backside and do something about this by establishing case law.</p></speech>

It is a broader conversation for another time.  However, I do want to thank all the Senators who participated in the debate.  This is really important legislation.  It is another tool in our armoury to ensure what the Senator spoke of a moment ago, namely, that people know there is a serious criminal sanction of ten years in prison or a fine of &euro;10 million.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ireland has developed a large financial services sector that is twice the size of the European average and employs 90,000 people in domestic and international financial services spread throughout the country.  One third of the jobs are based outside County Dublin.  The perception is that they are all in County Dublin but they are not.</p><p>The process of reform has turned from crisis management to how financial markets can serve the broad policy objectives of jobs and growth.  We believe that putting in place criminal sanctions for serious infringement of the markets in financial instruments directive, MiFID, rules will provide a deterrent effect against any blatant misbehaviour and thus promote orderly markets, market integrity and investor protection.</p><p>Similarly the essential technical amendments to both the Credit Reporting Act 2013 and the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 are required to ensure that the central credit register and the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman cover the products envisaged by Government when initially enacted.  The ombudsman will have the necessary power to investigate, where appropriate.  This relates to Senator Kieran O'Donnell's question about long-term financial products and whole-of-life policies.

The point made by Senator Norris is one on which, as the Minister of State said, we should have a debate at a future date.  The Minister of State and Senator Kieran O'Donnell were members of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  The point that drove people daft was that nobody in the eyes of the ordinary citizen, an gn&aacute;th-dhuine, was held to account.  They went into courtrooms and people walked away.  I am not going to question the courts.</p></speech>

To be fair to him, whatever else about him, he is a straight shooter, he does not hold back and he is a man for whom I have great admiration.  There is no point in having all the armoury and all these tools in the holster if people are not held to account.  To return to my fundamental point, people were driven cracked by the lack of accountability.  In their dealings with insurance companies and banks, people talk about the small print, the fine print, having to shop around and all the different types of products.  There is also an obligation on those institutions to be honest with people, which they are not in some cases.</p></speech>

I will start by welcoming the Bill and the strong reforms it will implement to the governance of the greyhound racing sector.  Much work has gone into the Bill before us.  I recognise the 2014 Indecon report commissioned by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the 2015 report on the industry by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Morris review of anti-doping and medication in Ireland published in 2016, all of which have played a part in contributing to the drafting of this legislation, as well as the advocacy of a range of organisations and NGOs that have been part of the process such as Dogs Trust, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, and the Irish Council Against Blood Sports.</p><p>For today's debate, my colleagues, Senators Black, Grace O'Sullivan and Higgins, and I have all tabled several amendments to the Bill.  Taken together, they are brought forward in an attempt to work alongside and complementary to the provisions, as currently set out, and to strengthen and broaden those provisions that refer to the welfare and health of greyhounds within the industry.  We do not wish to hold up this important legislation, merely to ensure that it leaves the Seanad strengthened and more complete as it relates to the animals at the core of this industry.  It is an unfortunate reality that the industry has not always put the welfare of dogs at the centre of its practices.  While progress has been made in recent years, there have been widespread violations of animal welfare, which we are seeking to ward off by the enactment of this legislation.</p><p>In amendment No. 3 we seek to ensure that the health and welfare of animals are put at the heart of the governance of the greyhound racing industry and the new greyhound board.  Our intention with this amendment is to make it a statutory requirement that a veterinary practitioner be on the board.  Such practitioners have dedicated their careers to the health and well-being of animals and we believe their presence on the board would have a significant impact on raising welfare standards across the industry as all board decisions and discussions would be seen by someone in the room through an animal welfare lens.  It is a simple and straightforward amendment intended in a constructive spirit and I hope the Minister of State will accept it.</p></speech>

It was probably remiss of me not to include the term "veterinary practitioner" in my amendment.  Where I am coming from on this is that it is well-known in the House that my background is more in horse racing than the greyhound business.  I have based the amendment on the model of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  There are representatives on the HRI board from stable staff and trainers to the Association of Irish Racecourses.  My thinking in submitting this amendment is that, as Senator Ruane just said, depending on how the board would come together over a period, it is conceivable that none of the aforementioned - the breeders, owners, trainers or independent tracks - would have direct representation, and decisions would be made by the board which would directly affect them.  It is very important that they have a voice in the room.  I will give one example which could happen down the line.  If the independent tracks were not represented, the board could conceivably be seen in every decision it makes to be favouring its own tracks.  For this reason, it is very important that the independent tracks be represented, likewise the breeders, owners and trainers.  As Senator Ruane said, the amendments are fairly self-explanatory and I hope the Government will see fit to accept them for the positive purposes and reasons for which they are intended.</p></speech>

The proposed new section 7 states:</p><blockquote>The membership of the Board shall consist of&mdash;(a) a chairperson, and<br /><br />(b) 8 ordinary members</blockquote> <p>Then we have a rather bland statement: &quot;who have, in the opinion of the Minister, experience of or shown capacity in matters relevant to the functions of the Board&quot;.  This could mean more or less anything.  The functions of the board include financial matters, so there could be an accountant on it, but there is nothing specific about people who have direct involvement in the greyhound industry or a veterinary surgeon.  Subsection (2) of the proposed new section 7 states: &quot;The Minister shall, insofar as practicable and having regard to the relevant experience of the persons concerned, ensure an equitable balance between men and women in the composition of the membership of the Board.&quot;  This is all blather.  It is of much more significance to have expertise rather than this kind of politically correct nodding in the direction of gender balance.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What is needed is expertise.  If there are women who have expertise in this area, that is wonderful and we should let them on the board, but why stress this in the absence of any direct relationship to the professional qualifications of members of the board?</p><p>Senator Ruane's amendment is strikingly obvious.  We must have a veterinarian on the board.  These people are charged with looking after the welfare of animals.  One of the objectives of the Bill is to look after the welfare of animals.  I strongly support the subsequent amendments that deal with the export of greyhounds, which is an abominable practice.  They are exported as flesh and bones to be manufactured away.</p><p>It is extremely important that the membership of the board shall include one or more than one veterinary practitioner of at least five years' standing.  That is perfect.  I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the amendment.  It seems to be perfectly reasonable and logical and it fleshes out the existing section 9, in which there is no mention whatever of the veterinary profession.  I find that extraordinary.  I urge the Minister of State strongly to take this on board.</p><p>Senator Paul Daly's amendments deal with representatives of the greyhound tracks, as well as greyhound owners, breeders and trainers.  That is fine.  They are all significant players.  I welcome Senator Daly's statement that he regrets that he did not include veterinary practitioners and views his failure to do so almost as an oversight.  We have strong support from Fianna F&aacute;il for these four amendments and I hope they will be all passed by the House.</p></speech>

It is sensible and opportune to have someone with veterinary expertise on the board given the welfare issues that exist, including the drug issue.  That is a major issue, which we will address in subsequent sections.  I support that amendment without qualification.</p> <p>One of the concerns I have relates to the Irish Greyhound Board and the proposal to increase the membership up to eight ordinary members as well as the chairperson.  There is a general point about increasing the size of boards.  There is no international evidence available to suggest that increasing the size of a board, whether of a company in the private sector, a public limited company or a semi-State body, leads to an improvement in decision-making, accountability or transparency.  There is no evidence that I am aware of to support increasing the number of members of the board.  The proposal to increase the size of the board is being taken at a time when the revenues are falling in the Irish Greyhound Board, especially income from the tote and stadiums.  There are major difficulties in this area.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Norris.  There is clear need to have people on the board with impeccable expertise, especially around the issue of the business model of the company.  This organisation continues to lose money.  Certainly, there is a strategy to improve the governance and income but it is dependent on the taxpayer for a large proportion of its income.  In 2007, the IGB depended on taxpayers for approximately 20% of its income.  This year, its dependence on the taxpayer stands at approximately 40%.  That raises grave questions about the way the board has been headed until now.</p> <p>I realise the board has a new chairman and chief executive and I wish them well.  However, there is a need for new direction and to listen to the stakeholders, something that has not been happening heretofore.  The board, especially the previous board and its chairman, had serious questions to answer.  They failed to answer those questions.  We need to have independent people who can bring some transparency to the board and have no vested or conflicting interests.  That problem has dogged this industry.  Whether it is true or otherwise, there is a perception that the stakeholders in the industry believe there are too many vested interests at the table where the board sits.  If that is the case, it needs to be rooted out.  There is no point in changing or increasing the size of the board if we do not deal with those issues.  Bringing in proper expertise involves appointing individuals who can add value, are independent and do not have the conflicts of interest that have marred the greyhound industry in recent years.  I support Senator Ruane's amendment for these reasons.</p> <p>My good colleague, Senator Paul Daly, has also proposed an amendment.  I have spoken to the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation, which is not seeking a position on the board.  The federation wants people appointed who can bring something to the board, are independent of mind and transparent in their decision-making processes.  If the federation is to be provided with a position on the board, that is fine.  The nomination of that person should be made by the federation and be elected from the federation in a democratic manner through its internal structures.  I imagine Senator Daly would agree with that.  Both amendments aim to strengthen the Bill.</p> <p>I may introduce an amendment on Report Stage.  What is the rationale for increasing the board size?  Some of those who appeared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine recommended increasing the size of the board.  However, increasing board membership does not necessarily bring about better boards.  We could increase the numbers on the board.  The question is whether that adds to productivity, efficiency or the effective running of the board.  There is no evidence to suggest it does.</p> <p>The amendment on including a veterinarian on the board is very important.  There should be veterinary expertise on the board to understand the complexities around animal welfare and deal once and for all with the drugs issue that has marred the sport in recent years.</p></speech>

I know the Minister of State was heavily involved with parallel legislation dealing with Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  That legislation clearly stipulates who shall be on the board of HRI.  The Minister has only two representatives on that board, whereas it appears from the legislation before us that he will have all nine representatives on the Irish Greyhound Board.  The Minister of State should consider the provisions for the board of HRI.  There are too many people on the board of HRI with vested interests from a racing perspective.  They are all, if Senators will excuse the expression, getting something out of it.  I am looking at this board.  That is why I have talked about the greyhound owners and breeders, because they have a federation.  Each body involved contributes to racing financially because they pay for the trainers and they pay entry fees into racing.  Ultimately, the breeders pay as well because they have to register pups.  All those associated with the greyhound breeders and owners federation are contributors.  That is why I would like to see them represented on the board.</p> <p>It is also necessary to appoint independent persons to the board, perhaps individuals who have no association with greyhound racing, because they bring a different perspective.  That is a key point.  I am keen for the Minister of State to bring in some people who have an association with the industry, similar to the provisions in respect of Horse Racing Ireland.  As I said, the provisions on the HRI are over-the-top because there are nine members on the board.  The Minister has an opportunity through the legislation to stipulate what type of board should be in place, including provisions providing that some appointments should be left to the Minister's discretion.  As previous speakers noted, the independence of the board is vital.  Previously, some members of the board had an excessive vested interest and were in it for what could they could get out of it, rather than for the good health of the industry.</p></speech>

I do not necessarily agree with Senator Norris who said that expertise rather than gender balance is important in terms of the board.  I agree that expertise on the board is important but it has been shown that the addition of women to boards, including the boards of companies, improves transparency and the decision-making process, and they also lift the energy of the company, in this case, the energy of the greyhound board.  We need to support a cultural change in the greyhound industry.  For too long its culture has been one of the old boys' club with everybody patting each other's back and nobody on the ground knowing what is going on and being kept in the dark. We should do away with the old boys' club and bring women onto the board.  I agree with the amendments proposed by Senators Ruane and Paul Daly to section 9.</p></speech>

I will stick to the Greyhound Racing Bill in my contribution.  Regarding the amendment in the names of Senators Ruane, Black, Grace O'Sullivan and Higgins, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, commissioned Indecon consultants in 2014 to carry out a review of certain matters relating to Bord na gCon.  That report made a number of recommendations regarding the board and among those was a recommendation regarding the skill set of the board.  The report identified the requirement for a senior legal professional, a marketing expert, a board with a depth of financial expertise in addition to a veterinary expert, and, as a matter of policy and in accordance with the recommendations of Indecon, to ensure there is a veterinary practitioner on the board.  This has continued and will continue into the future.  I do not believe, however, that it would be appropriate to set down in primary legislation the requirement of a veterinary practitioner on the board as I also believe it would not be good practice to single out veterinary skills when a balance of skills is required.</p><p>Regarding Senator Daly's amendment, as I have stated, one of the areas examined by Indecon was the structure of the board.  The increase in the board size from six to eight ordinary members was one of the recommendations made by Indecon and this has been included in this section.  Indecon recommended a skilled board rather than the representative board proposed in the Senator's amendment.  This issue was not identified as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, so I do not believe it would be appropriate to set down in primary legislation the specific skills of board which may change over time.  Therefore, I do not propose to deviate from the recommendation in these reports.</p><p>With regard to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's specific reference to the board size, as he will be well aware, I have seen boards where it has been recommended to reduce the size as opposed to increasing it.  To have right mix of skill sets, it was considered important to get the right size rather than a bigger or smaller size.  Specifically in this case, it was recommended to increase it by two so that a broader range of skill sets could be included.  Horse Racing Ireland's board increased in size from 13 to 14 members on the recommendation of a committee to provide for industry sector employees to have a position on that board, as was recommended.</p><p>We are trying to get the balance right here.  The Public Appointments Service, PAS, process will be undertaken.  I reassure the female Members that an effort will certainly be made to get the gender balance as equal as possible.  It is a specific ambition but that is not to say that people will be restricted or chosen just on gender.  The broad thrust of this section covers the constitution of the board, which is specifically laid out.  The PAS process will be used to bring forward the membership recommendations, and those will, in turn, be appointed by the Minister.</p></speech>

He said nothing convincing for not accepting it.  He put on the record of the House the recommendations of various committees that were commissioned to write reports and they indicated it was important to have veterinary practitioners and people from the greyhound industry on the board.  By accepting these four amendments, the Minister of State would be find himself in accord with the recommendations that he has quoted to the House.  I see no reason whatever for him to refuse to accept this amendment.  I am surprised he did not refer to the new proposed subsection (7)(1)(b) of the principal Act which reads &quot;8 ordinary members, who have, in the opinion of the Minister, experience of or shown capacity in matters relevant to the functions of the Board&quot;.  I would have thought that was his let-out because it is stated there that we can appoint veterinary practitioners or people from the greyhound industry.  As I prophesied, however, the Minister of State spoke about people who were accountants and those with other skills, but it is much more important to have a veterinary practitioner, someone who is interested in the welfare of animals, on the board.  I see nothing whatever wrong with this amendment.  I hope Senator Ruane, seconded by myself, will call for a vote on this amendment because I believe we would win it.  I believe the House is with us on this one.</p></speech>

To portray an image of stakeholders within the industry on a board as having vested interests can sound whatever way the speaker from the Government side wants it to be heard.  Who else is appropriate to be on a board other than people who have an interest in the workings of that board?  My amendment specifically reads &quot;one shall be nominated for appointment thereto by such persons as the Minister considers to be representative&quot;.  The Minister is having a say in who he believes are the representatives of the breeders, owners, trainers and independent tracks.  He will also have the final say in vetting their nominee.</p><p>Taking the two amendments together, we are talking about four people - three on foot of my amendment and one on foot of Senator Ruane's amendment.  That is still four out of nine so, collectively or individually, they still cannot dominate the board but they will be a voice for the stakeholders in that industry.  It is ludicrous for the Minister of State to talk about putting a board together to run an industry, leaving the stakeholders in that industry, the people who have vested interests in the success of the industry and whose day-to-day workings are keeping the industry alive, outside the room and not having any input in any way.  It is not as if they will come in and take over the board.  We are talking about four nominees on a board of nine who, even collectively, cannot dominate the board.</p></speech>

He will also know there was an Indecon report on Horse Racing Ireland, which recommended that the board of Horse Racing Ireland should have all various sectors that are represented on that board.  The Minister of State referred to certain people with skill sets other than specific knowledge of greyhound racing and who may not be greyhound owners.  He might consider bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage whereby he might be open to including some of the suggestions made in this debate.</p></speech>

I saw people being nominated for this House in the most recent Seanad election, and although they did not get elected, they were people who did not know the back of a greyhound from the front in certain cases, and some of them were never even inside a greyhound track.  The genuine people who should have been nominated were told it had been done secretly, the envelope was gone, and it was done and dusted.  I recommend that these industry groups, breeders and owners come together and unite under one body, and not have different groups and it all done in secrecy.  It is not good enough.

We are caught here between vested interests being needed, on the one hand, and, on the other, excessive vested interests not being a good thing.  Let us be clear about it.  This is a balancing act.  As an example, Horse Racing Ireland moved from 13 to 14 finally, but it removed a certain number from the Turf Club, replaced them with industry representatives, and was left with one from four or five, if memory serves me.  We have tried to get the balance right.  Everybody in the industry, the representative organisations and stakeholders, can put themselves forward within the Public Appointments Service system.  This is not to say the skilled board will not have representatives from the various stakeholder groups, be it the trainers, the breeders, the owners, the greyhound tracks or the bookies.  It is a matter of trying to get the board right and having independence on the control committee and the appeals committee.  At one time people would have said there were too many people from the industry and no objective eyes within the board, so we have to get that balance right.</p> <p>I will not agree to change this now.  I believe we need to have faith in the PAS system to allow us to bring forward a skill set that is representative, if I could put it that way.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister of State to give me the rationale.  What exactly is so poisonous about being a Member of the Oireachtas?  Why should somebody who one day is sufficiently qualified to be a member of Bord na gCon be ruled out?  I do not see the need for this and have opposed these sections on many occasions.  It seems daft to me, unless it is because one assumes Members of Parliament are fully occupied with being Members, but I would not think being a member of Bord na gCon was a very onerous duty.  I would think most people involved were full-time professionals of some kind.  I do not see the time constraints.  If we trust people to legislate, what, in the name of God, prevents them from being on the board for the greyhound industry?  I do not see any reason for it.  It is self-flagellation by politicians to show that we are incorruptible.  The public does not believe it anyway and thinks we are all corrupt.  If one was to take off all of one's clothes, give all of one's money to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and dance naked along the roof of Leinster House, people would still ask, "So what?"  The public is not impressed.  I question why Members of the Oireachtas should be excluded from membership of the board.  One cannot even be a director of a subsidiary if one is a Member of the Oireachtas.  It is complete nonsense.  I oppose the section.</p></speech>

The Senator has raised a wider point with which I agree.  I would be interested in hearing the response of the Minister of State.</p> <p>In this section and as referred to in section 9, there is an issue with a board member whose term expires.  Until such time as there is a vacancy, that member is not replaced, which is wrong.  If we are trying to bring forward a timeframe in this legislation in order that board members will serve no more than two consecutive terms, once the second term is up, they should be gone and the vacancies filled immediately.  I am not sure why that is not the case as it is mentioned in section 8(10).  Perhaps I might deal with the matter on Report Stage.</p> <p>With regard to an organisation which was castigated by another Member, while I appreciate that everyone has the right to exercise his or her opinion, I state categorically that the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation is the only legitimate body with a democratic mandate representing owners and breeders.  They have an opportunity to nominate two people to contest Seanad elections.  On every occasion they have done so to the best of their ability, in nominating people who have supported, helped or have a connection with the greyhound industry.  I am honoured to be one of the representatives for the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation which has unearthed a lot of dirty laundry about the industry.  Were it not for the work of the federation, the Bill may not be on the floor of this House this evening.  I acknowledge its work and contribution.  It was steadfast in its contributions and in 2015 bringing this issue to the attention of the agriculture committee, under the stewardship of the Minister of State who did an excellent job as chairperson of the committee in hearing the views of all stakeholders.  The federation's contribution should not be undermined or understated.  That is all I want to say on that topic.  </p> <p>I agree with Senator Norris on the membership issue.  It is an interesting point.  I am not sure why Members of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament are excluded.  It is not necessarily the case that they should be the first persons to be appointed to any board, but they certainly should not be excluded from being members of the board.  One sees many former Ministers and Members of the Houses on various boards.  Perhaps current Members might contribute equally as well as former Members to any board.</p></speech>

That is the rationale.  If it was to be changed, it would be the subject of a wider debate.  Voting moneys to State boards by elected Members would seem to be inappropriate and a conflict of interest.  </p> <p>I do not really wish to comment at this stage on some of the other observations or contributions made.  There is a technical issue with section 8(10) in being members of the board.  We can seek clarification for the Senator, if he so wishes.</p></speech>

Under section 21(2)(<i>n</i>), it provides that it may prohibit &quot;the entry to a greyhound race in the State of a greyhound the subject of a sanction of a foreign greyhound racing jurisdiction&quot;.  That provision is fine and correct but a full stop should follow the word &quot;jurisdiction&quot;.  Instead, the paragraph continues: &quot;or where agreement has been reached with the other greyhound racing jurisdiction&quot;.  Let us say a greyhound that raced in England is found to have been banned because illegal substances had been administered.  Under this provision, the board has the discretion to allow such a dog to race here.  That is wrong and I ask the Minister of State to reflect on section 21(2)(<i>n</i>) and insert a full stop after the first instance of the words &quot;racing jurisdiction&quot;.  Any dog banned for illegal substance abuse in another jurisdiction should be banned here until such time as the process has been concluded.  There should be no grey area around the use of drugs in the industry, particularly class A drugs.  This is one of the recurring themes that emerges from greyhound owners and breeders.  They are the ordinary people in the industry, not those who sit on the board or those who benefit from the financial rewards generated by the greyhound fund.  Ordinary punters have serious concerns about this issue.  There should be no misconception or grey area.  It should be spelled out in black and white, which means we should abide by the outcome of any drug test done in another jurisdiction until such time as the process has concluded.  If a dog is found to have a class A drug such as cocaine in its system after, let us say, a race in Manchester on a Saturday night, under no circumstances should it be allowed to race in Clonmel the following Tuesday.  That would be wrong and there should be no grey area around doping.  </p></speech>

It seems to be perfectly obvious that if a dog has been subjected to a doping test in England and the owner has been convicted of doping, it would be  extraordinary that the dog would not be banned from racing at an Irish racecourse.  A ban would be absolutely obvious so I completely agree with the Senator.  I hope the Minister of State will take his point on board and, if not, I hope Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill will table an amendment on Report Stage, which I will strongly support.</p></speech>

A dog would not be allowed to run in Manchester one week and run the following week in Ireland because the dog would have to undertake a clearance trial.  A dog, bar it was an open class dog, would be banned automatically.</p> <p>Dogs are banned for other reasons.  In England, some dogs do not chase the hare or certain hares so they are banned.  We would have to include them in any ban in this jurisdiction as well.  Dogs are banned on the basis of a failure to comply with other rules and regulations.  </p> <p>The Senator referred to various organisations ruling the roost when it comes to greyhound owners and trainers.  I could prove that shenanigans went on in many greyhound and breeders organisations when it came to choosing people to run for the Seanad.  I know what went on because I have been involved in the industry over the years.  The process was far from clean and I stand by my words.</p></speech>

Perhaps there is clarification needed about where agreement is reached.  Perhaps it has not been established that a dog has either been subject to a ban or banned for some other reason such as the one outlined by Senator Butler.  Where a dog may be the subject of a sanction, we can clarify what that entails, perhaps in a Report Stage amendment.</p></speech>

Essentially, they are identical amendments tabled to the sections that relate to the artificial insemination of greyhounds, the traceability of greyhounds and the welfare of racing greyhounds.  The overall affect of the amendments would be to increase and clarify the regulatory responsibilities of the Irish Greyhound Board in respect of these three areas.</p><p>By replacing the word &quot;may&quot; with &quot;shall&quot; and inserting the words &quot;each of&quot; before words &quot;the following&quot;, the amendments taken together would mean that the board's regulatory powers would cease being statutory capabilities and become statutory responsibilities.  In addition, every subsection in which the board is currently able to regulate would no longer be optional and at the discretion of the board but a statutory requirement set out in law.</p><p>Section 26 is on the artificial insemination of greyhounds.  As drafted, the Bill would allow the board to skip section 26(1)(<i>n</i>) as it issues its regulations in this area.  Section 26(1)(<i>n</i>) refers to &quot;measures relating to the health and welfare of greyhounds at such centres&quot;.  We do not want the health and safety requirements within this Bill to be optional.  We want them to be as strong as possible to safeguard the welfare of the animals.  With our amendment to section 26, we would simply strengthen and clarity the regulatory responsibilities of the board.</p><p>Another example can be found in section 28, which refers to the traceability of greyhounds.  This is an extremely important issue for maintaining the oversight of the welfare of animals and general accountability of the industry.  Section 28(1)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>h</i>), inclusive, set out strong and comprehensive provisions for the practical ways a traceability database will work.  What we seek to achieve with our amendments Nos. 9 and 10 is to ensure that the board has a statutory responsibility to issue regulations in this area and that every area outlined in section 28(1) must be regulated for, with no exceptions.  The amendments would increase the effectiveness of the overall intention of section 28 and strengthen the tracing framework.  It would be a worthy addition to the Bill.  </p><p>We also propose amendments to section 29, which is significant as it is the main section that refers to the health and welfare of racing greyhounds.  We want this section to be as strong as possible.  The addition of the words &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;each of&quot; would increase the effectiveness of the provisions and raise welfare standards in the industry.  We want all parts of the section to be compulsory in terms of the board's regulation of this area.  This is what we seek to achieve with amendments Nos. 11 to 13, inclusive.  </p><p>Amendment No. 14 is tabled in a similar vein to fix what would appear to be a grammatical error in section 29(1)(<i>a</i>)(i).  Section 29(1)(<i>a</i>) states:</p><blockquote>(a) requiring persons involved in greyhound racing to&mdash;(i) provide information for the purposes of the proper administration of the industry, or<br /><br />(ii) protect the health and welfare of a racing greyhound.</blockquote> <p>From my reading of the paragraph, it appears that the provision makes regulations requiring persons involved in greyhound racing to &quot;protect the health and welfare of a racing greyhound&quot; optional.  I believe those same persons should simply provide information for the purposes of the proper administration of the industry.  This appears to be a drafting error as it would make the statutory responsibility to protect the welfare of greyhounds optional.  My colleagues and I seek to replace the word &quot;or&quot; with &quot;and&quot; to make the paragraph (<i>a</i>)(i) and (ii) compulsory.</p><p>Amendment No. 15 would make an additional provision in the regulatory powers of the board and allow for the board to make regulations on provisions for the health and welfare of a racing greyhound that has been retired by its owners.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In other words, these are retirement plans for the racing dogs.  While I recognise that much progress has been made in recent years on conditions for dogs following retirement, with notable decreases in 2014 and 2015 in dog pound figures for greyhounds being put to sleep and a notable rise in the number of greyhounds being transferred to welfare groups, there are still no industry-wide standards and regulations on the best way for a dog's welfare and health to be managed in its retirement.  We are, therefore, seeking to place responsibility on the board to take on this task and issue those guidelines for how these dogs should be treated.  The amendment is supported by Dogs Trust Ireland.</p></speech>

The principal finding relates to the treatment of Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  The tribunal has set out in a clear and stark way the ordeal which Sergeant McCabe endured.  Many aspects of the report make for very disturbing reading.  What shines through at all times in this report is the courage and incredible level of resilience of Maurice McCabe and his loving family.  Since the report was published I have spoken with Sergeant McCabe on the phone and, on behalf of the State, I apologised to him and his family for the manner in which he was treated over a prolonged period.  He was extremely gracious and accepted that apology in the spirit in which it was offered to him.  I intend to meet Sergeant Maurice McCabe in person in the coming weeks and I look forward to those discussions.  I know the entire House joins with me in wishing him and his family well.  My sincere hope is that Maurice McCabe, his wife Lorraine and their family, can now put this horrendous and prolonged ordeal firmly behind them and get on with their lives.  I have no doubt that Sergeant Maurice McCabe has done the State some service and deserves our sincere thanks for that.</p> <p>While this module of the tribunal addressed Sergeant McCabe&rsquo;s situation, the report shines a light on many issues and events and contains many important lessons for us all.  I propose to look at the report&rsquo;s main findings and outline the way forward as I see it.  I thank Mr. Justice Charleton for the efficient and effective manner in which he conducted this module of the tribunal's business and for the clarity of his report and its conclusions.  I also thank Mr. Justice Sean Ryan, the former President of the Court of Appeal, who will take over the work of the tribunal for module two, in relation to the matters covered by paragraph P of its terms of reference.  That paragraph covers any garda&iacute; who made protected disclosures and who alleged that they were subsequently targeted or discredited as a result.</p> <p>To put the matter in context, I will outline briefly the background to the tribunal.  The tribunal arose essentially out of two protected disclosures made by Superintendent David Taylor and Sergeant Maurice McCabe to my predecessor as Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, in the autumn of 2016.  Those protected disclosures alleged that a campaign was being run by senior garda&iacute; to discredit Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  In general terms, the primary allegations which gave rise to this tribunal related to the alleged use of an entirely false allegation of serious criminal misconduct by Sergeant McCabe and the involvement of Tusla in this regard; allegations that the then Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan, sought to use these allegations to discredit Sergeant McCabe at the O'Higgins commission of investigation; and allegations that senior members of the service acted in a manner intended to discredit or traduce Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  In relation to these matters, the report's primary conclusions are clear.  It is emphatic in its vindication of Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  While that vindication may have been a long time coming, it was unequivocal.  It states that Sergeant McCabe is a genuine person who was concerned to maintain standards and that he has done the State considerable service by bringing failures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the attention of the wider public.  He deserves the gratitude of all of us for bringing these serious shortcomings to public attention.</p> <p>The report finds that an error made in preparing a report on allegations against Sergeant Maurice McCabe was allowed to remain uncorrected.  This was a Tusla issue and will be addressed in due course by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  No one before the O'Higgins commission of investigation ever accused Sergeant Maurice McCabe of any crime, hinted at it or engaged in any innuendo about it.  This is an important finding for the reputation of the former Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan, and I will return to this point momentarily.</p> <p>The tribunal found that both former Commissioner Martin Callinan and Superintendent David Taylor had not been truthful in their evidence.  The tribunal accepts the evidence of my predecessor, Deputy Fitzgerald, that she decided not to interfere following an email on 15 May 2015 informing her that an issue had arisen at the commission of investigation.  The report emphasises that her response was a considered one.  On a personal basis, I want to say that Deputy Fitzgerald is a loss to the Cabinet, to Government and to public service and I do not believe her resignation served any public interest, although it may have served the political interests of some parties.  I hope there will be an opportunity to see Deputy Fitzgerald returned to high office in the near future.</p></speech>

A frenzied rush to judgment on the part of many brought down a good and decent woman.  Returning to the tribunal&rsquo;s central findings, it is also accepted that the former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, did not speak with Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan and the tribunal finds that in fact no situation requiring intervention by the Minister occurred before the O&rsquo;Higgins commission.</p> <p>A particular allegation was made about my Department&rsquo;s involvement with those transcripts but the report states clearly that the transcripts provided to the tribunal from the O&rsquo;Higgins commission of investigation are and always were complete despite unfounded media speculation to the contrary.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I would like specifically to mention former Commissioner N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan.  Former Garda Commissioner O'Sullivan was the subject of a concerted campaign to undermine her position over a period of time, from the leaking of partial and misleading transcripts from the O&rsquo;Higgins commission right up to the making of the two protected disclosures and even following the establishment of the tribunal itself.  While I accept that the Oireachtas has a vital role in ensuring accountability, it is incumbent on all of us as elected representatives not to abuse the responsible positions we hold.</p></speech>

During her tenure as Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan was frequently before Oireachtas committees.  She was subjected to questions that sometimes crossed the line that divides robust inquiry from personalised attack.  In the end these allegations, which have been found by the tribunal to be unsupported by evidence, became more than anyone could reasonably bear, particularly in an extremely pressurised, responsible and visible job such as that of Garda Commissioner.  The tribunal did not find any evidence that the former Commissioner N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan was party to the calumny visited upon Sergeant McCabe or indeed any wrongdoing on her part regarding Superintendent Taylor.  It is important in all the circumstances that these findings are recorded in the House.  As I did on the occasion of her retirement, I thank Commissioner O'Sullivan for her service.  I acknowledge wrongs perpetrated against her in this and other Houses, and I wish her and her family well in future endeavours.</p><p>While some members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are revealed by the tribunal to have behaved in a reprehensible manner, Mr. Justice Charleton also highlights the diligent and professional approach taken by many members of the organisation.  As Minister for Justice and Equality this gives me grounds for optimism for the future.  The misdeeds of the few should not taint the majority.  Mr. Justice Charleton raises the fact that the Oireachtas did not debate his second interim report dealing with terms of reference (n) and (o), regarding complaints made by Garda Keith Harrison.  I am sure that Senators will acknowledge that there can be a level of furore regarding a matter giving rise to a tribunal that is seldom matched by in-depth analysis on publication of the report, especially if it makes for uncomfortable reading for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We should not shy away from some degree of self-reflection as a Parliament if we are to ensure the maintenance and preservation of a healthy democracy.</p><p>Garda Harrison and his partner, Ms Marisa Simms, alleged that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the highest level had prevailed on the HSE to intervene in their family affairs as a consequence of the making of protected disclosures by Garda Harrison.  The media coverage of these allegations, when put together with Sergeant McCabe&rsquo;s experiences with Tusla, opened the appalling vista of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na colluding with the social services to target members who raised issues.  Mr. Justice Charleton fully investigated Garda Harrison&rsquo;s allegations.  He finds: &quot;All of the allegations of Garda Keith Harrison and Marisa Simms examined by the tribunal are entirely without any validity.&quot;  Mr. Justice Charleton goes on to say: &quot;It is appropriate here to exonerate everyone in social services and in policing accused by them of discreditable conduct.&quot;  His words require no further elucidation on my part.</p><p>Let me turn to the future.  I very much welcome the Garda Commissioner's initial response to the report last week.  I met Commissioner Harris earlier today and I assured him of my support as he addresses the findings in this report.  It is clear that there are consequences to be dealt with for individuals and much of that will fall to the Garda Commissioner.  It would not be helpful for me to comment directly on these matters at this juncture.  I can say, however, that any action required of me or my Department will be followed up speedily and thoroughly.  Mr. Justice Charleton also refers to protected disclosures and how they were used in the lead-up to the establishment of the tribunal.  I note that he questions in particular if there is a lacuna in the system whereby protected disclosures properly made in accordance with the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 are then made available to Members of the Oireachtas and to the media to whom the subjects of the allegations have little or no opportunity to respond.  This has created a situation where those accused are practically considered guilty until proven innocent.  It is an abuse of an Act introduced to protect genuine whistleblowers from reporting what they reasonably believed to be genuine wrongs.  The issue raised by the tribunal merits consideration and I will raise this with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, whose Department has carriage of this legislation.</p><p>Mr. Justice Charleton is right when he says that new structures will not of themselves create the culture that will avoid the repetition of bad practice that has been highlighted now in a number of reports on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It requires significant cultural change, embedding consistent good practices and conscientious supervision by those in management ranks.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commissioned an independent organisational culture audit earlier this year, which spoke to many rank-and-file garda&iacute;, and the report also highlights many of the issues addressed by the report of the tribunal.  It is imperative that measures are taken by the Garda Commissioner to address the findings of the audit.  Furthermore, as the House will be aware, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland reported on 18 September.  The commission has produced a comprehensive roadmap for the transformation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  No more than the disclosures tribunal report, I strongly recommend anyone with an interest in policing to read the commission's report from cover to cover.  I am engaged in a consultation process with the Departments and agencies on which the report will have an impact, and I will be returning to Government with a high-level implementation plan before the end of the year.</p><p>The report specifically recommends new oversight architecture for policing that defines and separates responsibility for governance, oversight and accountability.  It also addresses the critical issue of discipline in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, similar to Mr. Justice Charleton&rsquo;s report, recommends a new disciplinary regime.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, would be replaced by a new complaints body that would handle all complaints against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that raise serious issues about standards of policing or police integrity itself, such as potential breaches of the law, violation of human rights or corruption, and issues that might indicate a widespread or systemic problem within the police.  These measures and others in the report have the potential to break the cycle of controversy that has beset An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for far too long.  The implementation plan for the commission&rsquo;s report will take full account of the issues and recommendations raised in the tribunal report.</p><p>To return to where I began, Sergeant Maurice McCabe has done the State a huge service.  Mr. Justice Charleton has done likewise, but their service will be for nothing if we do not respond appropriately.  I was greatly taken with the set of obligations on garda&iacute; set out towards the end of the report, namely, to take pride in their work and their uniform, to always be honest, to be visible, to be polite, to serve the people of Ireland, to treat the obligation to the public as superior to any false sense that garda&iacute; should stick up for each other, and the obligation of self-analysis.  These are simple values - doing the right thing, being honest and decent - but they are fundamental.  These are the standards that we should all observe, as public servants, as Members of this House and indeed as human beings, and they are certainly what the public has a right to expect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at each and every level.</p><p>My Department is engaged in a reflective process in undertaking the fundamental transformation of its structures and processes arising from the first interim report of the effectiveness and renewal group.  The second interim report was published yesterday and comments favourably on good progress having been made across the Department.  That self-reflection will continue and deepen to take on board the tribunal report.  Clearly, there are lessons for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for my Department and indeed all public bodies, for the Government, for the Oireachtas and, not least, for the media.  A central tenet for all of us is that we must learn how to act more effectively in facing up to and determining the truth of allegations while not making the mistake of treating these as given facts in all circumstances.  Above all, we must respond appropriately as a society to those who speak up to highlight a wrong.  For my part, I am determined that these lessons must and will be learned and applied.</p></speech>

I will not go into the detail but one point seems to have been lost in this discussion of what happened to Sergeant McCabe, his family and the other whistleblowers.  The Minister echoed the words of Othello when he described Sergeant McCabe as having done the State some service.  To quote another famous speech, if a man stands for a righteous cause, he is stronger than all of the hosts of error.  Sergeant McCabe has stood against all of those "hosts of error".  What we have forgotten, however, is what he was doing when he was whistleblowing.  He was taking on a system that was rigging the penalty points system and he was highlighting that assaults were not being properly investigated.  As a consequence, people were driving on our roads who should not have been on the road because they were not given the penalty points they deserved.  As the Department is well aware, last year more than 60 drivers involved in serious accidents, including some causing death, should not have been on the road.</p> <p>Let us step back from what happened to Sergeant McCabe and ask what happened to garda&iacute; who fraudulently manipulated the penalty points system, with the result that people died on our roads.  What happened to those whose crimes were not properly investigated and who subsequently committed further assaults?  Why did the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na allow that to happen?  What happened to the garda&iacute; who did not investigate those crimes properly and did not ensure our roads were safe because they failed to issue penalty points?  We know what befell Sergeant McCabe.  In a letter Sergeant McCabe provided to be read out in the D&aacute;il, he stated they had destroyed him, his career and his family.  </p> <p>The Charleton report referred to the astounding inefficiency and inertia of Tusla and stated that the allegations against Sergeant McCabe took on a life of their own.  It found that Sergeant McCabe was a good citizen and a good officer.</p> <p>The question that arises is related to consequences.  We know what happened at a high level to the Garda Commissioners and Ministers for Justice and Equality who resigned as a result of the handling of this case.  However, at a fundamental level, there have been no consequences for people who engage in the types of activities Sergeant McCabe highlighted and for which he was isolated within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>I welcome the initiatives the Minister is taking on reform.  However, as a result of the blood transfusion scandal, the Law Reform Commission proposed 13 years ago that a corporate manslaughter Bill be introduced.  Deputy O'Callaghan and I, as well as other Members, introduced corporate manslaughter legislation that reflects exactly the proposals made by the Law Reform Commission.  It would mean that an official in the Department of Health or a person working for a blood transfusion service who knowingly allowed contaminated blood products to be issued to women, resulting in death, would go to jail.  We would all consider this proposal appropriate, yet the Bill has not been passed.  Hundreds of women died needlessly, not through human error but because somebody, whose job was to ensure blood products were safe, sent out blood products in the knowledge that they were not safe.  Did this person go to jail?  No, he did not.  Did he die?  No, he did not.  Did the people he affected die?  They most certainly did.  Where is the law to stop that happening again?  It is sitting in the Department, which does not want section 3 of the Bill enacted.  This section provides that people would be held to account if somebody dies.  The Minister is far more qualified than I am in the law.  If a garda chose not to allow penalty points to appear on a person's driving record, with the result that the person retained his or her driving licence instead of having it removed, and subsequently that person was responsible for killing someone on the road, should that garda be jailed for corporate manslaughter on the basis that he or she did not do his or her job?  The Bill sets a high threshold in that regard, so I am not sure the garda would go to jail.</p> <p>The reason we are discussing scandals is that there are no consequences for those who do not do their jobs.  Sergeant McCabe was trying to do his job as he saw it, and he was correct in what he was doing.  However, the system tried to prevent him from doing his job.  The people who should have gone to jail and lost their jobs are still members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They are the people who isolated him in his Garda division and felt it was okay to allow penalty points to disappear from the system.  They did not investigate serious assaults.  The reason people died is that the people who should have investigated certain assaults did not do their job.</p> <p>We repeatedly hear about systems failure.  We expect people to do their job and they should be held accountable when they do not do their jobs.  We have not learned the lesson from such a serious and callous episode as that which occurred in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, as a result of which the Law Reform Commission proposed the introduction of corporate manslaughter legislation.  In the Minister's constituency people knew the maternity services in the Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise were not working and chose not to highlight this or intervene.  Instead, they allowed the problem to continue, which should have had consequences.  Tragedies happen and we understand that.  The problem with our system is accountability.  When somebody does something wrong, a person can resign and walk away with a pension, if in some disgrace.  This will keep happening because there are no consequences for those who do not do their jobs as they should.</p></speech>

It is clear that he is deeply committed to and supportive of the report.  I also acknowledge that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na put their lives on the line every day and do an excellent job.</p> <p>It is a rarity in this country that a tribunal completes a substantial part of its work in ten months.  In this case, the commission of inquiry also gave the public clear and unambiguous answers to the questions that led to its establishment in the first place.  Most of all, however, the fact that Maurice McCabe has been unequivocally vindicated in his relentless pursuit of high standards within the police force and, in the words of Mr. Justice Charleton, "exemplified hard work in his own calling", provides a rare glimmer of hope that the tribunal system can deliver justice from time to time.</p> <p>This is now the third report in which Maurice McCabe has been vindicated in the substance of the issue he was raising within the force.  A tribunal was only required because, again in the words of Mr. Justice Charleton, Sergeant McCabe was "was repulsively denigrated for being no more than a good citizen and police officer".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

What Maurice McCabe endured is possibly one of the most despicable stains on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the highest ranked person within the force and no amount of compensation will likely return the lost years and toll that have been imposed on his family.</p><p>The loss of ministerial office cannot in any sense be viewed in the same light as what Maurice McCabe has suffered but, equally, the resignations of Frances Fitzgerald and N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan were brought about in a manner that cannot be ignored.  Almost all on the Opposition benches, including me, said that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, had to resign because it was believed, first, that the information she gave the D&aacute;il about her state of knowledge of the legal strategy to undermine Maurice McCabe was untruthful and, second, that she sat idly by while a good man's reputation was being systematically destroyed and undermined in the most vicious manner at the O'Higgins commission.</p><p>The third reason, however, which cannot be swept under the rug, is the crazed environment of Leinster House to which the Minister referred, where politics sometimes becomes a blood sport.  A head was wanted and those calling for that head were willing to collapse a Government and force an election unless they got one.  Sadly, some took satisfaction and even pleasure out of the resignation of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald.  In their minds, victory was complete even if the quest for the full truth was the casualty.  This type of behaviour and politics reflects the same boorish manner in which Commissioner Callinan and Superintendent Taylor operated their public affairs.  Is it any wonder that there is so much contempt for politicians in this country?  Even when faced with the most serious maladministration within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we still found a way to turn it into a game for a political assassination.  The tribunal has made it absolutely clear that the actions taken by Frances Fitzgerald in effectively not intervening in the commission's work when she became aware of the legal strategy were fully justified.  As Mr. Justice Charleton says, any hint of working things out between the Garda Commissioner and the Department of justice had to be avoided as a matter of ethics.</p><p>Ethics should be the driving force in Irish politics and that is the key question we need to address here with respect to Frances Fitzgerald.  The tribunal not only found that there were no questions here for Frances Fitzgerald to answer; it also found that the Minister's intervention would have been unethical.  Charleton explicitly found that the only appropriate action for one investigative party was not to interfere with the approach of the other investigative party.  In other words, the Minister acted appropriately at all times.</p><p>There is no going around the fact that the former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, was taken out, mired in public controversy and yet found to have done nothing wrong in her function as Minister.  It is petty in the extreme for any of us involved not to acknowledge the simple fact that the very essence of why we forced her our - her inaction - has proven to be an ethical approach that a Supreme Court justice and tribunal chairman has said ought to have been adopted.  Deputy Fitzgerald rose through the ranks from being a Member of this House to being Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Minister for Justice and Equality and T&aacute;naiste.  For her career to have been sullied in the way it was mirrors the brutish and bullish culture of Commissioner Callinan and David Taylor which they adopted in their campaign against Maurice McCabe.  I want to say to Deputy Fitzgerald that I let my own standards fall when I became part of the frenzy that called for her head.  I want to say I am sorry for any hurt I caused her.  I am sorry for the hurt to her reputation and to her family.  She comes out of this tribunal with her reputation intact.  How can we as politicians possibly give leadership and inspire decent public service when our political behaviour is sometimes so far removed from facts and reality but instead feeds the notion that politics is some cynical and gladiatorial battle filled with winners and losers?</p><p>Having acknowledged that there were political gains at play in this sorry affair, I must accept that a number of my colleagues in both Houses of the Oireachtas, who have persisted on many matters surrounding wrongdoings in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, must not be lumped in with the game players.  We owe a debt of thanks to those who take wrongdoing in all parts of our society and bring it to this House to ensure the innocent do not suffer.  I am speaking of those who championed the McCabe case.  I cannot begin to understand the pain caused to the family of Maurice McCabe.  I hope the tribunal report gives Maurice and his wife, Lorraine, and their family a new lease of life.  I hope they find peace.</p><p>I equally hope that this provides the impetus for our new Commissioner, Drew Harris, to drive the cultural reforms that seem to be so badly needed and that we never again see this rotting behaviour at the top of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I hope, with much less expectation, that politicians and media alike hit the pause button on the ministerial head-hunting approach to politics the next time a crisis comes around.  I hope when the facts do not meet the political reality that it is acknowledged and not simply quashed to ensure nobody loses face.</p><p>We owe the McCabes, the O'Sullivans and Deputy Fitzgerald a deep apology.  I stand here in all humility today for I was among those in this House that called for the heads of Frances Fitzgerald and N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan.  I am deeply sorry to both of them and I do hope and pray that Deputy Fitzgerald finds high public office again, for she deserves it.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, for taking the time to come here.  I know he holds this issue in such high regard that he wanted to be here himself although he could have sent a Minister of State.  When he is talking to Deputy Fitzgerald, I ask him to pass on my apologies.</p></speech>

In fairness to him, he acknowledged it and I salute that.  I remember that night last November very well.  I was sitting in the same seat as now.  As it happened, the Leader of the House was beside me.  What we had to listen to that night was just appalling.</p></speech>

They are not here.  We have five or six Members out of 60 here tonight.  It is a disgrace on them.  There was one gentleman who stood up here that night and talked about bullet-proof glass, if I remember correctly, in the Department of Justice and Equality, suggesting that the place was effectively contaminated beyond belief.  I have no doubt that there are challenges in the Department of Justice and Equality.  There was a report produced which is being implemented by the exceptional Minister who is sitting in front of us.  The comments made that night to and in front of Deputy Fitzgerald were breathtaking.  They were incredible.  What went on was appalling.  On such occasions when one is sitting and listening to that sort of thing, however, some people do impress.  Senator Boyhan that night was extremely fair to the Minister and T&aacute;naiste.  He called for the tribunal to be allowed get on with its business and do its work and let the T&aacute;naiste's future be determined by its recommendations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There were others, not just in this House but in the other House, who were not as fair.

I commend the Acting Chairman on his honesty and sincere apology.  It is disappointing that Senator Mark Daly in his contribution did not, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, apologise to Deputy Fitzgerald for the wrong his party did to her.  I am using this Seanad Chamber to call on the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il and the party's justice spokespersons in the D&aacute;il and Seanad to apologise to Deputy Fitzgerald for the way in which they hounded her out of office.  The report called her &quot;selfless&quot;, and that is what she was and is.  She is a woman of the utmost probity and integrity.  Apart from Deputy Fitzgerald, the real victim is Sergeant Maurice McCabe and his family, and they must be at the bedrock of our thoughts.</p><p>We all welcome the publication of this tribunal's report as it shone a light on the media and the way in which they report and operate.  The report is worth reading in its entirety.  It is important to recognise, as Senator Conway noted, that the Minister is facing challenges in the Department of Justice and Equality.  A cultural change must now begin in the Garda force.</p><p>I join the Minister in condemning the way in which the former Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, was treated.  It is about ensuring we have fairness and equality in our debate and public discourse.  Ironically, the one place with accountability is the political arena, as people can be voted in or out.  Nowhere else does that happen to the same degree.  It is with that in mind that I make my contribution.</p><p>I sit on the policing fora of Cork city and county councils.  I see the work being done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a local level and the leadership being given by the Minister and the new Garda Commissioner.  I welcome his appointment and I hope he will, in time, address the Seanad as a figure of public importance and outline his vision for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>We all want accountability and answers.  Sergeant McCabe and his family deserve it.  They got some measure of response from the disclosures tribunal, although the report of Mr. Justice Charleton makes for sobering reading.  He does not pull any punches.  He is very clear and cogent in what he says and what he has reported.  It would be best for us all to reflect on that.  We must reflect on the political discourse in this Chamber.</p><p>The Acting Chairman's remarks, as well as his honesty and sincerity, are refreshing, and I admire him because of that.  He spoke about new politics on the Order of Business today, but it is a pity new politics have not been followed by Senator Mark Daly on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I wonder why you did not do it, Senator Daly.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Acting Chairman has just been placed an invidious position.  It is disappointing that Members of the House who operated a Star Chamber in November last year have been quiet tonight.  It is sad.  I have never looked for a political head in my political life and I have always judged issues rather than personality.  I welcome the tribunal report and I commend the Minister on his approach.</p></speech>

He is the person most central in this tribunal.  I am sure he wishes it were the case that none of this transpired.  Unfortunately, the actions of his superiors meant he was drawn into one of the largest controversies involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its history.  He is to be commended on his bravery in the face of such adversity and what appear to be almost insurmountable and deliberately placed obstacles.  He has been entirely vindicated by the tribunal findings, which further indicated, quite remarkably, that he was denigrated for being no more than a good citizen and police officer.  He was subject to a "campaign of calumny".</p> <p>These are very strong findings and I thank Mr. Justice Charleton for his sterling work on this tribunal.  I wish Mr. Se&aacute;n Ryan well as he takes his place for the final module.  We can all agree that when the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe came into the public domain in 2012, the nation was shocked.  A few months later he lifted the lid on the penalty points matter.  At this point I also commend Garda John Wilson, who stood by Sergeant McCabe's claims and publicly supported him when the easier route would have been to disappear into the background.  They did not commit the sin of silence that makes men cowards.  Unfortunately and disgracefully, the response by the institution of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was not to reflect on these failings, see how they might be resolved and examine the serious breach of what the Garda was supposed to uphold and serve.  The people involved circled the wagons before rounding on Sergeant McCabe and treating him as a nuisance to be ignored, marginalised and vilified.  Such feelings of disdain were made overt in public by the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, when he went before the Committee of Public Accounts and proceeded to tell it that only two officers from a force of 13,000 were making allegations of wrongdoing and that, on a personal level, he found that quite disgusting.</p> <p>In May 2016, days after the publication of the O'Higgins report, further leaks revealed that Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan's legal team had a strategy of attacking Sergeant McCabe's motivation and integrity during an inquiry.  In June 2016, Tusla wrote to Sergeant McCabe and confirmed that no allegation of digital penetration had been made against him.</p></speech>

There is a good deal in the report about Tusla, the allegations of rape, Sergeant McCabe's family, society and its loss of strength of feeling.  What Martin Callinan did to try to undermine and discredit Sergeant McCabe was truly disgusting.  I could go on about Superintendent Taylor, who is equally damaged by the report.  He has internalised guilt for wrongdoing on his part.</p><p>It is important that we entrusted Mr. Justice Charleton to make an adjudication of the facts and legal elements of the various related controversies, but it is not for him to adjudicate on the political handling of events and the political response to them.  The criticisms of the Government and the former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, in the report were not legal but they were political criticisms.  The reason the former Minister lost the confidence of the D&aacute;il and the reason a confidence motion was not tabled was well documented at the time.  It is a matter of public record that the Taoiseach corrected the D&aacute;il record on numerous occasions in the days leading up to her resignation.  I accept the findings of the tribunal, and Deputy Fitzgerald is entitled to point to the fact that she acted truthfully and honestly.  The D&aacute;il had been given the wrong story too many times and the political decision was taken to table a motion of no confidence.  There was not confidence in the Minister in terms of the way this affair was handled by the Government.  However, it was all but a formality.  The Government would have lost the vote.  That is the political reality and how it works.</p><p>I wish Maurice McCabe and his family the best of luck, health and determination in the years ahead.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-10-23a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1402" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018102300002#UU00300"><p>That is rather a challenge.  I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to debate the important report.  I say to the Leader that I hope we will have more time to debate it further as we are short of time.</p><p>As the Minister has done, I commend Mr. Justice Charleton on his forensic analysis and very clear recommendations and findings in this important report.  In the short time available to me, I acknowledge the comments and points made by my colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Sherlock.  He made three key points, namely, that Ministers must account fully and accurately to the D&aacute;il, that the tribunal accepted the sworn evidence of all Deputies who gave evidence before it, and that the Policing Authority must be retained for openness and accountability.</p><p>I acknowledge also, as the Minister did, the findings of Mr. Justice Charleton in respect of the former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and, on a personal note, commend Deputy Fitzgerald on all of her work as Minister for Justice and Equality.  Those of us in this House worked very closely with her on many pieces of important legislation such as the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences)(Amendment) Bill.</p><p>I pay tribute to Maurice McCabe and acknowledge the utter vindication of him by the tribunal report.  I note the Minister's apology also and all of us, as public representatives, join him in that.</p><p>The findings of the tribunal are very important.  It found that Maurice McCabe was an officer of exemplary character who has done the State considerable service.</p><p>I acknowledge also that Mr. Justice Charleton greatly praised ordinary rank-and-file garda&iacute; who do a very difficult job, but he was highly critical of the culture in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of aspects of Tusla, which as the Minister stated is a matter for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to deal with but which must be highlighted when we see phrases such as &quot;startling inefficiency&quot; and a chaotic failure in senior management in respect of Tusla.  That should be acknowledged.</p><p>In terms of the report's findings on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, many of the findings are not new.  Those of us who served on the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, including Senator Conway, will be conscious that the Garda Inspectorate made similar findings.  The Guerin report, the Morris report and the O'Higgins report made findings in respect of difficulties, problems and flaws within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na culture that have to be addressed.</p><p>Some quotes stand out from the Charleton report.  On page 295 there is reference to a &quot;cultural shift requiring respect for the truth is needed&quot;.  That is a shocking thing to say about a policing service.  The obligations of the Garda that Mr. Justice Charleton suggests as recommendations also stand out, as they did for the Minister, as he pointed out.</p><p>The report notes that structures within the Garda have changed since the Morris tribunal, notably the establishment of a Policing Authority, long sought by my party, to ensure external governance and the passage of the Protected Disclosures Act.  The report points out that structures can be put in place readily, but a change of culture is markedly more different and that is what is needed.</p><p>I will conclude by referring to two specific recommendations made by Mr. Justice Charleton, on one of which the Minister pointed out he will be taking action, along with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The first is that those of us in the Oireachtas need to consider amendments to the Protected Disclosures Act to ensure it is not abused.  The Minister made a very good point on that and the report, at page 299, is very clear on it.  We all need to reflect on that.</p><p>Second, Deputy Sherlock referred to the impact of the report on the way we implement the recommendations of the O'Toole Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  As Deputy Sherlock stated, the Policing Authority was a very important reform in terms of ensuring external oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The report of the O'Toole commission set out a very clear blueprint for overall reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is very welcome in that regard.  Nonetheless, we need to consider very carefully the recommendations in respect of changes to the governance and management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly the report's recommendation that there would be a statutory Garda board to strengthen internal governance and management, along with a new oversight body to be called the policing and community safety oversight commission, which effectively would be a merger of the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate.  I know there is a recommendation from a minority, Dr. Vicky Conway and Dr. Eddie Molloy-----</p></speech>

I will finish the point that the minority recommendation expressed concern that the new architecture proposed by the O'Toole commission might not offer the best prospects of achieving the goal of unambiguous, independent, empowered and transparent accountability.  We need to reflect on how best to ensure that there is an external oversight body.  The Policing Authority was to be that body and I believe is bedding down to be that body.  I would be very concerned, and Deputy Sherlock raised this point, that any new architecture would preserve the vitally important principle of an external oversight body which would have power to deal with internal matters too and the ability to examine internal management, including resource management, senior promotions, appointments and so on.  As legislators, we need to reflect on how best we can ensure that external oversight is provided for while acknowledging the importance of the recommendations of the O'Toole commission and the major work put into that.</p><p>I will conclude on a slightly lighter note.  I was delighted to see Mr. Justice Charleton concluding his report with a quote from one of my heroes, namely, the first President of the Czechoslovak Republic, founded 100 years ago this year, Tom&aacute;&scaron; Masaryk, who said that change comes in small ways through hard work and not just through large, sweeping changes.  As Masaryk stated:</p><blockquote>Utopianism can be overcome by humble work and through small work.  Revolutionism is over, as well.</blockquote> <p>I believe that was intended by Mr. Justice Charleton to be a call on everyone to engage in the sort of fundamental change in culture that is required in policing in Ireland, which in many ways can be more difficult to do and takes much longer than changing structures.</p></speech>
