The conference gave people the opportunity to hear about the transformative work that happened in schools and communities as a result of the programme.  The Taoiseach, who established the programme as he was the Minister for Education at the time, acknowledged all of the terrific work as did the current Minister for Education, Deputy Norma Foley.  I wish to acknowledge the SCP work that has been carried throughout the country.</p> <p>I appreciate that the Cathaoirleach accepted my Commencement matter that seeks an update on the Curragh-Kildare school completion programme and calls for necessary supports to be provided to enable the programme to carry out its work.  Recently, I was contacted by the acting chair of the Curragh-Kildare school completion programme cluster, which consists of Kildare Town Community School, which has more than 1,000 pupils, St. Brigid's primary school, which has more than 1,000 pupils, as well as the Curragh post-primary school and the Curragh amalgamated primary school.  The cluster has been supported since 2006 by the school completion programme.  It has done a lot of really good work.  The cluster works with children at primary and post-primary levels who are at risk of not completing their schooling, which is hugely important within any community and town.  One school home-school liaison teacher has been assigned to one of these primary schools, so a huge amount of work needs to be carried out.</p> <p>During Christmas 2021, local schools received an email informing them that the current educational welfare officer would leave in the next two weeks, which had the result that many priority cases had to be closed.  A suggestion was made that the school completion programme and the one home-school liaison person could continue to support the remaining families as best they could.  Since then the local schools have sought an update on the appointment of a new educational welfare officer but to no avail.  They have been left with no contact and no support for six months.  These schools do their very best to support their pupils and their families but they cannot do that on their own without proper enforcement and follow-up at a formal level by an educational welfare officer.  The deterioration in attendance has been frightening and, quite frankly, unforgivable.  These schools need external supports and without that schools are powerless, and defenceless, against investigation by the Ombudsman for Children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is insulting that this situation has been allowed to continue.  It is a slap in the face for the teams within the schools and shows a complete disregard for the years of work that they have put into supporting the programme and the target families.  They have been left high and dry.  It is absolutely time that action was taken here.  It is time that the calls from these schools were heard at the highest levels.  That is why I am raising it today.</p><p>It should not be this difficult and school completion programmes should be able to access something as basic as an educational welfare officer.  It is unacceptable that the adequate support is not being given.  This cluster of schools caters for almost 2,400 students in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, initiative who are in schools in bands 1 and 2, and many of whom have substantial care needs.  That there is no forethought or preparations for continued provision for the continuity of support is simply not acceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-12a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051200002#B00200"><p>I thank Senator O'Loughlin for raising her Commencement matter and I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Education.  Senator O'Loughlin sets out quite well and very clearly the merit and importance of the educational welfare officer and the repercussions if such an officer is not <i>in situ</i>at a very important time in the development of children.</p><p>DEIS is the main policy initiative of the Department to address educational disadvantage at school level.  Currently, 884 schools and more than 180,000 students benefit from the DEIS programme.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, recently announced the expansion of the DEIS programme to an additional 310 schools, with 37 existing DEIS schools upgraded.  This means that in the 2022-23 school year, there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS programme serving over 240,000 students or nearly one in four students.  This will also mean a &euro;32 million increase in the Department's expenditure on the DEIS programme for 2023.  This is the largest-ever single increase in the investment in the programme and will extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest proportions of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.</p><p>The school completion programme was established in 2002 by the Department to support the retention of young people in education.  It was integrated into the school support programme provided under DEIS in 2005 and is now one of the key DEIS supports.  The school completion programme is a key component of Tusla education support service, TESS.  The programme is targeted to support primary and post-primary children and young people who have been identified as potentially at risk of early school leaving, or who are out of school and have not successfully transferred to education outside of the school system or into employment.</p><p>The Curragh, County Kildare, school completion programme comprises two local primary schools and two post-primary schools.  The total funding provided to the Curragh school completion programme by TESS is in the region of &euro;170,000 <i>per annum</i>.  The project provides targeted supports to young people identified as requiring support.  In addition, universal supports are given to some 500 students.  More than 700 young people receive interventions, ranging from intensive supports multiple times weekly to after-school supports and school holiday programmes.  The project also delivers a significant number of programmes such as mentoring for achievement, mind out and decider skills.</p><p>The educational welfare service is also part of TESS and operates under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which emphasises the promotion of school attendance, participation and retention.  The educational welfare service deals with children and families who have difficulties with regard to school attendance, participation and retention.  This is a statutory service and its primary role is to ensure that every child either attends school regularly or otherwise receives a certain minimum education to ensure and secure every child's entitlement to education.</p><p>A recruitment process with the already-established educational welfare officer national panel is currently under way to fill this vacant educational welfare officer post.  In the interim, TESS management at local level have been working collaboratively to bring together the home school community liaison, the school completion programme and the educational welfare service capacity in TESS to prioritise TESS interventions for children and young people to ensure school attendance.  I will bring the Senator's specific issues to the Minister for Education as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-12a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051200002#B00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for being here to give a response.  While I certainly welcome the expansion of the DEIS programme, my question was not about that.  It was specifically about the welfare office.  I accept that the Minister of State said that more than 700 young people receive interventions.  That just shows the number of young people and the extent of the community that need this support.  The Minister of State mentioned that the recruitment process is under way to fill this job and that management at local level have been working collaboratively to bring everyone together for interventions.  It is not working.  The efforts of the home school liaison and school completion programme are toothless without the legal standing of the educational welfare officer to support their work.  The educational welfare officer is an essential piece of the puzzle.</p> <p>I again ask the Minister when the Curragh-Kildare school completion programme can expect to have a replacement educational welfare officer.  What caused the delay?  I appreciate the Minister of State is not within the Department of Education but what will that Department do to ensure that should such a situation arise in the future, the position be filled in a time-efficient manner?  This case is in Kildare but it could happen anywhere in the country.  It is too big and too important of a piece just to be ignored and not to have something set in train.</p></speech>

It is stated in the formal reply from the Department that the recruitment process is under way but I do not have a timeline as to when it will be completed.  I will revert to the Minister, Deputy Foley, and advise her of the Senator's concerns for her locality which are very-well merited.  I know that we have to learn in this country that early intervention is key to determining the future of people and giving them the chance to realise their ambitions.  We have to be very proactive in that approach.</p></speech>

I know it is a situation of which he is very well aware.  In the Athlone area and its environs, there are eight parents who do not have a school place for their children within the Athlone school area for next September.  These eight children have been in autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes within primary school settings.  We now have a situation where there is no school available within Athlone or within 55 km of the town for them to get an education.  That is not acceptable.</p> <p>A number of people have also been in contact with me whose children are within the post-primary schools within the area but would prefer if there was another class for them to go to.  We need in the region of 12 to 18 places to be made available within the Athlone area for the kids to go to school.  The reality is that these children are entitled to be educated close to their home.  As it stands, some of these children will have to travel a return journey of 100 km per day to be able to get an education.  This is at a time when our school transport system requires that people go to their nearest school and yet, we are not accommodating that for families.  Parents need certainty.</p> <p>I will give the Minister of State an idea of the surrounding areas.  In Longford, at present, we have 48 ASD classes for an enrolment of 4,205.  There is low availability in two of the schools.  There are no places available in Mullingar, Ballinasloe or Roscommon.  Those are all the surrounding areas of Athlone town to where those families now look to have their children educated.  I have been in contact with the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  I know she is working on it but we are coming to the end of the school term and these parents have to get certainty that their children can be educated in the Athlone area, in the environs of where they live, in September 2022.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051200002#C00100"><p>I thank Senator Carrigy for his Commencement matter which is a very important one and, as he has referred to himself, I am aware of a number of cases in my own home town of Mullingar where there is no capacity at all.  This is a shocking situation for families who need certainty and are under significant pressure at the moment in trying to get a place for their children into the future.</p> <p>This year, the Department of Education will invest in excess of &euro;2 billion, or over 25% of the Department's budget, in the area of special educational needs support.  As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.  Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to a  current total of 2,148 for the 2021-2022 school year.  Of these, almost 1,900 special classes cater for students with autism.</p> <p>Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements over the past two years, the Department of Education and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined-up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year.  Overall, this intensive intervention has seen an additional 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places, which have already opened nationwide for the 2021-22 school year.</p> <p>The NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs nationwide.  It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  The NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all the children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  The Department, the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, continue to prioritise support of this work.  As correctly referred to by the Senator, that is very important because there are very vulnerable families travelling a distance, if they are lucky enough at times, in order to get a place.  The transport system can pose a great problem for and stress on a family.   </p> <p>The Department also recognises that where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for their child, particularly a child with additional needs, it can be a stressful experience.  The Department is working hard to ensure that there are sufficient school places, appropriate to the needs of all children, available on a timely basis nationwide.</p> <p>As matters stand, the Department in this reply has confirmed that there is a total of 30 autism spectrum disorder, ASD, special class places in post-primary schools in the Athlone and Moate area.  The Department and the NCSE are always grateful to schools that express a willingness to open a special class to meet the educational needs of students in their local communities.  </p> <p>There are special educational needs organisers, SENOs, located across the country and they have a specific remit in helping and supporting parents in accessing the education necessary for their children, including in identifying suitable school placements.  The NCSE is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022-23 school year and beyond.  The NCSE is looking at local information on projected demand for future special education places, particularly to cater for students with autism who have associated complex needs.</p> <p>The NCSE has also been working with stakeholders in Westmeath for a number of years to meet the identified need in the county.  SENOs are currently engaged with schools and boards of management in the Athlone and the wider Westmeath-Roscommon regions to establish the level of need to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place to meet that need.</p> <p>I should also state that budget 2022 has provided funding to the Department of Education and the NCSE for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022-23 school year.  These additional classes will provide more than 1,700 new places this year.  This additional provision will bring the total number of special classes to more than 2,400 in the 2022-23 school year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051200002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State and I compliment the Government on the work that it has done and, in particular, the work that has been done by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the senior Minister, Deputy Foley, in providing a significant number of places, especially at primary level.</p> <p>We have a tsunami ahead of us because we have not created the places at post-primary level.  The reply refers to the fact that there were 30 places in Athlone and in Moate.  The reality is that there are, in fact, 30 places but there is no availability in those towns for any child who wishes to avail of such a place in September.  In fact one child from just outside Athlone, on the Ballymahon side in Glasson, has secured a place in St. Mel's College in Longford.  That is a 90 km return journey every day for that family.  For anyone who knows anything about autism, and I know about this condition personally, one needs to have children in schools in places with which they are familiar.  This is not acceptable. </p> <p>It is also stated in the reply that the NCSE has been working on this for years.  This does not take years to sort out.  If one sits down with the schools in the area, not just there but across the country, we know the numbers that are in the primary system and we need to ensure that every family and child who is entitled to get an education - and this is written into the 1916 Proclamation - is treated equally.  We need to sit down, identify the schools and ensure that we have sufficient places for all children.  This needs to be sorted before this school term is over to give certainty to those parents.</p></speech>

The forward planning is very poor in providing adequate places.  Only yesterday I heard of a child in Brittas, County Wicklow, who has to travel to Rathangan, which is in County Kildare on the Offaly border, and a child from Rathangan must travel to Straffan which is right at the other end of the county, and is over a 90 mile trip also.  I completely endorse everything the Senator has said and I call on the Minister of State now to reply, please.</p></speech>

I also endorse and share the concerns that I have seen on the ground working in my locality.  I have seen very vulnerable families who are under significant pressure in having to deal with the burden and stress, first, of getting a school place and, second, getting a school place which is a great distance away.  That is not good enough and I feel for those families.</p> <p>Potentially, we should meet the senior Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, again on this issue because, as the Senator has quite rightly pointed out in respect of the reply, it is factual to say that there are 30 places in the areas referred to but they are not meeting the demand.  That is the key point.  The families are placed under pressure then because this demand is not being met.  That is completely unacceptable given the amount of money we are spending on education.  It would be important to meet both Ministers to try to shine a spotlight on this issue and to push as hard as we can to have it resolved. </p></speech>

We now move to to the third Commencement matter of the morning which has been tabled by Senator Craughwell.  This refers to the need for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to make a statement on the consultations undertaken with industry experts and other stakeholders ahead of the publication of cybersecurity legislation.  I notice that the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, is in the hot seat once again.  Senator Craughwell now has four minutes in which to make his case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-12a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051200002#C00700"><p>I thank the Acting Chairperson.  I am sorry that the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has been thrown into this issue as it is not his area of responsibility.  It is regrettable that the Minister who is responsible for cybersecurity is not here.</p> <p>Legislation on cybersecurity is scheduled to come before the Oireachtas in the summer of 2022, as the cybercrime Bill is due shortly.  I have attended a number of conferences and have engaged with quite a number of cybersecurity companies operating in the State.  The first I heard of this legislation was when it was announced at the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications last week.  It is simply not good enough that legislation on a matter as important as cybersecurity would arrive without the opportunity for fair engagement right across the industry.</p> <p>As the Minister of State will be aware, the HSE cybersecurity attack will have cost this country in excess of &euro;100 million and probably a great deal more by the time it is finished.  We have also had a cyberattack on the Rehab Group and cyberattacks are part and parcel of every day life now.  The ambition set out by the newly appointed director of the National Cyber Security Centre is appallingly weak with respect to the number of people it expects to employ in that centre by 2023.</p> <p>The industry wants to engage with Government.  We want to be the best country, the most cyber-aware country, and the most cyber-protected country in the world.  As the Minister of State knows, we are never totally protected because the criminals are always one step ahead of us.  I ask, as I have in the committee, that the Minister of State relay this message back to the Government.  I have written to the Taoiseach on this issue and have made a number of points.</p> <p>First, I do not know why cybersecurity is located in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications when it should be in either the Department of Defence or the Department of Justice, or, more properly, directly under the Department of the Taoiseach.  This makes absolutely no sense to me.  This is the primary defence of the nation.  A cyberattack could bring this economy down in a nanosecond.  The last time cybersecurity was discussed in either House was in June 2021 and that is simply not good enough.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It should be discussed on a regular basis.  The National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, should be educating people all the time rather than hiding in the background.  The strategy for 2019-2024 is a work of fiction because it has not delivered on its claims.</p><p>The bottom line is that we have attracted the greatest companies in the world from an IT perspective.  We have Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc.  Not only that but we also have very large chemical and pharma industries.  We have a massive amount of research and development going on here.  All we need is one successful attack on one of these companies and the likelihood is that we will see a flight from this country.  Cybersecurity has to become the most important thing in this country because it is a battle we are fighting all day and every day.</p><p>It would be better to stall the legislation, although we do not know what is in it, and to engage with the industry.  Let us have the experts in here.  We are lucky in that because of the organisations we have in this country, we have some of the greatest minds in the world in regard to cybersecurity.  We should be tapping into those minds to make sure we have the best possible cyberdefence in the world.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to go back to Government and ask it to stall this legislation and give the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications an opportunity to engage with these people to inform the legislation that will come before both Houses, even if that is in the autumn of this year, rather than rushing it through in the summer.</p></speech>

I want to apologise for the absence of a Minister from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p><p>Officials in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications are in ongoing consultations with cybersecurity industries.  That is obviously at variance with what the Senator said.  We will probably have to square that circle in regard to what is stated in the reply. Cyber Ireland is a national industry cluster headquartered in Munster Technical University in Cork.  Cyber Ireland&rsquo;s board membership indigenous and multinational firms as well as third level institutions engaged in cyber education and research.  Ministers and officials are in regular contact with Cyber Ireland and its members and the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will tomorrow participate in the launch of Cyber Ireland&rsquo;s Cybersecurity Sector in Ireland report.  The Minister of State will also soon be travelling to the US with the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, to promote Ireland as a destination for foreign direct investment.  During that visit he will meet with the multinational cybersecurity and digital services firms, which have a base here.  The Government will continue to consult with Cyber Ireland and relevant stakeholders in industry and in the academic community to inform the drafting of legislation and the forthcoming review of the national cybersecurity strategy later this year.</p><p>I would like to highlight on behalf of the Minister that a large proportion of legislation covering cybersecurity in Ireland has its origins in the EU and officials are in frequent contact with Cyber Ireland and other industry stakeholders both in Ireland and Brussels to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s national positions are informed by the perspective of industry.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has conducted an extensive industry consultation following the publication of the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a review of the network and information security directive in December 2020.  Officials have continued to engage with industry stakeholders during the Council negotiations last year and the ongoing<b></b>trialogue negotiations.  Most recently officials have engaged with stakeholders about the Commission&rsquo;s industry consultation and forthcoming Cyber Resilience Act, which closes later this month.</p><p>In respect of other key stakeholders I can assure the Senator that the officials in the Department are in regular and ongoing contact with relevant Departments and agencies in the drafting of legislation for the NCSC.  The Government has agreed that legislation will delineate the NCSC&rsquo;s role in relation to other actors in the cyber area.  The NCSC has long-standing co-operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces, including secondments of personnel.  To address this ever-growing threat of cybercrime and malicious cyberactivity by state and non-state actors, it is essential that the co-operation can be expanded and deepened into the future.</p></speech>

The document given to the Minister of State by the Department today reads well.  It reads as well as the strategy document but I am afraid the Department should read what was said at the last meeting we had with people in the cyberindustry to see what they had to say.  They condemned everything about our cybersecurity.  I ask the Minister of State to bring this back to the Taoiseach and the Government.  We need to move the area of cybersecurity into the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Defence or the Department of Justice where it will get the proper support, and we need to do it urgently.  We need to engage with the industry and listen to what it has to say.  Those in the industry are the experts out there fighting crime every day.  The cost to this economy of cybercrime runs to billions of euro.  It is now more profitable than the drugs industry, and that is frightening.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, to the Chamber.  The Connemara Bog Complex is a very large site of approximately 50,000 ha.  It covers the majority of the south Connemara lowlands in County Galway.  The site is bounded to the north by the Galway-Clifden road, the N59, and to the south, it stretches as far as the Moycullen-Spiddal road.  This is a huge area of land that is protected within the Connemara region.  It is predominantly lowland Atlantic blanket bog, with some small areas of old oak woodland with some invasive rhododendrons and, of course, some of the finest rivers are in the area.  That is very important as the Atlantic salmon, a species listed under Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive, is found in some of the rivers within this site.</p> <p>There is a long-running history of the selection of this area as a candidate for a special area of conservation, SAC, going back as far as 1997 when there was a first notification of the site.  It was subsequently extended and renotified in 2006.  I understand there has been an appeals process and that appeals have been lodged and processed since then.  The Department is engaging in the final signing off of the SAC.</p> <p>I am inquiring in regard to clarification on the appeals.  Will there be any future opportunities in regard to appeals?  I am not talking about large-scale changes.  In some cases, there may be a request for some minor changes to the boundaries of the SAC in the future.  It could be to rectify some issues where there may be mistakes on the mapping, for example, or there could be areas which are commercially sensitive to somebody and it may make sense to make a slight change in the boundary and that could be compensated elsewhere with the inclusion of another area.</p> <p>I am inquiring as to whether the boundaries will be the boundaries forever or whether there could be changes to an SAC in the future.  As I said, it is a huge tract of land, some 50,000 ha.  I appreciate it is hugely important in terms of biodiversity and our requirements under the Habitats Directive and it is something with which we have to comply.  There has been a great deal of discussion, engagement and talk since this was first notified as far back as 1997.  We have come a long way in terms of acceptance that SACs are here and are required under European law.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There has to be a process and a boundary created to define that special area of conservation.  However, as I said, can there be minor, but perhaps important, changes in the future which would benefit society, the economy and local communities, whether it is a requirement to remove a small piece to allow for a piece of amenity or commercial infrastructure?  Clarification on the processes into the future is important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-12a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051200002#E00200"><p>I thank Senator Kyne for raising this very important matter.  It is great to see children back into the Visitors Gallery to see the work in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is very important.</p> <p>The designation of European sites under the nature directives is a formal, legal process with a number of steps that must be followed for each site.  The criteria used to set the boundaries of the sites are purely scientific, as is required under the nature directives.  They are designated to protect threatened, rare or endangered species and habitat types, which are listed in the annexes to the directives.  The sites chosen are significant not just on a national but on a European stage.</p> <p>The full process for site designation is set out in SI 477 of 2011, the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  The first step is the identification of the appropriate geographical area of the site.  This is done by scientific analysis.  Once draft boundaries are proposed, the Minister notifies landowners and the public of his intention to designate the site and provides an opportunity for objections or appeals on the proposed site boundaries.  Advertisements are published in local media and notices are displayed in local government offices, Garda stations and public libraries.  Landowners within the proposed site, where their identities are known, are notified directly in writing with detailed information including a map of the site and information about why that site is being proposed for designation and details of compensation that may be available.</p> <p>Connemara Bog Complex was first publicly notified in 1997 to protect a wide range of habitats and species, including active blanket bog and lagoons.  In 2006, the boundaries of the site were amended by agreement between the Government and farming organisations.  Public notifications were again issued and a further opportunity offered to appeal the amended designation.  In total over the full period, 60 objections, or appeals, were received for Connemara Bog Complex.  Of these, nine were successful, 12 were partially successful, 21 were unsuccessful and 18 were deemed invalid.  </p> <p>The appeals process for this site has now concluded and the site has moved on to the final stage of the process which requires the publication of a statutory instrument formally designating the site.  The statutory instrument includes a description of the site, a detailed map showing the area, a complete list of habitats and species for which the area was selected and a list of activities which require the consent of the Minister before they can be undertaken in a way that affects the site.</p> <p>It is important to note that all relevant protections under Irish law apply to the site from the time it is publicly notified as proposed for designation.  A full list of all designated sites, the associated maps and statutory instruments is available on the Department's website.</p></speech>

They have had a very long journey to come up here.  I was in Glandore last summer and it is just such a beautiful part of the world.  We appreciate that they have taken the time to come and join with their Deputy.  I know that the particular topic we are discussing now will of be of particular interest, of course, to their Deputy because his whole portfolio and interest is in the whole area of environmental protection and heritage.  We hope that they have a very interesting day today and the opportunity to come back again at a later stage.  I thank them for joining us.</p> <p>I apologise for interrupting the Senator.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply on behalf of the Department.  It deals quite clearly with the process to date on where we are.  It states that the appeals process is now concluded and the site has moved to the final stages of the process, which requires the publication of the statutory instrument formally designating the site.</p> <p>There is a certainty and I know all areas got protection once the site got candidate status.  However, from reading this, there will be no future opportunities, under what it says here, for any sort of minor appeals or changes to the boundary.  It is something that may be relevant not just in the Connemara Bog Complex, but indeed to all special areas of conservation, SACs, around the country.  As I stated, people accept that SACs are with us and are required under European law and people are learning to live with them, though they are not always happy and I appreciate that.  However, I just would be concerned that this excludes any chance of an appeal into the future.  I hope the Department can keep that in mind.</p></speech>

Over the years, the steps to designate a site have remained the same, but we have been able to improve and streamline the process.  For example, the list of landowners at a site is now provided by the Property Registration Authority of Ireland.  However, we still see that not all property is registered with the Property Registration Authority.  Therefore, in order to be sure every opportunity is given to appeal, advertisements are placed in national and local newspapers and notices are also placed in local public offices.</p> <p>The appeals process is comprehensive.  If people&rsquo;s initial appeal is partly unsuccessful or unsuccessful and they are unhappy with the outcome, they can make a further formal appeal to the designated areas appeals advisory board.  The board is independent of the Department and it is comprised of a chairperson and equal representation from landowners, user groups and environmental conservationists.  This board considers appeals and makes formal recommendations to the Minister on a scientific basis.  No further appeals may be lodged after the appeals process has concluded.  </p> <p>All statutory instruments, designated sites and special areas of conservation made to date may be viewed in both the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and Irish Statue Book websites.  </p> <p>Obviously, the Senator raised a valid point.  My knowledge is not very detailed in this area, but in terms of into the future, if there are areas that may not, should not or potentially should not have an SAC designation, I know from the Department it can be raised at a future date as well, outside of the process that is here, once it has concluded.</p></speech>

At the moment in County Kildare, as with many other counties, we are going through the long and arduous process of the county development plan.  All Members know how difficult it is to get planning for a one-off house or many other types of development.  Unauthorised developments, however, are popping up to a significant extent.  I am speaking in particular about my experience in south Kildare but I have no doubt the same could be true across the country.  I have been working with local councillors on several cases in Rathangan, Newbridge and Kildare town and there is no doubt that we need a more effective system for dealing with unauthorised developments.  The resources of local authorities are stretched very thin.  That is particularly true in Kildare because there is one county council but two D&aacute;il constituencies.  There are issues in respect of enforcement and that is basically what is causing the problems.  We cannot allow unauthorised developments to go unchecked.  In several of the cases to which I refer the developments are causing significant issues for neighbours.  Even after being instructed to stop and having gone through the courts system, some of the developers are continuing to develop their sites.  That is leading to a financially onerous situation for local authorities.  The system we have is costly and inefficient and does not meet the needs of communities.  There is a need for the House to have a debate on this issue.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise relates to public transport.  I welcome the reduction in public transport fares that was announced.  It makes a significant difference for many people.  We need to ensure that all services are affordable, but also reliable.  I refer to the No. 120 Go-Ahead bus route.  It basically starts in Edenderry and goes through Derrinturn, Newbridge, Allenwood and Kilmeague on its way to Dublin.  It sometimes goes through Suncroft as well.  It is a key commuter route but it is not up to scratch.  Signage and so on are a problem.  I have received a commitment that will be fixed.  The route is completely unreliable, however.  People are relying on the service to get to work, college or hospital appointments.  Last Thursday morning, two buses did not show up.  On Friday morning, three buses did not show up.  That forces commuters to take expensive taxis, miss appointments or go to the expense of buying a second car.  It is not acceptable and it will deter people from using public transport.</p> <p>Yesterday, I had the opportunity to bring the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConaloge, around rural County Kildare.  We spoke to farmers and breeders about the challenges they are facing, particularly those in the context of Brexit, climate change and the Ukraine war.  A particular point raised related to fertiliser.  I saw this morning, and it is worth noting, that fertiliser manufacturer Yara International has reported a threefold increase in profitability for the first quarter of 2022 despite a sharp fall in product deliveries.  One could say it is possibly a sixfold increase.  That has to be addressed.</p></speech>

I thank them for their work not just during Covid, but in general.  I acknowledge that the Covid pandemic payment needs to be paid and expedited as a matter of urgency.  I hope the Leader will bring that request from the Seanad back to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  It is important we pay tribute to nurses working in all aspects of healthcare.  </p> <p>I have made my next contribution previously but I want to do so again in light of the potential rise in ECB interest rates and the fact that inflation in this country reached a 22-year high today.  As the world, and Europe in particular, wrestles with the war in Ukraine and our reliance on Russian energy, I am calling for a debate on fiscal policy and budgetary and economic matters as a matter of extreme urgency.  There is the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in the Oireachtas but Seanad &Eacute;ireann can play a role in the framing and preparation of the budget.  Although this House does not have a specific budgetary role under the Constitution, we can facilitate a debate in terms of fiscal policy for October.  I hope that between now and the summer recess the Leader will consider and, perhaps, facilitate a range of debates on economic, budgetary and fiscal matters.  It is important that we do so.  As all present are aware, prices have gone up and people are wrestling with balancing their household or business budgets.</p> <p>Today is an important day for nurses and I hope the House will send a strong message to nurses in all aspects of healthcare that we acknowledge, thank and pay tribute to them.  They are a pivotal and important part of all aspects of healthcare, from public health nursing to hospital care and from elderly care to care for young children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I thank our nurses.

I hope there are future writers among them.  Listowel is famous for its writers.  One of the great writers from Listowel wrote a letter to Brendan Kennelly, who, in turn, had written to one of the people working at the newspaper <i>The Kerryman</i>.  In the early days, Brendan Kennelly was not as good as he became.  He got a letter back stating that in his writings he was making all the right mistakes.  I hope the students in the Gallery all become writers and come back to visit us again soon.  We are delighted they are here and we hope they enjoy their day in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and in Leinster House.</p></speech>

This is the second BAR announcement in recent times.  The impact of these packages is critical, particularly in the context of capital and diversification in the fishing and marine industries.  That is clearly critical not only in parts of Cork and in Donegal but also around the coast.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, which I live beside, received funding in the previous BAR announcement.  That is really important.  We on this island, particularly those of us in the Seanad, do not spend enough time talking about fisheries and the marine.  Perhaps at some stage in the future we might have focused statements on the fishing industry and the challenges that go with it.  I acknowledge and salute the enormous work the Minister has done in that regard.  This scheme is operated by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and all the details of it are on its website.</p> <p>This morning, I received a really nice postcard.  We in Leinster House receive a lot of angry letters but we also receive a lot of nice letters.  This is a little postcard with an image of the Proclamation on the front.  On the back is a thank-you note regarding the debate we had in this House - a very respectful debate, might I add - on the mother and baby homes and illegal adoptions.  It is from a group called the Irish Registered Adoptees.  It does not have an address on it but it came through the post today and I thought it was nice and fitting that it was on this Proclamation postcard, which is clearly bought and not homemade.  I have never seen it before.  It is just an acknowledgement that people are always listening in.  I acknowledge the way in which the Minister for Children , Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth conducted himself and interacted with many of the visitors after the debate that night.  He engaged extensively with a number of the people in the House well into the night, and they really appreciated that.</p> <p>In that context, I call again for a debate on children.  We have spent a lot of time talking about the history of children in care, vulnerable children, displaced children and children disconnected from their parents or families through various circumstances.  At this time, we can learn so much from the past and put into place supports for children.  I am thinking especially of Ukrainian children and education.  The Leader will be aware that I have asked before for a focused debate on education, and I call for it again.  I was reminded of that because there was a segment on "Morning Ireland" about it.  Some Department officials are meeting today to talk about how they will manage and cope with school places in September, specifically in the context of Ukrainian children and the importance of full integration of and support for both them and their parents.  I ask that we have that debate and a focus not only on education but also on play for children because that is critical to their personal development.</p> <p>I call for statements on the latest annual report of the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon.  He has done amazing work.  The Cathaoirleach talks about Seanad reform.  Let us make it real, let us make it relevant and let us bring before the House current reports and discuss and debate them here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-12a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051200002#L00600"><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business: "That No. 17 be taken before No. 1."  No. 17 is the Animal Health and Welfare (Dogs) Bill 2022.  This is legislation on which I have worked closely with the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA.  Many people are familiar with the images of puppies seized at ports or on the border or from illegal puppy farms.  All too often people offer to take the poor mites in, but most people are not aware that animals seized under the Animal Health and Welfare Act cannot be rehomed either until the dog is surrendered voluntarily by the owner or until the legal proceedings conclude.  That means that puppies, after receiving whatever essential veterinary care they need, must remain in either foster homes or, worse, in the animal shelter.  This means that they could be nearly two years old before they have a permanent loving home to go to.  This also places a significant financial burden on the rescue organisations, which is often not recovered in court decisions and is being used by the illegal dog smugglers to drain the resources of those organisations.  My Bill seeks to bring the Animal Health and Welfare Act in line with the Control of Dogs Act in order that dogs seized under the Control of Dogs Act, if they are found roaming or are unlicensed, can be rehomed after five days if they are not claimed.  My Bill would allow for those dogs seized under the Animal Health and Welfare Act to be rehomed after five days, subject to a veterinarian deeming it to be in the best interest of the animal's welfare.</p> <p>Another element of the Bill would align the microchipping law and the dog licensing laws.  Currently, a dog licence can be obtained online very easily.  In some cases, criminals use dog licences to retrospectively claim ownership of dogs that have been seized.  My Bill will make it mandatory for the licence to include the microchip of the dog in addition to the current requirement of a description.  In addition, it would mean that the local authorities would continue to get the revenue from dog licensing, which they absolutely need.  It would also help to raise awareness among dog owners that they are required by law not only to have their animals microchipped but also to have the details on the microchip kept up to date.  Many people, including very responsible dog owners, are unaware that their dogs might still be registered to the breeder or to a previous owner.  Given the devastation we know families go through when their dogs are stolen or go missing, up-to-date microchip information is the single most important tool in reuniting a beloved family pet with its family.</p> <p>I hope the House will accept my amendment to the Order of Business and that we will soon have an opportunity to bring this Bill to Second Stage.  This is notwithstanding the wonderful work that organisations such as the DSPCA and Dogs Trust do.  I thank the DSPCA for all its support on the Bill.  No dog should spend a day longer than is absolutely necessary in a shelter.</p></speech>

It comes on the back of a number of reports from both Daft and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, which show that rents in the country are rising exponentially.  They are a huge contributor to the cost-of-living crisis.  They are up 11% nationwide.  In particular, there is a real worry in the north west, where the rent on a lot of homes that are not in rent pressure zones has gone up by nearly 20%.  The issue is very concentrated there.  The Daft report highlights in particular the lack of rental properties that are available and coming onto the market for people to move into.  That indicates a big problem with supply.  To my mind, the way to address this supply crisis is to invest in cost-rental housing, which we know is more linked to affordability than other forms of housing.  Instead the Government launched yesterday the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund, which essentially gives a no-questions-asked subsidy to developers in order to complete apartment buildings in towns and cities.  The subsidy, potentially, can be &euro;120,000 per apartment.  Only &euro;5 million will be allocated to the fund this year, but the amount involved will eventually rise to &euro;500 million.  That money would be much better invested in and spent on better the development of cost-rental housing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to look at this as a longer-term project.  Countries such as Germany or Austria have done so, where they reinvest the money from rents in providing cost-rental housing and build other housing.  It is not the answer to give developers subsidies in order to build housing.  While we have a supply crisis, the way to address that is through State and Government intervention, not through incentivising developers.  We know what happened when that last happened.  </p><p>I want to raise the issue of build-to-rent standards.  We have supply coming on.  For example, there has been a supply of approximately four years within Dublin that has not yet commenced.  While I am not against build-to-rent, because I do not see anything wrong with the tenure of people renting, I do have a problem with the affordability.  We also need to be building stock that will last into the future.  This is because it requires an awful lot of carbon to build that stock.</p><p>I live in a very small house of 40 sq m.  One of the things we need in our very small house is storage, because we are planning on living there for a long time.  Unfortunately, in build-to-rent apartments there is not adequate storage, there are not adequate balconies and they are not buildings that we could see in 50 years being developed into housing that is still there and operational.  They are just boxes.  I understand that the Government needs and wants to bring supply.  This is welcome, but we need to make sure that such housing can last into the future and for hundreds of years. </p></speech>

At the time, I genuinely thought it was unique to have cases of hepatitis in Ireland.  Today it was reported on RT&Eacute; News that unfortunately, a young child has died from hepatitis.  Another young child needs a liver transplant due to hepatitis.  In the case in Labre Park that I was speaking about, and in many other cases, there are people living in marginalised accommodations and in horrible living conditions within many communities.  I have seen outbreaks of hepatitis A in Wexford, Carlow and on both sides of Dublin.</p> <p>Not only am I nervous, but all of Ireland is also now nervous about the welfare of children in respect of hepatitis.  It is a conversation that we need to have as soon as possible in this House.  The Minister needs to come in to update us on the information he has and to outline how we can put services in place.  There is a stigma and a shame that comes with hepatitis and now, more than ever, we need to have these conversations.  I note the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, has reported 450 cases worldwide.  I would like to get information from the Minister for Health about this.  This has not been in Ireland just for the last number of months but to the best of my knowledge, it has been here since before January 2021.  It is important that we get this conversation going about hepatitis in our country now, as soon as possible.  </p></speech>

The Taoiseach was the first guest speaker to make a speech.  He had a question-and-answer session with the organisers directly afterwards, which has already been covered by the national media this morning. </p> <p>The Taoiseach pointed out that the climate change challenges are very stark.  We need a debate and an update on this.  We do lots of talking about it, put in carbon budgets and so on but yet, how do we implement all these things?  How do we make sure we are making our move to active travel and to public transport?  We heard Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin complaining about people trying to use public transport and then the bus does not turn up.  People are trying to retrofit their houses and they cannot find plumbers or people to do updated heating systems.  They cannot get windows.  They cannot get retrofitting for insulation and so on.</p> <p>We therefore need not just a single-session debate but rather a series of debates to deal with the idea of climate change, with just transition and with the different sectors.  The debate should address how we are dealing with it in agriculture, how we are dealing with in housing and how we are dealing with in transport.  The challenges are stark and urgent and while everyone says that we must do it, we are not all doing it.  We are perhaps not in a position to do it.  This is about how we move to the new economy and about the circular economy discussion, which is about reusing, reducing and recycling.</p> <p>All those points are really important matters we should debate in this House.  There is an urgency to it, particularly in the context of rising energy prices.  Fuel is getting more expensive but if we can manage to reduce people's fuel use that will save them money.  Equally, people may not initially have the funds to provide for the construction themselves.  Therefore, we need to be looking at how we can front-load the construction and then people can pay it back to their ESB bills or pay it back in other ways.  There are also grants needed from the carbon tax and so on.</p> <p>We need an urgency in this House.  We need to take on board Mary Robinson&rsquo;s challenge to us at the launch of the Seanad100 programme to take ownership of this topic.  The sooner we have debate on the urgency of climate change in its broadest form, the better.</p> <p>I know that I am out of time, but I also seek an update on how we are getting on with our new Ukrainian people.  I have met people who have found them in retail and in hairdressers.  They have been really impressed with their willingness to be involved and to integrate into the community and in schools.  We might get an update on how we are doing on that soon.  </p></speech>

We now have 29,000 Ukrainians living in Ireland.  Many of these are children who are going to school and who have little English.  There is also a quite a number of Ukrainians who were teachers in Ukraine.  They have good English and are working in schools doing translation.  Yet, it has come to my attention over the past few days that, so far, they have not been paid.  The convoluted process to recognise their qualifications through the Teaching Council is causing them a huge amount of distress.  Some of them are in a situation where they cannot get certain documentation from Ukraine for reasons that are clearly obvious.  Yet, the Teaching Council is not showing any flexibility.  The paperwork is complicated and convoluted.  These people are in the schools and are providing support for the school community.  Vitally, they are acting as a communication link between the children and the teachers.  When will the Teaching Council cop itself on, reduce the red tape and resolve this problem?  Will these teachers get their back payment to the day that they started teaching?  They could easily go off and get jobs and cafes or in the hospitality industry, which badly needs them, but their top priority is to do what they are trained to do, that is, teaching and ensuring that the children who have come here from Ukraine get every possible opportunity to learn and to be happy.  When you have hundreds of Ukrainian people, mostly women, in our schools who providing supports for nothing, because they are not getting paid, that is not acceptable.  I would appreciate a debate on this, or at least a query to the Minister's office about whether they will get their backdated payments and when the Teaching Council will cop itself on.  </p></speech>

A payment of &euro;35 for a 24-hour duty is hardly an incentive to stay.  There are talks commencing with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, with respect to the current pay round because of inflation etc.  For years, the Department of Defence and the Minister have dithered on whether they would allow affiliation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

The Commission on the Defence Forces, which was established by the Government and the report of which was given to the Minister last February, recommends that it be allowed to affiliate, but still no decision has been made.  This is nonsense.  It is a simple stroke of a pen by the Minister.  I ask the Leader to write to the Minister to ask him if he would please make a decision, once and for all, and allow these people to have the same parity of esteem when it comes to negotiating on pay.</p><p>The second issue relates to Hong Kong and the human rights abuses taking place there on a daily basis.  Yesterday, a Catholic archbishop was arrested in Hong Kong.  Could we organise to have a debate on the situation in Hong Kong?  I am fully aware of the sensitivities of anything to do with China, but we cannot sit on our hands and allow human rights abuses to take place in any part of the world purely because there are a couple of tonnes of beef on the other side of the equation.  We just cannot do that.  I ask the Leader if she would be willing to hold a debate on human rights, specifically in the context of Hong Kong.</p></speech>

If so, I apologise for bringing it up again.  We learned recently that householders are paying &euro;250 more for electricity than the EU average.  We are told by journalists like Charlie Weston and others involved in the media, including Daragh Cassidy of <i>bonkers.ie</i>, that our electricity prices are between 26% and 28% higher than the EU average.  Only a small number of countries, Denmark, Germany and Belgium, have more expensive energy prices.  We must bear in mind that those figures, which show an enormous difference, were published before the war in Ukraine.  We have a major issue here with the cost of electricity.  That is despite the fact that there are 12 electricity suppliers in this country, which is high number for an island of this size, but we still seem to have a significant issue with the cost.  On average, most families will pay &euro;800 or &euro;900 a year more annually for electricity.  That will be a shocking weight around the necks of many families in the coming months and years if the war does not come to an end.  The war is not helping the situation.  I ask that we have the Minister in here, not to fire arrows at him but for a constructive debate.  We can all come up with new ideas on why electricity costs so much more in this country.  I always make the point that we are part of the EU, but we are an island off Europe and providing anything in an island country is always more expensive, but, nevertheless, there is a stark difference in electricity prices, and the Government needs to investigate the matter.</p></speech>

I often raise many of the issues that are going on at University Hospital Limerick and how the staff are working in horrific circumstances, but I pay tribute to them because they work every hour when they are at work, and they give it their all to make sure that the patients and everybody within the hospital have a very safe experience.  They are so committed to their jobs.  I pay tribute to them because it is important to acknowledge the hard work they put in.  Many nurses work in nursing home settings or in health centres.  They are very committed, and they undertake the upskilling and training they require over many years.  I pay tribute to them and wish them all the best in the future.</p></speech>

It is two years, one month and one day since they lost their jobs in such a shameful way.  Last month, I stated in this Chamber that we had a lot of honeyed words back in the spring and summer of 2020 and that we have yet to see any substantive action from the Government.  There have been many promises with regard to the employment law review group, but we have yet to see anything from it.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Moynihan, referred to the Daft report.  Rents have increased by more than 11%.  The Labour Party introduced a living wage Bill this week to ensure that we move all minimum wage workers to a living income over the next three years.</p> <p>Many are listening to the debate on the national maternity hospital.  They see it as a bubble debate.  We all want to see a new national maternity hospital built as soon as possible.  It is important to state for the record, however, that I very much believe this is a lousy deal.  I am conscious that the scrutiny by the Legislature will be complete as of today.  Once what is proposed passes through the Joint Committee on Health, it will go to the Cabinet next week unchanged.  Ultimately, this will be a public-private hospital.  It will be privately influenced because there are three private directors who will decide the chair in three years' time.  The key issue of why we are in this place is because the State has failed.  The Government has not had the courage to make the site the subject of a compulsory purchase order in order to put it up to St. Vincent's.  This is a hospital that receives millions of euro every year under a service level agreement.  The questions that we have about why St. Vincent's so desperately wants this site and how it intends to use its ownership of the site into the future will only be answered in time.  It is a real shame, however, that we are going to see a new hospital on this site that is not going to be developed as a full public hospital but that will instead be a public-private hospital.</p></speech>

Hundreds of people were there and wanted to give their views on what we, as a Government, could do to support them.  It was a listening exercise for us.  As a party, we have always prided ourselves on representing rural Ireland and farmers.  Many people from my county were there.  In that context, could I ask that we have a debate on rural Ireland and farming because we are the party that created the Department of Rural and Community Development under the then Minister, Deputy Ring.  The current Minister is Deputy Humphreys.  When we look to support rural Ireland, it is through that Department as well as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Both can help to enhance regions like mine in Tipperary.  We have been fortunate to have many schemes, such at the town and village renewal scheme, the rural regeneration scheme and a new scheme for the improvement and development of community halls.  Could we have a debate with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, on the schemes that are available to rural communities such as those in my county of Tipperary and what there can be done in the future?  Representatives from a number of villages and communities have already come to me to ask if they can make applications in respect of the community hall scheme.  There is &euro;15 million available.  That money will be gobbled up very quickly in view of the number of villages that are interested in the scheme.  In future, we will need to put more money into it.</p> <p>Rural Ireland needs to be supported.  It has been supported by Fine Gael in the past.  It needs to be in the future.  In every single recession we have had in this country, it has been rural Ireland and agriculture that have helped us to recover.  It was no different ten years ago in the context of the most recent recession.  I ask that we get a chance before the recess in July to have the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, come before the House to outline her plans to get as much money as possible in the budget for rural Ireland.</p></speech>

There is particular risk for Members of the Oireachtas participating in these visits.  I am concerned about depleted uranium, which is a by-product of nuclear enrichment after uranium-235 is extracted.  The remnant uranium is widely used as armour and on the tips of projectiles, missiles and bullets by both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries.  I am conscious of that when I look at the pictures from Ukraine.</p> <p>Wherever one sees a burnt-out vehicle or a building that has been destroyed, there will be massive amounts of depleted uranium present in the environment.  It is a highly toxic contaminant.  It is used as a hardened projectile or a penetrating tip but when it hits the target with the kinetic energy that is provided it oxidises and generates millions of microscopic particles of depleted uranium that are invisible to the human eye.  They are very persistent, because they are heavy, and they will remain in the location of the strike for years.  If a person were to pose next to a vehicle and brush off it or accidentally touch it or even go into a building or inside a burnt-out vehicle to have a look, there is a possibility that the person may inhale one or two of these particles or even ingest them.  One particle inhaled would be the equivalent of having a chest X-ray every day for the rest of one's life.  It is associated with multiple tumours in the lungs, oesophagus and the digestive tract.  These weapons have proliferated and the calibres have gone down so it is very commonplace in the environment.</p> <p>I advise all Members of the Oireachtas, and I do not know who is travelling out there, to seek health and safety advice about how to prepare for a visit.  There are certain things one should and should not do.  The United Nations Training School Ireland in the Curragh used to provide such training days, and I used to contribute to those.  If anybody is travelling and has a concern, I would be delighted to meet him or her, have a cup of coffee and give a few very useful tips for travelling to a hostile environment, particularly one that is contaminated in this way.  Is there any way of communicating this to our colleagues in the D&aacute;il who may not be listening to this or hear it?  It is a very pressing concern.</p></speech>

Given your experience, it is always important to learn from experts and people who have such knowledge, as you do.  Obviously, we are in discussions with the Defence Forces and we are getting a briefing from them in advance, but the topic you raise is a very practical issue in terms of avoiding all elements of harm and I will share that with the Ceann Comhairle.

Overnight, we see the arrest of Cardinal Joseph Zen as an expansion of that crackdown on those who were involved in the 2019 pro-democracy demonstrations.  It is another indication, as if we needed it, of Beijing in particular and, through Beijing, the Hong Kong Administration's absolute determination to suppress any discussion, opposition or political freedom of expression.  It is tremendously important that Ireland takes a stand on this and makes it known to Beijing and Hong Kong that it is not acceptable and that Ireland is absolutely opposed to that type of behaviour.  I hope we can do that and perhaps, if it is possible, we can invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House to discuss that subject as well.</p><p>This morning I had the pleasure of going to my <i>alma mater</i>, St. Laurence College in Loughlinstown, which is hosting a community day.  There was a fantastic atmosphere with lots of community organisations there.  They included local sports clubs such as St. Joseph's soccer club in Sallynoggin, Cuala GAA from Dalkey and the Leinster Rugby women's academy with their rugby skills.  Emily McKeown, the women's development officer, and Ailsa Hughes, an Irish international scrum half, were showing the skills to young girls and boys from St. Laurence's and the surrounding area and exposing them to rugby.  I had a conversation with them and I was struck by how little they are resourced in real terms in helping women's sports advance in this country.  There is a misconception that somehow there is a greater interest in men-only sports and they therefore get attention that is beyond what is reasonable.  There is a growing interest in women's sports, particularly international rugby.  I was at some of the international matches this year and they are every bit as competitive, if not more so.  They are very well attended and they are great events.</p><p>Could we have a debate about what resources the State is specifically targeting at women's sports, internationally and professionally or semi-professionally, and also women's participation in sport, which is well below the level at which it should be?  We should be pushing for a much stronger agenda for women's sport in this country and we should invite the Minister to the House for a discussion on that subject.</p></speech>

Market rents are at a record high, with inflation close to record rates since 2005.  The average market rent per month rose from just over &euro;1,400 a year ago to &euro;1,567 in the first quarter of 2022.  This level of rent is over twice the low of &euro;765 per month of just over a decade ago in late 2011.  It is more than 50% higher than the Celtic tiger economy peak of &euro;1,030 per month in the first quarter of 2008.  That is an astounding figure.  I doubt that the people walking in the streets of Dublin would say that it feels like we are back in the Celtic tiger economy by any other metric.</p> <p>However, sky-high rents are not the only prong of the fork poking the Irish people.  The availability of new rental homes has utterly collapsed since 2019.  On 1 May this year, there were 850 homes available to rent nationwide.  That is down 77% year on year and, frankly, is an unprecedented number in a series extending back to the start of 2006.  The average number of homes available to rent nationwide at any given point in time over the 15-year period from 2006 to 2021 was nearly 9,200, which is over ten times the supply available today.  Granted this figure does not account for the rentals offered by multi-unit rentals but ,even so, the current analysis by Daft predicts that there are not enough multi-unit rental developments, perhaps only a few hundred homes, to overturn the extraordinary tightening in rental supply in the traditional rental market.</p> <p>The release of this report is timely as it coincides with the conclusion of the Housing Commission's conference on a referendum on housing in Ireland.  Nobody has mentioned that in this House over the last number of days.  On that front, I find myself agreeing with my colleague, Senator McDowell, and I understand the frustration that this was caused by the failure of successive Governments to tackle the housing crisis.  I am sympathetic to those who would seek recourse through the Judiciary through the enforcement of a constitutional right to housing, but I believe that the implementation of a solution to this crisis is the remit of the Executive and that is where the pressure must be applied.</p></speech>

Every year for the past 48 years the families of the victims have been searching for answers as to who was behind the awful atrocity that occurred in 1974.  An investigation is currently under way.  It is headed by Mr. Jon Boucher, a former chief constable in the UK.  His team is seeking documentation from both the British and Irish authorities.  We have been pleading with the British Government for years to hand over documents, but that has fallen on deaf ears to date.  Thankfully, the security service, MI5, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and the Minister for Defence are now co-operating with Mr. Boucher's investigation, known as Operation Kenova.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What is disappointing is that, to date, the Garda has not handed over any documents whatsoever regarding this investigation.  That is considerably disappointing for the families of the victims.  I understand that the Garda's interpretation of whether this is called an investigation or review is part of the problem.  It is difficult that although the terms of reference were signed off on this some time ago by Mr. Drew Harris, the Garda Commissioner, we are still in a limbo with regard to whether we call what is happening an investigation or a review.  Quite frankly, for the families who have been waiting 48 years, that is simply not good enough.</p><p>I ask the Leader to ask the relevant Minister to come to the House at the earliest opportunity to tell us the exact cause of the problem and the delay, and why the terms of reference that were signed off on have become an issue.  I would be grateful if the Leader could do this as a matter of urgency because the families of the victims have been waiting 48 years for answers.  That is far too long.</p></speech>

The hospital building dates from the 1930s.  There are two wards, one with 15 rooms.  Women going into labour are separated by a curtain and there is one toilet.  We walked around the hospital and noted that the corridors are too narrow to take beds.  Beds cannot be fitted into the lifts.</p> <p>Portiuncula University Hospital, Ballinasloe, dates to the 1940s.  We fought so hard to get a 50-bed unit across the line two years ago.  It took ten to 15 years to do so.  It has still not been built.  It is at stage 2, thank God, and will be built, but we needed that hospital 20 years ago.  The women of Ireland needed a new national maternity hospital 20 years ago.  It is not good enough to say that the quality of life entailed is acceptable for women or that we have to pause.  There are valid concerns among women.</p> <p>We need to have very clear guidelines on the 299-year lease and the fact that the new hospital will provide services.  There are letters, signed by more than 400 clinicians from around the country and also England, about the services that will be provided at our new national maternity hospital, which involves a multimillion euro investment.  The conditions in which women are currently having their babies are incredible.  One member of the senior team I met this morning said women who must deal with certain medical procedures must also deal with the crisis of losing a baby.  Bereaved women, who have just experienced one of the biggest losses in their lives, must go in and out the same door as those going in to have their babies.</p> <p>We have to have a duty of care to women.  We have to have equality of care, and this State must deliver that.  It should have delivered it years ago.  The State needs to deliver it now.  It is not enough to say we can wait longer.  We need to have the support of the Government to move the project forward, and we need to deliver the services for women.  I want to ensure that our Government is taking all the steps necessary to provide reassurance to people who have valid concerns.  We know from our clinical experts and the legal team who spoke to us this morning and previously that there are concerns to be met.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann needs to say it is delivering services for women in Ireland - services we can stand over.  Right now, we cannot stand over them.</p></speech>

I have in mind a piece of infrastructure extending from Longford towards Ballaghaderreen, with which Senator Murphy would be very familiar.  It bypasses Strokestown.  I refer to the N5, which has been the subject of problems because Roadbridge went into receivership.  The project may well have to be retendered for.  There are problems now.  The Leader might like to organise a debate on infrastructure.  The infrastructure in question is very important to the west; it is the gateway to the west.

Pete has a claim to fame other than playing football for Kerry: in May 1969, he was asked to cut the hair of Charles de Gaulle, no less, after the latter had resigned as President of France.  The whole world was looking for de Gaulle.  He was staying in Reen-Na-Furraha.  Our good friend Pete Hanley was asked not only to cut his hair but to shave him as well.  They had a great conversation.  He relayed the conversation but is now a State secret and will not be released until the remainder of the time covered by the 100-year rule is up.

May the Cathaoirleach enjoy the anniversary on Saturday.</p> <p>Senator Paddy Burke was seeking a debate on infrastructure, particularly in the west.  There is a standing request in Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a debate on the national development plan.  I will chase that up again today.</p> <p>Senator Dolan recounted her tour of Holles Street hospital this morning.  The building has been creaking at the seams for decades.  Patches and short-term alterations do not cut the mustard.  The need is no doubt glaring to every single one of us, but what needs to be put on the record - we all have varying opinions on the proposed new hospital - is the tremendous service that the women and men who work in what is an antiquated building give the women of Ireland in all their work.</p> <p>On the matter raised by Senator Gallagher, I will send a letter to the Minister for Justice asking her to talk to the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Harris, to find out the reason for the delay with regard to defining what is happening as a review or an investigation.  If a redefinition by the Minister is required and directions need to be issued by the Garda Commissioner, these should be done sooner rather than later seeing that the 48th anniversary is approaching very soon.</p> <p>Senators Keogan and Moynihan asked for a debate on the latest Daft report.  I will organise it in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Senators Ward and Craughwell asked for a debate on Hong Kong, particularly on the human rights abuses that we hear of.  I will organise that.</p> <p>What Senator Clonan compassionately raised is so concerning.  I was certainly not aware of it.  I was not near anywhere that was being bombed, thankfully, but quite a number of our colleagues have been.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue and sharing his knowledge.  We got briefings on security and all local issues, but what was raised was certainly not in my briefing.  However, I was not going to Ukraine.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter in the House today and for his offer of assistance to anybody else going.</p> <p>Senator Ahearn talked about the rural conference and looked for a debate on rural Ireland and regeneration.  I will organise that as soon as I can.</p> <p>Senator Sherlock spoke about the former Debenhams workers outside the House today and the Bill that will be before the D&aacute;il next week.</p> <p>Senators Maria Byrne and Buttimer both paid tribute to our nursing fraternity today, the International Nurses Day.  Nurses' lifelong commitment not only to the patients they look after but also to their own educational resources is second to none.</p> <p>Senator Murphy sought a debate on energy prices and the absolutely crazy variations highlighted to us this week by the media.  Ireland is paying a rate that is 26% higher than the EU average.  It certainly needs an explanation.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell sought a debate on Hong Kong but also sought the affiliations of our Defence Forces' members.  I will write to the Minister today to ask him to make a decision on that and let us know about it in the House.</p> <p>Senator Conway spoke about the Teaching Council, but the matter is not unique to the council.  For example, the medical practitioners legislation requires amendment so we can allow our trained, skilled, new refugees to work and use their skills in Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will certainly bring that to the attention of the Cabinet sub-committee.  There are a number of pieces of officialdom that need to be sorted out to help our people to integrate.</p><p>Senator Horkan spoke of coming from the Dublin climate summit and asked for a rolling series of debates on climate change and the updates that are happening.  I will organise that.  Senator Flynn spoke to us about the absolutely horrendous recent reports on the rise of hepatitis in Ireland and the substandard accommodation that is probably feeding into the increase.  I will ask the Minister for an update and request a debate and come back on it.</p><p>Senator Moynihan looked for a debate on the Daft report.  Senator Boylan outlined her dog Bill the full Title of which I did not catch.  However, the merits of the Bill which she described absolutely warrant support and I wish her every success with it and hope to God to debate it here shortly.</p><p>Senator Boyhan spoke about the &euro;45 million food and marine fund announced this week by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  He sought a debate on fishing and also on children.  Senator Buttimer spoke about the ECB interest rate increases and the fact that unfortunately we are experiencing a 22-year high in inflation rates.  He sought a range of debates on economic and budgetary matters.  I will organise that.</p><p>Senator O'Loughlin opened today's debate talking about the scourge of unauthorised developments which I know is not unique to Kildare and we should have a more effective system of enforcement.  She also talked about the unreliability of some of our service providers in the public transport sector and sought assurances that there would be better services, particularly given that we as a nation are trying to encourage people to get out of their cars and onto public transport.  I will see if we can organise that debate.</p></speech>

It is important that the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, who are keenly interested in and strong advocates for local government, have an opportunity to air their views on a recent television programme that examined a wide range of matters in local authorities.  The report at issue is the "RT&Eacute; Investigates: Council Chamber Secrets" programme broadcast on Wednesday, 23 March 2022.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The programme cited a specific number of cases in local authorities which it used to identify issues of governance and a lack of accountability and transparency within the local government system.  The irony is that the programme makers relied to a significant degree on the findings, work and diligence of the Local Government Audit Service in making their programme.  Many of the cases highlighted in the programme were identified from the Local Government Audit Service reports and management letters issued to local authorities in the course of the annual audit and the remainder through investigations and reports.  I would argue that the reporting of these audit issues by the Local Government Audit Service is an example of the positive impact that service is having on systems and procedures in local authorities.</p><p>The programme also highlighted instances where disciplinary proceedings were pursued by local authorities against members of staff and reports referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  It is, in my view, correct that details of such cases would not be put in the public domain for reasons of natural justice but also in case doing so would prejudice any Garda investigation.</p><p>Article 28A of the Constitution recognises the role of local government in providing "a forum for the democratic representation of communities, in exercising and performing at local level powers and functions conferred by law".  Local authorities are entirely independent corporate entities.  Their constitutional basis gives them responsibility under the law for the performance of their functions, the discharge of their governance and other responsibilities.  As the House will be aware, democratically elected councils are responsible for reserve functions, that is, those functions which are reserved for the elected council acting by majority resolution.  These include passing an annual budget, housing policy decisions and policies on environmental protection, among many others.  A key role of elected councils is the governance and oversight of their local authority, including in relation to risk and audit practices and holding the chief executive and his or her officials to account.  These reserve functions are set down in law.  Everyone in the House will agree that elected councils and individual councillors take this governance role very seriously.  The Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, local authorities and councillors work hard to ensure they are equipped and fully trained to fulfil this role.</p><p>As Minister of State with responsibility for local government and planning, I am responsible for policy, legislation, Oireachtas accountability and, at a broad level, oversight in respect of the local government system.  It is not my role to step in to a local authority to fulfil the governance role of the elected council.  That said, my Department, working with local government stakeholders, is currently developing a code of governance framework for local authorities.  The aim of this framework will be to encourage improved accountability by establishing a benchmark for aspects of good governance resulting in a culture of better service delivery overall.  It will offer guidance to officials, the elected council and other stakeholders on their governance obligations and responsibilities.</p><p>I also wish to mention the Local Government Reform Act 2014 which dealt substantively with accountability arrangements and further strengthened governance in all local authorities.  The Act reinforced the operation of the audit committees in local authorities and established the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC.  Among other matters, audit committees review financial and budgetary reporting practices and procedures within local authorities.  They also review any audited financial statement, auditor's report or auditor's special report in relation to a local authority and assess actions taken by the chief executive in response.  NOAC is the national independent oversight body for the local government sector in Ireland.  NOAC's functions cover all local authority activities and involve the scrutiny of performance generally and financial performance specifically.  NOAC also has a role in supporting best practice, overseeing the implementation of national and local government policy and public service reform by local government bodies.</p><p>In February 2017, NOAC, in accordance with its statutory functions, began a review of the performance of individual local authorities.  This is a two-stage process of meetings between NOAC and the local authority, the minutes and presentations from which are all published.  Stage one typically involves face-to-face meetings with the chief executive and some of the management team with the chair of NOAC and the secretariat.  The stage two meeting is an opportunity for the local authority to meet the full board of NOAC and respond to any questions it may have on the local authority and its operations.  To date NOAC has completed 18 of these two-stage processes and the reports on these meetings are published on the NOAC website.  These processes will continue in 2022.  Representatives of NOAC periodically attend the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to discuss its annual reports and annual performance indicator reports.</p><p>The RT&Eacute; programme also made reference to a 2012 critical review on merging the Comptroller and Auditor General's office with the Local Government Audit Service.  This review arose in the context of the Government's overall approach to the rationalisation of State agencies at the time.  The then Government decided in October 2012 that the proposed merger should not proceed.  That decision recognised that these Houses have set down a system which regulates the affairs of local government, including by providing a separate system of auditing procedures for ensuring an open and public consideration of audit issues.  It also recognised the constitutional position of local government and addressed the legitimate question of the appropriateness of the Oireachtas overseeing the performance of an independent sector with its own system of democratic accountability and oversight.</p><p>The Local Government Audit Service has a very strong working relationship with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Since the review in 2012, arrangements have been put in place for enhanced co-operation between the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Local Government Audit Service, having regard to differences in scale and the relative priorities of the two organisations.  The director of the Local Government Audit Service also appears regularly before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to discuss the work of the audit service and will do so again in the coming days.  </p><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for facilitating today's important discussion.  I look forward to hearing the views of Members during this afternoon's debate.</p></speech>

I am not sure who requested this debate.  It is an important debate but I do not believe the Senator who requested it is in the House, which is a shame.  If Senators request debates, they should be in the House when those debates take place in order to contribute.</p> <p>While this discussion on local authorities and the investigation that was carried by RT&Eacute; is important, it cannot cloud the fact that local authorities right across this country do excellent work on a daily basis.  There will always be errors, omissions and bad practices in every organisation and we must put structures in place to minimise the risks but we must acknowledge the excellent work done, not only by councillors across the country but also by the executives and employees of local authorities.  </p> <p>I was elected to Waterford City and County Council in 2009 at the age of 21 and was proud to represent the council as mayor on two occasions.  The diligent work that I saw during my time on the council, over 11 or 12 years, was exceptional.  I saw nothing short of absolute dedication and commitment to the people the council serves and that applies to every section of the local authority.</p> <p>I will now address some of the criticisms levelled in the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme, one of which was the toothless nature of the auditor.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We would not be here having this discussion today if it were not for the Local Government Audit Service identifying these issues and irregularities right across the country.  In one sense, therefore, you have to say that the system is working, in that it is able to identify them.  However, the follow-on criticism was the sanction was not there to fit the &ldquo;crime&rdquo;.  In one sense, I understand that criticism because I raised concerns on my own council in Waterford in relation to credit cards and the volume of prepaid credit cards that were in existence within the local authority.  That was one of the issues that was ultimately identified in this "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme in respect of one employee.  It had been highlighted by the auditor.  The follow-on nature is something we have to look at as a Government.</p><p>The programme also cited issues regarding investigation reports not being published.  The Minister of State has referenced the concerns about ongoing investigations, as well as prejudicing any cases that might come forward to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a later point.  This is something that obviously has to be put on record.  </p><p>In the last minute that I have, I will make reference to the NOAC reports the Minister of State highlighted in his contribution.  They are excellent.  They provide an image of where every local authority is on all of the indicators across housing, environment, roads, transport and so on.  It is good to be able to compare local authorities around the country and how they are stacking up in averages.</p><p>The issue that I have in relation to the NOAC reports is their timing.  We discuss a NOAC report nearly two years after the fact, because of the timing.  This is because the reports for the previous year come nearly a year into the following year.  Therefore, they are nearly out of date by the time they are being discussed, albeit they do show trends.  It would be far more effective were the NOAC reports finished and completed in early course at the end of the year.  Then, we could discuss the previous year by May or June of the following year.  This is not the case at the moment.  Perhaps that is something that the Minister of State can take on board.  The work that the auditors carry out is very valuable for public representatives, so that they are able to see what is working well, where it is going well and how we can replicate good practice.   In addition, it shows them what is going wrong in their local authority and where they have to put measures in place to rectify that.  Perhaps that is something the Minister of State can take on board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-12a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051200002#T00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Seanad today to discuss local government.  I do not know who requested this debate but I always welcome the opportunity to talk about local government.  It is right here in my heart.  I was first elected in 2004 to the country's largest local authority, Dublin City Council.  I do not think there can be any greater honour than to be elected to represent your local community.</p> <p>Today's debate, as I understand it, was triggered by an "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme.  We are talking about local government, about governance and about media coverage of those matters.  Our role as legislators also comes into the discussion.  When we are talking about local government it is important that we first and foremost recognise it as a cornerstone of our democracy.  We need to recognise and acknowledge that local government is made up of 31 local authorities with more than 949 elected representatives from their local communities.  There are 30,000 employees in local authorities around the country.  They have the responsibility for championing local communities and for championing and defending local democracy.  They do that through delivering services, which include everything from the most utilitarian services such as sewerage and waste management, as well as housing, planning and traffic.  They also include culture, such as our parks, our libraries and our local community festivals.  This weekend, in the constituency in which I live, Phizzfest, which is supported by Dublin City Council, will be held in Phibsborough while in the north inner city, there is the Five Lamps Arts Festival.</p> <p>All around the country, in the 31 local authorities, local authorities support local communities to deliver and to sustain one another.  They ensure to a large extent community cohesion, as well as the healthy, vibrant communities that can be found in all of our local authorities.  They are funded to the tune of &euro;5 billion a year.  That is a significant amount of funding.  It is appropriate that our local authorities should be funded to that level and I probably would argue for more funding and some more autonomy for our local authorities.  They are independent corporate entities, established under the Constitution.  You cannot get greater authority in our State than to be established under Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, which they are.  It is from that authority that they conduct and carry out their responsibilities.</p> <p>One of their key responsibilities, and the elected representatives work with the executives on this, is to ensure that there is good governance.  I believe that all councillors and all executive functions - or the vast majority of them at least, allowing for the human failings - take their governance responsibilities extremely seriously and diligently.  Not only do they take them seriously, in my experience they go beyond what is required under legislation.  </p> <p>While the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme had the title, the &ldquo;Council Chamber Secrets&rdquo;, these were not secrets.  These were publicly documented failings documented by the Local Government Audit Service.  That is right and that proves to us and to the public that the Local Government Audit Service is doing its job.  Each local authority has an audit committee.  The executives and the councillors work together to ensure that the highest of standards are achieved.  That is as it should be.  The Local Government Audit Service, and NOAC as the Minister of State mentioned, work to support the local authorities to catch where standards fall below what they should be, to identify those failings and to trigger corrective actions.</p> <p>What the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" story did was not actually reveal any secrets of the chamber, but it amplified what was already public knowledge and what was already publicly documented, and rightly so.  I say all of that not to in any way belittle the issues, because anybody who saw the programme would be upset.  I know from talking to the Fianna F&aacute;il councillors from the local authorities around the country that they were really upset by it.  They are upset because these are people who give of their time to go out, to get elected and to represent their local communities in order that they can do the best for their local communities and to ensure that the local authority delivers for their local communities.  This tarnishes everything that the local authority does.</p> <p>At any time in an organisation when there is a failure to achieve the highest for standards or when standards fall below that which should be expected and should be delivered, that reflects badly.  I know from speaking to the Fianna F&aacute;il councillors in Waterford, Clare, Mayo, Cork and in the other local authorities that have been mentioned, that this really upset them.  It is important that they have the support of the Minister of State&rsquo;s office, of the Department and of the Local Government Audit Service.</p> <p>When these issues are identified, there should be follow-through.  I accept, as do most reasonable people, that where an issue has been referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and where it is before the courts, that has to follow due process.  Everybody is entitled to be treated fairly under the law.  It is important that transparency, accountability and the highest of standards are championed and are delivered.  This is because there is not just a financial cost.  There is also the cost of reputation and the damage that does to the local authority.  There is also the cost and damage to, and the loss of opportunity for, those local communities and those local authorities when projects that are funded and that should be delivered are not delivered.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have run out of time.

The RT&Eacute; programme made for some uncomfortable viewing because any case of misuse of public funds, we can all agree, is troubling and uncomfortable.  The lack of oversight, the way in which these cases were investigated and the failure to publish reports were concerning.</p><p>I will use this debate as an opportunity to touch on some adjacent ethics legislation.The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, initiated a review of all ethics legislation last November and that is very welcome.  That review should be completed with a sense of urgency.  I believe there is a commitment to have it completed by the end of next month.  We all look forward to getting sight of the review of ethics legislation.  </p><p>Section 212 of the Local Government Act 2001, which allows for the Minister to conduct public inquiries at local level, has yet to be commenced.  My colleague, Deputy Denise Mitchell, tabled a parliamentary question on this matter a couple of weeks ago.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, responded that he did not have any intention of commencing section 212 of the Local Government Act at any time in the near future.  He said there were perhaps constitutional issues with conducting inquiries locally and stated: </p> <blockquote> 	The potential costs of public local inquiries would also need very careful consideration and whether such an option would represent best value for money as a means for addressing issues of local concern. </blockquote> <p>While I take that point, moments such as this, including the broadcasting of the &ldquo;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; programme, highlight money being wasted.  Will the Minister of State consider commencing the relevant section of the 2001 Act?  </p><p>The role of the Standards in Public Office, SIPO, in the oversight of public officials also needs to be reviewed.  I hope the Minister, Deputy McGrath, will think about reintroducing the relevant Bill once his Departmental review has been completed. </p><p>Unpublished reports into investigations should be published where no criminal investigation is currently ongoing.  That is vital from a transparency point of view.</p><p>Councillors serving on audit committees should probably have independent financial advice and training if they ever require or want it.  I am not certain that is currently available.</p><p>The RT&Eacute; programme was a very worthwhile piece of journalism.  It showed the importance of public service broadcasting.  When we discussed the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill we heard about the commercial pressures facing RT&Eacute; and public broadcasters.  Programmes such as &ldquo;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; show the importance of public service broadcasting.</p></speech>

To name just one issue, I will focus a little on their failure to provide Traveller accommodation year after year.  During my ten years of working in this area with members of the Traveller community and in the area of accommodation, I have found that things in local authorities fall apart more often than they fall together.  Government does not hold local authorities to account.  In the two years I have been a Senator, I have focused on accountability and transparency in local government.  Let us put our hands up.</p> <p>To be fair to local county councillors who are independent of political parties, they have little or no power.  I speak to county councillors up and down the country who tell me they have absolutely no power.  While they may be able to pass motions here and there, when it comes to drawing down money, building roads, etc., they do not have the power.  We should, by right, give power back to the people who are voted in by communities.  If a local authority member is voted in by the Ballyfermot community, he or she is there to represent the community of Ballyfermot.  Unfortunately, that is not the case because the system underpinning local authorities has failed and will continue to fail unless we do something about it.</p> <p>After watching the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme, one Senator said there were no surprises in it.  As a member of the Traveller community, given the continuous failure I have seen in Tallaght, Ballyfermot, Clondalkin and other places all over the country, I was not surprised.  However, I was surprised at how a local county councillor could not get an independent inspection done in relation to what was going on in local authority.  For me, the most striking part of the whole programme was that a person who was voted by the community could not get an inspection done after all of the work she did to get an inquiry.  </p> <p>I could talk all day about the programme.  The truth of the matter is the job of the Government and local government is to govern.  Unfortunately, we are not seeing that in local authorities.  Local government belongs to the public.  It is a trust fund of the people.  As legislators, we need to listen to the people.  We have not done that.  I remember when Dublin City Council was known as Dublin Corporation.  It failed then and is failing now.  Again, that is not a failure by the individuals who are voted in by communities because, unfortunately, they have little or no power.  It is the system and we need to rebuild it.  I am aware that legislation is under review and I welcome that.  </p> <p>If we take anything from this investigation, it should be that real reform of local authorities is needed, not just changing names but genuinely reforming the system so that it works for the people on the ground and our county councillors.  We have been failing our county councillors.  As a member of the Traveller community, I gave out to my Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in and People Before Profit councillors for ten years.  Until I came to this House, I did not realise that county councillors had little or no power.  It is the system that needs to be fixed.</p> <p>I will end by saying again that we are talking about public funds that benefit our people.  Members of the public must be able to trust their local authority and, right now, they cannot do that.  I welcome the current review and people on the ground would genuinely welcome better, sustainable local government which the Government held to account.  Local authorities must answer to people and cannot be left to monitor themselves</p></speech>

I was elected as a Galway county councillor.  As with Senator Flynn. it was a brand new world for me.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I had little understanding of what is done by a local authority.  It was a steep learning curve to understand how the local authority in any particular county, such as, for example, Galway County Council, is involved in so many aspects of our day-to-day lives.  In terms of water supply, Irish Water is working with Galway County Council and local authorities and councils across the country, but the local authorities took the lead on that.  We are trying to put other supports in place to support them in how they deliver these services.  It was a shock to discover that there is a lack of resources or staffing within certain county councils and that this affects their ability to deliver the services that are required.  In order to ensure that Ireland has county councils that are fit for purpose and that deliver the services, it is crucial they are staffed adequately and that we understand there are challenges within certain areas.  Under Housing for All, the Government is allocating staff to work within the local authorities to deliver on the massive target of 30,000 houses per year, and to ensure that we are working within our towns.</p><p>The reason I ran for election was that, to my mind and to my community's mind, there was an inappropriate planning decision for a waste transfer station, whereby they were planning - and are still planning - to force hundreds of trucks through the middle of the town of Ballinasloe, which has a population of 6,500.  At a national level, we talk about air pollution, clean air, clean water and environmental standards and demands.  We need to ensure for the public that the national policies and initiatives are being correctly managed within our county councils and authorities.</p><p>Perhaps this also comes down to communication.  Local authorities are doing so much in so many areas that it can be hard to get the message out there.  It is crucial, however.  People in every town and village need to understand what their local authority does for them, even at a municipal district level.  For example, Ballinasloe has had major flooding in the past.  Under the OPW, it is one of the catchment flood risk assessment and management projects for flood relief with regard to the River Shannon and one of its main tributaries, the River Suck.  Many towns across the country prioritise tackling flooding.  It is incredible that chief executives, managers, directors and the teams of local authority staff on the ground are the ones bringing out the sandbags.  They are the ones working with businesses and residents in times of crisis.  When a crisis hits, it is the teams working in the local authorities that people go to.  They are the ones who help people on the ground, in particular the most vulnerable.  For the most part, they prioritise that.  I know there are also huge issues in Roscommon around flooding and trying to protect families and homes.</p><p>While things need to be challenged and we need to have appropriate services in place, it is also important to talk about the activities that local authorities do and what they deliver to our communities and our businesses.  We talk about rates.  At a Government level, we are aware of the supports in place for businesses through the employment wage subsidy scheme and so on, but we also put a pause on rates over the past year or two years.  We need to make sure that our businesses understand what they receive in return and what are the benefits of the rates they pay, be it lighting, footpaths, street enhancement or all the projects we see rolled out at Government level.  Those town enhancement projects are coming out of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  We see how that makes a difference when we have street enhancement and town enhancement to tackle dereliction and vacancy.  We want to make sure towns in all areas, particularly in regional and rural areas, are fit for the future and that we encourage more people to come back to live, work and invest in our local areas.</p><p>That is down to having teams within our councils.  We have fantastic engineers in municipal districts across our country, trying to deliver they best that they can, but we need to ensure they have wraparound supports and administrative services.  I am very conscious of this because Galway County Council is always ranked low in terms of financing, and that is something we need to be conscious of.  Again, I want to acknowledge the communication of everything that is done well by our local authorities.</p></speech>

This is a great opportunity to discuss this very important issue with him.  It arose out of the RT&Eacute; programme, which local authorities did not come out of very well.  There were certain local authorities involved but one could say it represented every local authority because I am sure there are a lot of shortcomings in a lot of local authorities.</p> <p>As Senator Fitzpatrick pointed out, when all of the local authorities are amalgamated together, it is quite a sizeable organisation with 30,000 employees and more than &euro;5 billion of a budget.  That is a great deal of money and many employees.  Those employees do an awful lot of work.  When we go through the work they carry out, it includes all of those essential services, from utilities to houses, to business and the arts.  The local authority is involved in everything.</p> <p>It is a great honour to be elected as a member of a local authority and to represent one's community.  From the time I was elected as a local authority member, I have witnessed huge changes in the local authority system.  I have to say they are not all for the best.  The powers of local authority members have been stripped away, year after year, Government after Government.  This Government has to do something about it.</p> <p>Local authorities in the main are not efficient.  When people go to their local authority or to a local authority representative or councillor, they should be able to get answers but the public cannot get answers.  What I would like to see the Minister of State do is to pick one local authority on a pilot basis and see what it takes to make it completely efficient.  In other words, to run it like a business and provide all of the services.  This could mean dealing with staff, with management, with councillors, with unions and with whoever it takes to make it more efficient.  It could well mean there would have to be bonus payments or some form of incentives for staff or management.  However, all of those things should be taken into consideration on a pilot basis, and who better to do this than the Minister of State.  He was a councillor, and he is a Deputy and a Minister of State.  He knows the system and how it works, and he knows the management of local authorities.  What I have outlined would be a very worthwhile exercise from the Department's point of view.</p> <p>No matter what public representative one talks to, whether it is a councillor, a Senator or a Deputy, they are all frustrated when trying to get work done.  When I was first a councillor, local authorities were responsible for housing, water, sewerage and planning.  Nearly all of those are now stripped away from the local authorities, mainly because councillors were afraid to make decisions in many cases.  We should look at generating new services to be brought into the local authorities but to do that, we have to make the local authorities more efficient and more service friendly.  As I said, a pilot scheme would be a great start.</p> <p>We have all seen the decay in every town centre throughout the country.  Councillor after councillor, council after council, and Deputies and Senators have been raising this issue for years.  The local authorities were not able to do anything in regard to improvements, even though it was then within their jurisdiction.  Now, because we have the hand of the Government and the funds from the Department involved, something can be done in every town centre and in every local authority - and rightly so - because this was sucking the heart out of towns.</p> <p>If right was right, the local authorities should have been making a case, whether a financial case or otherwise, to whatever Department.  When they make a case like that, they should be heard, but they were not heard because no heed was paid to it, with the result that we all know, namely, the decay in the centre of towns, with businesses closed.  At the same time, there is a great deal of upstairs accommodation that could be turned into worthwhile and very nice living accommodation.  This would bring the heart back into towns and encourage people to live in towns.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is nothing nicer than going through a town and seeing doors open downstairs or windows open upstairs.  Where there are people, there is life.  We need people to have life and if people are living in those buildings, there is life in them.  </p><p>What could you say about the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme?  It was picked up by the Local Government Audit Service and the Department auditor, which goes to show that those organs of the State are working.  I can see how it happened in the case in Mayo.  The council did not want to say that it did not want any more money so it was probably saying it would work the system.  If it was worked in a transparent way, you might say that was fair enough but it was hard to hide something like that.  It did give back the money.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, is waiting for an independent report from the county manager regarding this issue.  I hope that she will see that this is resolved quickly and that the continuation and flow of funds to County Mayo, which has stalled, will continue.  I have more to say but I do not have time on this occasion.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-12a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1670" speakername="John McGahon" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051200002#W00200"><p>The point I want to address is the concept of local government as we know it today.  I spent five years on Louth County Council.  The current format is fundamentally flawed.  The reason is because the people who are supposed to hold the chief executive and director of services to account are technically the county councillors.  They are the people who supposed to hold them to account to make sure things are happening the way they should.  Let us be blunt and call a spade a spade.  If I am a county councillor who wants to try to achieve things that need to be done on a county council, it will not be to my advantage to go out of my way to hammer a chief executive or director of services week in, week out to make sure he or she is doing a proper job.  This is why the system is flawed.  The county councillors, who are supposed to hold the executive to account, need the executive to be able to progress stuff through a local authority.  This is why I firmly believe chief executives and directors of services should be accountable to a higher body, namely, the Oireachtas in order that at some stage they are called in once a year, be it before the Committee of Public Accounts or the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to explain why a particular county is consistently the lowest collector of rates in the country, consistently has the highest number of maintenance requests, is not building enough affordable homes or why so many people are on the housing transfer list and there has been no movement.  They must be accountable to somebody at a higher level, which is why the Oireachtas has a real role to play.</p> <p>Chief executives and directors of services are not accountable to anybody.  They are not accountable to the public.  They are technically accountable to county councillors.  This is why overall reform is needed.  I do not mean to be radical when I say this but I think we should see directly elected mayors in all local authorities, not just for Dublin or Cork.  It should be done for places like Louth or the Minister of State's locality.  The reason why is because we would then have an elected official who is running on a campaign pledge to introduce certain measures, be they more active travel ways or greenways or efforts to rejuvenate town centres.  The politician must then deliver on the issues on which he or she campaigned.  There is then a driving force within local authorities and a figurehead in a mayor moving forward.  We see a similar situation with local authorities in Great Britain where political parties are in control of councils and allocate different portfolios to different councillors.  They are councils that can really achieve things.  The fundamental flaw in Ireland in terms of local authorities is the current system.  </p> <p>It is so easy for me to come into this Chamber and say the system is wrong and we need to fix it.  I am advocating taking a sledgehammer to local authorities, breaking them into 1,000 pieces and building a brand new system.  This is what we need to do.  As Senator Paddy Burke rightly said, local authorities have been decimated at every point over the past 30 or 40 years.  More powers have been taken away.  At the end of the day, councillors do nothing more than rubber-stamping approval for the executive.  I do not know why Senator Fitzpatrick is shaking her head; I am being honest about this.  This is my experience as a councillor on a smaller county council unlike Dublin, which with the finance it has, is the Real Madrid of local authorities compared to my local authority.  This is why it might be easier on larger local authorities but I am giving my experience of what happens in County Louth.  In such a local authority, the executive can turn around to say that the issue can be kicked into a strategic policy committee, SPC, to be examined there, but then, six months down the line, nothing comes from it.  </p> <p>What I am talking about is fundamental change in local authorities.  A lot of great things are done by local authorities but they are totally inefficient.  That has been my experience in my county over the years.  If we really want to be radical about it, and it is not pie in the sky stuff, we should do something different.  What Senator Burke said is a good idea.  It involves running it as a pilot in another local authority.  There needs to be a key person with responsibility in any local authority who is held to account publicly.  If this is a directly elected mayor, great.  If it is a chief executive, he or she should be held directly to account by an Oireachtas committee where he or she can be called in every year and questioned on various issues concerning what is and is not going very well in his or her local authority.  One thing I am very clear about is that there is no accountability in local government today and this needs to change.  If we can start there, it would be a good process to move forward with.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-12a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1696" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051200002#W00300"><p>The Minister of State and I were the chair and the vice chair of the HSE's regional health forum for Dublin - mid-Leinster a long time ago and worked well together.  A lot of people in this Chamber have come from a local government background and are very familiar with how local authorities work, both what does and does not work well.  If we want to be honest about it, even in the past ten years we can see that when Irish Water was created, it took responsibilities away from local authorities.  It must be said that this was not done by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  The strategic housing development, SHD, process, which I opposed very strongly in this Chamber, was well meant.  I remember a phrase at the time that whatever the problem was, An Bord Plean&aacute;la was unlikely to be the solution.  We are talking about An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the challenges it faces at present.  Many of those SHDs that were approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in contravention of development plans have been rightly held up by judicial reviews because the courts have said they should never have been granted in the first place.</p> <p>I have no issue with chief executives coming in and talking to an Oireachtas committee but this further strips out oversight and brings it all back to the centre.  Perhaps we need a stronger audit or governance committee or a stronger corporate policy group in local authorities that can hold to account those directors of services or chief executives who are not up to scratch.  I also want to put on the record that of all the chief executives with whom I worked, from Derek Brady through to Owen Keegan, Kathleen Houlihan, Philomena Poole and more recently the new chief executive in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, I note that getting to the top of the tree in local government is no mean feat.  They are usually incredibly hard-working and diligent but sometimes, they are trying to steer a very large ship.  Dublin City Council has about 6,000 employees.  With the best will in the world, the chief executive can only do so much.  This is not taking responsibility away.  We tend to see problems in public sector organisations because of FOI.  I am sure private organisations are not perfect either.  We just do not get the same transparency levels about them.  We need to acknowledge what works well in local authorities as well as acknowledge that when there is failure, there should be a level of accountability.  I remember how when I was on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, of which the Minister of State was a member at the same time as me, we brought in Robert Watt when he was Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and asked him about managing out, which is a phrase used in the private sector, those kind of employees who may be burnt out or not up to scratch.  His reply was "we don't do that".  The private sector can pay people off but we do not do that.  Sometimes people are not in the right jobs.  They might be very good if they were moved into a different job but the job they have is not the best fit for them.  We need more flexibility in how we hire people, how we manage staff and how we look after their needs and to make sure that if people are not performing to the level we expect them to, there will be counselling and training to bring about further improvement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to acknowledge that the local government sector provides many services but, through the years, whether it be Irish Water, waste services, regional waste management plans or strategic housing development, SHD, processes and planning, central government has repeatedly sucked powers away from local authorities.  In some cases, that may have been because the local authorities were not willing to grasp the nettle on various matters.  The Planning Regulator is another example of that.  I have no issue with the Planning Regulator as such; it is more that local authorities are not being left to do their own thing.  There may be a need for better oversight of what they are doing but that should be at local level and with those who are elected in their areas.  They understand their counties.  I refer to the Acting Chairperson in the context of Kildare, me in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown or another person in Dublin city, Waterford or wherever it happens to be.  All Members are aware of the idea of subsidiarity.  Moving powers down the chain is probably a good thing but, historically, we in Ireland are very bad at doing that.  In fact, it is quite the opposite.</p><p>In the context of the concept of a directly elected mayor for Dublin, I am concerned in respect of from where the powers of the directly elected mayor will come if there are four local authorities.  If those powers come from the councils, there will be nothing left in the councils because they have so little already.  If the directly elected mayor will get powers in respect of policing, education, public transport, tourism promotion or whatever it may be, there will be nothing left for the councils.  There are many things that are done by central government but that could be devolved down.  I have rarely seen any Government of any colour in this State devolve powers from the centre to local government, however.  I know the local enterprise offices may be an example of that to a certain extent but they only replaced enterprise boards that were there anyway.  Typically, power has left local authorities and gone up the line.  Rather than identifying what is wrong with the system at local level and fixing it, the power is taken off the local authorities and they are left with less to do.  All they have now is grass cutting, graffiti removal, drain unblocking and so on.  Even in the case of water leaks, they have to be reported to Irish Water, which then telephones or emails the local authority and asks it to fix the leak under a service level agreement.  In the old days, one could just ring the local authority and get it done directly.</p><p>All Members present have a lot of experience.  I was on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for 12 and a half years.  Senator Burke was on Mayo County Council for a long time.  The Acting Chairperson was a councillor, as were the Minister of State and Senators Fitzpatrick, Cummins and Warfield.  I know Senator Flynn has experience of being involved with local authorities in other ways.  There is so much experience here at local and national levels.  Let us acknowledge what is good but always be driving to make it better.</p></speech>

In the context of this discussion on reforming local authorities and governance structures in the 31 local authorities, it is interesting that 75% of the speakers in the debate were from the Government side, exclusively from my party, Fine Gael, and Fianna F&aacute;il.  That demonstrates in terms of debates in this House how much the Government is interested in solving the issues in respect of local authorities.  I note there is 45 minutes remaining of the time allotted to the debate.  That is an interesting point.</p> <p>One of the things I took on when I took over my brief was to be an advocate for local councillors.  I refer to the responsibility that has been placed on them.  With the reduction in the number of local authorities, from 114 right down to 31, the geographical area councillors have to cover increased significantly.  In addition, there are 360 statutory bodies across the country to which local authority members have to be nominated, as well as approximately 400 external bodies.  There are well in excess of 2,000 nominations of local authority members to bodies on which they serve the public.  There are also other issues such as the public participation networks.  In the first instance, I wish to acknowledge the work done by local councillors.  I hope that we will get a lot more reform done in my remaining time in the Custom House, such as providing for maternity leave for female councillors.  I refer to what are almost significant human rights that councillors have been denied.  We have a lot more reform to do in that regard.</p> <p>As regards the powers councillors have, it is often forgotten that the county development plan is the cornerstone document that unlocks and develops the potential of the county right across its geographical area.  Local authority members have control of determining that policy.  They have control in terms of development levies - how much of levies should be ring-fenced and at what rate - to develop key public infrastructure to underpin all that development in their county.  Those are significant powers.  In terms of revenue-raising powers, they have powers to strike a rate, adopt a budget and implement property tax.  All those issues are being enhanced, especially under the property tax review that is currently ongoing.  Obviously, they have total control in terms of the disposal of property and the granting of permissions under material contravention.  There have been significant votes in the latter regard right across the country.  There is a formal process for them to input into many SHD planning applications.  I know that process is now concluded but local authority members always had an input on some of those major issues.  </p> <p>As regards accountability, local authority members have significant powers, including suspension, to hold a chief executive to account if they believe he or she has performed inappropriately.  Those powers are at their disposal.  Those are facts.  It is the reality under the Local Government Act.</p> <p>As regards the work of local authorities, in the context of directly elected mayors reference was made to the programme of reform we are progressing.  We are aiming to hold a plebiscite in all the local authority areas that wish to have a directly elected mayor.  Obviously, it will be their choice, but that is significant reform.  Senator Horkan referred to devolving power down to local authorities.  Local authorities deliver more than 1,000 services for citizens.  The response of Ministers to attempts to bring more reform down is interesting, however.  It can be difficult.  I refer to the Government decision in respect of a mayor for Limerick and the devolution of autonomy and authority to the local authority there.  When one goes about that process, however, it is challenging.  I have first-hand experience of that in the context of trying to have bilateral engagements with various Departments.  We are working at pace to do that.  The Senator referred to the Citizens' Assembly under the chairmanship of Jim Gavin in terms of what the response will be in respect of a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  That is interesting.  There is no doubt it is a complex issue.  The Senator pointed out some of the issues in that regard. </p> <p>As regards transparency, I referred to the Local Government Audit Service, as well as the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, which provides that service.  Senator Cummins raised issues relating to timing.  One of the challenges relates to when the data are certified and ready.  I refer to linking or mirroring Departments having their accounts done with local authorities having the end-of-year figures certified.  As an accountant, I know that can be frustrating.  The Revenue Commissioners will attest to that also.  The gap between a problem first happening and it being identified can be significant.  Unfortunately, a lot may have happened by the time one gets to change or even identify it.  That can be challenging in every sector.  I hear the Senator's points regarding an enhanced role for NOAC in terms of carrying out performance reviews.  I know that I and the other Ministers at the Department have powers to request it to review positions within the local authority system.  That is a good power that is at the disposal of the Ministers under the Act.</p> <p>Senator Warfield referred to section 212 of the Local Government Act 2001, relating to public inquiries.  I understand there are several reasons the provision has not been commenced, not least the potential cost of local public inquiries and concerns that individuals involved could subsequently seek to assert their rights through the courts.  It is important to recognise that in October 2011, a referendum was held on a proposed amendment to the Constitution that, if successful, would have granted full investigative powers to Oireachtas Members to hold inquiries.  That amendment was rejected by the electorate.  Concerns cited at the time related to how the granting of judicial powers to a non-judicial body would operate in practice and, in particular, how sufficient safeguards in respect of the constitutional rights of individuals subject to inquiries could be provided.  Those are significant items that would have to be considered first.  The Government currently has no plan to commence the section.</p> <p>I thank Members for their interaction.  It is important that we work hard to reform local government.  The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future has a clear body of work to deliver that reform.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We all know from our various roles that it is challenging in our local authority system but I cannot think of another body or authority that, when Covid came, responded within 48 hours through the community call.  These staff members were men and women throughout this country who protected the most vulnerable.  They were there to organise a system within 48 hours to protect our community.</p><p>As we see in respect of the Ukrainian crisis, local authorities are again stepping up to the mark.  We all know there are areas where we have to improve and there are deficiencies.  Sometimes, as a society, we throw everything at our local authorities and expect them to deliver everything.  That is one thing I would say in life.  Significant responsibility is placed on the shoulders of staff who work in the local authority system and sometimes we have to realise it can be difficult when there are so many competing interests in society.  In the main, however, I am confident and comfortable that the majority do the best job they can, sometimes in very difficult circumstances.</p></speech>
