    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-11-27a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019112700002#A00500"><p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for selecting this critical item for debate today and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to the Chamber.  I know accident and emergency departments around the country are under pressure, not least the department at Mayo University Hospital.  There is a planned extension for the accident and emergency department and a plan to install more medical bed capacity.  I would like to see some progress on this and I ask that funding be ring-fenced so that architects can be appointed and the hospital can at least begin to design the extension to start moving this investment along.</p> <p>Currently, there are staff operating in very pressurised circumstances and patients are on trolleys in corridors.  I heard that yesterday there were 30-odd persons on trolleys in Mayo University Hospital and a similar number on trolleys in Galway.  Mayo University Hospital's capacity is smaller than that of Galway and the accident and emergency department is much smaller.  In excess of 30 people on trolleys in Mayo University Hospital would have a bigger impact there than a similar number would have in Galway.</p> <p>I know part of rolling out Sl&aacute;intecare is an increase in capacity and this speaks to that objective.  Something needs to be done.  When the accident and emergency department was designed, it was meant to handle approximately 20,000 cases per year but it is now receiving approximately 36,000 cases per year.  This is evidence of the clear capacity constraints that exist.  On the other hand, I acknowledge some of the measures taken by the Government, including investment in the Castlebar primary care centre.  That is a good news story as it provides X-ray facilities outside the hospital setting, and it handles approximately 7,000 cases per year.  This is done under the auspices of the hospital consultants and radiology department, and it means people only wait approximately one week for the service.  This demonstrates that the Government's move towards investment in community and primary care centres is correct.  There is more potential capacity and there are plans in the pipeline to expand services at the primary care centre, including ultrasound facilities.  In the meantime, this issue needs urgent attention.  A recent survey was done on patient experiences and all the issues pertaining to Mayo University Hospital involve capacity.  No matter how efficiently people work, when they do not have space to take in patients, problems arise, as the Minister of State knows.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-11-27a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019112700002#A00600"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position on capital development projects at Mayo University Hospital.  The role of capital investment is to support the delivery of quality healthcare services.  This includes the provision of the appropriate infrastructure that supports service delivery, such as the facilities at Mayo University Hospital.  Mayo University Hospital provides health services and care to the people of Mayo and the west.  It is an integral part of the Saolta hospital group, a model 3 hospital with 331 beds, providing quality patient care delivered safely by skilled and valued staff through the best use of available resources.  This Government is committed to developing services and infrastructure at Mayo University Hospital.</p> <p>A number of capital projects at Mayo University Hospital are progressing and are at various stages of development.  This includes electrical upgrade works, fire response improvements and a mortuary upgrade.  A proposal has been developed to provide a new multi-storey block extension in the courtyard area of the hospital.  This block would facilitate an extension at ground level to increase the size of the accident and emergency department and provide space for the medical assessment unit.  It would also provide space at second floor level for a new 12-bed ward.  It is also proposed to provide space for a further 12 to 15 beds at second floor level in the existing two-storey building.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is a complicated project addressing a number of separate, if related, issues in different parts of the hospital.  The project is being reviewed.  It is expected to be progressed in 2020 as two separate projects - one addressing additional capacity and the other focusing on the emergency department and the medical assessment unit.  This proposal will be subject to further definition in the coming months with a view to being in a position to make progress with the project, subject to funding availability and overall project prioritisation in 2020.  It is important to recognise that all capital development proposals, including capital developments at Mayo University Hospital, must progress through detailed appraisal, planning and design, procurement, construction and commissioning stages before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established.  This Government is committed to developing services at Mayo University Hospital and will invest more than &euro;2 billion in capital funding in the public health services over the three years between 2019 and 2021.</p></speech>

We all know that the planning process takes a while but we need to get down to the nuts and bolts of designing this extension.  The Minister of State has pointed out the complexities of it but it has been well appraised.  We need it; we needed it yesterday.  I am mindful of the constraints on capital expenditure that existed in the past.  I would like to make a significant point.  I have mentioned University Hospital Galway, which serves counties Mayo, Galway and Roscommon.  The blockages in Mayo University Hospital are having an impact on University Hospital Galway.  Patients, especially oncology patients, need to be discharged, released or transferred to Mayo University Hospital.  If there is no capacity in Mayo, it blocks up the centre of excellence in Galway.  It is a circular situation.  There is a blockage somewhere.  We should have moved past the appraisal stage.  We need to get on with it.  We need to get the design going to overcome the complexities and to get a hospital that functions better than the hospital we have at the moment.</p></speech>

It is accepted that we have a capacity issue at Mayo University Hospital and throughout the country.  This was recognised and identified in the bed capacity review that was undertaken by the Department recently.  I appreciate the opportunity to try to make progress with this matter for the Senator.  I will take back her strong sentiments to try to get this matter prioritised and progressed as quickly as possible.  Clearly, it is in the interests of the people the Senator serves that we ensure the capacity of Mayo University Hospital is enhanced.</p></speech>

The organisation in question works with more than 100 families, some of which have two or three children who are on the autism spectrum.  Even though it is based in Buncrana, it serves the north Inishowen area.  The Bluestack Special Needs Foundation, which is based in Donegal town, serves families in south Donegal.  A large part of County Donegal is covered by both organisations, which have been in existence for almost 20 years.  Until a year ago, they were entirely self-funded.  This has been a long road for families.  Family members who are dealing with the significant stress of being carers for their loved ones have to go out and raise money again and again.  The local communities in north and south Donegal are supportive of these organisations.  They always give great support to their fundraisers.  These families should not have to raise funds.  They should not have to live with the uncertainty of how they are going to secure these services each year.</p> <p>I am knowledgeable about ICARE because it is based in my home town of Buncrana.  Families are referred to the services of ICARE by schools, social services and health services.  The State asks ICARE to provide the services it should be providing, but it does not offer any funding support.  ICARE sought &euro;100,000 this year, but instead it received just &euro;35,000.  The Bluestack Special Needs Foundation sought &euro;150,000, but it received just &euro;36,000.  It is well known that they are getting just a fraction of what they need.  The HSE worked with both organisations to put together these funding proposals.  There are no exaggerations in them.  The organisations are looking for exactly what they need - no more and no less.  They have been given a fraction of what they require for this year.  As the year draws to a close, it is crucial that the same mistake is not made in 2020.  That is why I am raising this matter now.  To be clear, ICARE requires &euro;100,000 and the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation requires &euro;150,000.  That is the appeal.  I am frustrated because nothing has happened even though the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, told me earlier this year he would keep a close eye on this issue.  Funding was found when the HSE in Donegal reallocated funding from somewhere else.  It was robbing Peter to pay Paul.  No additional funding was provided by central government.  Instead, we got tea and sympathy.  I am asking for an end to the tea and sympathy.  These organisations, which are delivering services that have been referred to them by the State, should be respected and funded properly in order that they can do the work they are doing with the support of the people of north and south Donegal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-11-27a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019112700002#B00600"><p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue of funding for ICARE autism support group and the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation.  As Senators may be aware, ICARE was founded in 2000 by a small group of dedicated parents of children with autism.  It provides a range of activities for children and young adults with autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, in the Inishowen area of County Donegal.  The supports provided by ICARE include informal education and supports for the individual with autism and his or her family, school holiday activities, access to a youth club and support meetings, training and development for families.  I acknowledge the extraordinary achievements of the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation since it was established in 2006 by a dedicated group of parents and professionals working in the disability sector.  The foundation operates a range of educational, practical and emotional support programmes using a family support model.  It provides evening and weekend activities, summer camps and a diverse range of activities.</p> <p>The family-centred approach adopted by ICARE and the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation is an important move away from a system designed to suit the needs of the service provider and towards a system designed to meet the needs of service users and their families.  This model ensures families are empowered by being supported and included in the planning of their children's care.  The successful manner in which ICARE and the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation have integrated their services into the community goes an enormous way towards challenging historic patterns of exclusion and is very much to be welcomed.  I understand that ICARE and the foundation each received funding of &euro;41,000 from the HSE in 2019 towards the costs of their operations.  Submissions for funding from ICARE and the foundation of &euro;41,000 and &euro;86,500, respectively, have been made to the HSE in respect of 2020.  The HSE will consider its decision on the level of service to be provided in the context of available resources and priorities for the coming year.</p> <p>Additional funding of &euro;2 million has been secured under the autism plan in budget 2020 to address health-related issues for individuals with autism.  This money will be used to implement an awareness-raising programme that can provide a better information resource for children and parents about the supports that are available; to build capacity and competence among key professionals working with autism, including a national training programme for clinicians; and to implement a tiered model of assessment to improve access to and responses by services for those with autism.  It will also be used to fund a campaign to assist in creating awareness of the challenges, needs and experiences of people with autism.  The Government remains committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities in a way that empowers them to live independent lives, gives them greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhances their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-11-27a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1400" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019112700002#B00700"><p>We have a serious problem here.  The person in the HSE or elsewhere in the health service who drafted the Minister of State's response has his or her numbers badly wrong.  I appeal to the Minister of State to sort this out.  A senior official in the Department of Health needs to speak to the person who drafted the response to ask him or her why it is suggested that ICARE has applied for &euro;41,000, or less than half of what it requires.  I spoke to representatives of ICARE and the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation in advance of this debate.  ICARE is seeking &euro;100,000, as agreed with the HSE.  That is what it requires to fund the dedicated core portion of its service.  It does all sorts of ancillary works that would not be funded from this &euro;100,000.  The Bluestack Special Needs Foundation requires &euro;150,000.  The person who put together the numbers in the Minister of State's response is not serving the interests of ICARE or the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This response is an absolute disgrace.  Let us be clear about the amounts involved, which are &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000.  If that is not what was applied for in 2020, then the application needs to be amended urgently.  What has been given is a fraction of that and shows the lack of respect for these two organisations.  I reiterate that education, social care, community and health services are referring families to iCARE and the Bluestacks Special Needs Foundation for support.  Those organisations have only a fraction of the supports available to the statutory organisations.  I conclude by asking the Minister of State for an urgent intervention because these figures are completely wrong.  I am certain about that.  This is a misrepresentation of what these organisations require and this situation needs to be resolved today.</p></speech>

The Bluestacks Special Needs Foundation and iCARE provide excellent services to people with disabilities and their families in County Donegal.  The HSE acknowledges that commitment and endeavours to support such community voluntary-based services as much as possible.  In that regard, each organisation received &euro;41,000 in 2019 towards the cost of their work.  I also reiterate that some 100 new therapy posts have been added this year and there is an overall budget of &euro;2 billion.  </p> <p>Regarding the Senator's contention that the figures are wrong, I have no problem getting clarity from the HSE.  I have no reason to doubt that agency, but I have no objection to seeking that clarification.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-11-27a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019112700002#C00800"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am disappointed, however, because I saw the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in the canteen.  It is disappointing that the Minister cannot make himself available.  Regardless of who someone is or what party or political group one represents, if any, if a Minister is in the building then he or she should endeavour to do his or her very best to attend.  I have other opportunities to engage with the Minister on a range of matters because I am a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I am more than happy, however, to drop the Minister a line to tell him how disappointed I am.  It is disrespectful to the House for the Minister to not come in.  I know Ministers are busy, but so are we and the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, is very busy.  That was clear from the answers he gave to the earlier Commencement matters.   That said, I do not doubt his commitment and ability to pass on this message.</p> <p>I ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to empower the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, or somebody else, to monitor local authority standards on housing.  Local authorities randomly inspect the properties of private sector landlords.  Who is keeping an eye on the local authorities, however?  People with young children have come to me because they have mildew on the walls of their residence.  They have been told to go out and buy a bottle of bleach by the local authorities and those people have that in writing, by the way.  They were told they had to ventilate their residences better, use bleach and take the mould off the walls.  </p> <p>People across the country, and probably in the Minister of State's constituency, are living in appalling accommodation which is part of our social housing stock.  Who is monitoring that situation?  This is an important issue because tenants often fear that continuing to harass the local authority about the poor standards of their accommodation will result in some sort of rancour, to the detriment of a transfer or move to another property.  It is not acceptable for local authorities to be acting as judges and juries in their own causes.  </p> <p>An independent inspectorate is needed to ensure that our local authority social housing stock is maintained to high standards.  I acknowledge that some authorities are making better progress than others.  We still have situations, however, where there is bad ventilation, damp and even pyrite in some of our social housing.  We have serious problems, in certain spots, concerning local authority standards.  I ask the Minister of State, at his convenience, to ask if the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will consider putting in place whatever mechanism for inspections might be possible to give comfort to tenants in those situations.   </p> <p>There is no point in all of us, from all parties and none, bellyaching about standards and doing nothing about the problem.  This is our forum during Commencement matters and that is why I want to bring this topic to the attention of the Minister.  The record will show my disappointment that he is not here.  Leaving here today, I commit to contacting some local authorities and I undertake to send photographs of the problems to which I have referred.  I will zone in on the constituency of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government himself.  I will identify a few appalling houses in his electoral area and bring them to his attention within the next week.  I thank the Minister of State.  </p></speech>

I did not question where they are, I just took their bona fides, which I have no reason to doubt.  I assure Senator Boyhan that I will pass on his sentiments to the Minister and the Minister of State.  Officials from the Department are also monitoring this debate and taking on board the points raised by the Senator.  He can rest assured that he is not making his case in vain.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter of monitoring standards in local authority housing stock.  The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, last amended in 2019, specify requirements on a range of matters such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas, oil and electrical supply.  These minimum standards also include measures covering fire safety, carbon monoxide and window safety.  The regulations apply to all rented dwellings, both private rented houses and local authority housing stock, with just a small number of exemptions.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure their rented properties comply with these regulations.  Responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority.  Local authorities are responsible for the management and maintenance of their own housing stock under the Housing Acts, 1966 to 2015, including responsive and planned maintenance and the identification of housing in need of upgrade, regeneration or adaptation.</p> <p>The Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness committed all local authorities to adopting a preventative maintenance approach to housing stock management, including consistent standards and the adoption of a common national re-letting performance standard.  The City and County Management Association, CCMA, on behalf of local authorities, is driving a shared approach to the planned maintenance of social housing, including stock condition surveys, building on the work that several local authorities have already launched in that regard and there is ongoing dialogue between the CCMA and the Department to advance reform in the area.</p> <p>In addition to funding provided by the local authorities themselves in respect of their own housing stock - approximately &euro;350 million per annum - the Government provides funding across a number of programmes to support local authority work to maintain and improve social housing stock, for example the energy retrofitting and voids programmes.  In all cases, however, it is the local authorities that identify priorities.  Local authorities have a multi-stage procedure for dealing with complaints from their tenants regarding housing conditions.  The first involves discussing the complaint at the point of service.  This is usually the quickest and most efficient way to address matters that have arisen.  If someone is unhappy with the outcome of this first stage, a formal complaint can be made under the council's complaints and appeals procedure, details of which can be found on the websites of the local authorities.  If a person continues to consider the response from the local authority to be unsatisfactory, the matter may be pursued further through the Office of the Ombudsman.</p> <p>The Residential Tenancies Board is an independent statutory body established under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2019 to operate a national tenancy registration system, provide information and advice to the public, and to resolve disputes between private landlords and tenants.  The inspection of rental properties is not a function of the RTB.  Social housing is subject to a separate legislative regime under the Housing Acts and it would not be appropriate for the RTB to have an enforcement role in relation to social housing.</p></speech>

I take on board the official response concerning the role of the RTB.  It is a valid point and I am happy to take it on board.  There is, however, a need to regulate and inspect independently of the local authorities.  They are failing on a whole range of fronts and we need to monitor them because no actor currently has responsibility in that area.  We need to find some way to zone in on those standards.  I reiterate that I undertake to contact some of the housing bodies today and I will identify a few houses on the social housing list in the constituency of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I will then come back with a further Commencement matter on this topic, because we need to drive home notice of the existence of this problem right into the political heartland of the Minister.</p></speech>

I echo what Senator Boyhan said, that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, should be here today.  He is in the House.  When I left the self-service restaurant to come here he was there so I cannot understand why he cannot be here to deal with this matter personally.</p> <p>The Minister has advertised his intention to conduct a public consultation on amending the spatial strategy document to delete all reference to any alternative route for the southern end of the metro system.  The result of this is that what the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, said about being open to persuasion on this matter is being quietly shelved and a decision is being made to cannibalise the green Luas line and incorporate it eventually into the metro system.</p> <p>The House knows, because I have mentioned it previously, that the consequence of doing this is the green Luas line would be out of operation for two years while these works are carried out.  This is a matter of great importance for the south Dublin region.  It is very unfortunate that the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, which is a democratic body of local representatives, has made an amendment to make provision for the options the Taoiseach has said are open to the Government to pursue but now it has become apparent that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, led by the Minister, Deputy Ross, has requested the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to make an order deleting all references to alternative routes in the spatial strategy.  In effect, this means the Minister, Deputy Ross, has asked the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to end all possibilities of alternative routes for the southern end of the MetroLink system.  The consequence of this is that the Minister, under section 31A of the relevant planning Act, has the power to make a direction telling the regional assembly to amend its spatial strategy to conform with what is now emerging as the preferred strategy of the Minister, Deputy Ross, which is the green line cannibalisation scheme and the two-year delay implicit eventually in pursuing that scheme.</p> <p>We are now in a situation whereby the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has started a procedure.  He has put advertisements in the newspapers indicating he intends to consider ending any possibility of these alternative routes by making a direction under a statutory power.  I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State while complaining about the absence of the senior Minister.  My information is the Minister has a draft order before him.  He has had correspondence with the National Transport Authority, the Office of the Planning Regulator and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Minister should make a clear statement.  Has he yet made the order in question?  Does he intend to do so?  When is he likely to make this order?  Will he publicly state the effect of making this order is that what the Taoiseach has said about the possibility of pursuing alternative routes will be brought to an end?</p></speech>

At material amendment stage, the members of the assembly included the additional undergrounding of extensions to UCD and Knocklyon from Charlemont, which effectively adds an additional two metro lines to the project.  The regional spatial economic strategy never proposed the extension of the metro to the Rathfarnham and Churchtown areas.</p> <p>The consideration of the regional spatial economic strategy by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has been framed in the context of Project Ireland 2040 and the statutory requirement for the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly regional spatial economic strategy to be consistent with the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, which provides the statutory framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure for the region and with associated funding included in the national development plan.</p> <p>Following this consideration, the Minister gave notice on 7 August 2019 to the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly that he intended to issue a direction under section 31A of the Planning and Development Act 2000 on objectives in the regional spatial economic strategy that identified additional rail, metro and Luas infrastructure, which went beyond the scope of the National Transport Authority's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area for 2016 to 2035, the National Planning Framework 2040 and the National Development Plan 2018-2027.</p> <p>In reaching this position, the Minister took account of advice from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in July 2019 that the regional spatial economic strategy contains references to projects that are not consistent with the national planning framework, the national development plan and-or the greater Dublin area transport strategy.  There was also a strong recommendation, also made in July 2019, from the NTA for the issuance of direction to the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly to remove, among other items, the reference of the metro extension to Knocklyon and UCD.  There was also advice from the Office of the Planning Regulator.</p> <p>The draft ministerial direction was the subject of public consultation from 20 August 2019 to 2 September 2019, following which the Minister, on the 11 October, appointed an inspector to carry out an independent review.  This has now been received.  Following consideration of this review, the Minister will decide either to extend the period for consideration or issue the direction as per the draft or with amendments by 9 December 2019.</p> <p>I understand that a review of the greater Dublin area transport strategy will commence next year and will incorporate a re-examination of travel demand across the greater Dublin area based on the most recent forecasts of population and employment distribution.  It would be more appropriate at this point, and through this process, that the requirement for additional rail lines, or for expediting certain elements of the greater Dublin area transport strategy, are identified and considered.</p></speech>

The Government is speaking with a forked tongue on this issue.  The Taoiseach says he is open to persuasion on other routes.  The proposal to extend the metro to Sandyford was stated to be something that would not be required for the next 20 years but now it appears the Government is quietly going back to its original proposal, which is to cannibalise the green line and exclude all other possibilities.  I want to make it very clear that if the metro is extended to incorporate the green Luas line as far as Sandyford it will entail closing the line for two years and replacing one piece of infrastructure that is working, and with extended tram sets will work more efficiently, while ignoring the possibility of giving other suburbs in Dublin, such as UCD, Belfield, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Churchtown, Rathfarnham and Knocklyon any decent public transport system, which is wholly absent.  Whereas I recognise the Minister of State has informed the House today that a decision will be made by 9 December, this has been an exercise in kicking the can down the road.  The Taoiseach has said he is open to persuasion on these matters but this process is going to culminate on 9 December.  It is deceiving the people as to the Government's real intentions.</p></speech>

We need to have a proper debate in this House on rural Ireland and putting a value on farmers, the sustainability of rural Ireland and farming and how much we value having fresh produce and good beef.  Individuals and the supermarket sector as a whole must figure out whether we want decent beef and agricultural produce in future.  I have started going to my local butcher because the beef is a little better and although I pay a little more, it is worthwhile.  I have considerable sympathy for those farmers.</p> <p>On the same matter, issues around death threats to certain individuals should be clarified.  There is much hurt out there and if the parties are to go ahead with the task force and the mediation of some form of agreement, they must clear the air.  There must be trust on both sides.  I hope the talks will go ahead in December and the farmers will achieve some sort of satisfactory agreement.  It is very much a long-term issue but we must all figure out whether we appreciate fully our access to good produce.  I would like a debate in this House on the matter.</p> <p>I also raise the issue of cycling in the city.  Three weeks ago, a young man, Mr. Neeraj Jain, was knocked down, tragically, by a cement truck on the South Circular Road at the junction with St. James's Hospital.  We know cycling is becoming more dangerous on the roads in the city.  I commend Dublin City Council because as part of the Dublin agreement, councillors agreed to allocate 20% of the roads budget to increasing cycling infrastructure, which is very welcome.  I also welcome the new laws coming into effect whereby fines of &euro;120 for overtaking a cyclist in a dangerous fashion will be implemented.  It is really important that we have enforcement.  We have many great laws but the real problem is with enforcement of those laws.  Perhaps the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will assign enough personnel to enforce cycling-related laws in the city.</p> <p>I commend my colleague, Senator Craughwell, who is not here today but who spent some time recently cycling on the roads to see the issues on the ground.</p></speech>

Last night I would have liked to have been a cyclist when I was leaving Leinster House.  They were able to speed past all the traffic.  It is a sensible way to do business but I would be too scared to cycle.  I have tried it but until cycling infrastructure improves, many people will be like me and will not be comfortable cycling the roads.</p></speech>

It is my sincere wish, as it has been since I had the honour of being appointed to this Chamber, that I will leave this Seanad knowing that the Irish people have been given a chance to vote on whether their Irish brothers and sisters right across the globe will be able to vote on who our next President should be.  I fully supported the Government's decision to postpone the holding of this referendum in the teeth of Brexit negotiations but if, as seems likely, we will have a degree of certainty surrounding Brexit following the completion of the United Kingdom general election, I strongly urge the Government to call a referendum before the St. Patrick's Day festivities.</p> <p>What an amazing sight it would be for all the Ministers travelling across the world to interact with our diaspora having seen a referendum passed to give them a formal say in who should be the Head of State.  I know in my adopted country of the United States the enormous depth of meaning the holding of this referendum would have for our community.  St. Patrick's Day is a unique period in our calendar where every Irish person resident in this State recognises and sees just how global and broad-shouldered is our community.  Beamed across the globe from Dubai to Durban and Singapore to Seattle, the whole world stops and pays attention to the community of this small island.</p> <p>We know the economic and diplomatic value of our Taoiseach and Ministers travelling across the world and although there is always criticism of the cost of these missions, we never talk about the value to the State and taxpayer of what it means to our Irish community to be visited by their home Government.  That value would be enhanced dramatically if we could deliver a referendum to give that community a say in who our next President should be.  I am calling on the Government and all other political parties to support my call for this referendum to take place before St. Patrick's Day in 2020.</p></speech>

I was out there this morning meeting some farmers, and this follows previous engagements I had with them both at previous protests outside these buildings and at a meat processing plant at Rathdowney in County Laois.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pippa Hackett:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=0000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On each occasion, a heightened sense of frustration and despair has been highlighted among these farmers.  The beef talks that took place after the previous round of meat plant protests have not resulted in a successful outcome for these farmers and they are now back out on the streets.  All these farmers and their families want is fair trade and a fair price for their produce.  Instead, as Senators are aware, many of them are producing at below cost price and losing money.  Smaller farmers will feel this most as they do not have the critical mass to negotiate stronger positions on price.  This crisis is affecting beef producers of all types, however.</p><p>We expect a lot from our farmers.  We expect them to adhere to rules and regulations, engage with policymakers and legislators, reduce emissions, improve biodiversity and achieve other environmental outcomes.  However, when they face difficulties such as those we are seeing now, they are left with little or no support, guidance or advice.  The agrifood system is broken in this country.  From inside the farm gate all the way to the consumer both here and abroad, creating consistent high demand for Irish food while also addressing our environmental commitments should be at the heart of any effective solution for the Irish agriculture sector.  The oft repeated narrative or threat that if we do not produce goods, someone else will do so demeans Irish farmers and their produce.  If our produce is so easily produced elsewhere, where is the added value in it coming from Ireland?  This is a question for Bord Bia but one we should keep in mind.</p><p>The continued pursuit of commodity production in a small country such as Ireland does not serve our farmers or environment well.  We must also reflect on the social and economic impacts on our farmers.  Land abandonment and farm consolidation are happening.  Reports suggest that about 1,000 farms go out of business in the EU each day.  This is a staggering number.  Retaining small-scale family run businesses is a must, particularly for a small country such as Ireland.  With all our eggs in one basket of beef and dairy, we are exposed and vulnerable to climate change and the volatility of global markets.  At farm level, our dairy farmers are in receipt of some of the lowest milk prices in Europe and our beef is stagnating at a cost price that is lower than the cost of production.  In the meantime, our emissions keep rising and our biodiversity, animal welfare and water and air quality are compromised.  Where will it end?</p><p>A new land use plan is required both to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change and biodiversity loss and to turn the tide of depressed prices for our farmers.  Farmers will rely significantly on a reformed Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, to deliver these transitions on their farms.  A business as usual approach with a few cherries on top will not suffice.  Food production will always remain central to our agricultural land use but we must at the same time consider other income streams for farmers, including farming for carbon storage and water-----</p></speech>

We have to talk about what is happening outside these gates and around Dublin today.  We have to talk about our farmers.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has been sitting on his hands for too long, unfortunately.  The beef sector agreement was signed six weeks ago and the beef task force has yet to meet.  The Minister needs to call on the factories to withdraw all the injunctions.  That is the impediment to having the talks.  There can be no level playing field while powerful, cartel-like factories have legal injunctions out on farmers.  The protests we are seeing are a direct result of farmers' frustration at the lack of progress the Government is making on the beef sector.  I spoke to farmers yesterday, last night and today and they do not want to be here.  They have farming to do at home and do not want to be surrounding Leinster House or in Dublin with their tractors.  They have lots of work to do.</p> <p>The Minister has to sit down with the farmers.  I know he went out to the protest this morning but he has to sit down and talk.  He also needs to have respect for farmers.  Some of the comments he made yesterday in the D&aacute;il show contempt and disrespect for the farming community.  These are my neighbours and friends.  They are from all over the country and they are struggling to survive.  They are the keepers of rural Ireland who produce the quality food we can be proud of when we travel the world.  The Minister has to meet the farmers halfway.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in calls on the Government to support our Mandatory Beef Price Transparency Bill 2019, which would ensure transparency throughout the supply chain and that a fair price to all farmers for their produce.  We have to sort this out once and for all or this protest will become an everyday occurrence.  I call on the Minister to act.  The buck stops with him and he has to get this issue sorted, not only for the farming community.  We are conscious that people are trying to get to work, hospitals and so on all over this city.  The Minister cannot ignore this issue.</p></speech>

I made comments yesterday on a murder that took place at the beginning of this week.  That was the fifth such murder in seven months on the north side of Dublin.  The situation is clearly out of control.  If this had occurred in any other area of the country, the political system would have screeched to a halt and every available Minister would be seated around a table talking about it.  That has not happened with regard to Coolock and that needs to change.  We are asking for an amendment to the Order of Business to provide that the last hour of the scheduled debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 be substituted with a one-hour discussion on the issue of crime in Dublin and around the country, in light of the most recent murder at the beginning of this week.</p></speech>

We are in a terrible situation.  Dublin city centre is in disarray with farmers protesting and people unable to go about their daily business and get to work in the city.  Farmers feel desperate about prices and the terms and conditions they are being asked to operate under.  We know that no problem will be solved on the streets.  We all thought a solution or at least a formula for a solution was in place when it was agreed at the beginning of September to establish a beef market task force.  Nothing has improved since and farmers are in exactly the same position.  Many people will be frustrated by what is happening on the streets.  There are even whispers suggesting people do not have much sympathy for farmers.  If farmers are complaining and protesting, they have reason for doing so.  This problem has been going on for far too long and we need a solution.  Meat Industry Ireland can no longer sit back and take a <i>laissez-faire </i>approach.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->C&amp;D Foods has taken out injunctions against a couple of people involved in the protests.

We have a proud agricultural tradition in this country; if we do anything well, it is farming.  Farmers are up to meeting the challenges of the market and of climate change, but they are not being given a chance to do so.  I welcome the initiative by the Minister, Deputy Creed, in going out to speak to the protestors, but it is time for everybody involved to sit around a table.  There are no farming organisations out there today, such is the disarray in which we find ourselves.</p> <p>Meat Industry Ireland cannot just sit back and let others deal with the issue of the injunctions.  It must be proactive on the matter, and it is in its interests to take that approach.  Bord Bia and the Government are working hard to win markets for the sector in China and elsewhere.  What is going on is not acceptable.  We want farmers off the street and back on their farms and we want the beef market task force up and running and doing the job it is supposed to do.  It is a tough job but it must be done.</p> <p>I will finish by giving some figures that illustrate starkly the difficulties for farmers.

I propose that this debate be taken at 3 p.m. instead of the resumed debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.  It is a matter of great urgency that the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, has decided to close this resort, which provides respite and holiday services for people with disabilities, without any consultation with its members.  We need a debate today to allow for a postponement of the decision by the Joint Committee on Health last Thursday and to discuss how additional funding can be secured to ensure the service is retained.  There must be an extraordinary general meeting of the IWA to allow members to have their say.  It is not acceptable that the executive members of the IWA should act like a dictatorship by deciding, without any consultation, to close the unit on Friday, 30 November.</p><p>My appeal to avert that closure is a reasonable one.  The same call was made at a rally in Roscommon last Saturday which was organised by a support group in Oran and attended by 2,000 people.  The people of County Roscommon are as one on this matter.  The Minister of State must explain to us the position of the HSE and the Government in regard to the closure of this important service for people with disabilities.  It is an issue of fundamental importance but it is not getting national coverage because most media, including RT&Eacute;, are very much Dublin-oriented.  We have at least had some input from the State broadcaster's regional correspondents.  The matter would have had no publicity at all if not for them and the local media, including local radio stations Shannonside and RosFM, the <i>Roscommon Herald</i>and the <i>Roscommon People</i>.  They are giving the issue oxygen and making sure people in the area know what is going on.</p></speech>

Farmers are agitated and disappointed, as are Senators and Deputies.  I welcome the decision by the Minister, Deputy Creed, to meet with the protestors, but the situation still requires urgent resolution.  The Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association has expressed serious concerns in regard to Bord Bia, the beef prices index and the difficulties in breaking through the deadlock with the meat factories.  These serious problems must be addressed.  As Senator Mulherin said, we want farmers out of the city and back on the land where they want to be, doing what they do best.  It is important to keep cool heads as we work to get the task force up and running as quickly as possible.</p> <p>There was reference on "Morning Ireland" today to a leaked report indicating that county and city councillors will receive a pay rise of &euro;8,000.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, confirmed at an Oireachtas committee meeting earlier today that the review of local authority members' remuneration has not been completed and, as such, the reports of a specific pay increase are not accurate.  He indicated that he saw a draft of the report some months ago and that he made a submission on it two months ago.  Ms Sarah Moorhead SC was commissioned in June 2018 to conduct the review but has still not completed her work and made a comprehensive report.  We are no further on in the matter, although I welcome the indication by the Minister of State that when the report is published, which could possible be in ten days' time, he will publish it immediately.</p></speech>

However, I have been holding off on a particular matter since April 2016, namely, the appointment of a consultant sarcoma specialist at St. Vincent's hospital.  Following meetings with patients, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, agreed to the creation of this post.  One of those meetings was attended by members of the hospital board, who had not been invited.  Since then, we have had a lot of heel dragging.  The post was offered to somebody who decided, after two and a half years, to decline it, even though it is custom and practice that posts be taken up within three months.  In the meantime, there is no specialist available for patients suffering from sarcoma, which is a terminal illness that requires specialist input.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The specialist we had, Dr. Bertuzzi, was sent packing.   I do not mind saying that there is nefarious stuff going on in St. Vincent's Hospital.  I am sure they will come down quite heavily on me but self-interest is evident.  I would like the Minister to come to the House to address those concerns.  I would like to ask him why this post has been languishing for so long when so many of the sufferers who pleaded for it have passed away.  Many other young people are now diagnosed with this condition.</p></speech>

There were 85 people on trolleys on Monday and 75 yesterday.  The list is growing.  I met with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, last week to express my frustration.  We need to ensure a safe environment for the staff of the hospital and for people attending it.  I recently met somebody who chose to stay at home rather than go to the hospital, even though they were very ill.  That is a very sad case.  Something has to happen and somebody has to intervene.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is carrying out an independent review.  What is the status of that review?  There is no sign of the report coming out.  I ask the Leader to bring the Minister in to have a debate on overcrowding in hospitals, especially University Hospital Limerick, as soon as possible for the sake of the safety of patients, staff, and those who attend the hospital every day.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Hackett on her excellent speech in response to the farmers' protest.  I understand it is in the process of being resolved, which is welcome because the farmers' group is raising serious issues.  Senator Hackett is correct when she speaks about the future of sustainable farming in Ireland.  I spoke about an excellent model during the Finance Bill debate last night, that of the Burren Beo Trust and the work being done in the Burren by Mr. Brendan Dunford and his colleagues on sustainable farming.  That is the future.</p> <p>I commend the Dress for Success organisation and the organisers of the great conference being held today.  I had the pleasure of attending this morning where An Taoiseach announced that the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality will have its inaugural meeting on 25 January 2020 when it will look at issues around the serious and ongoing gender pay gap between women and men and issues in respect of ensuring women's equal participation in the workforce.  The conference will be hearing about the importance of childcare, expanded parental and paternity leave, and so on.  I welcome that announcement in the spirit of collegiality.

I ask the Leader to use his offices with the Taoiseach to inquire as to the progress on the gender pay gap legislation which we have been promised since I first introduced my Bill in this House.

Following on from Senator Bacik's comments, I welcome the fact that there appears to have been a breakthrough of sorts in the farming dispute.  What I find particularly frustrating - and I am sure many farmers do as well - is that it seems to take farmers leaving their lands with their tractors to drive up to the gates of Leinster House to get action.  This clearly illustrates that more urgent action is required of the Minister to address this issue and to finally achieve a positive resolution.</p> <p>The main issue I wish to raise relates to mortgage holders.  Mortgage interest rates in the Republic of Ireland are among the highest, if not the highest, in the eurozone.  To provide a practical example, a couple or single individual with a mortgage of &euro;200,000 pays &euro;250 per month more than their eurozone counterparts.  That amounts to &euro;3,000 per annum, which is a serious sum.  This is clearly not right and not fair.  People are asking why this is so.  </p> <p>The other area of the mortgage market about which the Government needs to be more proactive is that of switching.  Many people do not realise they can save thousands of euro by switching their mortgage from one lender to another.  More needs to be done to inform people of the savings that can accrue.  The process of switching mortgage needs to be simplified so that more people take up the opportunity.  More switching would encourage more competition which would, in turn, reduce interest rates.  I ask the Minister to invite the Minister for Finance to the House for a debate on the mortgage market in Ireland and on how Irish mortgage holders are currently being fleeced compared to their European counterparts.  We need to get the Government to be more proactive and we need a campaign to encourage people to switch their mortgages from one lender to another to save themselves a few euro.</p></speech>

As of September this year, we had spent &euro;650,000, &euro;100,000 of which was spent on a video using Bono to sell the notion of Ireland having a seat on the Security Council.  We recently spent another &euro;144,000 sending Ministers to the US to further this cause.  This is nothing but a vanity project.  It serves no citizen in this country in any way.  It does nothing for hard-pressed citizens and it is time it stopped.  It is time that we stepped back and started to use the offices of Ministers to do the jobs they are empowered to do.</p> <p>This morning we were unable to get into Leinster House without using ID cards and at the top of the street we see tractors and farmers taken from their farms.  The level of poverty there is unbelievable.  Somebody remarked that there could not be that much poverty in light of the size of the tractors but the truth of the matter is that the banks own them.  These men and women are in dire straits.  The Leader will be aware that there is a market of 80 million people waiting to buy Irish lamb and beef in Iran.  The only impediment to opening up that market is our lack of an embassy in Tehran.  Why do we not have an embassy there?  Iran has its problems.  Indeed, the Iranian ambassador to Ireland will admit there are problems in his country but there is a market there for Irish beef.  My colleagues were talking earlier about the price of Irish beef being down to &euro;3.30 a kilo.  Good God tonight, are we going to drive our farmers out of business?  It is simply not good enough.  On the one hand, we are off chasing vanity projects while, on the other, we are not looking after our farmers, who are the heart and soul of this country.  I want somebody to explain to the House what good this goddamn vanity project we are chasing will do.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

To be fair to officials and the relevant Ministers, the heavy lifting has been done.  There is a growing consensus among political parties, civic society and diaspora groups and it is now time to put the question to the people.  The Convention on the Constitution has agreed it.  The Senator made the imaginative proposal that the question should be put before the Government travels all around the world to tell the diaspora how much it values them.  Perhaps now is the time that the Government showed them by initiating the referendum. </p> <p>I call for a debate on cross-Border transport and travel, which is an issue that I have raised on several occasions since I became a Senator.  Today, I found out via the Twitter account of our colleague, Senator James Reilly, that the Cabinet has approved a feasibility study on a cross-Border Dublin to Belfast train with a reduced travel time of one hour.  Belfast City Council and councils along the eastern corridor have voted in favour of this and, indeed, Belfast City Council has initiated a feasibility plan to consider the issue.  A feasibility study is a significant and necessary step forward by the Government, and I welcome the announcement.  Rather than make an announcement via the Twitter account of the Senator, who happens to be an election candidate but I shall let people make their own minds up on that aspect, it is important that we get the stakeholders around the table for a discussion.  We must get the chambers of commerce, the councils, local authorities, the Departments in the North and South and, indeed, the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and other elected representatives who have advocated and lobbied for the initiative.  A feasibility plan is vitally important.  However, we need to move on and see it inserted into the capital plans.  The project must become a major priority for the Government, not least given the current political and economic climate and the threats posed by Brexit.  We must all work in collaboration.  I hope and certainly Sinn F&eacute;in hopes that the rail link will not be confined to just being between Belfast and Dublin but can expand across the island and, therefore, address some of the historical infrastructural neglect.</p></speech>

There is no question or doubt about that.  Everybody else seems to make money out of the sweat from farmers' brows.  Prices are chiselled at the meat factory and supermarket yet, for farmers, their costs have risen and incomes have decreased.</p> <p>I was appalled at the remarks made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine when he appeared to draw a parallel between the dignified protests of the farmers and the kidnap, torture and attempted murder of Kevin Lunney.  I do not think there is any such parallel possible.

She is the leading European expert on whistleblowing.  A lot of EU regulations will come down the tracks over the next six to 12 months and, therefore, I strongly encourage all Senators to go to the audiovisual room to hear her presentation.  There will also be plenty of opportunities to ask questions.  She has written a number of books on the topic of whistleblowing so I urge Senators to please avail of the event if they are free.</p> <p>I do not know how many Senators met the farmers yesterday but I hope everyone did as it was well worth doing so.  Senator Conway-Walsh met them last night.  The Senator and I spoke to the farmers and they are ordinary, decent people.  They do not want to be in Dublin but want to be farming.  It takes an awful lot to get ordinary, decent people like them to come here to protest.  I fully support the passionate comments that Senator Mulherin made about farmers.  I ask her to use whatever influence she has on the Government to get it to move faster on all of the issues.  </p> <p>I shall now talk briefly about rural Ireland.

The groups are whipping up fear.  For a number of weeks they have circulated leaflets across the State.  For a number of months they have been holding public meetings and there was a meeting at the Spawell venue in Templeogue last night.</p> <p>One group is called Let Kids be Kids.  It has distributed leaflets, and participated on radio shows such as "The Niall Boylan Show" on Classic Hits 4FM and on fake news outlets such as Gript Media.  It has consciously circulated misinformation for months. </p> <p>Let me give an example of the misinformation.  That children under four years of age will be taught about masturbation and a report by the World Health Organization, WHO, was cited but it has no link or reference to the ongoing curriculum review.   Some leaflets make spurious claims suggesting that reform of relationship and sexuality education will lead to incidents of statutory rape.  On what planet do these people live?  </p> <p>Without doubt, the misinformation is intentional.  It is seen as some sort of bastion of defence against liberalism.  However, they are content not to consider the consequences of not reforming relationship and sexuality education.  They are happy for children to grow up without a formalised curriculum, without getting information about consent, and without a curriculum that helps them to stay safe.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They want to exclude lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people from getting education about sexuality and relationships.

A Sinn F&eacute;in activist in Donegal has pointed out that, "There is a fierce irony in attempting to counteract the perceived inclusion of political propaganda in schools by distributing what is undoubtedly political propaganda in schools."  Being gay in school is still not easy.  A campaign group that goes by the name of "Hands Off Our Kids" is a disgrace because it harks back to an agenda that frames gay men as predatory.

It seems to be the way of things nowadays.  The leak that came out this morning related to councillors' pay and conditions, which is a matter close to the Leas-Chathaoirleach's heart.  Many of us here are quite animated about it.  A great deal of work has been done in recent years.  I understand the Moorhead report will not be released today.  Much of its contents seem to be known.  All that is missing is the circulation of the report.  It has been suggested that the recommendation will be lumped in with another review of pay and conditions.  Up to now, this was not part of the agreement with councillors, who have had a long-outstanding entitlement in respect of their pay and conditions.  There has been a lengthy review.  This process has gone on for years.  The effect of the mealy-mouthed statement we are hearing at this stage is that it is great that there will be a pay increase, and we are happy about that, but-----</p></speech>

All of this is being done as part of a policy that is approved by President Xi, whom we feted when he came to this country, and others in Beijing.  We are on our knees trying to sell beef to these people.  There has not been a whimper of protest from Iveagh House about the Uighur population being the subject of a latter-day psychological holocaust, if I can use that phrase to describe it.  Do we stand for anything anymore?  I do not want to talk about the carbon footprint of the agricultural trade in beef to China.  Is that trade more important than the need to stand up for what we believe in as human beings?  I am shocked that the Irish Government is so weak.  I am grateful to the BBC "Panorama" programme the other day, which showed us the reality of what this savage regime is all about.</p></speech>

We have called previously for a detailed debate on our relationship with that country.  The Asian country with which I am most familiar is Taiwan, which is a democratic republic.  It has a population of 24 million and is the most democratic country in the world.  Ireland does not recognise Taiwan and does not trade with it in any real way.  I suggest that if this Government and previous Governments had treated Taiwan with the respect it deserves, we could be sending much more beef to Taiwan than to mainland China, and without any strings attached.  When I visited Taiwan recently with a number of colleagues, we went to a food trade fair at which almost every European country was represented.  However, the Republic of Ireland was not.  The EU even had a stand.  Most European countries have trade offices in Taipei.  They trade openly with Taiwan.  For some reason, we are afraid to deal with Taiwan.  China only deals with us for commodities it needs.  Otherwise, we would be in the ha'penny place.  It is time for us to wake up and look at markets other than those that are trying to impose themselves on this country.</p></speech>

Senator McDowell has referred to the need to be "truthful".  The agricultural system, as we know it, is broken.  I am not surprised that farmers are on the street because they are running faster and faster just to stand still.  Food is cheap.  As consumers, we have to acknowledge that we are paying too little for food.  I will give the House some figures in support of my contention.  People in the UK and Ireland spend approximately 9% of their disposable income on food.  The European average is approximately 14%.  French people spend almost twice as much of their disposable income on food.  We must be under no illusions about the fact that cheap food is part of this problem.  It is not solely about pricing.  We have all spoken about the three pillars of sustainability.  We all know about economic, social and environmental sustainability.  Farmers are working tirelessly on a daily basis to ensure they produce food as efficiently as they can.  We need to develop systems that will reduce losses.  Most of all, we need to help the agriculture industry to develop robust and healthy animals, genetics to reduce waste, precision farming and positive welfare attributes.  They need support.  It is not all bad.  I am frustrated by the continual bad news stories that are coming from the industry as it comes under immense pressure from animal welfare groups and environmentalists.  I will give the House some statistics that were shared with me yesterday.  We need to stop beating our farmers up because they are doing a good job.</p></speech>
