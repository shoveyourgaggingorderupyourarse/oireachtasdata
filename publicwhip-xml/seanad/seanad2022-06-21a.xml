He will be aware that within the programme for Government there is a very clear commitment to provide for therapeutic services, particularly for children in the care of Tusla.  The Government is developing its plans about expanding and developing the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and it is increasing the number of medical and other interventions for young people and, indeed, support for their families.  I commend the Minister on his work.</p> <p>However, we need to look at that question of the broader range of therapies that are available, and particularly for children in care, many of whom who may have complex needs.  It is about ensuring they have access to appropriate counselling and therapy.  Those services are essential. </p> <p>A quite successful programme has been operated by Tusla in the north inner city in Dublin, as the Minister will be aware.  The child art psychotherapy programme allows children and young people, through use of creative means, such as art, painting and drawing, to express themselves.  It has worked quite well.  The Minister will be aware of the recent Growing Up in Ireland survey, the latest iteration of which was just published by the ESRI, which reported the impact that the past two years have had on children and young people.  There are increasing numbers of young people reporting poor mental health.  The Minister will also be aware that last week Women&rsquo;s Aid reported on what has happened during the Covid period in terms of the number of reports it received, and particularly the impact on children and young people.  There were a number of frightening statistics, however, one stands out.  Women&rsquo;s Aid reported that over the Covid period, 5,400 child abuse or suspected child abuse reports were made.  It is important that we provide, as much as possible, the broadest range of supports.  We have a very clear commitment within the programme for Government to do that.  I hope that the Minister will be able to outline what progress has been made in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-21a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062100002#B00500"><p>Tusla's in-house therapeutic model aims to support and inform front-line practitioners in their day-to-day work with children and families, as well as providing multidisciplinary therapeutic services that can address more complex needs.  It is essential, therefore, that any expansion of this service must have regard to the provision of related services offered by other State agencies.  In that regard, I highlight that overall responsibility for mental health services lies with the Department of Health, through the HSE.</p> <p>Tusla, therefore, funds the HSE to supply psychology services on its behalf to children in care.  Under existing agreements with the HSE, Tusla pays approximately &euro;7 million annually for psychology services provided by the HSE.  Where these services cannot meet a particularly crucial and essential therapeutic need that has been identified, Tusla also purchases additional private therapy sessions.  I have been informed that these therapeutic services are accessed based on the unique needs of each child and delivered as part of their care plan.   </p> <p>As the Senator is probably aware, my Department funds the Child Care Law Reporting Project, CCLRP, which reports on child care court proceedings and engages in research on child law.  In its most recent report, Ripe for Reform, the CCLRP identified issues regarding the provision of mental health services to children as a theme in a number of the child care proceedings it had observed, particularly in terms of CAMHS, which the Senator mentioned.</p> <p>In September 2020, officials from my Department and the Department of Health agreed a revised joint protocol to be adopted by Tusla and the HSE regarding the management and funding of disability placements for children in care, or those transitioning out of State care.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The agreement relates to individuals displaying complex disability, including mental health.  Crucially, this revised joint protocol ensures that the needs of the child or young person are central to all deliberations about them.</p><p>On a separate but related point, Tusla has advised me that in order to enhance the quality and consistency of care to children, it is actively investing in enhancing therapeutic services across the system.  Senator Byrne spoke of the commitment in that regard set out in the programme for Government.</p><p>Action 1.4 of the Tusla business plan for 2022 commits Tusla to work collaboratively with other agencies to investigate, assess and support children, young people and adults who have been abused.  There are also related business plan action points which are relevant to the Senator's query.  These include the mapping of all existing Tusla and Tusla-commissioned therapeutic services completed; finalising a revised integrated framework for therapeutic services for children who have been harmed or abused; and, from the third quarter of this year, all children and young people newly admitted to care will have a multidisciplinary assessment and care plan completed.</p><p>I had the opportunity early this year to visit the north Dublin hub to see the services.  My colleague, Deputy Costello, has always been a strong advocate for these services.  I met the service providers in the Tusla hub and also some of the community services linked to that.  Some &euro;700,000 has been allocated in the financial framework of the business plan for 2022 to roll out the objectives I have just outlined.  </p><p>I also welcome Tusla's strategic approach to deliver an integrated framework for therapeutic services.  This includes a three-year plan to establish a high-level framework and operating model for Tusla therapeutic services within each of its six regions with clear pathways of responses based on the assessed need of each child in care.  I welcome this strategic approach adopted by Tusla, which includes a commitment to establish multidisciplinary teams in each area with clear governance and supervision arrangements.</p><p>Tusla has informed me that it has adopted a project management approach to the development and implementation of the revised integrated framework for therapeutic services for children in care.  This has been progressed with the establishment of a project working group with key stakeholders being brought in.</p></speech>

In particular I welcome the clear commitment that from the third quarter of this year, all children and young people newly admitted to care will have a multidisciplinary assessment and care plan completed.  It is not only important that a care plan is completed but also that it is implemented and that the supports are put in place.  Coming out of the Covid pandemic period, we do not know what its full impact will be and how that may manifest itself in certain areas.  However, we must make sure that every child is allowed to have as full a childhood as possible and where children face difficulties or have complex needs, the State will step in and support them, including through the provision of counselling and therapeutic services.  It is not only that a care plan is provided but that it is also followed through and the necessary supports are put in place.  I know the Minister is committed to doing that but if we were to give that guarantee to every child, it would be very welcome.</p></speech>

The crucial work that Tusla has done has been backed up by my Department with significant additional funding of &euro;66 million in 2021.  I think that is the highest ever annual increase in funding and &euro;41 million was provided last year in budget 2022.  We are investing in Tusla to give it the resources to be able to undertake the kinds of innovative approaches we are seeing in the therapeutic hub in north Dublin.  It will take a little while before this approach can be rolled out across the country.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned multidisciplinary work and it is an issue I have raised with Bernard Gloster and his team several times.  We recognise the importance of having these interlinked and wide-ranging therapies available for the children who need them most.  As Senator Byrne said, that need is particularly great coming out of Covid.  I will be happy to engage with the Senator and other Senators and to provide updates on the roll-out.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, to the Chamber to discuss, once again, healthcare matters in the west of Ireland.  As I always say, it is great to have a Minister of State from the west, who has an interest in this particular area, answering the questions.  As he knows, the national development plan, NDP, under Project Ireland 2040 objectives, states: "In accordance with balanced regional development, a cancer care network for the Saolta region (West, North West) with a Cancer Centre at Galway University Hospital with appropriate infrastructure will be delivered."  This is a welcome commitment for which many people fought, including politicians, practitioners and those with expertise in the field of cancer care in the west.  Those people do a tremendous job in the region with the resources and facilities they have.</p> <p>Unfortunately, as the Minister of State knows, cancer care outcomes in the west of Ireland are not as good as elsewhere in the country.  That is the unfortunate reality.  The survival rates from cancers are lower in the region than they are in other parts of Ireland.  It is not acceptable that any part of the country would be left behind in this fashion.  That is why I welcome the commitment in this regard in the NDP.  One in two of us will get cancer during our lifetime.  This is a frightening statistic but it reflects the reality.  It is the reality because we have an ageing population and people who live longer are more likely to suffer from a number of illnesses.</p> <p>We need to get the best results we can in the west of Ireland.  Unfortunately, the survival rates for such conditions as lung and colorectal cancer are lower than the average for the country.  This is not good enough.  Figures from HSE west show that for breast cancer, there is a cumulative five-year standardised average net survival rate of 80%, compared with the average for Ireland of 85%.  In the case of lung cancer, the survival rate in the HSE west area is 16.7%, compared with the national average of 19.5%.  For colorectal cancers, the survival rate in the west of 62.6% is just below the national average of 63.1%.  The survival rates in the region are worse than the average for the whole country.  These statistics are no reflection of the wonderful work consultants and staff do, but it is a wake-up call on the need for a cancer care strategy and facilities in the west.</p> <p>I welcome the commitment in the NDP but we need to see progress on it.  It is a long way out to 2040, under Project Ireland 2040, and a long way out, under the NDP, to 2030.  We have seen with other projects that actions are put down on paper but their progress and delivery through all the various stages is very slow.  It is incumbent on all politicians in the west of Ireland to drive and push this project forward.  As I understand it, following a great deal of deliberation, it has been agreed that the site will be located at University Hospital Galway, UHG, as stated in the NDP.  There have been larger debates for years on the best use of appropriate sites and, in this instance, whether UHG or Merlin Park University Hospital should be used.  The commitment is now in place for the development of the centre in the grounds of UHG.  We need to see progress and we need timelines that can be adhered to and achieved in order to ensure delivery.</p></speech>

The model of care for hospital cancer treatment is centred on eight designated cancer centres, each serving a defined population and geographic area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->University Hospital Galway, UHG, is one of the eight designated cancer centres.  The centralisation of specialist services into designated cancer centres aims to optimise patient outcomes through case volume, multidisciplinary working and infrastructural supports.  As part of the Saolta University Health Care Group, UHG is the Saolta model 4 hospital delivering 24 hours a day, seven days a week emergency medicine, acute medicine, acute surgery, critical care, maternity, neonatal, paediatric, cancer, laboratory and radiology, alongside a wide range of tertiary referral services for the Saolta Group.</p><p>Recommendation 15 of the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 sets a goal of ultimately developing at least one comprehensive cancer care centre in Ireland that will optimise cancer prevention, treatment, education and research during the strategy period.  It was always envisaged the development of such a centre could only be achieved towards the latter part of the strategy period.  The Department of Health and the national cancer control programme, NCCP, have had preliminary discussions on the best way forward, including the possibilities for comprehensive cancer networks across regions or internationally.  These issues are also the subject of much debate in other EU countries in the context of the Europe's Beating Cancer plan.  It is envisaged that proposals on a way forward in Ireland will be defined shortly, at which stage the matter will submitted to Government for approval.</p><p>With regard to the development of a comprehensive cancer centre at University Hospital Galway, the National Development Plan 2021-2030 sets out, "In accordance with balanced regional development, a cancer care network for the Saolta region (West, North West) with a Cancer Centre at Galway University Hospital with appropriate infrastructure will be delivered."  The Saolta cancer managed clinical and academic network, MCAN, has been formulating proposals for the development of the cancer infrastructure at UHG, with the goal of becoming a comprehensive cancer centre, along with a network of enhanced ambulatory cancer services at Letterkenny, Sligo, Castlebar and Portiuncula.  Both the NCCP and the Department acknowledge the work that has been initiated in this regard.  However, the national policy in regard to a comprehensive cancer centre and cancer structures nationally has yet to be worked up and agreed.  It is most important that developments in UHG and Saolta fit in with the national approach and take realistic account of the overall limitation on resources.</p><p>Furthermore, a new &euro;56 million radiation oncology facility is under construction at UHG under the national programme for radiation oncology, NPRO.  The facility will include seven radiotherapy treatment vaults, a brachytherapy suite, two CT rooms, MRI, on-treatment support and ancillary physics, treatment planning and administration facilities.  Construction of this new facility is expected to be completed in 2023.</p><p>The Department of Health and the NCCP continue to work closely with UHG on short-term actions to continue to support the delivery of cancer services through UHG and the Saolta hospital group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-21a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062100002#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply.  I acknowledge and welcome that there are plans and a commitment to develop this very important centre, although the timeline is not spelled out.  According to the experts, what is urgently needed is the functional cancer centre at University Hospital Galway, including inpatient beds, operating theatres, cancer ICU, an ambulatory rapid access diagnostic centre, a haematology oncology day ward and outpatients department, and modern laboratories, as well as functional regional cancer infrastructure, including ambulatory cancer centres at regional Saolta hospitals, supporting diagnostics, imaging pathology and multidisciplinary teams across the network, supported by a regional network of GP and primary care facilities.</p> <p>I welcome the response the Minister of State has given but, as I said, we need to progress this and ensure there are no undue delays.  Obviously, when the time comes, funding will be an issue but it is committed to and contained within the national development plan and Project Ireland 2040.  We need to see progress in regard to the site, the various strategic assessment reports and preliminary business cases, all of the various stages of the spending code of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the lodging of the planning application.</p></speech>

Galway University Hospital provides diagnostic services for breast, lung and prostate tumours, with a satellite service for breast cancer at Letterkenny University Hospital.  The hospital has a reputation for the delivery of high-quality, innovative and safe care for patients, particularly through the provision of medical, surgical and radiation oncology services.</p> <p>As the Senator knows, over the past two years more than &euro;40 million in new development funding has been secured for the ongoing implementation of the national cancer strategy.  It is the largest investment in the strategy since its launch in 2017.  The funding is also being used to increase and bolster existing services, including those delivered through University Hospital Galway, while also facilitating the development and implementation of new services in all cancer clinical programmes.  Furthermore, a new &euro;56 million radiation oncology facility is under construction at the hospital.  This facility will include all of the various services.  I believe it will be completed in 2023.</p> <p>While no decision has yet been made on the development of a comprehensive cancer centre as outlined in the national cancer strategy, the Department of Health and the national cancer control programme continue to engage with University Hospital Galway to ensure it continues to deliver high-quality cancer services to patients in the west and north west.</p></speech>

This matter is with regard to the Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill.  I thank Grace Kearney from the Bridgeway Family Resource Centre in Ballymahon whom I met recently on a visit to Ballymahon Vocational School.  She highlighted this serious issue and the epidemic among children as young as 12 years of age who vape on a regular basis.  It is seen as cool.  The reality is that teenagers do not know what they are putting into their bodies.  It is seen as cheap, accessible and acceptable in society.  Many parents allow the activity unaware of the consequences or unaware that their children are vaping.  People can hide the fact they are vaping due to the fact the smoke disappears.  The smells and the tastes are like bonbons in a shop with flavours such as mango, bubblegum and strawberry.  There are 40 or 50 different versions.</p> <p>People can buy disposable vapes for as little as &euro;5.  These can give up to 10 to 20 mg of nicotine.  People can buy vapes with up to 50 mg, which is the equivalent of 50 cigarettes.  Some children are inhaling these to get a buzz instead of using drugs.  This is what they can do apart from putting nicotine into their system.  I have heard stories of shops delivering these products to children at certain venues such are the profits that can be made from them.</p> <p>What is this doing to the health of our children?  What is it doing to their lungs?  Children are pulling out of sports because of the reduction in their fitness.  They are not fit to play football or take part in sport because of this.  We need to license these products properly as we do with cigarettes.  We need to introduce a ban on the use of vaping in sports grounds.  The reality is that it is cheap and cool and people are uneducated about it.  We need strong robust legislation to help us police it.  We need this immediately prior to the summer recess.</p></speech>

As we are aware, these shops are springing up all over our towns.  They are located in prime locations with very expensive rents.  They seem to be open on a daily basis.  I have never come across a shop that just sells cigarettes because it would not be financially viable to do so.  Something needs to be done on the regulation of these shops.  I am aware that the committee on health has had a number of pre-legislative scrutiny discussions regarding the Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must try to strike a balance between the potential benefits of e-cigarettes for adult smokers trying to quit and the risks that more non-smokers, particularly children and especially young children, will start vaping.</p><p>As Senator Carrigy said, there is evidence that children aged as young as ten and upwards are vaping.  The ban on sales of e-cigarettes to minors and the sales licensing system are measures that are needed, and a ban on cigarette flavours, which are believed to appeal largely to children and young adults, should be adopted.  I understand there is a consensus among those selling these products that an age limit of 18 should be reduced, but that they disagree with a ban on the flavours.  While e-cigarettes face fewer restrictions than the sale of tobacco cigarettes, as they are considered consumer products, the EU tobacco products directive does regulate some aspects of e-cigarettes, including: minimum standards of safety and quality; notification of ingredients; packaging and labelling, including health warnings; and a ban on advertising in print, broadcast, online and other electronic media, although outdoor advertising is allowed on buses and billboards, for example.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation are concerned that the number of young people vaping is increasing.  In 2015, 23% of young teenagers used these e-cigarettes.  By 2019, this had increased to 37% and I suggest it is even more now.  Therefore, in October 2020, the Health Research Board, HRB, published a report that stated that adolescents who used an e-cigarette were three to five times more likely to start smoking than those who did not.  This is an important issue.  It is as important as when we had to consider legislation to address the head shops in 2009.  After much work by the late Senator Nicky McFadden, me and others, those shops were banned in the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010, which stemmed from the so-called "party Bill".  Those shops were closed.  This issue is just as important.</p></speech>

The Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill 2019, which deals with these matters, is a legislative priority for this Government.  Nicotine inhaling products, such as electronic or e-cigarettes, are relatively new and the science concerning their public health effects is continuously evolving.  Analysis in this regard is made more difficult by the rapid and continuing evolution of the products themselves.  For example, an e-cigarette from ten years ago is nothing like the products currently on the market.  Important questions exist around the use of these products and there is no scientific consensus on their harms or benefits.</p> <p>On one side of the argument is the risk of possible long-term health effects from e-cigarette use and the question as to whether they may act as a gateway for young people to smoking tobacco products.  Against this, there are the possibilities that e-cigarettes could act as a substitute for combustible tobacco products for smokers and assist some smokers to quit and therefore reduce the enormous levels of disease and death caused by smoking tobacco products.</p> <p>In 2019, the HRB was asked to carry out evidence reviews on electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products on behalf of the then Minister for Health.  The HRB was asked to examine the available evidence on three topics: the effectiveness of electronic cigarettes as a cessation aid for smokers; the relative health harms and benefits of electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products; and what association, if any, could be found between the use of electronic cigarettes among adolescents and the subsequent initiation of smoking tobacco products.  </p> <p>In 2020, the findings of these evidence reviews were published.  On the effectiveness of e-cigarettes in helping smokers to quit, the HRB review found that e-cigarettes are as effective as nicotine replacement therapy as an aid to smoking cessation for observed periods of up to six months.  On the relevant health harms and benefits of e-cigarettes, the research found they are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes but that further research was needed.  On heated tobacco products, the review found that there was insufficient evidence from which to draw conclusions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On whether e-cigarettes used by adolescents increased the likelihood of smoking, the review found a strong association in the majority of examined studies between the use of e-cigarettes and a subsequent uptake in smoking.  While the likelihood of smoking initiation varied across the studies, the conclusion was there was a higher likelihood among adolescents who used e-cigarettes.</p><p>Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of many of the measures contained within the public health (tobacco and nicotine inhaling products) Bill that is currently in development.  We do not want our children to vape and the Bill will prohibit the sale of these products to or by anyone under the age of 18.  The Bill will also introduce a licensing system for the retail sale of nicotine inhaling products such as e-cigarettes.  A separate licence for each premises that sells these products will be required and an annual fee will apply.  The creation of a comprehensive list of retail outlets where these products are sold will also assist the HSE in its enforcement of existing legislation on e-cigarettes under European Union law.</p><p>The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the intention is that it will proceed to enactment as soon as possible.  The draft law will require submission at EU level to assess its alignment with Single Market principles and, subject to this process, it will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  Pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill began on 3 November 2021 and the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health on that process is awaited.  Once again, I thank the Senators for raising this important public health issue.</p></speech>

I also thank Senator Wilson for sharing this Commencement matter with me and I support his comments.</p> <p>The Minister of State in his reply said the review found a strong association in the majority of the examined studies between the use of e-cigarettes and a subsequent uptake in smoking.  That is a key point. If we want to stop young people from smoking, we need to ban these substances.  We do not know what this can lead to.  We are allowing people to be addicted at 12 years of age.  How are they going to be able to fund this addiction other than turning to crime?  The legislation needs to be implemented before the summer recess.</p></speech>

I thank him for his comprehensive reply.  I welcome that this Bill is progressing and I would like if it could be speeded up as soon as possible.  This is very necessary legislation and it is important it is brought in as a matter of urgency.  More importantly, when it is brought in, it is important it is enforced because these shops are springing up daily in our towns and villages.  Anything we can do to discourage that should be done.</p></speech>

A tobacco products directive that was published in 2014 was transposed into Irish law following the EU legislation.  Under the regulations, health warnings that advise consumers that electronic cigarettes contain nicotine are mandatory on packaging.  The regulations also provide for mandatory safety and quality requirements for electronic cigarettes and refill containers, including maximum nicotine concentrations and maximum volumes for cartridges, tanks and nicotine liquid containers.  E-cigarette manufacturers or importers are required to notify the HSE of all products they place on the market, and if a manufacturer, importer or distributor has a reason to believe the product is not safe, they are required to notify the HSE immediately and to explain what corrective action has been taken.</p> <p>Advertising for e-cigarettes is also prohibited on television, radio, online and in printed publications.  The tobacco products directive is currently being reviewed as part of the EU's Europe's Beating Cancer Plan, and it is very likely this will result in proposals for further regulation of electronic cigarettes.</p> <p>The measures contained in the public health (tobacco and nicotine inhaling products) Bill, together with the existing regulations provided by the tobacco product directive, will create a comprehensive regulatory system for electronic cigarettes in Ireland.  Taken together, these laws will ensure e-cigarettes and related products and those businesses that operate in this market are appropriately regulated and will act, as the Senators have said, to prevent young people from accessing and using these products.</p></speech>

Last year, he included the wholesale fruit and vegetable market in Dublin 7 in the more than &euro;121 million allocated funding for urban regeneration in the north inner city of Dublin.  We greatly appreciate the funding.  I have asked him to update the House on the progress that has been made by Dublin City Council, DCC, in using the funding to reopen the fruit and vegetable market.  Please advise the House on how his Department can support DCC to achieve an early re-opening of the market.</p> <p>As the Minister will be aware, the market is housed in an iconic Victorian building located behind the Four Courts in one of the oldest parts of this city where the streets date back to medieval times.  The distance from the Spire to Smithfield is 1 km and, therefore, the market is in the middle of the city and is served by the Luas transport system.  In addition, the market is located within walking distance of all of the major attractions in the city centre.  The Victorian building is iconic with its facade of red bricks, wrought iron, wood and steel.  The building was purpose-built in 1892 by Dublin Corporation to allow local producers to sell their fruit and vegetables to residents and businesses.  For generations, and for most of my life, the market bustled with activity and I am sure that the Minister will be aware of that himself.  The market is a quintessential and unique Dublin institution with its building, the activity there and the generations of families who traded at the market.</p> <p>As far back as 2001, DCC came up with a framework to redevelop the market.  In 2005, the adjacent fish market was demolished and that has been replaced by a car park.  In 2004, when I was elected to the council, I worked with the traders and officials to upgrade the market building by rewiring it, and replacing and repainting the roof.  Significant funding went into it at that time but, sadly, since 2019, the site has lain vacant.  The council said that it needed vacant possession and the market is lying vacant, which is a shame.  One pop-up Chinese New Year festival took place at the venue but otherwise it has been rented out as a builder's yard.  The building is now empty and that is shameful.  The design of the building is spectacular and, therefore, it has enormous potential to act as a culinary, cultural, commercial and community point in the city centre.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope that the Minister can advise the House on what progress has been made by Dublin City Council because the latest report from the local authority has indicated it will be another two years.  Another two years does not sound like a long time but in the context of more than 20 years already talking about this, it is unacceptable.  It is de-motivating for other businesses in the area, for the local community and for the wider city.</p><p>I hope the Minister can advise the House on what actions his Department can support Dublin City Council with to reopen it.  Ideally, it should be opened, at least on a pilot basis, once a week.  It is a huge space.  Conservation works could take place in parallel.</p><p>I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p></speech>

I am acutely aware of them.  I visited them when I was much younger when they were a bustling place that was full of life, full of enterprise and an important part of the north inner city.</p> <p>By way of a little background, the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund is a cornerstone of the Government's response to ensure that right across the country, no less so than here in Dublin, we are providing funding to the local authorities directly to regenerate and rejuvenate areas such as the Victorian fruit and vegetable markets in St. Mary's Lane.</p> <p>To date, the Government has committed &euro;1.7 billion of Exchequer funding to move forward with projects.  I have had the pleasure of seeing in a number of areas right across the country, such as in Kilkenny, Tralee and Limerick, where this funding is already being drawn down and used to deliver significant regeneration works that are driving enterprise in those areas.  In Kilkenny, for example, in the Abbey quarter, there will be 450 new jobs in that space.  I want to see Dublin City Council, DCC, do the same.</p> <p>We have allocated to DCC in call 1 approximately &euro;190 million for projects in the north inner city.  I have sought an update from Dublin City Council, which informs me that it is developing the preliminary business case for the north inner city concept area 1 project in line with requirements.  I am being told I will receive that in the coming weeks.  I want that in the coming weeks.  The "coming weeks" should be by the end of July.  If I need to sit down and meet the city council in this regard with Senator Fitzpatrick, I will certainly do that.</p> <p>St. Mary's Lane in Dublin 7 is a sub-project of the larger urban regeneration project providing significant investment in the rejuvenation of Dublin's north inner city.  With Senator Fitzpatrick's support, and insistence, and rightly so, we allocated &euro;5.625 million specifically for the Victorian fruit and vegetable market sub-project.</p> <p>I am informed that the local authority has now appointed a conservation specialist who will identify works, methodology and specifications for refurbishment and conservation works because it is an important building.  That will ensure the highest standard of protection for the structure.  I am being told that this report is also due in the coming weeks.  I want to see definitive timelines on this, not ones that are open to interpretation.  On completion of the report, the local authority will procure a design team and contractor to complete the conservation works.</p> <p>I am strongly encouraging Dublin City Council to expedite the process here.  It has appointed a conservation specialist.  Let us see how quickly that work can be done.  There have been previous plans.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel on this issue.</p> <p>I want to see that area of Dublin, in particular, the markets, being a living and working space that is full of life and that will breathe life into that area.  I am taking a personal interest in this particular project.  With the significant moneys that we have allocated, I want to see those moneys drawn down by DCC and being put to active use, as I am seeing in other parts of the country.</p></speech>

Those funds will be used not just for the fruit and vegetable market but for Moore Street, Wolfe Tone Square where DCC has done a fantastic job, Mountjoy Square and the city library we need to see delivered as well.  I hear the Minister's frustration and I share it.</p><p>Locally people are really at their wit's end because DCC has been bringing forward plans for what to the naked eye is a purpose-built building that is fit for use for more than 20 years.  I appreciate the council has given the Minister a commitment that he will get a report within the coming weeks but I would welcome a meeting on-site with the council.  I have to believe with the collective will and energy and the resources that have been applied to this we have an opportunity to reopen it early.  Maybe it will not be open fully seven days a week but let us aim to have it open at least once a week and start it as a pilot.  We have to make people believe DCC is serious about reopening it.  At this point, after more than 20 years, there is not that confidence.  It hurts me to say this but there is not the confidence DCC is serious about delivering it.  We know that is not the case so let us make it real.</p></speech>

He is 100% correct.  I have been in the buildings with Senator Fitzpatrick and, fortunately, they are in good shape.  I remain to be convinced of the level of restoration work required to bring the market back into use.  We can look to the English Market in Cork, El Nacional in Barcelona and others.  We can see what they add to their areas.  I have no doubt whatsoever the fruit and vegetable market will be incredibly popular with people and will be a hub for enterprise but also for community.</p> <p>Following the Senator's intervention, I am going to seek a more detailed, concise report from DCC with specific dates in it.  I will absolutely commit to a meeting on-site with her and senior officials to move this forward because we know what needs to be done here.  If we can, even on a temporary basis and provided it does not impinge on the works that need to be done, look at opening it up at various times, I want to see this work start.  I am aware there is a process to follow through and commend DCC on the work it has done heretofore but I share the frustration of the Senator and residents of the area.  With my Department working with DCC and the Senator we can look to expedite this process.</p> <p>Following this debate I will write to the city manager to seek a meeting on-site in the coming weeks.  I will seek a more concise report with specific timelines on delivery.  I do not want to see the opening of the market delayed until 2024, so we need to be able to do everything we can to shorten that timeframe.  That is what I want to do.  I again thank the Senator for her continued support for this project on behalf of Dublin and residents of the north inner city as well.

We are entering a quite exciting renewables phase.  The technology is advancing and the opportunity to generate renewable electricity, particularly off the west coast, is evident to everybody.  In recent weeks, the Taoiseach referred to the cost-of-living crisis, particularly the energy crisis we now face, and acknowledged what we all know is a fact, that is, that we are in for a difficult seven or eight years ahead.  This will mean the decarbonisation of our energy production when there is energy price inflation.  One solution, as advocated by the Government, is to become more self-sufficient and produce more of our own energy, and to do so through renewables such as offshore wind.  This will be the key to generating more electricity domestically and having a more sustainable supply for ourselves that we can say is green and decarbonises the economy.</p> <p>Many people, following the Taoiseach's comments and others by the Government, were asking where the Government's strategy on offshore wind energy is.  They were asking about our plan of action for the rest of this year, next year, the short term, the medium term and the long term.  We realise there is a technological challenge but we also know the technology exists.  Other countries are already using it, so there is no reason we cannot do the same.  We can become a net exporter of energy if we do the right thing and put the right investment and infrastructure in place.  We need to manage the environmental impacts of putting wind turbines in the sea, and we also need to work with our fishermen, fisherwomen and fishing communities to make sure they are not negatively impacted.  I am sure we can achieve the right balance in this regard, working closely with them.  People are now looking for hope.  They are looking to see what the Government is doing to deal with the energy crisis at a time when energy costs are rising.  We know we are too vulnerable when it comes to sources of energy from outside our own country, and we also know we burn too much fossil fuel in this country to generate electricity.</p> <p>With these two points in mind, it would be welcome to hear about the Government's strategy and what we aspire to achieve as a country in the coming years, particularly along the west coast.  I am from County Mayo.  From having lived there, I can attest that it is one of the windiest counties in the country, but the opportunities are immense.  We have a vast coastline.  The same applies to Clare, Galway, Sligo and Donegal.  There are immense opportunities for offshore wind energy generation, but it will be expensive and require a significant State investment to put the infrastructure in place, work with communities and work to ensure we can achieve our goal of being more self-sustaining and self-sufficient in the production of our energy.</p> <p>I acknowledge that we have particular planning difficulties associated with many of these initiatives.  This will have to be addressed.  I would welcome the Minister of State's comments on how we are to deal with the planning process for wind turbines, particularly because offshore wind energy will present new challenges that we may not have dealt with in planning for renewable energy sources previously.</p> <p>I have a question about the grid.  There is little point in producing vast amounts of electricity offshore if we cannot transfer it to the national grid.  We are aware that we have considerable vulnerabilities in the grid, particularly in the west.  I understand and acknowledge that EirGrid has been invested in significantly in recent weeks to increase capacity, but ambition in this regard to match our ambitions for increasing renewable energy seems to be lacking.  We have to match our ambitions with investment in the grid so the two can work together.</p> <p>Could the Minister of State talk about the strategy for the short and medium terms, the level of investment by the State to realise it, the percentage of our energy we expect to derive from offshore wind and how we are going to deal with grid capacity to capitalise on the energy we produce?</p></speech>

I do not know what school they are from.  We are now dealing with Commencement matters, which are matters raised very briefly by Senators in the House.  A relevant Minister comes in to respond and the sessions are very tight.  The guests are very welcome and I hope they enjoy their day.  I hope we inspire one or two of them to enter politics.</p></speech>

We have a sea area of 490,000 sq. km, which is about seven times the size of our land area.  Because of Ireland's location at the edge of the Atlantic and the EU, we have more energy potential than most countries in Europe.  The climate action plan of 2021 includes a suite of actions to realise the full potential of the totality of Ireland's offshore renewable energy resources, and it also commits to the achievement of 5 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Our programme for Government sets out a further commitment to develop a long-term plan to harness the estimated potential of at least 30 GW of offshore floating wind power in our Atlantic waters, which could enable Ireland to become a major regional generator and exporter of offshore renewable energy.</p><p>The 5 GW target will be primarily met through the development of offshore renewable energy in Ireland's eastern and southern coastal regions.  This reflects the suitability of water depths in these regions for the deployment of conventional fixed bottom offshore wind turbines and existing electricity grid infrastructure to connect these projects to the onshore grid.  Subsequent cost-effective deployment of renewables in deeper waters off the west coast, in order to take advantage of greater wind resources, should be increasingly feasible through future advances in floating turbine technology.</p><p>The national marine planning framework, NMPF, was published in 2021 and brings together all marine-based human activities for the first time, outlining the Government's vision, objectives and marine planning policies for each marine activity, including port activity and offshore renewable energy.  The Maritime Area Planning Act was enacted in late 2021 and provides the legal underpinning to an entirely new marine planning system, which will balance harnessing our huge offshore wind potential, while protecting our rich and unique marine environment.</p><p>An eight-week MAC application window for the first batch of projects, known as the phase 1 projects, coming in under the new regime was opened on 25 April 2022 and will close on 22 June 2022, with the first MACs expected to be granted in quarter 3 of 2022.  The first phase of offshore wind in Ireland will be necessary, but not sufficient, to reach our 2030, 5 GW ambition.  An additional phase is required, comprising projects which can deliver by 2030 and before we complete the transition to a plan-led enduring regime. </p><p>The Department is currently reviewing submissions on a recent consultation to gather views on the scale, make-up and sequencing of phase 2 of offshore wind deployment.  A new offshore renewable energy development plan, OREDP Il, will be published in the first quarter of 2023.  It will assess Ireland's offshore energy resource potential, including for floating wind off the west coast, and will provide an evidence base for the identification of the areas most suitable for the sustainable development of fixed and floating wind, wave and tidal technologies in the Irish exclusive economic zone, while also considering other maritime activities and marine biodiversity. </p><p>The OREDP Il, along with a planned economic analysis, will set out the pathway for the long-term sustainable development of offshore renewable energy beyond 2030.  This plan will provide a framework for the future sustainable development of Ireland's ORE resources.</p><p>A cross-departmental offshore wind delivery task force has been established to drive delivery and capture wider and longer-term economic and business opportunities associated with the development of offshore renewables in Ireland.  This will include the identification of supporting infrastructure development and supply chain opportunities as Ireland's offshore wind industry is developed.  The development of offshore renewable energy in Ireland will bring us closer to achieving our energy and climate goals, reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels and increasing our security and diversity of energy supply.</p></speech>

There is some positive stuff in it, but it appears to be lacking in terms of the level of ambition we would like to see for the west of Ireland.  I understand the technology is slightly different and is not as easy to install floating, as opposed to fixed bottom, turbines, but the Minister of State acknowledged in his reply that the wind resources off the west coast are far greater than elsewhere.  If we are serious about achieving our 2030 targets, which we are currently not on track to meet, and we want to do more than that longer-term, that is where we have to be ambitious and what we should aim for.</p> <p>I ask for a renewed commitment to advancing projects in the west of Ireland because that is where we will reap the greatest benefit.  It should not deter us because it is the more difficult option; if it is the better option it is the one we should pursue now and not wait for ten years when we will have missed our 2030 target.  </p> <p>I also welcome the new development plan, OREDP II.  It will consider the possibility of offshore wind for the west coast.  We will be waiting with bated breath to read that plan next year.  We hope we will deliver it in quarter 1, as the Minister of State promised in his response.</p> <p>I did not hear anything from the Minister of State about the level of investment the Government is putting into the development of offshore wind.  I am not sure if he has any answers to that at the moment.  If he does not, his officer might forward that information on at the earliest opportunity.  I ask for some more detail on the cross-departmental offshore wind delivery task force.  Who is on it?  Does the Minister of State sit on it?  Are there any Members of the Oireachtas on it?  Does it meet in public or in private?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Is there access to the minutes?

It has faster speeds and more regular wind and, therefore, there is more to be harvested.  However, it also has deeper waters and a more environmentally sensitive coastline.  There are, for example, the Cliffs of Moher and many beauty spots along the west.  It is, therefore, harder to develop wind there using the conventional approach, which is to put a wind turbine in the sea and build it onto foundations.  That can be done in the shallow waters of the east coast where the wind is not so strong.  We are moving towards floating wind turbines, which are a newer technology that is not quite yet commercial.  However, I was in Portugal recently.  They have a floating turbine there as a pilot and all their water is deep.  We are not the only country in the world that is facing this issue.  Japan is in the same situation in trying to face this.  Our current plan is to not build floating turbines until after 2030.  However, there is a war in Ukraine.  There is an accelerated need to move towards renewable energy.  We know this because long-distance commuters are feeling pain when they have to put petrol in their cars.  People are who are on low incomes are finding it hard to heat their homes because the enormous price of fossil fuels.</p> <p>There is an acceleration across Europe.  The European Commission&rsquo;s REPowerEU plans are all about how we speed up the development of offshore wind and renewables in general, as well as how we can go beyond our current plans.  I, therefore, ask the Senator to watch this space.</p></speech>

I would like him to make a statement regarding the recent HIQA report on University Hospital Limerick.  It is a damaging, concerning, disappointing and shocking report.  I have been raising the issue of UHL in this House, as well as with the Minister for Health, for a long time.  I raise issues every week.  While there are positive things that happen there, this report is damaging.  It is important that the Minister acknowledges the concerns around the hospital.</p> <p>I welcome that the visit was unannounced.  I had been calling for this, because I believe that in an unannounced visit we can get the true sense of the issues within the hospital.  I have written to the Minister seeking the terms of reference of the independent group that he is asking to look at the hospital and the issues present there.  I believe that this report should inform what the independent group looks at.  </p> <p>The report outlined many disturbing facts and concluded that UHL was mainly non-compliant with all HIQA standards.  That is most frightening.  Throughout the report, it can be seen that of the many examinations that took place, none of them concluded that the hospital was compliant.  There have been recent reports of patients going missing.  There are not enough neurological nurses, which I have highlighted in the House in the past.  I was told that three were sufficient but I believe that eight are required.  </p> <p>Some solutions have been suggested, including the provision of 100 beds.  However, Professor Lenihan said the other evening that they need more than 200 beds to bring the hospital up to standard.  More than 200 patients have been waiting for over four years for appointments for diabetes.  These issues are not helping the overcrowding conditions.  </p> <p>During Covid-19, 98 extra beds as well as 11 extra critical care beds were provided but that has not been enough.  Improved access to special infection prevention, supporting staff with education and training, improving clinical audits, activity within the emergency department and staffing levels are all issues that were highlighted in the report.  I believe the Minister for Health and his Department can no longer bury their heads in the sand and ignore the crisis any further.  Doing so will be a reflection of the fact that, at the moment, his concerns do not seem to be around overcrowding in UHL.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I really believe it is the worst hospital in the country in that respect.  On one day alone last month, there were 126 people on trolleys.  Standard 6.1 states: "Service providers plan, organise and manage their workforce to achieve the service objectives for high quality, safe and reliable healthcare."  The report concluded that UHL was non-compliant in this matter as staff shortages were always present and staff deficits varied between 17% and 33%.</p><p>With regard to the quality and safety dimension, the report found that UHL was also non-compliant on the two national standards that were assessed.  Furthermore, UHL was found to be non-compliant regarding service users' dignity, privacy and autonomy, which is highly disturbing as patient confidentiality is crucial in all healthcare settings.  The hospital was also found to be non-compliant in the service provider's ability to protect service users from the risk of harm associated with design and delivery of healthcare services.  The conclusion of the report states that while it was the second busiest emergency department in 2021, UHL had the second lowest bed stock compared with other model 4 hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Another point that was highlighted is that elective hospitals in other areas are being progressed.  In Limerick that is certainly not the case.</p><p>It is deeply concerning that there has not yet been a single comment from the Minister on the report.  Undoubtedly the crisis is dangerous, not only for the people of Limerick and the mid-west but also for the staff.  That is the really frightening part.  I have been speaking to some of the staff and morale is on the floor.  The report from last Friday needs to be considered in a serious light and taken as part of the independent review the Minister is ordering.  The issues need to be addressed.  Limerick and the mid-west deserve a better standard of healthcare, not only for the patients and their families but for the staff working there as well.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</p></speech>

I also welcome the publication of HIQA's report of the unannounced inspection of the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick against the national standards for safer better healthcare.  Four national standards were assessed as part of the HIQA inspection, two standards in each of the two dimensions of capacity and capability, and quality and safety.  HIQA judged that UHL was partially compliant against one standard and non-compliant against the remaining three standards.</p> <p>The inspection focused particularly on the important issues of patient flow and inpatient bed capacity in the hospital; respect, dignity and privacy for people receiving care in the emergency department; and staffing levels in the ED.  As Minister of State, I am concerned about the significant risk to service users identified in the report.  I am pleased that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, recently requested the HSE to appoint an expert review team to work with hospital management to improve ED performance at UHL.  In addition, the Minister also requested the HSE to prepare short-term and longer term unscheduled care performance improvement plans for all our emergency departments, including UHL.</p> <p>The compliance plan agreed by UHL with HIQA to bring about compliance with the relevant standards contains short-term, within three months, medium-term, within six months, and long-term, within three years, actions.  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to ensure the ED performance improvement plan for UHL and the expert team review operate in concert with the compliance plan included in the HIQA report.</p> <p>In addition, UHL also commissioned Deloitte to review and advise on unscheduled care and patient flow in the hospital.  The expert team will consider the outputs of this work in its review.  Both Deloitte and the HSE expert review team are due to submit reports which are expected to help identify potential mitigations for the problems outlined in the HIQA report.</p> <p>It must be recognised that University Hospital Limerick continues to deal with record volumes of patients attending its ED.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There were more than 76,000 attendances at the emergency department in UHL in 2021, up 16% compared with 2020.</p><p>There continues to be substantial investment in UHL to address capacity issues, including a 28% increase in the workforce since the end of 2019 and the opening of an additional 98 non-ICU acute beds.  To deal with this increased level of presentations, reform of service delivery as outlined in Sl&aacute;intecare is vital.  This includes the expansion of community care and other measures to provide people with the care they need outside emergency departments.  We are working to improve patient flow and egress from hospital by providing more home care packages and nursing home supports.  Investment of &euro;1.1 billion was allocated in budget 2021 to expand capacity, increase services and support reform.  That level of investment has been maintained in budget 2022.</p></speech>

While I acknowledge there has been significant investment and expansion of services, it is not enough.  This report has made that clear.  I am disappointed that the Department has not acknowledged that services need to be expanded further.  I acknowledge the Department is awaiting the expert report but it is not right that the people of the mid-west are subjected to these conditions.  It is the most overcrowded hospital in the country.</p> <p>There are many good things about the hospital.  It has won several awards in different areas.  Not all the departments are affected by overcrowding - I do not want the story to go out that they are - but the emergency department is a significant concern and needs to be attended to.  The Minister must acknowledge straightaway that these issues need to be dealt with because the situation is at crisis point.  It is very deflating for staff, families and patients to hear other patients saying they are afraid to go to the hospital.  That is the most frightening statement a person could make.  That needs to be acknowledged by the Minister.</p> <p>The Department and the HSE cannot afford to put their heads in the sand any more.  There has been significant investment but there is a need for an independent group to see what is working right and what is not working, bring the two together and deliver a report.  Any such report must not sit on a shelf, however; it needs to be implemented.</p></speech>

However, I believe the report provides an important opportunity for a renewed focus on the capacity and capability of UHL and on the quality and safety of the emergency services it delivers to the people of the mid-west.  The Senator has articulated those issues extremely well.  HIQA reviews are essential in ensuring that the resources required to underpin patient safety are optimised and that learning is shared across all hospitals and the health service generally.  A strong quality and safety culture is associated with a responsive health system that listens and learns to improve services.</p> <p>The Department regularly seeks assurance regarding the appropriate escalation measures for emergency department overcrowding.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, significant resources have been invested in UHL in recent years.  This has seen an increase in its workforce of 28%, or 796 whole-time equivalents, since the end of 2019.  In addition, 98 new beds have been provided since the start of 2020, including a 60-bed modular ward block that was established to provide a rapid-build interim solution to begin to address the bed capacity issue at the hospital and to improve patient flow.  A further 96-bed block is currently in planning for the hospital.</p> <p>The performance of hospital emergency departments is under constant review by the Department through ongoing engagement with the HSE.  I assure Members that the Government and the Minister are committed to driving improvement in emergency department performance.  I again thank the Senator for raising these concerns.  They will be brought back to the Minister and the Department.</p></speech>

The consultation takes place in the Galway Harbour Hotel.  It starts on 23 June, running from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m on that day, and continues from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on 24 June.  Along with many other people, I attended a launch of the public consultation yesterday.  The members of the Galway hydrogen hub consortium include SSE Renewables, National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Eacute;ireann, the Port of Galway, Aer Arann Islands, Aran Islands Ferries and Lasta Mara Teo.</p> <p>This is an innovative approach to decarbonising sectors, particularly those that cannot be electrified.  It is a multimodal, zero emission, green hydrogen transport hub that can be easily replicated throughout Ireland.  It is a wonderful initiative and a new approach.  Clearly, there are other things that are needed, including a hydrogen strategy in this country.  It is anticipated that during peak production, approximately 8 tonnes of hydrogen will be produced per day.  Hydrogen produced at the site will be compressed and stored in permanent hydrogen storage tanks before being dispensed to vehicles at the hydrogen refuelling station.  This is a wonderful concept.  There is a whole consultation being developed with the intention to go to planning permission and all that goes with that as well.  I urge people in Galway to drop into the Galway Harbour Hotel on 23 and 24 June to get a complete overview of the project.  Environmental surveys and scoping are going on at present.  It is anticipating that a planning application will be lodged in the autumn and the decision is expected later in the year or early next year.  It will then go through the whole tenders and construction phases.  Using the natural resources of our wind farms is a wonderful innovation and approach.</p> <p>Yesterday, I asked the question of whether it would require the development of offshore wind for this to reach the full ambition and scale that is necessary.  There would be enough offshore projected up until the end of 2030.  However, for this to realise the full scale and ambition that is necessary and to allow for hydrogen buses, taxis, shipping and heavy goods vehicles, offshore needs to develop.  I know there was a Commencement debate on it this morning.  This is a very exciting development in Galway.  Again, I would urge people to engage in the public consultation on 23 and 24 June at the Galway Harbour Hotel.</p></speech>

This is slightly younger than the national average, but it points to the continuing challenge of the ageing profile of those within our farm communities.  I have raised on a number of occasions in this House the question of incentives for young farmers and the need to encourage more people into agriculture and food production.  I hope we have a full debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this issue.  If it was any other sector of society or the economy where we had such a problem with an ageing population, it would be much more to the fore.  Therefore, I ask for a debate on how we can encourage more young people into farming.  Indeed, we should engage with Macra na Feirme, which has done much work on this issue.</p> <p>This is the seventh occasion on the Order of Business that I have brought up the question of the Future of the Media Commission report.  This report was provided to the Minister, Deputy Martin, by the group that was chaired by Brian MacCraith and charged with looking at the future of media in Ireland.  We know that just prior to when Covid hit, a number of local radio stations said, and the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland presented evidence of such, that they were within a week of closure, only for Government supports.  We know local newspapers are under much pressure.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The future of RT&Eacute; depends on decisions being made on its future funding but also how it will operate.  This is something the joint committee on media has raised regularly.  We had to do pre-legislative scrutiny of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill without this report being published.  We went through Committee Stage in this House without the report.  I cannot figure out why, after nine months, we still have not seen the report of the Future of Media Commission.  I am very conscious that, today, its chair, Professor Brian MacCraith, again criticised the Government for its failure to publish the report.</p><p>I am asking the Deputy Leader to write to the Minister to say this House expects the report to be published immediately in order that we can have a real debate on the future of media in Ireland.  The Leader gave a commitment to me less than two weeks ago that we would schedule a debate on the future of media in the House regardless of whether the report was published.  It would put some pressure on the Department to get it out there.  It is simply unacceptable that a report that was provided to the Government nine months ago, and where several aspects have been leaked to the media, still has not been published.  I ask that it is immediately put into the public domain.</p></speech>

Last week I spoke of the harm being done to children in the Republic through domestic violence.  One child an hour experiences domestic violence.  That is somewhat beyond our control, but what is in our control is the harm being done to children with disabilities throughout the State.  The numbers are extremely alarming.  Some 48,000 children are waiting on physiotherapy, more than 10,000 of whom are waiting for more than a year for an appointment, not even for meaningful physio intervention.  Some 21,000 children are waiting for an occupational therapy appointment, with 10,000 waiting for more than a year.  Some 16,000 children are waiting for speech and language therapy.  Again, 10,000 are waiting more than a year.</p> <p>For those children that wait is time that cannot be revisited.  The interventions must be timely.  The damage done to children on those waiting lists is life altering and life limiting.  I have experienced that myself.  I have seen the deterioration in my own son, which is irreversible.  We are actively harming children by not providing them with the timely and necessary interventions that would be expected in a country in the European Union, in the so-called developed world.</p> <p>There is a similar situation for children waiting on psychological assessments.  Some 2,000 have been waiting for more than one year for their initial appointment.  The child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, has a similar issue.  The scandal we became aware of in the Kerry service is replicated throughout the Republic.  Most of the 73 CAMHS teams are understaffed.</p> <p>We do not have psychiatric nurses, community engagement teams or psychiatrists, including those with higher specialist training.  They will not work here.  The problem is not with physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, nurses or any of the clinical or front-line medical staff but with the very highly remunerated management of the HSE and the people in the Department of Health who are failing our children in this regard.</p> <p>There are 250,000 people awaiting community services.  To put the children's figures in context, 42,000 children went through our industrial schools.  That is a scandal of the ages that impacts on the history of this Republic.  There were 60,000 mothers in the mother and baby homes.  We are talking about a much larger number of children with disabilities who are being hurt right now.  This is the scandal of today.</p> <p>I would say to all the Senators and especially those in Government parties, when they go to their parliamentary party meetings tonight, they should talk to their leaders.  There is no coming back from this scandal, the hurting of children and the harm being done to them.  We must intervene.  I am aware that no risk assessment has been carried out in the implementation of the progressing disabilities services, PDS, programme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tom Clonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=TomClonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The waiting lists to which I referred are increasing exponentially in every three-month period.  The numbers on them are going up by thousands.  We are in a state of failure in this regard.  Notwithstanding the other challenges that confront us, this is something we must address.  The Catholic Church and other institutions could tell us that when we are aware of but do not act on a harm being done to children, there is no coming back from that for any political party, cultural institution or any other organisation in our Republic.</p><p>We need a very robust debate on the harm that is being done to children as a result of these waiting lists.  I have personal experience of it and it is being replicated in hundreds of thousands of households throughout the State.  We must act to address it.</p></speech>

Setting aside the totally unacceptable way in which some SNAs found out on a website at 4.20 p.m. in the afternoon that they no longer had a job, the issue now is the unrealistic demands facing the schools that lost SNAs, which are seeking the reallocation of those positions through the exceptional review process.</p> <p>Under that process, undertaken by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, schools have been sent the details of the lengthy replies that are required of them.  On top of all the administrative work required under a normal process, the NCSE is now looking for specific, up-to-date psychological reports outlining schools' specific needs for an SNA.  My colleague, Senator Clonan, touched on this issue.  We are all aware that schools are being told the NCSE will not engage with them unless these new reports are in place.  We all know such reports cannot be assessed in the short term.  Indeed, like me and the speaker before me, I am sure all colleagues in the House are dealing with large numbers of parents who are waiting months and years for such assessments for their children.  For many of the schools that have contacted me, meeting the requirements is an unrealistic demand in the timeframe involved.</p> <p>The replies we have received from the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, outline the process and method of appeal but do not acknowledge the timeframe involved in gathering the information for those appeals.  We need to allow schools to put forward their best case, based on the information they have on the children involved, without having to go through an assessment that takes so much time.  F&oacute;rsa has outlined in recent publications that more than 30 SNAs have been lost as a result of the special class reductions.  Those SNAs were assisting the most vulnerable students in our education system and I am sure that vulnerability remains.  Those children need the expert assistance of SNAs.  Without their support and the great work carried out by them, the most vulnerable pupils in our mainstream education system simply will not be able to function on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>As I said on the previous occasion we discussed this issue, we need a review of the way allocations are completed and how they are communicated.  At least 30 SNA school positions have been lost as part of the review that took place.  There are many very upset staff in school communities as we head into the summer.  Schools must now try to develop a school plan in time for September as well as preparing for exceptional reviews.  Many parents are only now learning that the schools involved will have to adjust their plans for September and are realising the upsetting consequences that will have for their loved ones.</p> <p>The Leader committed on the previous occasion to raising the way the loss of the SNAs was communicated with those involved.  I ask the Deputy Leader to raise the demands being placed on schools via the exceptional review process with the Minister of State and to ask for a different way of conducting the reviews and a change in the timeframes involved.</p></speech>

I will not repeat any of what was said last week because doing so is not the answer and will only ensure more people hear it.  My mother used to say that you can tie a knot with your tongue that you are not able to open with your hands.  She meant by this that people can get themselves into big positions where others are looking to them to be a leader and they should not use inappropriate language.</p> <p>Many members of my community live in nasty accommodation, if that is the right word, due to a lack of services.  Many of them felt there was a comment made in the D&aacute;il last week to the effect that people living in trailers or caravans are not respected.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like the T&aacute;naiste to reflect on his actions last week in the D&aacute;il and, most importantly, to be mindful going forward of the poor people in our society.</p><p>While I have the opportunity, I will say to every Member of the House that they may not be anti-Traveller and stand up and be anti-Traveller here in the Seanad or in the D&aacute;il, but we see it on their social media pages, their Twitter accounts and Facebook accounts.  It is inappropriate in this day and age for any Senator or Deputy to be coming out and stirring up hatred online.  I do not know what we can do about it in the House because, obviously, it happens outside the House and they will not come in and make such comments in here because, of course, there are rules and regulations against it.  Again, times are changing and they should not be using inappropriate language and stirring up hatred on social media if they are representing this House or the D&aacute;il.  We all know about freedom of speech and we do not have to get into it, but hate speech or stirring up hatred is not freedom of speech.</p><p>On another note, on the Order of Business in recent weeks, I have been looking for the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to come to the House for a debate around ending direct provision.  As we know, the White Paper was launched over a year ago.  I understand the Leader put in a request but, unfortunately, I have not heard anything back.  It would be good to have a debate before the recess around ending direct provision because we are at such a critical point and, as we know, hotels are full and people are living in dire accommodation.  I would like to know where we stand with that.</p></speech>

This is a situation where parents are estranged and one parent acts decisively to alienate the other parent from their children, be it psychologically or physically preventing them from accessing their children.  It is an awful thing.  It is not just hard for the parent but it does terrible damage to the children, and we have spoken about the damage done to children.  This is something that is done deliberately by an adult to his or her own children.  It is pervasive and much more common than we think.  Many people have contacted me recently about this issue.</p><p>I am grateful that the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, has taken steps to start a process on this and there is a public consultation under way through the Department of Justice on parental alienation and what is involved in that, asking people to share their experiences and what they think should be done.  The deadline for that public consultation is this coming Friday, 24 June.  People can make a submission by emailing <i>parentalalienation@justice.ie</i>.  I encourage anyone who has suffered as a consequence of parental alienation to share their experiences with the Department.  This public consultation gives us a full and proper picture of what is actually happening.  It is important that people keep the details of any personal experiences to themselves so the parties are not identifiable, but I know people will be aware of that.</p><p>I personally think this should be a crime.  It damages the children in a way that we cannot even understand until many years later.  In many respects, it is as bad as the other abuses and the other difficulties children face that have been discussed in the House today.  I encourage anyone who has experience or ideas in regard to parental alienation to make a submission to the current public consultation by this coming Friday.</p></speech>

Where this system breaks down and becomes suspect is when the Government finds itself funding bodies whose sole purpose is not to help, serve or facilitate and to organise volunteers, but to lobby.</p> <p>Ireland has an astonishing 32,141 NGOs, with many being taxpayer-funded to the collective tune of &euro;5.9 billion annually, a figure worth remembering any time a lack of funds is used as an excuse for not meeting some basic need.  It is a case of &ldquo;Sorry, we are giving that money away to spend it on trying to change people's minds.&rdquo;<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As has been seen recently, many of the NGOs wield enormous lobbying power which is completely disproportionate to the actual support they have the community.  They are hot air balloons puffed up with government money and are presumed to be large based on the shadow they cast on Twitter, which we all know is not a real place.  It really has become the case that in Ireland the massively bloated NGO sector has become the tail that wags the dog.  We should have a serious look at restricting taxpayers' funding to organisations that are non-political and truly non-profit and engage in clearly charitable pursuits or are involved in policy implementation rather than policy influencing.  We politicians are here to serve the people.  If someone wants to come to speak to us and share an opinion or idea, they can do so.  They do not need to be on a payroll to do it.</p></speech>

I hope all in the House will join me in asking both sides to return to the table so we can have a collective public sector pay deal, which is the only show in town.  These are the most important pay talks of recent times.  I hope the Minister can come to the House and that the House can play a role in facilitating the return to talks.  We need a public sector pay deal.</p> <p>I have made the point a number of times on the Order of Business that the budget in October will be important.  Rising inflation and energy costs are having a gargantuan impact on the lives of ordinary people who are struggling.  It is not just the Opposition saying this.  It is all of us who live in the real world and know from people and our families the experiences they are having.  Accepting that the Government has made exceptional interventions in recent months, the budget in October is a long time away.  I accept the Government cannot chase inflation but it can intervene, make a determination and have an impact to help people.  I hope we can have this debate again and that the Government will listen to all of us, notwithstanding that there have been interventions and that the budget is in October.</p> <p>I concur with Senator Clonan on the matters he raised.  There is a real need for a whole-of-government approach with the HSE on the specialisms he has spoken about this morning.  I know from friends of mine and family members about the regression that has happened during Covid and about the lack of a joined-up approach since Covid by agencies dealing with the issues Senator Clonan has raised this morning.  Last Monday week in Cork, we had a briefing from the HSE.  This issue is something on which the House should have a rolling debate in advance of the budget with the line Minister.</p> <p>The Cathaoirleach has been very innovative in his approach to reform of the Seanad.  The following point might be something to reflect on.  I am not sure whether we can do it but the HSE should be brought somewhere with regard to accountability and a roadmap for disability services and the issues we have raised this morning.  We can say and do so much.  To be fair, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is doing a very good job but there is a piece missing and it needs to be joined up by the Government with the people for the people.  Senator Clonan is right that it is about people.  I use the phrase an gn&aacute;thduine.  If we cherish all of our children equally, then those who need services should not have to wait, beg or go to court.  At a time when the Government is throwing money at the HSE, I ask that we look at this.  Perhaps the Cathaoirleach could be innovative in his approach but I am not sure whether he can.</p></speech>

Though I have often criticised RT&Eacute; over the waste of public money and often raised questions about issues of fairness and balance, I thought it was strange that on foot of complaints about a particular programme that the joint committee would have moved to appear to haul representatives of the national broadcaster in to explain themselves.  If we imagine that a Russian television station had had a debate about the merits of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and that people from that station were to be hauled in front of a committee of the Duma to be berated, we can see how inappropriate it would be for an Oireachtas joint committee to overstep the mark.  RT&Eacute; was right in its correspondence with the joint committee to seek agreement on the point that it would not be the role of the joint committee to "investigate, examine or adjudicate the content of broadcast programmes, on RT&Eacute; or any other broadcaster".  Additionally, if there is a perception of ongoing problems concerning bias, impartiality and some communities being treated differently from others, then it is, of course, appropriate for a joint committee to ask questions and to seek engagement in that regard.  The knee-jerk nature of last week's reaction by the joint committee, however, was ill advised.</p> <p>This does, though, raise issues concerning free speech and freedom of expression in our society.  We should get back to this aspect now in the context of reports that the legislation on so-called "hate speech" is due in the autumn.  I note that the Department of Justice is at pains to say there will be a high threshold for any prosecutions.  That would certainly want to be the case because there is a real danger here that we will allow free speech for some people in our society, but not for others.  In a healthy democracy, all sorts of points of view get to be raised and the threshold should be very high indeed before anybody can be prevented from doing so or from being in any way persecuted or prosecuted for expressing a point of view that they are willing to back up with sound argument while avoiding abuse, incitement to hatred or any kind of threatening behaviour.  We must, though, always err on the side of facilitating free speech.  </p></speech>

This is a private hospital, but in the context of the Commencement matter I raised earlier today regarding University Hospital Limerick, UHL, once it is up and running it will complement the already-existing smaller BSHS-owned hospital, which was formerly Barringtons Hospital, and help to alleviate the numbers of people attending UHL.  This is a serious issue for Limerick and the mid-west.  The Deputy Leader was here earlier and heard my contribution on this issue.  This is the right thing to do.  The provision of more hospitals, public and private, in the region should be explored.  There is room for the expansion of St. John's Hospital as well, for example, and that is a public hospital.</p> <p>I also note the election of Councillor Olivia O'Sullivan as the chairperson of the Limerick Metropolitan District, which is the old metropolitan area in Limerick city.  I wish her all the best for the coming year.  She is the third female in a row to take over this role.  This is worthy of note because we have had almost 1,000 years of mayors in the city, but only five females have held the post.  </p></speech>

As the Deputy Leader knows, this matter is coming before the Cabinet this week.  It is a matter I have discussed over several years here and I am delighted to have fed input into the proposed policy coming before the Cabinet.  On reflection, this type of leave scheme is one that could be expanded.  Recently, one of our own exceptionally hard-working councillors in Westmeath, Liam McDaniel, fell ill.  He was ill for quite a long time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aidan Davitt:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2475"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2475&amp;amp;pid=AidanDavitt&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In such circumstances, where a person has had the misfortune to have a protracted illness, that they could look to nominate a replacement for six months or for a given timeframe is something that is worth looking at because a great deal of pressure at that time filters down to the person who is sick and to his or her family.  This is something that could possibly be shared, looked upon in a different light and that we could do.  With fixed-term county councils, people are aware of what is and is not the case.</p><p>I would like to add that Councillor McDaniel has made a good recovery and I was delighted to hear he attended a number of council meetings over recent weeks.  It is something is worth discussing and looking at.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to them for the work they did through the Covid-19 pandemic period, and I take this opportunity to express my thanks to them.  It was a difficult time for everybody but the Killoe Men's Shed and men's sheds throughout the country did magnificent work in helping with rural isolation etc.  I say, "Well done."</p> <p>A number of weeks ago we met with the Irish Men's Sheds Association and it was looking for supports from Government for the sheds.  I have a list of things it asked to be taken into account when discussions are taking place, namely, an annual maintenance grant, a sustainability grant, more supports for new start-up sheds, the issue of VAT and commercial rates on some of the buildings the sheds are in, and security of tenure for those that are in buildings or publicly owned buildings so that they know there is a guarantee for the future.  I put that on the record and I hope the Government will be positive towards supporting the very good work that they do.</p> <p>I also wish to raise another matter, which is the loss of commercial rates due to the closure of Lough Ree power station in Longford.  As Members will know, this station closed a number of years ago, along with the power station in Shannonbridge.  It led to a &euro;1.2 million reduction in the intake of rates for the local authority in Longford.  Every year since we have had to appeal and look for money to be provided, and it is only really at the last minute that our local authority finance department is told that money is going to be provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  In a Commencement matter last year I received a commitment from Government that we would put a long-term plan in place between now and 2023 to last up to 2026, when we were to have a just transition.  The loss of such rates has a serious impact on the ability of our local authority to provide the services that are needed by citizens in our county.  I am asking that a multi-annual budget be put in place now, before the recess, for 2023 so that our finance department can put the plans together for the services in our county and so that we know for the years ahead exactly what finance we have and need to continue to provide the vital services in our county.</p></speech>

As we all know, we are coming out of a decade of undersupply of housing, so I specifically welcome the latest report on housing supply and delivery that indicates the highest number of housing commencements on record in more than a decade.  There have been more than 30,223 new housing commencements which are to be welcomed.  These are new homes being built, and Housing for All is determined to deliver a mix of social, affordable and private housing through using State-owned lands.  To deliver housing, it is very important that not only do the commencements get approved and the housing is started but that they are delivered upon.  There are many pressure points with inflation and other resources but, with that in mind, I very much want to encourage all politicians from all parties on both sides of the House to stop objecting to housing, to stop putting barriers in the way of housing delivery, and to stop encouraging objections and barriers to the granting of planning permissions for housing and the actual commencement of construction of it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Every new home that is built, whether it is private, social or affordable, is a home for somebody.  There are more than 10,000 people homeless in this country.  On top of that, more than 30,000 Ukrainians have arrived and Europe is at war.  I urge those who object to housing to please stop and think of the human impact their objections have and allow commencements to proceed.  We also need to increase the number of commencements.</p><p>On a secondary issue, the Intreo office on the Navan Road, which is known locally as "the labour", has been closed since April.  Its closure was unannounced and notices were erected.  Many people do their transactions online with Intreo and the Department of Social Protection.  However, the surrounding area, which has a population of more than 10,000, has large elderly and disabled communities.  I ask the Deputy Leader to write to the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Minister for Social Protection to ask for a firm date for the reopening of the Intreo office on the Navan Road in Dublin 7.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-21a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062100002#BB00200"><p>I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Fitzpatrick on what she said about public representatives objecting to housing.  I can never understand such objections because ultimately the planners are supposed to be the professionals who can adjudicate on whether something is appropriate.  The days of public representatives making such submissions should be well and truly over given the crisis we are in.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, I spoke about the lack of a date for leaving certificate results to be released.  It is very disappointing that a firm date has not yet been given.  Earlier today, Mr. Jim Miley of the Irish Universities Association outlined on radio the difficulties, challenges and complexities.  He explained that it is impossible to plan when one does not know the date.  I do not know what is going on but resolving this is not rocket science.  Whatever the challenges, this is totally unfair on the students, in the first and last instance, as well as on all of those who rely on a date for the leaving certificate results to plan and ensure third level colleges are in a position to give the best possible support and services to students.  Again, I appeal for a date to be provided on when the leaving certificate results will be published.</p> <p>I will raise an issue I have spoken about before, namely, the need to locate retirement villages in towns and villages.  Where possible, each town should identify an area of ground where a retirement village could be funded.  There are lots of approved housing bodes and I am sure they would be only be too delighted to help in the creation of retirement villages.  In turn, this would free up larger houses to be used by younger people with large families.  I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate on the whole issue of housing elderly people, those who wish to downsize and those who want to have a more modest affordable housing unit and are willing to surrender larger houses.  These may be houses outside villages and the older people would prefer to be near services and supports.  I realise we are approaching the end of this term.  I would like a debate on housing the elderly arranged for the autumn.</p></speech>

The Department of the Taoiseach and the Office of Public Works have announced a competition for the monument.  I commend the Government on backing the campaign that has been under way for almost a decade.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, more than 70 million people around the world have acquired the infection and 35 million people have died from HIV and AIDS.  It is 40 years either last week or this week since the first cases of HIV and AIDS were recorded in Ireland in 1982.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Much has changed.  I am conscious I have spoken about HIV since &quot;It's a Sin&quot;, on Channel 4, was released.  It got everyone talking about that period and about sexual health in general.  Crucially, it got sexual health professionals and front-line workers talking about sexual health strategies, and HIV and sexually transmitted infection, STI, prevention, right now.  That is what we need to be doing with a memorial.<br/><br/>I hope the Department of the Taoiseach and the Office of Public Works, OPW, will have a consultation process that fully engages stakeholders, community folk and working-class communities who are affected by the epidemic because that is the potential the memorial presents for members of the LGBT community.  The first out older generation of LGBT people have a guilt that they survived that period.  As Tonie Walsh says:</p><blockquote>	It's time. Time to dry away our tears and build from them a monument to the destruction and loss from AIDS in Ireland. </blockquote><p>I commend the Department of the Taoiseach and the OPW and call for a wide-ranging consultation process to best inform the memorial.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-21a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1642" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062100002#CC00300"><p>I thank all Members who contributed to the Order of Business today.</p> <p>The first contributor was Senator Kyne, who alerted Members to the Galway hydrogen hub public consultation taking place on Thursday and Friday next in Galway.  The Senator spoke about the need for a hydrogen strategy, with which I would agree, and referenced the view of the hub that offshore wind would be needed.  The Senator mentioned the Commencement matter I raised this morning which spoke about the State's offshore wind strategy.  It appears to be more focused in the east and the south, which is something we must work on, certainly for Members in this House living in the west who might have an interest in advancing that strategy there.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne requested a debate on the future of the media.  That has been requested and we are awaiting a debate on that, with or without the report.  I take on board the Senator's comments that there is a significant delay in the publication of that report.  We are now waiting nine months for that.</p> <p>Senator Byrne then spoke about Teagasc and the average age of farmers in Wexford, Wicklow and Carlow being 56.6 years, which is below the national average.  It is still a mature age, if I can put it that way.  The Senator stated there is a significant problem in getting young people into farming for various reasons, many of them to do with access to farm land.  The need to facilitate farmers retiring and transferring land is one of those issues to be dealt with.  We will request that debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It will likely be in the autumn session because we are in the last four weeks and we have a lot of business in terms of Bills to pass.  It will be difficult to accommodate statements on a particular issue.</p> <p>Senator Clonan spoke on an important topic on which all of us on both sides of the House need to work.  It is abhorrent that we have thousands of  children and young people waiting for intervention services when we know that "early intervention" is the term and, if it is not early, it does not have the same impact.  We all know people within our communities and within our friends and family circle who are fighting day after day to get basic services.  It is a fight parents do not have time for because they are caring for their children as well and trying to support them as best they can.  Many parents are paying privately when they cannot afford it and even getting private services is becoming difficult because the waiting lists for public services are so long.  We will request that debate, probably at the outset with the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities.  That is a junior post.  Ultimately, it should be a cross-departmental responsibility at Government level to tackle what is a State failure to provide these services for children.  The Senator is correct that we will be looking back on this in ten or 20 years and we will be ashamed of ourselves as a country that we left children languishing on waiting lists for such a lengthy period.</p> <p>I take on board Senator Clonan's points about child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, being continually understaffed as well.  There are difficulties in recruiting the right people.  I do not know why it is so difficult to recruit people.  Perhaps we need to look at pay and conditions for those senior posts.  There are many vacant posts that have been funded.  The money is there to pay those salaries.  We are finding it difficult to get people to take up those posts and we are competing on an international level to get people into some of these posts as well, particularly at the highest level.  That is proving a challenge for us right across the health service.  I take on board as well the Senator's point about the progressing disability services programme and the issues surrounding that.</p> <p>Senator Wall spoke about the issues concerning special needs assistants, SNAs.  There was an announcement from the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan's office.  I accept the Senator's comments on the frustration with the communication around that issue and that there are ongoing issues in terms of accreditation for SNAs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is about proper recognition for the work they do, the responsibilities they have and the key role they play in schools.  Senator Malcolm Byrne was at that committee meeting, as were other Members, and there are issues around the contract.  My information is accreditation is something that is accepted and agreed by Government and is on the way but I accept absolutely there is frustration it has not happened by now.</p><p>Senator Flynn touched on an issue around the use of language and the importance of proper language.  Words matter and what is said cannot be unsaid.  It is forever on the public record once one opens one's mouth.  The Senator's mother's comments are wise and a very nice way to put it.  The Senator is right that any commenting around people's living situation, especially when there is a consistent State failure to provide proper accommodation, is wrong and should be reflected upon.  Many people in both Houses and beyond have at times used inappropriate language that caused hurt, so we can all think better about the language we use.</p><p>The debate with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on direct provision has been requested.  Again, it will probably be in the autumn session but we are working on getting that date for the Senator.  I am aware other Members also want to have that conversation with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.</p><p>Senator Ward spoke to alert the House to the public consultation taking place through the Department of Justice around parental alienation, which is where one parent stops another from accessing the child and this does damage to the child as well as the parent.  There are obviously lots of difficulties there.  One parent may have genuine reasons for not wanting to engage with the other so we must be very careful in how we work through that.  The Senator has encouraged Members to alert their communities to that particular public consultation.</p><p>Senator Keogan spoke about the NGO sector and the vast amounts of public money spent on these organisations.  She is right to raise the point there should be a specific role for NGOs in servicing the community, assisting people and advocating but that it should not simply be to lobby and that is not really the intention at the outset.  It is important we continually assess and reflect on the expenditure of public moneys and always ask the question of whether we are spending public money in the right way and can we justify it to the public.  Genuine questions can be asked there and we need always to hold Government to ensure public money is spent in the right way and with the right intention.</p><p>Senator Buttimer spoke about public sector pay and asked for a debate with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  We will make that request.  He also asked for a debate on the budget.  He made the point the budget is quite a long way away and he would like to see measures implemented before that.  It is worth noting we have seen almost &euro;2 billion of public expenditure on measures to try to deal with the cost of living.  Budget 2022 includes the largest social welfare budget the State has had in more than 14 years.  There have been specific targeted payments in the form of the fuel allowance and extra payments for those receiving it of &euro;125 in March and another &euro;100 in April.  There were specific measures around reduction in VAT on gas and electricity for everybody.  There was an energy rebate for all households as well.  Thus, there have been specific targeted measures and more broad-ranging measures.</p><p>There was obviously a reduction in the cost of diesel and petrol that seems to have been erased in recent weeks but there have been emergency measures taken by the Government.  It is worth pointing out those measures can be taken in advance of a budget as well if needs be.  The Government is monitoring the cost of living issue on a weekly basis and it is the top priority for the Government to deal with.</p><p>Senator Mullen spoke about RT&Eacute; now not coming in to the Oireachtas committee.  I completely agree with his remarks.  It is right and proper the broadcaster is not coming before an Oireachtas committee.  Despite the fact there was considerable upset and anger at that debate we must be very careful around the role of Oireachtas committees and that line between the State broadcaster and the Oireachtas as well, in that there is a relationship there that needs to be harmonious to ensure the proper operation of a democracy and the Oireachtas, as well as the proper functioning of the broadcaster.  There is a fine line.  There have been debates in the past on different issues like marriage equality and the referendum on the eighth amendment where at times others call for debates to be closed down as well.  However, again, it is about taking on board that we must listen as well, where certain language is used that maybe did not need to be used, that there are times when we can intentionally need to hurt others without any real benefit to it and there is no need for that either.  It is just to learn from that, move forward and hope that particular issue can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties.</p><p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about welcoming the new planning for a 150-bed hospital in Limerick to be run by the Bon Secours group.  She acknowledged it will be a private facility but made the point there is a role for public and private healthcare and the additional 150 beds, though they are private ones, will help alleviate the pressure on UHL.  That pressure is considerable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We know that HIQA recently reported that the circumstances of patients in the hospital are far below the standard expected.  The Senator congratulated Councillor Olivia O'Sullivan on her election as mayor of Limerick.  She is the third woman mayor in a row and there have been only five in the past 1,000 years.  That is quite significant.  I wish the councillor well in her time ahead.</p><p>Senator Davitt spoke about the plans to provide for maternity leave for councillors that are going to Cabinet and welcomed that move.  We all concur with that.  We have certain steps to take in this House also.  We still do not have maternity leave for Oireachtas Members.  A bespoke solution was put in place for the Minister for Justice that was absolutely appropriate and needed, but there has been no change whatsoever for any other Member of either House.  There is a public perception that the issue has been resolved but it has not actually changed at all.  If we are serious about encouraging women into politics and retaining them in politics, this is one of many issues we will need to address as an Oireachtas.  Senator Davitt said there is potential to expand a plan to cater for councillors with long-term illness whereby they could nominate somebody to stand in to do their job for a number of months.  It is a reasonable suggestion and one that should definitely be explored.</p><p>Senator Carrigy spoke about the Men's Shed in Longford, whose representatives in the Visitors Gallery are welcome to the Chamber, and also about the importance of the Men's Shed movement right across the country, particularly in rural areas.  In my county, Mayo, several men's sheds have no doubt saved lives by dealing with mental health issues and rural isolation.  I do not say that lightly.  Having an outlet and the ability to meet up, make new friends, reconnect with old friends and do something positive in the community is really important.</p><p>Senator Carrigy also spoke about the loss of commercial rates to Longford County Council when Lough Ree power plant closed.  There was a reduction of &euro;1.2 million.  The Senator said there is a need to bridge the gap and ensure the funding is still provided to the local authority.  It is Government policy to ensure that we have just transition such that when we close power plants like the one in question and it has an impact on employment and commercial rates for a local authority, there is an onus on the Government to ensure no detrimental impact on the local community.  The Senator's comments are certainly valid and of genuine concern.</p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick spoke about housing and has urged certain groupings, parties and individuals, and everybody in between, to think before they object to housing in their local areas.  This is a problem right across the country.  Projects are not getting under way as quickly as they could or at all because of local objections.  Taking into account that planning and community engagement need to be done in the proper way, it is urgent to get houses built and finished.  The Senator also acknowledged the latest report that shows housing commencements are at an all-time high, with over 30,000 commencements in the past 12 months and the number going in the right direction.</p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick also alerted the House to a particular issue on the Navan Road, with the Intreo office, locally referred to as "the labour", having been closed since April.  I suggest to the Senator that she raise this as a Commencement matter given that it is a quite specific issue.  We can take it from there if a satisfactory answer is not provided to her.</p><p>Senator Conway spoke about the need to provide more housing for elderly people to facilitate them in downsizing and freeing up larger homes for younger families coming through.  It is a sensible suggestion.  He has asked for a debate on this matter.  We will request it for the autumn session.</p><p>Senator Conway has once again raised the issue of the leaving certificate.  I take on board his comments in that there is frustration because we still do not know the date on which the leaving certificate results will be published.  It is important to know because it has an impact on the Central Applications Office offers for college and students starting college.  The delay is because there have been a number of re-sits of the examinations because of Covid, in addition to other reasons.  I am aware that the office of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, is working very hard to resolve the issue at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Senator Warfield spoke about the Government commitment to a HIV&ndash;AIDS memorial.  I take on board the Senator's comment that there should be consultation on the right way to achieve this.  It is hard to believe it is 1982 since the first case was reported.  We have come a long way.  Millions of people lost their lives over the period.  What is occurring is really important and I am glad to see it is finally progressing to the public consultation phase.</p></speech>

Section 177D, which is being repealed by section 21 of the Bill, which I will be opposing, provides for the decision of the board not to grant substitute consent.  In its submission to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, the Irish Environmental Network recommended that there would be an amendment to the existing gateways in sections 177B to 177D, inclusive, and a simplification of section 177K to allow that there would be a process of preliminary examination relating to exceptional circumstances with public participation and additional obligations in terms of making all of the relevant materials available to ensure there would be robust and speedy access to the necessary information rather than a straight repeal, as this legislation proposes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It basically comes down to the same crunch, namely, there is a very clear obligation that these measures and substitute consent be only made available in exceptional circumstances.  I will bring forward amendments on Report Stage to try to address that and look to what the processes might be in evaluating and considering whether a proposal meets exceptional circumstances, with strong and clear public participation mechanisms and full transparency regarding all relevant materials.  Strengthening the existing process would be a better approach than the proposal before us that effectively changes the process and indeed makes it excessively streamlined and developer-led in this regard.  I am opposing the section on that basis and will come to the linked issue of section 21 in due course.</p></speech>

I cannot accept the opposition to these sections.  They comprise technical amendments necessary as a result of the repeal of section 177D and ancillary provisions relating to the decision of the board whether to grant leave to apply for substitute consent.  The removal of the leave to apply stage when applying for substitute consent is one of the core elements of what is being proposed.  For this reason, I cannot assent to its removal nor that of any ensuing technical amendments elsewhere in the Bill.</p></speech>

A key element in this section is the deletion of the phrase &quot;in a case where it granted leave to apply for substitute consent on the grounds that exceptional circumstances exist, or in a case where the application is made in compliance with a direction to apply for substitute consent under section 261A&quot;.</p><p>Subsection (2) more broadly provides:</p> <blockquote> 	Where the Board grants an application for substitute consent under section 177K in a case where it granted leave to apply for substitute consent on the grounds that exceptional circumstances exist, or in a case where the application is made in compliance with a direction to apply for substitute consent ... it may determine that a sum or sums is or are required to be paid in order to defray some or all of the costs incurred by the Board or the planning authority during the course of consideration of the application... </blockquote> <p>This is again the core issue.  I do not believe the case has been properly, clearly or strongly made.  This is not the issue of whether there should be a mechanism for substitute consent.  It is fine there would be a mechanism but the issue is what the mechanism is.  This is another place where we are moving away from the situation whereby there is scrutiny by the court of whether the exceptional circumstances test has been met, that is, if somebody is seeking legal leave to apply for substitute consent that he or she would first have met a standard in terms of exceptional circumstances and been allowed to seek substitute consent on that basis.  It also relates to the removal of the power of local authorities to direct a developer or the owner of a development to apply for substitute consent.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Again, it has not really been clear to me what the situation is if there are developers who do not wish to seek substitute consent when local authorities can no longer request that they regularise their position.  That has been removed by this legislation.  Also removed are provisions that would have allowed for the costs of evaluation.  Maybe sums would have been contributed.</p></speech>

The section amends section 177N of the principal Act and deletes the phrase "for leave to apply for substitute consent" throughout.  Section 177N provides for the powers of the Minister to make regulations regarding substitute consent.  This section will remove the powers of the Minister to make regulations in respect of leave to apply for substitute consent.  To be extremely clear, it would mean a more favourable situation for developers, something that I believe risks a bar of incentivisation or reward for developers.</p> <p>I know the Minister of State will not accept what I propose because the fundamental purpose of this Bill is effectively to change our mechanism for substitute consent.  Ireland has been called out for failing to do what was required of it properly and it put together, however imperfectly, a mechanism around substitute consent.  The decision made a very short period later to start diluting the associated process and the checks and balances within it, including in respect of seeking leave to apply for substitute consent and the power of local authorities in terms of requesting it, is a regressive step in terms of oversight.  In that context, I just have to oppose section 19.</p></speech>

I picked it as the threshold the EU has set for what are considered to be &quot;major works&quot;.  Irrespective of whether the Minister of States wants to accept the amendment, I have used this threshold because it is recognised within the EU as the one pertaining to a project of great significance, a project with a value of over &euro;5 million.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am open to other thresholds that might be inserted.</p><p>I might reserve the right to bring forward more amendments on this on Report Stage given the very substantial benefit that may accrue to a developer in respect of the measures in the Bill.  Given that developers can avail of the approach that it is easier to look for forgiveness afterwards than permission at the time, it is important that the stakes are quite high.  We should not have projects worth &euro;5 million, &euro;4 million or even &euro;3 million that can get under way and simply absorb whatever fines, other measures or legal processes around applying for consent after the fact, and not have that be significant.  If a project is worth a significant amount of money, we know there are those who can simply absorb the costs of substitute consent after the fact.  As I have mentioned, I am extremely concerned the Bill creates perverse incentives and is in danger of being out of tune with the EU ruling which made it extremely clear there should be nothing that would serve to encourage development without proper planning standards or permissions or in any way reward those kinds of practice.  However, as we have discussed, the provisions of the Bill allow not only for people to seek substitute consent, which was already in place, but for a developer to have a meeting with An Bord Plean&aacute;la to decide whether he or she wants to seek substitute consent.  A developer is, therefore, not taking a risk or a gamble given he or she can have a meeting.</p><p>We need to bear in mind that the power of others, such as local authorities, to make a developer seek consent and go through the process have been removed.  Therefore, all of the power is in the hands of a developer.  The developer decides if he or she wants to seek substitute consent, based on a meeting with no risk, and can then seek that.  If a developer seeks substitute consent, not having obtained the proper permissions or engaged in proper environmental scrutiny at the time of the application, he or she is rewarded by being allowed to attach to the process other developments on other sites that may not be related developments but rather are new and different developments.  Such developments may not be on the same site but rather on adjoining sites.</p><p>The person seeking substitute consent for something he or she did in the past may want to do remedial work to address that.  That is not solely what developers are seeking.  Somebody could put in a massive application for anything on an adjoining site and bypass the usual process through local authorities by going straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That means the developer who has a previous record of non-delivery in terms of environmental standards is, in fact, in respect of a new development on a new site, in a better position than somebody else who has followed the rules and is applying for planning permission on a site.</p><p>They also deal with applications for substitute consent, but they already had to do that.  The fact is developers like that will be a lot better off and incentivised to engage in such practices after the passage of the Bill than they were before.  That is why putting a threshold on this is important.  If the Minister of State will not put a threshold on the original development because of the cost of breaking that down and all of the other issues that were discussed, the Government should, at an absolute minimum, be open to putting a threshold on the value of a new development that may be fast-tracked through the legislation.</p><p>The owner of a quarry may not have carried out an impact environmental impact investment and everything else.  He or she may have an adjoining site and be able to submit an application for a &euro;5 million development on that and tag that into regularising the quarry.  A developer on small development that did not seek substitute consent would be able, on a neighbouring site, to fast-track a project worth more than &euro;5 million.  That is wrong.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a massive overreach.  It is a gift.  The Minister of State should bear in mind that this is not a matter of just housing development.  This is not constrained, but can be for whatever one may want to put in.  As a minimum, if the Minister of State will not accept this amendment which seeks to put a &euro;5 million threshold on development, he might be able to put another threshold in place or he might be able to put a threshold on the value of the additional developments that get tagged along with the application for substitute consent.</p></speech>

The amendment seeks to insert a provision whereby the provisions of this Bill, including the right to apply for substitute consent, shall not be applicable in respect of projects that have an estimated commercial value of greater than &euro;5.48 million.</p> <p>I am opposing the proposed amendment No. 12.  The amendments that have been proposed by the Government by way of this Bill are intended for exceptional circumstances.  I note that the Senator did not refer in her contribution to the fact that the developer has to prove its bona fides in this case, as has been outlined clearly in section 16(8)(g), irrespective of the commercial value of the site.  In the rare cases where a substitute consent is being sought, it is done so after the bona fide mistake has been realised by the developer, which is often following a court judgment has revised a common legal understanding of whether a development or class of developments were in breach of the law or not, where a developer thereafter seeks formally to correct that mistake and where the developer is also exposed to the significant negative risk of mandatory enforcement and remediation of the site if substitute consent was to be refused.  It is not the intention of this Bill to preclude any site from being brought back into the planning system by way of substitute consent on commercial grounds.  Therefore, I am opposing the proposed amendment No. 12.</p></speech>

Perhaps he might expand on that, given as I say that this not an arbitrary threshold.  This threshold is recognised in the EU in procurement laws and others as major works.  Does the Minister of State feel that it is appropriate or acceptable for a project or a proposed development of more than &euro;5 million on adjoining land to be attached to an application for a substitute consent on a site?  Can the Minister clarify his position in relation to the additional applications?  If massive projects of that size are to go through a shorter process, that raises a concern.  This issue is quite separate to the position of the regularisation.</p> <p>Again, I have not received an answer about the situation for those who do not seek substitute consent, but who are found for example to be in a class of development or a development that has not properly applied the planning laws?  Previously, the local authority could initiate the substitute consent process and thereby could allow a developer to regularise its status.  Now, however, it is only initiated by the developer.  The risks are very much reduced for the developer unless there is a parallel process.  There may well be one and the Minister of State might indicate what that process is.  I have two specific questions on that.  </p></speech>

This section repeals sections 177k(1B) to (1l) of the principal Act, which are related to criteria for the decision of the board on an application of substitute consent.  This section repeals sections 177K(1A)(b) and (c) of the principal Act, which provides that when deciding whether to grant such a consent the board shall not be bound by, take account or otherwise have regard to any decision of the board under section 177D.</p><p>A number of areas are covered but one that is relevant to this House is section 177D of the principal Act providing for a decision of the board not to grant substitute consent.  Section 177B of the principal Act is the provision covering an application to apply for substitute consent where a notice has been served by a planning authority.  That section is important because it provides for a power local authorities had in respect of a development that was in breach and had not met the core environmental and other standards that were needed.  That was a crucial power local authorities had to require a developer to seek substitute consent to regularise the position.  This measure, along with a long series of decisions made in this House during the past two years, signifies yet another power of local authorities that is being eroded.  </p><p>Many of us are sick of hearing things local authorities cannot do with respect to vacant properties and dereliction.  Where a project has been found not to have met proper development standards or where the developer has not done the right thing in securing proper planning permission or proper consent, the local authority will no longer be in a position to require the developer to seek that consent.  There is no start button any more for the local authority to address that.</p><p>Bearing in mind some of the projects that would be relevant in this respect, it is not simply related to buildings or developments, it is related to projects such as quarries, which have massive environmental impacts in local areas.  A local authority will no longer be given the power to request, seek, suggest or serve a notice requiring a developer to seek consent.  That is leaving aside the other powers of local authorities which are also being eroded by this Bill, that is, local authorities are being cut out of the planning process in the meaningful way and role they have with respect to additional developments attached not to the same sites but adjoining sites that get attached to an application for substitute consent.  A quarry development is one such example.  If subsequent consent is sought for a quarry, an application for a new quarry or a new project can go in beside that application and local authorities will not be, as they usually would be, the key first tier in the planning process.  They are losing that power but specifically, under this section, they are losing the power to serve a notice requiring an application for substitute consent to take place.  That is why I fundamentally oppose this section.</p><p>I reserve the right to bring forward amendments on Report Stage specifically on that aspect.  I urge Members to think in the interim period between now and Report Stage and to get answers, which I have still not got, as to why exactly the powers of local authorities to serve a notice requiring an application for substitute consent are being removed.  I have not heard why that is being done or even an attempt to explain why it is being done.</p></speech>

If I am applying for something adjacent to a site that requires substitute consent &ndash; let us say I want to build a house - why in my right mind would I attach an application for a genuine development to something so toxic that it requires substitute consent?  I would not do that.  One would not attach a proper clean development to something that requires substitute consent and is viewed as being so toxic.  I would just go through the normal planning process.  No matter what way I try to arrive at a point that matches the suggestions made by the Senator, I keep arriving back at that point.  If someone has a genuine application for a house or other building on adjoining land, they would go through the normal planning process.  No one in their right mind would ever tie something to a toxic development that requires substitute consent.</p></speech>

This is what is getting added in.  It is not getting added because nobody wanted it.  Basically, it means this goes straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Of course, people can apply through the normal process and that is already there.  This is a different route that is being inserted.  If it is such a terrible route that nobody would ever want to take, why have it in the Bill, why introduce it?  Why create it today, in June 2022?  Why suddenly insert this new provision if nobody wants it and it is so terrible and inadvisable?  Maybe there are those who just do not get that embarrassed about having to look for substitute consent and, for them, there is the bonus of just being able to go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as it speeds up the process in another way.  Again, if it is so terrible, then we do not need to put it in the Bill.  It is not necessary for the substitute consent.  A key point is that these are ones that do not necessarily relate to additional proposals on the same site related to the same matter, for which there may be a case.  Senator Murphy made the point that if someone is developing a road and needs to change that road or do a new thing to fix up the project, that is one thing.  These are additional applications on other sites.</p></speech>

As I articulated on previous amendments, it is technically essential to facilitate the leave process and is one of the core elements of the Bill.</p> <p>I want to deal with some of the points made regarding local authorities.  Everything I do as Minister of State is to try to enhance powers of local authorities.  It simply misunderstands the genesis of the legislation to suggest that section 177B removes powers from local authorities, which it absolutely does not.  It means that normal enforcement procedures under the planning Act now take place under the power of, and with adjudication by, the local authorities.  Let us be very clear on that.  The local authority has its full enforcement powers under the planning Act.</p> <p>This comes at a time when the two-stage process has been restored in local authorities, SHD has been wound up, our Town Centre First implementation programme has been launched, with town regeneration officers going into each local authority, we are trying to tackle vacancy by bringing in a zoned land tax where local authorities are central in terms of adjudicating on the mapping process, and we are bringing derelict homes officers into each local authority by quarter 2 of this year.  To suggest that we are watering down the powers of local authorities in any shape or form is incorrect.  Indeed, given the conditionality that we are improving for the members to operate in those very difficult circumstances in local authorities, it is absolutely untrue.  I remind Members that it is important to read the legislation properly before making the totally inaccurate suggestion that one section is watering down the powers of local authorities when it is not.</p></speech>

Maybe they will come to pass and maybe they will not, or maybe there will be the scenarios that Senator Cummins has outlined, where nobody will want to use these provisions at all, but let us see what happens and let us have a report so we can debate it.</p><p>The amendment suggests that within 18 months of the passing of the Act, a report would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas outlining how many applications for substitute consent were received in the 18-month period, how many applications were made and the number granted, and whether there were impacts on other planning applications.  My concern is that this would become a route that is used rather than the other route.  Perhaps people will still continue to use the other route or perhaps they will not, but this is the point where we would make sure that we do not have any adverse consequences - some might say unintended or inadvertent consequences, but certainly potential consequences - which I foresee could happen under the Bill.</p><p>With anything like this, we want to be proven wrong and we want it to turn out fine, but let us have a report where we can look to the patterns and, crucially, see the relevant exceptional circumstances in regard to each successful application.  This is fundamental because, previously, those seeking the application had to go through a High Court process and a scrutinising as to whether they met the exceptional circumstances criterion.  The point is that every individual application, and certainly every successful application, should have been able to prove that it was an exception and that the particular application was not the norm and was an exception that was different from others.  That is why ensuring that the granting of substitute consent has remained an exception and not become a rule is important.  Paragraph (c) of the amendment is so we can identify the patterns and the kinds of exceptional circumstances behind decisions that have been made in respect of each application.  Again, the question is whether they are genuinely exceptional rather than rules or blankets.  It is very clear that each individual application will need to have such a circumstance attached, so I ask why not look at it in 18 months.</p><p>I have suggested to the Houses of the Oireachtas that if the Minister preferred to bring such a report to the relevant committee and have it survey this, that would also be very valuable.  However, it is very important, when we do something like this, that we try to make sure we monitor how it unfolds.  We have had many situations in planning where we are fixing problems after the fact and then trying to remove fixes around other problems again and again.  This is a chance to monitor a very significant set of decisions to see how they are folding out within 18 months, so we have time to either adapt or reverse course, if necessary.</p></speech>

I can recognise some of the logic in what Senator Higgins is saying but she might have made a proposal within her own argument.  The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage is, and has always been, for as long as I have been around, a very active and progressive committee, and perhaps, as she suggested, it is something the joint committee could look at.  It has a work programme, as every committee has, and it could be matter for it at any time if it wanted to have a specific focus on this particular area.  All the planning authorities will have this data and sometimes it is about pulling all of that together.  While pulling it all together is time-consuming, at least it would be there somewhere.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Perhaps that is something that the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, of which Senator Cummins is also a member, would be interested in examining after a considerable period of time.  We do not want to be too premature.  This will need to run.  There are mechanisms there and perhaps the suggestion of the committee is a better one than a report.  It seems with all legislation now that there is a request for reports to be laid before the Houses and we simply do not have the time to get through them all.  If we want to delve into and analyse matters in granular detail then the aforementioned committee would possibly be the best way to do that.  The committee could request the relevant information from the Department at any time but this legislation needs to run for a considerable period before we would even look at that.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 13 seeks to insert a provision that provides for the laying of a report by the Minister before both Houses post the introduction of these proposed legislative amendments.  Specifically, it seeks to impose a ministerial obligation to lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas within 18 months of the passing of this Act, outlining data on substitute consent applications received and-or granted, any impacts identified in respect of other planning applications, and the relevant exceptional circumstance in respect of each successful application.</p> <p>While I understand the intention behind the proposed amendment, I am opposing amendment No. 13 as existing planning reporting arrangements are already in place that are robust and fit for purpose.

The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas outlining the implications or impact of this legislation in<br /><br />respect of: <blockquote> 	(a) the powers of local authorities in respect of the substitute consent process;<br /><br />(b) the appropriate consideration of Local Development Plans in planning;<br /><br />(c) public consultation in respect of planning;<br /><br />(d) the right of the public to participate in environmental decision making as provided for under the Aarhus Convention.&rdquo;.  </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>This is another really important amendment in terms of the implications of the Act.  We have heard different opinions on what unfolds and again, the period is six months.  Perhaps, as Senator Boyhan has suggested, that should be longer.  It could be ten months, 18 months or two years but I think it is better to catch problems quickly rather than letting them run and repairing them afterwards.</p><p>This amendment provides for a report which would outline the implications of this legislation in respect of a number of key areas.  These are my key areas of concern, as I have outlined throughout the debate, leaving aside the issue of how exceptional circumstance is interpreted which is a separate one.</p><p>This amendment does not prejudice what the implications will be.  They may be as Senator Cummins has outlined or they may be as I have outlined.  Both are possibilities but we will be able to see which is the case if we have a report examining the impact of this legislation in terms of the powers of local authorities in respect of the substitute consent process and whether those powers are lesser or greater.  I believe that they will be lesser in respect of the substitute consent process and the amendment provides for a report which determines that question.</p><p>The report will also look at whether there is appropriate consideration of local development plans in planning.  I included this provision because one of the reasons for having local authorities as the first tier of decision making in relation to planning applications is that they are able to engage in a very detailed and knowledgeable way on local development plans.  That is somewhat different to what An Bord Plean&aacute;la brings to the table, although it may consider those local development plans in general.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Having the two-step process, whereby local planning authorities consider decisions first, brings important issues to light.  Because there will be planning applications under this legislation that will go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I am concerned of what the implications may or may not be on local development plans and whether they will be appropriately considered.  Again, the Minister of State may be confident An Bord Plean&aacute;la will appropriately consider them.  However, the report can show that.</p><p>In terms of public consultation on planning, a tier of such consultation will be lost when we move from having that two-stage process of local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to a direct move to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is also very important in terms of "(d) the right of the public to participate in environmental decision making as provided for under the Aarhus Convention".  Decisions that are taken on substitute consent for projects that have not had proper environmental impact or other proper assessments and the rights of citizens in respect of other associated planning applications that may be attached to application for a substitute consent are very important and are core issues here.</p><p>This amendment clearly addresses the concerns I have highlighted, but it does not seek to prejudice what the outcome on them may be.  If there is nothing to fear and if everything is fine, why not have a report that examines it?  If the Minister of State were to suggest a different timeframe for such a report, I would be open to that.  Senator Boyhan made a good point that the periods of time I have allowed may be too short.  However, we need to examine this and we need to make sure we get in quickly.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned strategic housing developments, SHDs, and that we are winding them down.  As someone who raised concerns about SHDs, who highlighted the problems that were likely to emerge, who asked that those concerns be taken on board, who raised flags about the problems that were unfolding, and who had to wait a number of years before the Government - a new Government, in fact; this Government - took on board the concerns about how the SHDs were unfolding, what I am trying to avoid here is what happened in the previous Oireachtas where we flagged concerns that were not listened to, and we then had to fix them very long after the fact.  This is a genuinely constructive proposal to avoid inadvertent or undesirable consequences from this legislation.</p></speech>

Similar to my response on amendment No. 13, amendment No. 14 seeks to impose a ministerial obligation to lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas, within six months of the passing of this Act, outlining the implications or impact of this legislation in respect of the powers of local authorities in respect of substitute consent processes, the appropriate consideration of local development plans in planning, public consultation in respect of planning, and the right of the public to participate in environmental decision-making as provided for under the Aarhus Convention.  While I understand the intention behind the proposed amendments, I am opposing amendment No. 14, because existing planning reporting arrangements are already in place that are robust and fit for purpose.  All planning decisions and related information are published promptly to the website of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and, additionally, these provisions will have no substantive implications for local development plans and consultations thereof.  The right of public participation in the environmental decision-making element of substitute consent is provided for in the planning Act, as amended by this Bill.  For these reasons, we will not accept amendment No. 14.</p> <p>I assure Members in relation to misinformation about the watering down of powers to local authorities that, in the first instance, the powers relating to substitute consent for local authorities are unchanged.  They provide a detailed planning report in the substitute consent process to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Second, on enforcement, normal enforcement powers apply under normal planning rules under the planning Act.</p></speech>

It would be useful to have, between now and Report Stage, a note on the normal enforcement powers.  Local authorities can give an input into An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but they will not get to start the process of a substitute consent application in the same way they will have been able to.  That is the key concern here.</p> <p>In terms of local development plans, it is not consultation on local plans that is at issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The concern is around the way in which local development plans are considered in regard to specific planning decisions.

I will now set out the main provisions of the Bill.<br/><br/>Part 2 provides the legislative basis for the electoral commission.  Chapter 3 of Part 2 sets out the governance arrangements.  Chapters 4 to 8, inclusive, of Part 2 provide for the transfer of existing electoral functions to an coimisi&uacute;n.  It will take over the work formerly carried out by the Referendum Commission.  It will be responsible for the register of political parties.  It will conduct reviews of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies and also conduct reviews of local electoral area boundaries, with this role being transferred from the local electoral area boundary committees.<br/><br/>Chapter 9 of Part 2 provides for an coimisi&uacute;n to take on a new policy research and advisory function.  As part of this role, it will conduct research on electoral policy and procedure and provide advice and recommendations, as required, to the Minister and the Government on electoral issues.  Annual research programmes will be prepared in consultation with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  An coimisi&uacute;n will also promote public awareness of and work to increase public participation in the State&rsquo;s electoral and democratic processes through education and information programmes.  It is empowered to produce <i>ex post</i>reports on how electoral events were administered.<br/><br/>Chapter 10 provides that an coimisi&uacute;n will have an oversight role regarding the register of electors, which will still be maintained and updated by registration authorities.  <br/><br/>Part 3 provides for the new and modernised arrangements for the registration of electors and amends key earlier electoral Acts.  Many amendments relate to technical updates arising from the move to a rolling register.<br/><br/>Section 83 provides a new process for people who have no fixed premises at which they are ordinarily registered to facilitate their inclusion on the electoral register.<br/><br/>Section 85 provides for the introduction of continuous registration by providing that the register in force at the time of commencement will remain in force to be updated.<br/><br/>Section 86 provides that the Minister may, by regulation, designate a single registration authority to establish, manage and maintain a shared database for use by all registration authorities.  Each local authority will remain responsible for its own register.<br/><br/>Section 88 provides for the data-sharing framework that will provide for the sharing of information between local authorities to maintain and update the register and the legal basis for the identity data cross-check between registration authorities and the Minister for Social Protection and the potential periodic data-sharing exercise.  Data protection tests for necessity and proportionality are included throughout this section.<br/><br/>Sections 89 and 93 make changes to postal voting provisions and special voting provisions and extend their availability to people with mental health difficulties that affect their ability to attend a polling station.<br/><br/>Section 91 provides for a new individual application process for entry to the register or for updating details and for the right of appeal.<br/><br/>Section 92 introduces anonymous registration for those whose safety might be at risk if their name and address or that of a member of their household were published.  A postal vote is provided for in such cases.<br/><br/>Section 94 provides for the new and pending electoral list which will enable pre-registration by 16- and 17-year-olds.  <br/><br/>Section 97 provides for reporting by each registration authority.<br/><br/>Section 99 sets out a new process for third-party claims in respect of possible inaccuracies with the register and provides for a right of appeal.  <br/><br/>Section 105 makes a series of changes to the second Schedule to the 1992 Act.  This includes specifying the information that authorities may require for their functions, including Eircodes, personal public service numbers, or PPSNs, and dates of birth.  Together, these changes will result in a more modern and accessible registration process, giving rise to a more accurate and up-to-date register of electors.<br/><br/>Part 4 runs from sections 118 to 141 and provides for transparency in respect of online political advertisements that have been purchased to run during the period of an election or referendum campaign.  Its key features are as follows.  It requires the compulsory labelling of paid online political advertisements during electoral periods.  In effect, each online political advertisement must be labelled as a political advertisement and must provide a link to specified information for voters on who is behind the advertisement, the total cost of the advertisement and why they are being targeted.  It sets out the obligations on online platforms, the buyers of online political advertisements and the restrictions that apply when such advertisements are being purchased from outside the State.  This Part empowers an coimisi&uacute;n to appoint authorised officers to monitor compliance with the provisions of Part 4 and to investigate any suspected breaches by online platforms or buyers of online political advertising to determine if enforcement action is needed.  Outside election periods, an coimisi&uacute;n may issue compliance notices in response to any contraventions of the requirements of Part 4.  Finally, this Part provides for a streamlined enforcement procedure, which will apply during the relatively narrow focus of an electoral period.<br/><br/>In addition to the provisions of Part 4, I flag as well that the Attorney General was requested to prepare proposals and options for inclusion in the Bill around the protection of the integrity of our electoral process.  These draft proposals were published on 10 June 2022 and are available on <i>www.gov.ie</i>.  Any necessary amendments to the Bill arising from this work will be brought forward as the legislation progresses.<br/><br/>Parts 3 and 5 include legislative amendments to facilitate the holding of polls if public health restrictions are in place during a pandemic.  These elements include the provision of alternative voting arrangements for special voters, such as long-stay residents in nursing homes, and flexibility for returning officers to allow polling to take place at electoral events over more than one day to facilitate social distancing at polling stations.<br/><br/>Part 6 strengthens our regulations concerning political donations and accounts.  The Bill provides the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, with a wide range of investigatory and enforcement powers, which are modelled on similar powers that SIPO currently has under the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  Section 154 requires that the leaders of political parties provide a written statement and accompanying statutory declaration each year to SIPO stating that donations from outside the State greater than &euro;100 in the preceding year have been declared in that statement.  Sections 162 and 167 make several amendments to Part 9 of the Electoral Act 1997 to provide for the preparation of consolidated annual statements of accounts by registered political parties.<br/><br/>Part 7 provides for same-day island voting at electoral events, specifying that voting at electoral events will take place on islands on the same day as the rest of the country.  It amends existing island voting provisions to remove early voting, with new powers being provided for the Minister, in consultation with returning officers, to shorten polling hours where required, having regard to local circumstances.<br/><br/>Part 8 clarifies that registered political parties may apply to the District Court for a licence to run periodical lotteries to support their fundraising activities.  The value of a contribution made by a person in connection with such an event falls within the meaning of a political donation and so the donation thresholds set in the Electoral Act 1997 apply to such contributions.<br/><br/>As can be seen, the Bill represents significant reform of electoral legislation, processes and structures.  It makes our system more accessible and inclusive and harnesses the opportunities presented by technology, while addressing the challenges arising from societal and technological change.<br/><br/>I thank the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for its detailed pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  The perspectives of the committee and those of the wide range of expert witnesses it consulted were invaluable during the drafting of the Bill.  I am glad to say that a significant majority of the recommendations set out in the joint committee&rsquo;s report are reflected in the Bill.  I look forward to this debate.</p></speech>

A number of parties did not send their general secretaries to the committee for engagement on what I believe is significant legislation.</p><p>With regard to the substance of the Bill, it is a very important and a welcome move that we will introduce a statutory electoral commission.  The new commission will educate the electorate.  It will have a permanent statutory footing to look after the register, albeit that local authorities will still have a role.  This is important and will bring a continuity that was not there in the past when we established an electoral commission just for the period of an election or referendum.  We will now have continuity with a body in place that will be responsible for elections.  It came through crystal clear in the pre-legislative scrutiny that this is needed, particularly as other countries have successfully put in place such electoral commissions.</p><p>The pre-registration of those aged 16 and 17 it is a welcome move, as is the move to allow to vote and participate in our democracy those people who for reasons of safety or for whatever reason are not comfortable with having their name on a register in a public forum.</p><p>I have a bone of contention with the identification of people on the electoral register.  The electoral register we have is not fit for purpose.  As Oireachtas Members we all know that if we were to send out a letter to people in a particular area a large number would be returned because those people are gone away, no longer living at the address or not known at the address.  The turnout figures for our elections are not accurate.  Having a unique identifier such as a PPS number to identify a person and to cross check the register is welcome.</p><p>I have some concerns about the existing electoral roll.  I know we will try to match people using the existing State apparatus.  During pre-legislative scrutiny it was suggested three attempts would be made to contact people before they would be removed from the electoral register.  I suggested this should occur within a limited time window because we cannot continue to operate an inaccurate register alongside a register that will be accurate due to linking unique identifiers to it.  If we are to carry out this exercise there is merit in doing so within a reasonable time period.  It cannot be left to go on <i>ad infinitum</i>whereby people sit on an electoral register forever just because they are on it at the point in time when the reform is being introduced.  We all know how inaccurate our electoral roll is despite the best efforts of staff in local authorities.</p><p>The changes being introduced on who will pay for advertising at election time are very important.  They will bring transparency to the process.  It is certainly something I teased out with the social media companies.  Content can be created outside of the State but the button can be clicked in Ireland.  Therefore, it needs to meet the advertising guidelines even though people may be employed in another country to all of the work.  Trying to capture this is very important.  We have strong protections in this State on political donations but we need to strengthen them to make sure money from outside the State is not inadvertently used to influence our elections.</p><p>Overall, I welcome the significant Bill.  I am sure there will be a number of amendments on Committee and Report Stages and I look forward to debating them in due course.  I thank the Minister of State for bringing the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I also thank the officials.  I also thank them for their engagement with the Oireachtas joint committee, which benefited from the evidence not only of the Department but of many stakeholders, political parties, political activists, people from non-governmental organisations and those involved in modern communications and social media platforms.  We benefited from all of their inputs and they were very welcome.</p> <p>The Bill is very important.  It is designed to reinforce and protect our democracy.  We have one of the oldest continuous democracies.  The Bill goes to the core not only of trying to protect our democracy but to ensure that its architecture, structures and operations are sustainable and robust.  I do not think at any other time our democracy has been under greater threat.  The Bill is timely.  It has been spoken about for a very long time, long before the Government came into office.  I congratulate the Minister of State and the Government on bringing forward the Bill and for doing so in a very prompt and inclusive fashion.  They have designed legislation that is intended to bring us into the next century of our democracy.</p> <p>We saw how in the aftermath of the presidential election in the US there was a direct attempt to undermine democracy and deny the people the outcome of their election.  Here, we had the aftermath of our most recent general election.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We saw a party that did not receive anything near a majority of the vote hold mass rallies in an attempt to assert their dominance, despite the will of the people, despite the outcome of the votes and despite the fact that they were way off anything like a majority.  It is, therefore, important not just for us here today, but for our children, our children's children and for our country's democracy into the future, that we get this legislation right.  The Bill goes a long way to achieving that and I am very happy to support it.  </p><p>I defy anybody to argue against the establishment of an independent statutory commission beyond the day-to-day of politics.  That is robust and substantial, and will serve our State right into the future, regardless of who is in power or who is the flavour of the week.  Its independence will be enshrined in the legislation.  It will be resourced and structured to safeguard democracy and the delivery of democracy into the future.</p><p>It is important that we have a statutory authority for the research and education functions.  There is also the issue of boundary reviews.  In my constituency of Dublin Central in my lifetime, how many boundary reviews have there been?  It is hard and it is undermining for voters.  They complain about the ever-changing nature of the amendments to the boundaries.  It is, therefore, important that the electoral commission will have responsibility for boundary reviews.  </p><p>The register of electors has historically been administered by the local authorities.  I commend everybody in the franchise section of the local authorities who have maintained our registers to date.  However, those registers fall far short of what is required in a modern democracy.  It is, therefore, correct that this legislation would seek to improve the registers by creating a shared, rolling register, one that will be a live, shared database.  Some political organisations have attempted to do the State's job by creating and operating their own database outside the State.  They have combined not just the register of electors but the marked register of electors.  This is privileged information.  I ask Members to think of this.  When people go to vote, there is a privilege in having an opportunity to vote, but one of the things they expect is the privacy of their vote.  They do not expect that information to be taken, combined, shared and hosted in another jurisdiction but that is what has been done.  That is how our registers have been abused.  Those are facts.  It is welcome that this legislation will tackle that issue and will ensure that the State is responsible, not just for compiling but for the operation and the maintenance of our registers.  They will do that on a continuous basis.  The registers will also encourage pre-registration for younger voters.  It will create for the first time the ability for homeless people to be registered.</p><p>I would like the Bill to also deal with personation, though, which is an important issue.  It is a real weakness, and it is risk to our democracy.  The commission should have the power to appoint independent personation officers in each polling station and they should be charged with ensuring that no personation is taking place.  It should be a severe offence to attempt to undermine our democracy by personating another voter.  </p><p>Political advertising and fundraising are also two important elements of the legislation and  I look forward to further debates on them with the Minister of State.  Political parties that operate solely within this State rely on fundraising that is accessible to people who take an interest in their communities, who want to make a contribution and who want to support the ideals and the values that they subscribe to and that those who represent them subscribe to.  I welcome the fact that fundraising ability is at the figure of &euro;10.  This amount will make it accessible to almost every citizen in our society.</p><p>There is also the issue of regulation of online political advertising.  The social media platforms themselves told us on the record of the House that truth does not matter.  It is not their business.  They do not care.  They are not interested in the veracity of the information, the messages or the political propaganda that is posted, shared or promoted on their sites.  It is important for our democracy that we ensure there is regulation of all social media platforms, all political messaging and all political advertising, so that there is at least some modicum of honesty in that.</p></speech>

I acknowledge, as previous speakers have done, that there was great collaborative work on the Bill by the joint committee.  I thank all those who were actively involved and participated in it.  I welcome this Bill on the whole.  I look forward to the debate, because there are a number of issues to tease out.  I will not repeat what other people have said.</p> <p>On the maintenance of the electoral registers, I am a strong advocate for local democracy and for local authorities.  However, on this occasion, it is right that the 31 local authorities should be duplicating or carrying out the monitoring of their own registers.  I do not doubt the capacity, inability or the integrity of a local authority but we should have a shared service.   One local authority should co-ordinate it.  We need a vast improvement on and professionalisation of how we manage the registers.  I would have thought that would have all been a matter for the electoral commission to decide on.  Maybe in time it will.  However, there are different sets of circumstances.  In my own local authority of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, the local authority staff do not call door-to-door.  That is a policy decision that was made.  In other parts of the country, the council sends out field workers to knock on doors.  How they operate the system is, therefore, discretionary.  We know that from old registers and out-of-date registers that everything needs to be tidied up.  We need to embrace technology.  I would clearly like to see another way.  This would be a central authority that would manage these registers in a focused and professional way.  It is the right thing to do.  I have spoken to a number of members of local authority management who say they see the merit in this idea.  We can leave this issue to another time, but I want flag that.  It is important to say that. </p> <p>I turn to the issue of lotteries and funding for parties.  I fully support the right to raise funds.  That is democracy.  We live in a democracy.  If people want to commit their money to their church, to an organisation, to a sports club or to a political party that is compliant with the law and this is within the parameters of the guidelines set down under legislation, I fully support that.  People work hard.  They are entitled to make a conscious choice to make a reasonable donation based on their means.  That is a matter for themselves and I support that.  </p> <p>I have mentioned the issue of pre-legislative scrutiny.  I am not sure that this is addressed enough in the legislation.  It is becoming practice for candidates in elections to send out mock ballot papers a day or two before an election.  I have been subject to one of those.  When I was running as a local authority candidate, a colleague of mine rang me and said that she had picked up a mock ballot paper from one of the parties.  I did not appear to have a picture on it, but I was a silhouette in black, although some were not.  I was also described loosely as &ldquo;an activist&rdquo;.  It did not say I was a community activist; it just said I was an activist.  It incorrectly gave my address as a different electoral ward from the one I in which I lived.  My neighbour stopped the individual candidate, who has since gone on to greater things in these Houses, and asked, &ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;Oh, it is just politics.&rdquo;  The neighbour said, &ldquo;I want you to stop doing it or I will not be voting for you.&rdquo;  He undertook to do so but an hour later his wife went down and met the same politician who was doing the same thing.  One might say that this was only a local election, and I won the election comfortably, as did the other four candidates.  The point I am trying to make is that we must look at that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A mocked-up official ballot paper could perhaps remove candidates who are alphabetically ahead of the candidate who produces it.  A mock ballot paper can present very false information and set out a professional person as someone else.  I so happened to have been a long-standing elected member.  The official ballot paper, which I checked the next day, described me as an elected member, a sitting councillor.  This is something that is coming up only today; I have not really given a lot of thought to it.  However, what I describe is potentially very damaging.  We need to keep an eye on it.  It is not right that anyone should purport to have and circulate an official ballot paper.  Once it has a sense of officialdom, people believe it must be the final race card.  There is potential for abuse in this regard.</p><p>On the issue of the marked registers, I hear what is being said but it is important to be honest in this debate.  The public at large do not know there is such a thing as a marked register.  We might rightly talk about the right of privacy at the ballot box but there is such a thing as a marked register for which one can apply for a given number of weeks after an election, either from the local authority or, in the case of a general election, the Oireachtas.  Many members of the public would be horrified at the thought that the law allows for marked registers.  If we are going to talk about people capturing, using or manipulating data, we must be honest with the public that, at this very time, it is permissible in law to have marked registers that show who presented for a ballot.  It does not necessarily mean one voted but that one presented at a polling station for a ballot paper.  One might not have exercised one's vote and might have taken the ballot paper home.  We need to reconsider this matter.  While I am aware of the political advantages of having the information, I am saying that if we are to talk about the issues of data, where registers end up and how they are used, we need to talk about this subject.  I am going to revisit it through an amendment.</p><p>This is great work.  There is cross-party collaboration.  Mindful of all that is in this legislation, we must encourage more people to vote.  I do not want to stymie political activity.  It is great that people are active and engaged and participating in elections.  We must be mindful that everything we do in this legislation is about encouraging people to participate in the political process and to vote.</p><p>I would love it if we could revisit at some stage the debate on giving 16-year-olds the right to participate in the election process.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s party drove the idea more than any other.  The debate may be for another day but I do not want to lose the opportunity to consider giving the franchise to 16-year-olds, certainly in local elections, if it is practical and possible.</p></speech>

He is very welcome to the House.  This is important legislation.  It will help to take anonymous money out of politics, to take online misinformation and bots out of politics and to bring more voters into the system.  It will regulate online political advertising, standardise and simplify the electoral register and protect the integrity of our elections.</p> <p>Democracy is not something we can take for granted.  We have seen it eroded in many other countries in recent years.  This Bill is a major achievement because it defends our democracy.  Over the past couple of years, we have seen an eroding, even within Ireland, because of the massive amounts of money some political parties have by comparison with others and the influence that some have online that others just do not have.  There are loopholes in the law and some are using them, which is actually damaging to our democracy.  That is why a cornerstone of the programme for Government was the setting up of an electoral commission.  That is why it is a cornerstone of Green Party politics.  In fact, our manifesto called for a commission to be set up.  We cannot answer everything in legislation.  That is what an independent commission is for.  An independent commission considers everything in a way that is fair and it is not just about the current Government or Opposition.</p> <p>The aspects of the Bill I am going to focus on are ones that are really important to me.  One is the exceedingly important update allowing the pre-registration of 16- and 17-year-olds on a pending electors list.  I have encountered at doorsteps people who had turned 18 and who had no idea what the closing date was and that they could have registered in advance of an election and voted.  A huge job of politicians when they go to doors is to try to educate people in that regard.  However, it should not be up to an individual politician at a doorstep.  After all, who is that politician?  Is he or she promising something in order to put somebody on the register?  We just do not know.</p> <p>I agree with almost everything said before me.  It is time to consider extending the franchise to 16- and 17-year-olds.  The education system, including civic, social and political education, has changed.  We have a lot more in our education system to inform young people about voting.  That means they need to feel they have a vote in order to exercise their right to participate in a democracy.  I would argue that an adult from 40 to 90 has no more of a clue about politics than somebody who is 17 or 18.  We have to show respect for younger people, particularly when it comes to matters associated with social and environmental justice.  These people are the ones who are left the legacy of the decisions made today in politics, and that is why they need the vote.  In fact, those who are towards the end of their lives have less motivation to vote with a long-term view in mind.</p> <p>I would like to bring up the issue of the independence of the commission.  I have been sent some suggested amendments, some of which are very good.  We have to make sure we have a mix of expertise in the commission.  That should probably be laid down very specifically in the Bill, although I realise it is to an extent.  However, while it may be desirable to have some experience or expertise of former members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or local authorities in the commission, I am not sure the commission should be balanced in favour of those who have served previously.  One of the key things in politics, particularly during elections, is that incumbents often have an advantage over those who are new.  That means there is a need for a commission that is independent and does not have a vested interest in bringing back incumbents when it comes to making decisions.</p> <p>A suggested amendment goes some way towards really taking on board the concern of Senator Boyhan over the giving out of false information.  There needs to be something to stop the circulation of false information.  I have seen people take legal cases over defamation.  In the last few weeks in the lead-up to an election, one should not have to take a criminal case to have disinformation challenged.</p> <p>I am going to speak again about my Bill on election posters and their restriction.  On the floor of the Seanad, Members had varying views on it.  Sinn F&eacute;in favours continuing with election posters, in the belief that any number is fine, but most of us do not have the funding or party members to do the electioneering, which includes putting up and taking down posters.  I have argued that it does nothing to enhance an election when, on pole after pole and poster after poster, there are just people&rsquo;s faces.  Voters need information on what candidates stand for.  That cannot be read on a pole.  That is why I favour having elections like those across Europe in which election posters are put on a centrally displayed board.  Everybody gets the same amount of space, regardless of his or her funding.  It is actually stated what candidates stand for, and they are accountable.  It is transparent.  I will hark back to the words of the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who is responsible for this area and who has done a huge amount of work on electoral reform.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was significant that the Minister of State said he would suggest the commission consider my Bill when it comes to examining the issue of election posters.

We can only achieve a thriving democracy when all of society has a stake in the process.  I want to focus on widening the franchise.  This House has done considerable work on seeking to lower the voting age to 16.  We have retabled the Electoral (Amendment) (Voting at 16) Bill in this term.  We were joined in that campaign by Senator Malcolm Byrne from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party who also tabled a Bill to lower the voting age to 16 in local and European elections.  We have the ability and right, as Senators, to do that through legislation.  It would not require a constitutional amendment, as proposed by citizens in the constitutional convention in March 2013.  This House has the power to lower the voting age to 16, thankfully, and I welcome the fact Senator Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly also supports that idea.  It has long been a commitment of green politics and the Green Party to support lowering the voting age to 16.  There are people in all parties and none who support lowering the voting age.  Let us do that and use this Bill to lower the voting age to 16.  We will not be here forever and, as such, we will not have the ability and privilege to legislate forever.  Let us do that and let Seanad &Eacute;ireann be the Chamber that lowers the voting age to 16.  While it is welcome that we allow people to register to vote before they reach the age of 18, it is a bit of a nod to the issue of reducing the voting age to 16.  I will not go as far as to say it is a bit of cop-out because it is a very important amendment.  I know people who did not get a chance to vote until they were 24 years of age because they may not have registered in time before their 18th birthday.  Sinn F&eacute;in will bring forward an amendment to lower the voting age to 16.  I appeal to Members, with respect and with dignity, to support that amendment because it comes from a genuine place.</p> <p>People are allowed to join a political party at the age of 16, as I did.  The activism and involvement of young people in recent referendum campaigns on civil marriage equality and the eighth amendment is evidence that when they are engaged, young people demonstrate an interest in mobilising and participating in the political process, despite the obstacles that we know they face.  Hopefully, the electoral commission will solve those issues, in addition to dealing with the nuts and bolts of running elections.  Those obstacles include a lack of formal education, the promotion of the idea of registering to vote and the difficulties with registering to vote.  As they have been mentioned, I will not go over those obstacles again.  However, they must be overcome to ensure young people feel empowered in their democracy and are included as voters at 16 and 17 years of age.</p> <p>For years, we have called for registration processes to make it easier for people to have their say.  The Union of Students in Ireland, USI, has been running registration campaigns for a long time.  We often encounter different processes in local authorities.  Some will not accept bulk registration forms, while others will.</p> <p>My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Donnghaile, will speak about votes in presidential elections and votes for citizens in the North.  While Seanad reform requires a separate Bill, we cannot fail to mention today the need to open up Seanad elections to everyone in this State, across the island and overseas if they have a university degree.  In addition, people who have been resident in Ireland but may not yet be citizens should be allowed a right to vote, regardless of their nationality or citizenship status if they have been here for a certain amount of time.</p> <p>An issue raised at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality was that civic, social and political education, CSPE, is being downgraded from an examination subject.  We have brought the Electoral (Amendment) (Voting at 16) Bill back to this House three times.  Every time, we have been told our young people need education and this, that and the other, yet CSPE has been removed as an examination subject.  Where does that leave young people&rsquo;s formal education in terms of voter participation and our politics?  Too often, these issues have been obstructed in this House.  We will have a chance to discuss the issue again on Committee Stage.  I put the House on notice in that respect and appeal to Senators for their support.</p> <p>The establishment of an electoral commission was first raised in the Oireachtas in 2004.  It has been agreed in consecutive programmes for Government since 2007.  The last time I checked, there were 66 state-run electoral commissions operating worldwide, 28 of which are in Europe.  In most cases, their remit is to promote and encourage participation and voting, oversee voter registration processes and collate electoral data.  Currently, these responsibilities lie with the local authorities and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p> <p>I, too, join Senator Boyhan in expressing some concern that we do not have a standardised registration process across local authorities.  While I hate to see power removed from local authorities, we need a standardised system.</p> <p>I raise the disquiet expressed by NGOs regarding political advocacy.  They are concerned that the definition of "political purposes" is too restrictive.  While we should have robust rules to ensure there are no external influences, we cannot limit the ability of NGOs.  We need to find a balance on that issue.  I hope my comrade will talk about proxy votes in the North, as I may not have time to do so.</p> <p>On a day that we should all be on the same page, I am saddened and disappointed that Fianna F&aacute;il felt it was necessary to bring forward an amendment to allow it to do legally what it could not do last year.  That is all I will say on that issue.  It has been spoken about at length in the other House.  I am disappointed, however, that we cannot all be on the same page today.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill, which is long overdue.  We have called for years for the establishment of an electoral commission, as have many Members of this House.</p></speech>

This legislation, the intention of which is to modernise our democracy, is very welcome.  For this reason, it is vitally important that we get the legislation right and get it done on a non-partisan basis.  What I do not want to see happen is what happened at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage when members took political positions on the Bill to get at other political parties.  When I speak about lottery fundraising, I will not do so from the perspective of another political party.  It is important we examine this legislation as a template, as opposed to a means of getting one over on our opponents.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->An independent electoral commission is a development that should be welcomed by all.  I credit the Minister for bringing this Bill to both Houses and thank everyone who has worked on this complex legislation which will bring about both social and political change.  A number of the academics who appeared before the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to discuss the Bill argued that the remit of the electoral commission should be broadened.  What we want to see at election time is that the electoral commission is responsible for making or changing the rules.</p><p>Ultimately, this Bill is about protecting the integrity and independence of the political and democratic process, which we in Ireland have not always done in the past.  As we have seen time and time again internationally in the past few years, this is not something we can take for granted.  Political results are used and weaponised by people after elections.  I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick in that respect.  We saw that happen in the US and that is why we need to a have a robust, independent electoral commission so that parties cannot create fake news around their own perspectives on an election.  We often see comments to the effect that certain individuals were "only" elected on the sixth or seventh count, as if their election does not have legitimacy.  That is ridiculous and it is why we need to have a robust system in place.</p><p>The Labour Party very much welcomes the regulation of online political advertising, which is provided for in the Bill.  The Internet and social media have a huge influence on politics and are often used to misrepresent what is happening in the political system.  Nefarious forces are trying to misrepresent on their own behalf.  Social media in particular are already dominating much political discussion and development.  Anything that engages people in politics is welcome but we must make sure it does not undermine the integrity of elections or referendums, as we saw happen with the Brexit referendum in the UK in 2016, for example.  Preserving the independence and integrity of our political and civic process should always be at the heart of what we are trying to achieve here.  It is also what the electoral commission will be tasked with and hopefully it will be properly resourced to achieve that goal.</p><p>The Labour Party also believes that electoral debates should be properly regulated by the independent electoral commission which could make recommendations on their conduct.  During the most recent election, there was enormous controversy around a particular decision by RT&Eacute;.  We believe this is an area that the electoral commission could oversee and regulate.  This also applies to the regulation of opinion polls which have been shown to significantly change the course of elections, particularly if people are led to believe that one party or candidate is going to win.</p><p>Modernisation of the electoral register is also very welcome but I agree with my colleagues that we need to have a centralised system.  The way that we currently maintain the register is not working.  Having 31 local authorities each holding its own register is not efficient, particularly in an age of information technology.  While it may not be included in this Bill, I want to see an electoral commission extending the franchise to Irish people living abroad who have the intention of coming back within a certain timeframe.  We saw a massive number of people come home to vote in the marriage equality referendum and we know that young Irish people are engaged.  We also know that for reasons such as the financial crash, the current housing crisis and the way they see our cities developing, many of our young people are moving abroad.  They should have the right to have a say on the political future of the country in which they want to live.  Just because they live in London, Paris or New York for a couple of years does not mean they should lose out on that chance.</p><p>I also want to see the vote extended to people at 16.  I understand that this might require a constitutional amendment but a referendum should not be a barrier to making changes that are right and promote democratic participation.  We also need to have a look at our citizenship fees which are among the highest in Europe.  Indeed, the cost is so prohibitive that many EU citizens do not apply for citizenship.  While they enjoy many entitlements as EU citizens, they cannot vote in D&aacute;il elections.  I know people from Madrid and France who have lived in Ireland for over 20 years and still cannot vote in constitutional referendums.  That is wrong.</p><p>That the Bill solely provides for pre-registration for those aged 16 and 17 shows a lack of ambition.  We should be looking at reducing the voting age.  This is a great opportunity to engage young people in politics.  It is time to empower all young people and allow them the opportunity to participate in a political process that will fundamentally affect them for years to come.  That is made clear by the housing and cost-of-living crises, as well as the crisis in education.</p><p>I want to speak about a recent Government amendment to the Bill relating to fundraising lotteries.  I believe in transparency, which is why an electoral commission is so important in terms of taking things out of political parties' narrow self-interest.  Every single political party, for its own reasons, can decide to insert provisions in this Electoral Reform Bill but it is unfair that this last-minute amendment was inserted.  It will benefit one political party.  This is particularly concerning because we have seen other measures inserted in the Bill to get at another political party.  This Bill will serve us for years to come, long after all of us have passed through this House.  We need to protect the independence and integrity of the electoral commission but the Government's last-minute amendment does not do that.  We all know how money can affect democracy.  We must make sure that all political parties and independent politicians have a relatively level playing pitch when it comes to fundraising and competing in elections.  This is vital to a free and fair democracy.  I support the registration of properties by political parties so that such ownership is transparent and people know about it.  That is why I believe the last-minute change is so sly, for want of a better word.</p><p>The Labour Party will work with the Minister of State to bring the best possible legislation into effect, to ensure a fair and independent democracy and electoral system and to produce ambitious legislation which will benefit this country and its political system for many years to come.</p><p>I echo Senator Warfield's comments on Senator Ruane's Bill.  I understand this measure was promised as part of the Electoral Reform Bill.  The Electoral Act is to be reviewed and I ask the Minister to commit to working with Senator Ruane and other members of the Civil Engagement Group when they submit amendments on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I welcome this Bill which will establish a much-needed electoral commission.  I also support the lowering of the voting age to 16 and we can do that as part of this legislation for the local and European elections in 2024.  The leadership shown by young people, particularly in the Irish Second-Level Students Union, on the leaving certificate and the question of climate change shows that they can have meaningful impact on our civic life.  The evidence from other countries, particularly Austria where this voting age has been in place for over 15 years, shows that young people do not tend to vote differently to older people but the fact that they can vote forces political parties to concentrate more on the issues of concern to them.  I support such a change.  Given that we can implement it by legislative means for the local and European elections in 2024, it would be appropriate to do so in this legislation.</p> <p>I also agree that voter education provisions are important.  Reducing the voting age is not the be-all and end-all.  There must be an educational process around our electoral systems and around digital and media literacy so that fake news can be recognised and so on.  This is an important aspect of this legislation.  Related to that, I suggest that under section 14, which gives the commission the power to establish committees, one specific committee be established to examine the issue of engaging young people in politics and the electoral process.  This would involve youth organisations and youth representatives looking at ways in which we can get young people more involved.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On another point that is tied into increasing levels of electoral literacy, in the appointment of members of the commission, section 9 sets out a number of areas of expertise.  One of the areas that may also be appropriate to consider in that regard is expertise in communication and education.  There are clear requirements about knowledge of electoral systems but we should also look at those with an understanding about how to educate and engage people in processes.  That would be welcome.  </p><p>At every election all of us know people who are away, who may have booked holidays far in advance or get caught at a wedding on the far side of the country and are unable to vote.  Quite frequently these are people who in all other circumstances would vote.  I have serious concerns about proxy voting but we need to look at some way in which we can extend a postal voting system to those who can show they are going to be away from the polling station on the day for legitimate reasons.  Some people can do that for work purposes.  There would have to be the necessary safeguards whereby a person would go to a Garda station, produce the necessary identification and vote in front of a garda.  The ballot would then be protected.  We all know the people of whom we speak and we should try to facilitate that category of voter insofar as possible while at the same time guarding against any threat of personation.  </p><p>Another piece of legislation we are dealing with is the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022.  It will be important that the electoral commission will work closely with the new media commission, particularly as the new media commission will have responsibility for online advertising.  There will be a thin line in some cases between what might be classified as political advertising and more general advertising.  Colleagues have also referred to the question of reform of the Seanad electoral processes.  When I introduced a Bill to enact the seventh amendment a commitment was given that this would be considered as part of this legislation.</p><p>In regard to the constituency review reports, section 56 states that each constituency should have three, four or five members.  Historically there were six and seven.  I sometimes wonder about the idea of not breaching county boundaries partly because of specific towns.  For example, both the Cathaoirleach and the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, will know towns such as Athlone which are served effectively by two constituencies.  It might make sense to look at a breach there.  I know where I am going with this.  Other places such as Carlow and Drogheda have significant parts of the towns outside the location.  I am aware that some colleagues in the south east had a bit of a row where some of that had been done.  I will finish on this point.  The obsession with county boundaries, which is driven by the GAA, is somewhat bizarre.  County boundaries are not natural designs in Irish history.  They started with King John who does not have the best reputation in this country.  He drew the county boundaries in Dublin.</p></speech>

The reason was that the British were trying to design it as a shire but three families, the O'Tooles, the O'Kavanaghs and the O'Byrnes all rebelled to delay the process.  Therefore, if we are to design it around the original county boundaries it should perhaps be around the O&rsquo;Byrne lands which stretched from Wicklow into Wexford and part of Carlow.</p></speech>

I can see a lively discussion at the next Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party meeting about issues like this in relation to Athlone and other places but I take the point the Senator is making.  In fairness, we have a small but important part of south Mayo in the constituency of Galway West.  To be fair when I say this at district meetings within our own party they do not like it.  They want to be back in Mayo and that goes for other areas as well.  That is a natural affinity.  They vote on the council elections in that county and they want the D&aacute;il representation to be congruent with that.  That is just part of it.  I am sure there will be many submissions from south Mayo to the next constituency commission, as there was in the past in Carlow and when Leitrim was split.  People have an affinity with their own county.</p><p>I welcome the Bill and the engagement by the committee in regard to this important body of work.  Some issues have not been taken up, such as proof of identity when voting.  When presenting to vote, a person has a polling card.  Other things are required also but are they looked for?  One hears stories of polling cards being bought for a pint of Guinness or for a fiver, or polling cards being handed around the place.  There are elements of truth in those stories because people can go in and not be questioned about their identification.  To believe folklore, this has happened for years.  </p><p>On fundraising, do we really want to go down the path of other countries?  In particular in the US a big part of the local representative's job is fundraising for the next election.  That is unhealthy.  In our party we run a fundraiser.  It is an important part of the democratic process to ensure that we can finance this without resorting to seeking thousands or millions of dollars as they do in the US to run their elections.  </p><p>Senator Moynihan and others talked about polling.  This is a bugbear of mine since the 2011 election when I had two opinion polls published.  One was published in <i>The Sunday Independent </i>which had me on a grandiose 15% for my would-be vote, which was wonderful if probably inflated.  A week before the election I was brought down to earth quickly when one of the local newspapers published an opinion poll that put me on less than 2%, I think it was 1.4%.  I ended up just getting the average of both of those polls, 7%.  I was elected by 17 votes.  Clearly an opinion poll can be published in that fashion a few days before an election whereby one is told one does not have a hope.  What is the point?  Fine Gael had four candidates running and this lad was last in the poll, and if he had not a hope why would anyone vote for him?  That is very difficult.  Everyone likes an underdog, or in that case the fourth underdog.  That has happened in various countries where it could be argued that opinion polls have impacted on election outcomes.  Perhaps a national opinion poll is fine but I have concerns about local polls.  That is perhaps something we might consider. </p><p>I welcome the changes regarding the islands.  I am trying to follow this exactly.  They are not in the explanatory memorandum but I am trying to follow the ins and outs of them.  Certainly many islanders feel very strongly about island voting on the same day as the rest of the country.  There was a concern about undue delays with the ballot papers being transported to the mainland.  There are attempts to change that as well. </p><p>The electoral review will be taking place based on the census figures.  This is based on the population of the country and those resident on the day but not the population of electors which in my view favours certain parts of the country.  It would certainly favour Dublin <i>viz-&agrave;-viz</i>the west of Ireland.  I have no doubt that the Minister will look at that for the forthcoming census.  It is an issue that I have concerns about.</p></speech>

The Bill proposes to make no change in terms of definition.  As the Minister knows, a campaign is under way by some NGOs for the definition of &ldquo;political purposes&rdquo; to be loosened to ensure that their huge sources of private funding &ndash; particularly foreign funding &ndash; are not captured by donation rules.  This arose from the case in 2018 where the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, tried to compel Amnesty International to return a large donation from the United States, which was given to it to fund a campaign for the introduction of abortion.  SIPO believed at the time that this was a political purpose within the relevant legislation.  As a result of the outworking of that case, where SIPO effectively pulled in its horns, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, Amnesty and other groups believe that, as the law stands, a political purpose is one that solely involves campaigning in elections, but it does not involve or include their campaigns to Irish laws on everything from abortion to transgender related issues and so on.  They seek to copper-fasten, if you like, that loophole by an amendment to the legislation that they are proposing.</p><p>However, in all of this, they seem to be confusing a political purpose with an electoral purpose.  There is, in fact, a big difference between the two.  &ldquo;Political&rdquo; is a word, as far as I know, that comes from Aristotle from the Greek work <i>politik&aacute;</i>, which means the affairs of the city.  By an ordinary dictionary meaning, political means relating to the Government or public affairs of a country.</p><p>Therefore, how could campaigns to change Irish laws not be deemed as political?  They are surely the very essence of the conduct of Government and public affairs.  As I said, in the wake of the Amnesty case, it seems that NGO money is not deemed to be used for a political purpose, even if it is used to campaign to change our laws or the Constitution, provided it is outside of the electoral period.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, which relies heavily on foreign funding at the moment, has been lobbying intensely, as I said, for this position to be loosened even further.  There is a campaign to protect foreign donations being funded by foreign donations, which strikes me as very strange indeed.  </p><p>Also strange was the fact that some backbench Members of the Minister's own party seemed to support that view, or did at least during the D&aacute;il debate on the Bill.  They seem not to grasp the implications of the present position, which is this: if you have an unaccountable lobby group with no mandate that can accept unlimited donations from abroad to fund campaigns to change our laws or Constitution, but if political parties and independent politicians with democratic mandates do not have the same rights, you could have a lobby group or a think tank established here tomorrow funded entirely with money from abroad, aiming to lobby for an Irish exit from the European Union, for example.  They could literally accept unlimited money &ndash; hundreds of millions &ndash; if they wanted to, from the UK, the US, Russia or wherever, and spend that unlimited money over many years, lobbying Irish politicians, mounting publicity campaigns, newspaper advertisements &ndash; the works.  All of that would be entirely legal under ICCL&rsquo;s and Amnesty&rsquo;s interpretation of the law as it stands, of which they seek to copper-fasten.  At the same time, if a political party, let us say Fianna F&aacute;il for argument&rsquo;s sake, wanted to mount an identical campaign to keep us in the European Union.  To fund their campaign, they would not be able to accept a penny of foreign donations and would have to rely on donations here in Ireland up to a maximum of &euro;2,500 and so on.  The Minister knows the rules.  </p><p>There is the contrast between the law as it stands, where a tiny unrepresentative lobby group with no membership or public support that we can prove have free rein to mount campaigns to change the law while those with an elected mandated are being hamstrung.  That is a situation the Minister needs to address.  It is not a case of copper-fastening this loophole, as ICCL and others want.  He needs to close that loophole and re-establish the fact that political purposes include campaigning outside of the electoral period.  I am amazed that the Minister has not thought to close that loophole in this legislation.  The definition of &ldquo;political purposes&rdquo; needs to be changed to prevent what is a distortion of democracy. </p><p>Viktor Orb&aacute;n and the Hungarian Government have been criticised for many things, no doubt some things justly and some not, but they were right when they criticised George Soros and the Open Society Foundations.  They criticised the phenomenon of massive foreign groups putting money into changing society, basically bypassing the democratic process.  We now know how the Open Society Foundations has compromised the independence of the European Court of Human Rights, with many of its kind of alumni now sitting on the benches.  We know that Open Society and other foundations are compromising the independence of UN special rapporteurs.  We need to have a debate about what happens when money comes in in large amounts from abroad to bankroll campaigns that may not actually have a mandate at all.  </p><p>I ask the Minister to consider closing the loophole that now appears to exist because of the development of law, in this case, to make sure that we do not have the massive interference of foreign funds in Irish elections, political referendums and other campaigns-----</p></speech>

The establishment of an electoral commission under the Bill is monumental and overdue.  Any democratic Government must aim to include as many people as possible in the electoral process and remove barriers to voting.  There are also welcome changes to incentivise electoral boundary decision-making processes that will hopefully avoid cutting off people from voting for representatives in their own counties.  I am particularly referring to my own county, among others.  We have seen people cut off from voting for Donegal representatives in the southern part of the county.  My hope is that whichever way the Donegal constituency is defined, whether it be a five or six-seater, or two or three-seater again, the boundaries must include all of Donegal in the electoral process and allow the people to vote for Donegal representatives.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind from today.</p> <p>Since the Local Government Reform Act 2014, there has been a slow erosion of local representation through the abolition of town councils and the removal of powers from county councils and county councillors.  Councils have since had to pick up the work left over from town councils and have fewer resources to work with.  Councils have since been stretched thin and need support to enable them to support their communities to the highest standards.  We have a good example of that in my home county.  Letterkenny lost its town council and there was marriage with the Milford electoral division as well.  The money is being sucked from the rural parts of the now-joined two electoral areas to keep Letterkenny town going.  It is not right.  It is not for today, but there is an issue there.  Resources have to be looked at from that perspective.  </p> <p>Towns that previously had local councils have suffered the most from this decision, which has strained the electoral system to provide adequate representation.  Unfortunately, the level of local representation that has been removed has not been replaced.  This must be addressed in the future.  I hope that having a centralised authority to tackle electoral issues will help bridge this representation gap and create space to discuss local representation going forward.  Having an electoral boundary committee that will make the right choice for the people will go a long way in addressing this democratic deficit.  </p> <p>I also want to strongly commend this Bill on its aim to tackle interference in our elections.  We are seeing foreign interference in elections and referendums in Ireland and across Europe taking place through political campaign financing and advertising on social media platforms.  This Bill has a very welcome set of provisions to tackle the existing issues that we have already identified.  The Bill also addresses the wider problems that have been seen in other European countries before they take root here.  Foreign money has been supporting certain political campaigns in our country and this Bill goes a long way in putting a stop to that.  We have seen great financial effort in social media advertising campaigns that aim to target people and influence their voting decisions.  I support the idea that all political advertisers must be open about their goals, audience targeting and amount spent.  The provisions here will add much needed transparency to a space that has so far been regulated by each platform according to its own standards.  We must put public trust and security first, and I believe this Bill will do just that.  </p> <p>All in all, this legislation is far-reaching and will update our voting system from top to bottom.  The Bill strives to modernise our democratic process and future-proof our elections.  Removing barriers to voting has been long awaited.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall Blaney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1812"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1812&amp;amp;pid=NiallBlaneyIND&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is also crucial that social media campaigning is addressed before any irreversible damage is done to our electoral process as we have seen happen in other countries.</p><p>I strongly support this Bill and I hope the conversation will continue about local representation and the importance of having local and effective representation.  Local democracy is very clean and has always been a very important part of our democracy down through the years.  The role played by county councils and councillors is a very important one.</p><p>While the removal of the dual mandate probably needed to be done, there has been a deficit across all councils since that has happened that has never been properly looked into and dealt with.  That is where that experience at Oireachtas level has been lost at council level and in council chambers.  There needs to be something greater than just the few meetings a year with Oireachtas colleagues.  There needs to be something there to make up that relationship because it is counties, particularly rural counties, that are losing infrastructurally as a result of that.</p></speech>

The Minister is very welcome.</p> <p>I want to begin by speaking briefly about my personal experience in campaigning and fighting elections in the North and the issue of proxy voting.  I understand anything new or different may present people with some concerns by definition of its newness.  I always find anything that strengthens and furthers people's ability to take part in the democratic process is positive and is welcome.  Certainly, over many years of being able to engage in proxy voting in the North, I am not aware of any real standard case or cause for concern within the electoral process.  This is not to pit one against the other because I believe both are positive, welcome and good.</p> <p>In terms of postal votes, for example, if a person incapable of reaching a polling station, he or she is equally incapable of reaching a post office or a postbox to post his or her vote.  The ability for people to have someone they know and trust to vote on their behalf, thereby ensuring they still have democratic expression, is a good and welcome thing.</p> <p>I also commend Senator Warfield&rsquo;s remarks, for which the Minister was not present, in respect of his long-standing campaign for votes to be extended to 16-year-olds in local government and European elections.  He has tabled legislation in this House on a number of occasions and we have been told it needed to be looked at and needed more time.  I hope people have had the opportunity to look at it and reflect on it, and to take the time that has passed to do this.  I certainly alert the Minister to the fact Senator Warfield and the rest of us in Sinn F&eacute;in will table amendments to this legislation that will seek to give 16-year-olds the vote in those elections.</p> <p>The following falls slightly outside the remit of this legislation, so I hope the Minister will indulge me very briefly.  It is on the issue of extending presidential voting rights to citizens outside the State.  I know it is a programme for Government commitment and is a long-standing commitment of political parties across the spectrum in this State and beyond.  We only have a limited amount of time to do this and, as I am sure the Minister will agree, a limited amount of time to win this, to make the arguments, to outline the rationale, to engage with our diaspora networks around the world, to ensure we are engaged with citizens in the North at this most crucial time, and to ensure people understand the importance of this and the reasons we need to ensure the referendum is won in order that citizens outside of the State are enfranchised with that vote.</p> <p>I would hope we could move the referendum Bill in this House, if that is required.  As I understand this from the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, a substantial amount of work and research was carried out by departmental officials in looking at the options for this.  The legislation is there and it is time it was moved.  Perhaps the Minister might give us an initial outline of when he, as Minister with ultimate responsibility for this, would be bringing it forward.</p> <p>I raise the issue that was raised by colleagues in the D&aacute;il pertaining to amendment No. 2 that was passed on Report Stage in that House, which is the amendment on lotteries.  I am not suggesting we have, nor do I want to engage in, a heated exchange across the Seanad floor on this issue, but a number of questions were posed.  I need to understand the rationale for amendment No. 2 on Report Stage, where it came from, the thinking behind it, what it is for, what it is seeking to do, and who it is seeking to benefit.  I found it astonishing that a Minister of State would respond on the floor of Parliament with no comment.  I hope the Minister will not respond here with no comment as opposed to giving us a full and comprehensive outline and rationale for that amendment, given that the questions did pertain to very legitimate and serious concerns around illegality by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on the lottery.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s rationale.  I am sure he equally agrees it is not good enough for Ministers anywhere, never mind within his own Department, to be responding to questions from the floor with simply no comment.</p></speech>

I thank him and the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, for the work they have done and I pay tribute to Senator Cummins for his outstanding work on the committee.  I also pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for his stewardship of the Bill.  To be fair to all of the Ministers and the Department, there has been accessibility and a willingness to debate.  I also thank the departmental officials.</p> <p>This is significant legislation that will change our electoral system forever.  It is one that many of us welcome, whether it is to register to vote, the register of electors, the maintenance of the political register, or the now very apt online regulation of political advertising.</p> <p>All of us who are practitioners of politics will welcome an electoral commission.  It will be impartial, independent and will have oversight of our electoral system, but I have a difficulty.  I do not mean this to be offensive but we need to put politicians who are either retired or local or non-general election candidates on the electoral commission.  We have judges and civil servants, and I will not name names, who are presiding and will be part of this commission. While I am not questioning their competence, they have never run for election.  In the main, they may not be involved in the political system at all, and the book and the theory, as the Minister knows quite well, are different from the reality.  The proof of it is the electoral boundary review.  Time after time we are told after every census we will have an independent electoral boundary review committee.  We pick the Clerk of the Seanad, the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, a judge here and whoever else to be on it.  Time and again they have decimated communities by drawing an arbitrary line, taking road A and road B, putting them in two different constituencies and disempowering people.  That cannot continue.  I appreciate we have come a long way from the gerrymander, and I am old enough to remember the last infamous one, which backfired badly on the then Minister, whom I will not name in the House, but the Minister here knows who I mean and what year it was.  I very much hope the electoral commission will work in respect of the political boundary review and will not disempower and disenfranchise communities.</p> <p>I also very much welcome the independence of the electoral commission.  Looking at what is happening in America, and the Cathaoirleach is very familiar with this, it is extraordinary that the secretary of state in the state of Georgia or Arizona, for example, can receive a phone call from the President of America looking to find 11,000 votes allegedly to change the outcome of the state's election.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is bad and unhealthy for democracy and bordering on corruption.  Therefore, I welcome integrity and independence.</p><p>Democracy costs money.  To have our democracy free and fair, I believe, requires State funding and State involvement in the funding of political parties.  I am unapologetic about that.  It sickens me to see people in America running for election raising millions of dollars at state, local and national levels to run a political campaign.  I hope that we can always have that transparency in our electoral system because if we lose that it will be back to the bad old days where none of us wants to go.  I hope that the electoral commission will be able to keep that at its core because we must fund democracy.  We must not be worried about what the commentariat will say about the funding of democracy.</p><p>Senator Kyne made a good point about opinion polls.  My time is nearly up but I will come back to it on Committee Stage, as I will to other issues.</p><p>I sincerely thank the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and his team in the Department for this Bill, which is long overdue.  It is an important piece of legislation that I hope we will all support.  I look forward to having further discussion on Committee and Report Stages.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Fitzpatrick and others in the party and, indeed, Senator Cummins, the Ministers of State, Deputy Peter Burke and Noonan, for their work on this.</p><p>It is important that we deal with the electoral process like this and the setting up of An Coimisi&uacute;n Toghch&aacute;in will be a major step forward in the protection of the democracy in the State.  We heard much talk here about outside influences and money.  I would like the younger generation to realise how hard people fought for our democracy and how easily it now could be influenced by influences outside, which have no great desire to help the State but to use it in a way that would not do us any good.</p><p>We must move with the times and we must acknowledge and realise that many democracies are now under attack.  Here we must be transparent in what we do.  There is no doubt about what is proposed in this Bill.  It will be transparent.  It will be good.  Once people start to focus on this, they will be quite appreciative of what we politicians are trying to do.</p><p>I welcome that we will be looking at the extension of postal voter categories.  I also would say - it is something that was brought up here by somebody and might be only a smaller point in the overall discussion - that sometimes when people are caught abroad on holiday and suddenly an election is called and they cannot vote, they get extremely annoyed and upset.  There are people who go abroad for work or whatever reasons who can be covered for a vote, but there are categories that are not covered.  It is something I would like looked at because many people will come to me stating that they had holidays planned, they like to vote every time and they cannot vote because they will be gone out of the country for the election.  </p><p>On the electoral register, I do not know if I would agree with one particular local authority having the overall say.  There is much to be benefited from each local authority doing the registers but people move around a great deal nowadays and it is difficult to keep a check on people.  We must reform it but rather than having one local authority overseeing the whole lot, it should be done through each local authority.</p><p><b></b>The boundary commission is not exactly what we are discussing here today but one would wonder at times how it makes decisions.  For my constituency of Roscommon-Galway, on the last occasion they decided to move 7,500 votes out of north Roscommon into Sligo-Leitrim-South Donegal.  They had done it with Cavan previously - they put them in with Sligo-Leitrim-South Donegal - and the Cavan people were not long saying that they had to get that changed.  Certainly, in a Roscommon context, we want our county intact.  It is something that we will be looking at in the future.  I suppose the commission has decisions to make but one would wonder sometimes how it works it out that way.  They will see us as population numbers and so many people per TD.  They work out from an existing system but this is something we should further reform as well.</p></speech>

I thank the Senators for their contribution to the debates.  I was not here for the first part.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, was here but I was watching contributions on the screen in the office.</p> <p>This Bill represents a fundamental reform of our electoral legislation and how we operate the electoral process within our system.  It is a once-in-a-generation piece of legislation and a fundamental change that has been long overdue.  The Bill will provide the upgrading of the apparatus of how we run our election system but also provide much needed accessibility, greater integrity and much greater transparency within our electoral process in a changing.</p> <p>I thank all Senators for their supportive and contributions to the debate.  There have been many contributions made here, with sensible suggestions and points of view brought forward that we will be able to tease out further on Committee Stage.  I would like to return to the core elements of the legislation.  Importantly, it will provide for an independent electoral commission which will bring together a range of electoral functions under one roof.  It will be positioned in a regulatory space.  It will take a high-level view of our electoral system and steer its evolution.</p> <p>The Bill, as I mentioned, will provide a much greater level of accessibility, greater integrity for our electoral processes, and much greater transparency about those who stand for elections, parties that run for election and the process of it.  This modernisation process will take better account of modern realities such as access to technology, a more mobile population and greater understanding of issues that different people face in exercising their rights.  I, as Minister, and the Government want to ensure that people are not hindered from exercising their electoral rights and we want more people involved in our electoral process.</p> <p>We have tried, through this process, to take on board a great deal of work that has been done by many groups and, indeed, by many politicians, many of whom are in this House, to look at how we can move this forward and realise a firm commitment within the programme for Government to modernise and protect our democracy.  That has been a comment that has been used loosely in the past about protecting democracy, and maybe used in a glib way too, but look at what has happened to our nearest neighbour.  Look at the interference that happened during the Brexit referendum.  Look at what we know happened in the US election.  These things happen.  There has been interference in other democracies by outside actors.  We do not have the luxury of assuming that will not happen here or, indeed, that it does not happen here.  That is why the area of online advertising and how online interacts with our electoral process is important.</p> <p>The Bill provides for the compulsory labelling of paid online political advertisements during electoral periods.  This will help to ensure transparency in the run up to elections and referendums and ensure that our elections remain free from hidden influences on how we vote.  All of us would want that.</p> <p>It strengthens our political donations and accounts regulation, giving SIPO more regulatory and new enforcement powers.</p> <p>The Bill makes prudent provisions to assist with holding electoral events during a pandemic, which we hope never to see again.</p> <p>The Bill will bring about, as Senator Kyne mentioned, same-day island voting, recognising that in the modern era we have the facilities to allow that all polling stations open on the same day.</p> <p>It brings clarity to fund-raising.  It brings clarity to the use of draws and lotteries by political parties as a legitimate part of their fund-raising activities.  I would like to restate that all contributions received in these are classified as political donations, and are subject to existing regulations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Buttimer raised a number of issues regarding the membership of the commission that I want to address.  Section 9 set sout the recommendations for appointment of ordinary members of the commission.  Section 9(4) states: </p><blockquote>	Where making recommendations of persons who are suitable for appointment as ordinary members of the Commission under this section, the Service shall have regard to the desirability of the members of the Commission possessing knowledge of, and experience in, matters connected with the following:  	(a) electoral matters, including any experience or expertise gained as a former member of the Houses of the Oireachtas or a local authority;  </blockquote><p>There are many instances in which boards and agencies have been set up and for some reason those who were elected and who served the State as a public representative have been precluded from being members.  That will not happen in this instance.  The process will be open.  People will apply to serve on the commission and specific criteria will apply.  No former public representative, either at local government or national level, will be excluded.<br/><br/>I am not going to get into a back and forth argument on political fundraising.  We all have our own views on that but I want to be very clear on the lottery piece.  The amendment was introduced on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It is intended to provide that registered political parties may apply to the District Court for a licence to run periodic lotteries to support their legitimate fundraising activities.  There is no secret in that.  For the avoidance of doubt, these provisions are intended to provide that any lotteries operated by any political party, whether referred to as draws, raffles, sweepstakes or otherwise, can continue to be run subject to the requirements under the new Part 8.  As was mentioned earlier, political parties engage in legitimate fundraising to run elections.  The alternative is that the taxpayer provides such funds, which I do not support.  I would not support a situation where the Exchequer would support every political party and cover all of their expenses at election time.  What is being done here is very clear.  It is a transparent and open process, brought forward in legislation in the D&aacute;il and brought into the Seanad to be debated.  I assume Members will accept that amendment.<br/><br/>We could go into a lot of other matters around political fundraising but I am not going to do so now.  That was done last week in the D&aacute;il and people can make up their own minds on the transparency of political parties, their fundraising activities and where they source their funds.  I want to look forward on this.  I want to put a permanent electoral commission in place that will manage our elections and referenda and that will ensure misinformation is called out and that our elections are protected as much as possible from outside actors who wish to damage our democracy and who wish to be able to influence the outcome of elections here in a certain way, by force of funds from abroad, for certain political reasons.  We know very well that states do this, including Russia, which has been engaged in a brutal invasion of Ukraine that we all condemn.  We all know of the Russian influence on elections on our doorstep and that is not something we should countenance.  We must being forward every possible measure to protect our electoral system.  <br/><br/>In fairness, when this legislation passes, and I thank all Members for their support for it, we will be an exemplar in Europe with our electoral commission, particularly in the context of the online space.  The Bill attempts to make sure that the information our people get is correct and where it is not correct or is being used for another campaign in the background, that is called out.  This is about protecting our democracy and our electoral system and is a very important step forward.  <br/><br/>I acknowledge Senator Byrne's contribution on the educational function of the commission and the different subgroups that the commission can set up.  I hope we can explore that more on Committee Stage.  The commission needs to be resourced appropriately to carry out the functions it is given.  Once we pass the legislation before the summer recess, we will move very quickly to the full establishment of the commission.  It will then be responsible for the next D&aacute;il boundary reviews.  The census data will be available and there is a constitutional imperative to review the boundaries in the light of that data.  I wish to confirm again that there will be no changes to the local electoral boundaries between now and the next local elections.  Changes will be made to boundaries for D&aacute;il and European elections once the census results are published.  <br/><br/>We have taken a number of points that Senators raised about the register and about pre-registration on board, including those raised by Senator Warfield.  He has worked on extending the franchise to those aged between 16 and 18.  I am bringing forward a pre-registration process so that 16- to 18-year-olds are registered in advance of the election, which is a significant step forward but I would expect the commission to look in more detail at that.  On votes for the diaspora in presidential elections, the relevant Bill has been returned to the D&aacute;il Order Paper.  It is under the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  <br/><br/>I thank Senators for their contributions and look forward to working with them on Committee Stage and moving this legislation, which is crucially important for our democracy here in the Republic, through the Houses.  </p></speech>
