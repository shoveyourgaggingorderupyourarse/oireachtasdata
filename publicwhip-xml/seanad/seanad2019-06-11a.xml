We need to get the message across that we all can contribute to reversing the damage caused by the burning of fossil fuels, etc.  We can do so by retrofitting primary schools and installing solar panels in order that they can produce electricity, not only for their own consumption but also for that of the wider community.  We need to work hard on this because retrofitting has not been incorporated into the planning permissions granted in respect of some new primary and secondary schools in the past two years.  Doing what I suggest would show that leadership is being given at national level and in local communities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-06-11a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019061100002#B00400"><p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy McHugh, I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue, which gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the Department's plans for upgrading older schools.  As he is aware, the Department will be investing &euro;8.4 billion in school buildings over the lifetime of Project Ireland 2040.  The latter will give rise to a 70% increase in the school building budget and this will be targeted at delivering the twin objectives of catering for the continued increase in demographics and a greater focus on refurbishment and upgrade of existing school stock.  The Governnent remains committed to delivering existing projects under the schools building programme as soon as possible.</p> <p>Project Ireland 2040 provides the investment necessary to implement the commitments in the Action Plan for Education to reform and modernise the school curriculum by committing to a physical education, PE, hall build and modernisation programme, starting in the second half of the Project Ireland 2040 period, which will ensure that students in all post-primary schools will have access to state-of-the-art PE facilities.  This will be particularly apt in the context of the roll-out of PE as a leaving certificate subject.  The next phase of the summer works scheme, which is currently open for applications, will facilitate a school laboratory modernisation programme.</p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills has been at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings since the development of its energy research programme in 1997.  Since 2017, it has partnered with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in an energy-efficient retrofit pilot scheme for schools.  This programme is focusing on medium to deep retrofit measures, including fabric, electrical and mechanical upgrades, to improve the energy efficiency of existing schools.  The longer-term outcome of the pilot will be to create an accurate and scaleable model for energy-efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland.</p> <p>In the national development plan, &euro;2.5 billion is identified for the refurbishment and construction of schools.  Part of this is an intention to undertake a deep energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Halligan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This pilot scheme will pave the way for and inform a much larger national schools' energy retrofit programme based on the range of topical retrofit options that will have been tried and tested during the scheme.  Some 16 schools have received energy retrofits under the programme to date.  The total expenditure involved was approximately &euro;7 million.  For 2019, proposed works for 17 schools are being progressed through tender and contract award stage.</p><p>The Department's technical guidance documents, TGDs, set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency.  Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the TGDs must achieve an A3 building energy rating.  Results show that new schools being built to the 2017 building regulations have A3 building energy ratings and are also - as has been assessed - up to 20% more efficient than required under the existing regulations.  All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements.  Successful and repeated results are then incorporated into the new school designs and refurbishments.  In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to schools' needs and are not just applied for the sake of attaching "renewable" tag to those schools.  It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable applications.  That is reasonable.   This has been assisted in previous years by means of the wall and attic insulation and the water conservation programmes.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has been using test schools to evaluate the suitability of renewable energy options for schools for the past 17 years.  More than 40% of the research programme features renewable aspects.  All new schools built in accordance with the current building regulations have a minimum of 10% of their energy supplied by photovoltaic, PV, panels and are future proofed to take advantage of developing technologies as they become available.  While it is not a planning requirement, major refurbishment projects facilitate the provision of PV installations to meet a base-load requirement - this is  the maximum electrical load of the school used outside school hours - to optimise the performance of the system.  In the context of projects that will be carried out under the 2020 summer works scheme and that will involve electrical upgrades, PV panels will be provided in order that the base-load requirements can be met and the performance of the system optimised.  The potential for the use of renewables in schools is under continued review by the research programmes of the Department's energy research programme through continued research and by monitoring improvements in technology and the marketplace.</p></speech>

He referred to the past 17 years in the context of this programme.  Should we not take a more aggressive approach to school renewal projects by using all available resources in order to ensure that there is energy saving, that value for money is secured and that oil and other fossil fuels will not be burned unnecessarily in order to provide heating.  Have we adopted an approach that is sufficiently aggressive?  The Government should be providing leadership in local communities by showing that this can be done with school premises.  People would then learn that they can do it in their houses.  We need to get that message across.  We need to work far harder on this issue.</p></speech>

With the TGDs as a benchmark and with the energy efficiency retrofit pilot scheme already well under way, the Department has demonstrated its commitment to achieving greater energy efficiency.  The pilot scheme has already cleared a path for the wider retrofit programme, funded under the national development plan, to follow.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Halligan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That, in itself, has sent out a message to other schools and the wider public that the Department is determined to do what we set out to do in the 2040 programme.  Schools currently being built to the 2017 building regulations have already an A3 energy rating.  It is good to see that they are 20% more efficient than required.  That is a clear message that is being sent out, including to the Government and future Governments, that it works.  The pilot scheme is very effective and is being noticed by other schools and the general public.</p></speech>

I thank him for responding to this very important item.  Newtownwhite national school is a rural school situated between Killala and Ballina and was in decline until September 2012 when under the patronage divestment process the patronage transferred from the Church of Ireland to Educate Together.  It is safe to say that since then the school has gone from strength to strength.  Next September the school will increase from 54 pupils this year to 60, which will allow it to have a third teacher.  I commend the Church of Ireland authorities, the local bishop, the school community and in particular the staff and board of management for their great work.  All of that is in spite of the fact that the school accommodation is poor.  The school is old and its accommodation is substandard to the modern day needs we envisage pupils should enjoy.  One can imagine their joy when they got the news six weeks ago that they will get new accommodation comprising two mainstream classrooms and a special education room.  That will enhance their offering and free up existing classrooms which can be put to other use such as for storage and a PE hall.</p> <p>That is good news.  However, there is a problem which has been ongoing for years.  At the time of the divestment the property was in the name of the Church of Ireland and, as I understand it, a lease must be drawn up between the Church of Ireland and the Department of Education and Skills to regularise the situation.  The school cannot act on foot of the notification from the Department to provide additional accommodation.  The Church of Ireland authorities have been waiting for years to get the lease sorted out and they are not happy for the project to continue without the lease being sorted.  That is only as a last resort and I hope we will make progress and get some answers today.</p> <p>I have been communicating with the office of the Minister, Deputy McHugh, and his predecessors for some time, inquiring about the reason the lease, which is a basic thing, has not been drawn up.  What are the delays and obstacles?  The school has no clear answers.  I should also add that the school is on a constrained site but is has an offer of land immediately adjoining the school to expand it.  The school community is not going to buy land when the title of the land it is on is not even sorted out.  We all understand that is a basic requirement for the school to be able to continue and to grow.  I would like some answers today and beyond that it would be a welcome relief to the staff, school community and parents if we could see some progress as they want their new accommodation to be built.</p></speech>

I thank her for raising the matter.  As she may be aware, the Newtownwhite Educate Together national school opened in September 2014 under the patronage divestment process.  The process is one of a number of steps taken by the Department of Education and Skills to provide a more diverse range of primary schools to cater for children of all religions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Halligan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Under this process, following surveys undertaken in 2012 and 2013, it was envisaged that existing school patrons would make buildings surplus to requirement available for greater diversity if sufficient demand for a school under different patronage could be demonstrated.  Some 11 new multi-denominational schools have been established under the process, with another due to be established in September.</p><p>As the Senator will be aware, the patronage of schools often involves ownership of schools and school properties.  The ownership and control of school property can be a complex issue, both constitutionally and in respect of property law and rights.  The ownership of the vast majority of school property by religious orders and trusts is an historical legacy of how Ireland's education system developed.  Typically, ownerships involve religious trusts; trustees; religious orders; bishops, both as landowners and school patrons; and the State.  The divesting of the school in Newtownwhite to Educate Together was facilitated by transfer from the Church of Ireland.  The Church of Ireland Trustees, which owns the property, and Educate Together engaged directly with each other in respect of the leasing arrangements for the property.  A draft lease was drawn up but was not finalised and executed between the parties.  The school authorities submitted an application to the Department for additional accommodation in September 2019 because an additional teacher had been sanctioned for the school.  The Department recently approved funding for additional accommodation for the school to construct two mainstream classrooms, one special education teacher room and one toilet for assisted users.  Given the timeframe for the planning permission process and the construction period, the school is working on interim solutions for September 2019.</p><p>On foot of a request from one of the parties, given that the school has been located in the property since 2014 and in recognition of the additional accommodation to be made available for the property, the Department recently agreed to engage with the representatives of the landowners with a view to regularising the position on the lease, which is good news for the Senator.  I have been told by the Department to inform the Senator that the case is being actively progressed.  As the engagement is ongoing, however, it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment on it, although the Department is committed to finishing the process.  Perhaps in a few weeks I will be able to provide further information but I am not currently at liberty to comment on the progress of the engagement.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, I am sure he will agree the issue of the lease, which has been ongoing since 2014, has taken an inordinate length of time to be resolved.  It must be resolved, however, because as I have described, a further delay will hold the school back in respect of the provision of additional accommodation and the acquiring of adjoining land, which the school cannot do.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State clarify whether the Department is party to the lease?  My understanding is that a lease will be drawn up between the Department and the Church of Ireland, while a sublease will be provided to Educate Together.  While the Minister of State's has not indicated that, it is indicated in the information provided to the school.  It is a significant issue because the Minister of State seemed to indicate there is an issue between Educate Together and the Church of Ireland Trustees, whereas my information suggests that the issue is with the Department.  The school community needs to identify the parties in question, the people who must agree on the lease and the parties to the lease.  I do not know if the Minister of State has the information to hand but it is critical to what I have asked.  Is the Department party to the lease?</p></speech>

Having briefly spoken to the Department earlier, I know that it is confident the negotiations will produce a result.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Halligan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I agree with the Senator that dealing with this issue since 2014 is a long time.

The Minister is well aware of my interest in this area.  I first raised the matter of Shannon Airport getting major European hub connectivity with him in the House on 6 December.  Shannon Airport is the only international airport in Ireland which does not have major European hub connectivity on a year-on basis.  While it has great connectivity through Heathrow, Dublin Airport has umpteen hub connections.  I accept it serves the capital city and that is important.  Cork Airport has good European hub connectivity through Amsterdam with two daily flights and Paris with one daily flight.  Shannon Airport, however, has no direct European hub connectivity.</p> <p>I raised the matter with the Minister on 6 December.  I followed it up with a meeting on Wednesday, 6 February, with the Shannon Airport management group and the Minister at which I put forward the argument that a Brexit strategic route development fund should be established.  It was a constructive meeting and, on foot of it, the Minister requested and encouraged Shannon Airport management group to make a submission to his Department on a route development strategy into a main European hub.  I understand this submission was made to the Minister and the Department by the group on 21 March.</p> <p>The context of this is straightforward.  Shannon is a key economic driver for the entire mid-west region, the western region and Limerick city.  The airport is doing well but it has major excess capacity.  Last year it served 1.86 million passengers but it has a capacity for 4.5 million passengers.  Accordingly, it is operating at just over 40% of its capacity and could accommodate 2.6 million extra passengers.  Dublin Airport is under severe pressure and the percentage of passengers its deals with is increasing.  In 2005, it accounted for 72% of all air passengers.  In the first quarter of 2019, however, Dublin Airport accounted for 87% while Shannon accounted for just under 4% and Cork over 6% of passenger numbers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are looking to drive economic growth outside Dublin exponentially under Project Ireland 2040.  Shannon Airport must be a key element of this.  The Minister's national aviation policy, the latest update of which appeared in February this year, talks about maximising the contribution of the aviation sector to Ireland's economic growth and development.  In terms of individual airports, the Government is looking to attract new business and sustainable development to drive local economies.  </p><p>I am asking for an update regarding a submission from Shannon Group to the Minister and Department on 21 March on foot of a meeting I organised with the management of Shannon Group on Wednesday, 6 February.  Where is that proposal?  We have very good connectivity through Heathrow Airport involving daily flights.  In light of Brexit, We need to complement that with major European hub connectivity.  Establishing a route out of Shannon Airport to a major European hub is critical in terms of Project Ireland 2040, Shannon Airport and, more particularly, the western region and my home city of Limerick.  </p></speech>

He has certainly been leading the field in addressing this issue and his concern for Shannon Airport is second to none.  In whatever form it takes, Brexit will have a significant impact on Ireland and requires planning by Government, business and citizens as well as at European Union level.  Brexit will have negative consequences in all scenarios but we are determined to be as ready as possible.</p> <p>On 8 May, Ireland and the UK signed an important memorandum of understanding on the common travel area, CTA, reaffirming the commitment of the UK and Irish Governments to maintaining the CTA in all circumstances.  Irish citizens will, therefore, continue to be able to move freely to live, work and study in the UK while British citizens can do the same in Ireland.  Similarly, the European Commission's regulation aimed at ensuring basic air connectivity in a no-deal scenario has been finalised and the UK has confirmed its intention to reciprocate the proposed measures.  While this cannot mitigate the overall impact of a no-deal scenario or the assurances contained in the negotiated withdrawal agreement, the fears that aircraft might not be able to fly in the event of a no-deal Brexit are being addressed and the risks to air travel between Ireland and the UK and the UK and the rest of Europe have been significantly mitigated.</p> <p>Government Departments, including mine, as well as key agencies, have been preparing for Brexit for three years now and notwithstanding any comfort we can take from commitments on the CTA and agreements on basic air connectivity, we continue to prepare through contingency planning and stakeholder engagement.  Brexit is being managed on a whole-of-Government basis and my Department is represented on all relevant cross-departmental co-ordination structures.  Additionally, an internal Brexit departmental committee meets monthly to oversee the Department's analyses and planning in the areas of aviation, maritime transport and tourism.  Officials have regular, often daily, contact with stakeholders on Brexit planning.</p> <p>Stakeholder engagement is important to the Government's domestic response to Brexit preparedness.  As well as support provided by the Government, businesses and other affected sectors also need to respond and be prepared.  Regardless of the impact of Brexit, there are some preparations that are purely good general business practice.  For example, my officials and I have continually stressed the importance of all stakeholders, including Shannon Airport, taking necessary steps within their control to prepare for</p> <p>Brexit.  This includes diversification of markets.  The Senator will be aware that establishing air transport connections is the result of commercial agreements between airlines and airports.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have no function in these commercial decisions.  However, I support all endeavours of Shannon Airport to ensure its prosperity in line with Government policy and taking account of national and EU law.</p> <p>The Senator referred to the fact that earlier this year, I met the chair and CEO of Shannon Group.  During this meeting, Brexit was raised, particularly with regard to EU hub connectivity.  I am aware that the company is endeavouring to secure alternative European hub connectivity post Brexit and is in discussions with several airline operators.  The company has submitted a document, to which the Senator referred, to me on this matter.  My officials are engaging with Shannon Group to explore what options are available to procure such air services, including supports from our tourism agency for co-operative marketing activity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government supports the development of air connectivity and the expansion of air services through funding from Tourism Ireland for co-operative marketing activity.  Co-operative campaigns with partners facilitate increased marketing effort and help promote the destination.  An increased Tourism Ireland budget for 2019 will continue to support both seasonal and regional growth and will be underscored by commitments to focus co-operative partnership activities on the January-April and October-December periods for Great Britain, North American and European markets.  I continue to encourage all airports to avail of this funding to optimise air services, including Shannon Airport regarding alternative European hub connections.</p><p>Project Ireland 2040 supports investment to promote high-quality international connectivity between Ireland the rest of the world.  This is vital in underpinning international competitiveness and to responding to challenges and opportunities arising from Brexit.  In line with the 2015 national aviation policy for Ireland, the role of Shannon Airport as a key tourism and business gateway will continue to be Government supported.  I welcome that Shannon Group is exploring ways of availing of funding under Project Ireland 2040, such as the urban regeneration and development fund and the rural regeneration and development fund.  My Department is engaging with Shannon Group to ensure all opportunities are maximised for the benefit of it and the region.</p></speech>

In respect of the submission made by Shannon Group to him and his officials on 21 March last, he indicated that his officials and the Shannon Group are exploring what options are available to procure air services to other hubs, including support from the tourism agency and co-operative marketing activity.  Time is of the essence.  Brexit is on the horizon.  From the point of view of Brexit readiness and Project Ireland 2040, which aims to achieve regional growth to complement Dublin, when does the Minister expect a decision to be made on the various options for progressing major hub connectivity between Shannon Group and other European airports such Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris?  The key issue is to secure major European hub connectivity so that we are Brexit-proof and we can drive passenger numbers into Ireland and alleviate pressure on Dublin Airport.  This would allow more people to fly into Shannon Airport where significant capacity is available.  The airport would be able to deal with well in excess of 2 million extra passengers.  As with Dublin Airport, Shannon has US pre-clearance.  The airport has a great deal to offer.  Will the Minister give a timeline by which his Department's formal consideration of the various options will conclude in order that Shannon Group can proceed with speed to get European route hub connectivity in place?</p></speech>

It is not good for the Senator and it would not be good for me to do so.  We will try to expedite this process and conclude as soon as we possibly can.  If I were to give the Senator a timeline for achieving what he wants, it would assume that we would be able to achieve it.  We will support the objective he has set out, as will Tourism Ireland and other agencies.  However, to give the Senator a date would be speculative and might raise false hopes that something will happen sooner.  My Department and I realise the urgency of this matter.  I will ask my officials to accelerate the talks in response to what the Senator has said and to continue to pursue the objective that he and my officials and I believe is important.</p></speech>

I note the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill is back again.</p> <p>I wish to raise an important report published by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The words do not come from Fianna F&aacute;il or the Opposition but from the Government's body, which points out that there are very significant challenges ahead.  It states that while growth is good, between &euro;3 billion and &euro;6 billion of our &euro;10 billion in corporation tax is quite vulnerable.  Of course, there is still the risk of a no-deal Brexit, which is certainly not off the table but very possible based on what is happening in the United Kingdom.  We have seen many spending Estimates massively ignored.  There was an additional &euro;645 million in supplementary funding for the Department of Health last year and overspends on capital projects such as the national children's hospital and broadband are happening far too often.</p> <p>The council has pointed out that the Government is very vulnerable to slippage in corporation tax.  The digital taxation agenda, which is worldwide at this stage in terms of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, and what is being discussed, has the potential to damage our corporation tax receipts.  Members should not misunderstand me - the more corporation tax we get, the better.  It is positive that there is so much foreign direct investment in this country, but let us not underestimate its vulnerability.  Thankfully, the estimates of corporation tax in all previous years up to recently have underestimated what we got.  We got more.  However, what goes up probably ends up going down.  I believe we must have a debate about our fiscal policy, our spending, the Estimates and that vulnerability.  In previous years people quite rightly criticised an over-reliance on stamp duty, but any drop in the corporation tax being paid by the top ten companies which pay half of the corporation tax would be very difficult.</p> <p>Second, I welcome the start of Men's Health Week, which began yesterday and runs until Father's Day next Sunday.  The purpose of the week is to highlight awareness of preventable health problems for men of all ages.  On average, men die four years younger than women and they have higher death rates than women in respect of all the leading causes of death.  Their smoking, drinking, obesity and suicide rates are much higher.  In Ireland, 75% of suicides are by men.  We must encourage men to look after their health and to take cognisance of what is happening.</p> <p>Finally, it is almost 30 years since smoky coal was banned in Dublin and other urban centres, but despite the green agenda and all our talk about climate change the Minister is still refusing to introduce a nationwide ban.  He is basically giving way to lobbyists who say it cannot be done.  If people in cities are entitled to clean air, people in the rest of the country are equally entitled to it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask that the Minister come to the House to tell us why he is not introducing a ban.

Over the weekend we heard of the terrible stigma attached to this scheme where low-income families, especially single mothers, are finding it extremely difficult to secure rental housing due to the stigma attached to the housing assistance payment.  The private rental market is not equipped to deal with the volume of renters, who are disproportionately low income earners in comparison with homeowners.  In many cases landlords do not want to deal with HAP while in other cases landlords simply do not know how.  The burden then falls on social housing provision, which we all know to be sorely lacking.  Due to chronic undersupply many people who should qualify for social housing are ranked instead as non-priority.  The problem HAP was introduced to solve persists.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has said as much in what should have been a call to action in 2015 when it reported on the inadequate provision of housing leading to family homelessness.  To its and to our dismay, the IHREC has again reiterated its position.  Under the European Social Charter it is the State's responsibility to provide for the right of the family to social, legal and economic protection.  The European Committee of Social Rights, ECSR, has constantly interpreted the right to economic, legal and social protection of family life, covered in Article 16 of the charter, as guaranteeing the right to adequate housing for families.  It is, therefore, the State's responsibility to provide adequate housing for families, but clearly the State is failing.  According to the IHREC newly released Comments on Ireland&rsquo;s 16th National Report on the implementation of the European Social Charter "...the State&rsquo;s failure to take sufficient and timely measures to ensure the social housing provided to families is of an adequate standard is a violation of Article 16."  One could not have it put any clearer than that.  The commission's report further states: "The decision to withdraw from building social housing and to instead provide rent supplement for private renters has made low income households extremely vulnerable to shocks in the housing market."</p> <p>Fine Gael is failing the most vulnerable in our society.  Working people across the island face discrimination of many varieties on a regular basis.  We should not tolerate this but the Government does little to act on one of the most prevalent human rights deficits or abuses in the State, which is centred in this city.  There are few forms of discrimination more heinous than the blight of homelessness, which is discrimination in the area of human rights based on income.  Housing is a human right but the State continues to send out the message that this applies only if a person can pay for it.  Human rights are not to be bought and sold, nor attached to income thresholds.  Rather, it is our duty in these Houses to ensure that those rights are upheld.  Every day that passes without the right to a home being enshrined in our Constitution, our collective shame grows in proportion to the number of families and children who live on our streets and in emergency accommodation.  Current solutions are nothing but a bandage over this wound in our national pride.  Government targets are not being met, and even if they were they are not high enough.  This is evidence of a Government that does not cherish all the children of the nation equally.</p></speech>

I raised this issue previously and asked about the possibility of bringing the Minister for Health to this House.  I want to discuss healthcare assistants because we need them.  Some 6,000 people in Ireland do not have homecare help.  There are 1,800 vacancies for healthcare assistants in Ireland yet to be filled.  I would like the Minister to come to the House to tell me what he would like to do about the situation, how he would like to improve conditions for current healthcare assistants and how he might like to find solutions within communities for healthcare assistants within people's homes and within nursing homes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2390"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People in villages and towns all over this country would be very happy to give up hours of their lives to provide home care and deal with the elderly if their pensions or social welfare benefits were not minimised or subjected to penalties as a result.  Addressing that could be one part of many parts of a creative solution to this problem.  As I have said previously, we should consider opening up the area of critical skills to healthcare assistants from abroad when we do not have enough in our own country.  We should, however, start with creative solutions in our own country, of which there are many.  We are not encouraging enough creative solutions, nor are we encouraging people in towns and villages who want to give help and aid to people they know who need help, whether it is acute care or just a few hours of their time each day.  People are afraid to do so because if they were to be paid for it, they would be penalised as they may have a small pension or social welfare entitlement.  We need to seriously think about this issue because it is very serious.  It is even more serious when one considers that we have 800 people in acute hospitals who cannot go home because there is nobody to care for them.</p><p>Members can talk all they like about housing, downsizing, taking people out of houses, minimising the size of houses and building villages.  That is all very well but it will not work unless we have services in place.  I am blue in the face from saying this and I know what I am talking about having watched a parent for three years with home care help who is now in a nursing home.  We better start attending to this issue because I am looking around and we are not getting younger.  Maybe the Members of the next Seanad will all be under 40 but this one is not.</p></speech>

We had a terrible stabbing yesterday on O'Connell Street.  I would like to put that in the context of the Government's decision, under pressure from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to reopen the Garda station in Stepaside, an area with falling crime statistics.  In the north inner city, Fitzgibbon Street Garda station has been closed or maybe there is one garda working in an adjoining office.  It is disgraceful that while the most deprived area of the city and the area with the highest crime rate does not have a proper Garda station, whereas Stepaside, a well heeled area in the Dublin mountains, is having a Garda station reopened at a cost of &euro;1.5 million.  It is a classic example of the Minister's stroke politics.</p></speech>

I am happy to say that today the Health Service Executive, HSE, leadership team has approved the drug.  I was quietly confident that it would be approved but I think until it was delivered the families deeply affected by the disease did not believe it would be.  I commend the Minister for Health on his fortitude in insisting on, and pushing for, that drug to be provided.  There are only 25 children in the country affected by this disease.  The drug is very expensive and there was a health technology assessment.  We should approach such assessments on an EU basis because with economies of scale we would have more negotiating power with drug companies as a bloc.  The way it currently operates is, in my view, unsatisfactory.</p><p>It has come to my attention recently that bottle banks which had been on private land in two locations in north Dublin were suddenly taken away and that they are no longer provided in this area of Kilbarrack and that one may be taken away in Killester.  It is not on that it should happen without there being an obvious place for people to go with their material for recycling.  There should be a national approach and a policy whereby these are provided in locations where they cannot just be taken away overnight.  Everyone is talking about the environment now with good reason but with actions such as this we are shooting ourselves in the foot.  It is a simple thing where people are in the habit of recycling and it is ridiculous for that opportunity to be taken away from them.</p></speech>

As far as I am aware there is a review going on.

These are logical and practical amendments that could be made to the Bill, if it comes to this House.

The alarms were to stop children playing on the sand on the beaches north and south of Dublin Bay.  It is an absolute scandal.  There is a plant in Ringsend that is operating at 20% over its capabilities and capacity.  There are what are called in the words of Irish Water controlled and uncontrolled releases.  Rainwater or grey water goes into the sewage treatment plant in Poolbeg, which serves 40% of the country's wastewater, then solids rise in water tanks and are deliberately released because the tanks cannot cope with the capacity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are addressing housing, planning and economic prosperity as part of the bigger plan to invest and encourage growth in Dublin and other locations.

I was recently approached by a person who received an award from the redress board and who is on a means-tested social welfare payment.  The person was informed that their case would be reassessed as a result of the award from the board.  That is absolutely crazy.  Those who have received money from the redress board may have worked in the Magdalen laundries, or may have been abused or exploited in other ways, and are dependent on the social welfare payments to which they are entitled.  I shudder to think that people's entitlements might be taken away because of money they received in respect of exploitation that took place many years ago.  The position must be clarified and the matter corrected if that to which I refer proves to be the case.  The person who made representations to me about it was told by health board officials that it was the case.  I would like to get clarification as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I commend our colleagues, Senator Gavan and Nash, who hosted a briefing earlier in the audiovisual, AV, room on the National Minimum Wage (Protection of Employee Tips) Bill 2017.  Senator Gavan will be bringing the Bill before the House tomorrow for Report Stage.  This is a very important Private Members' Bill which the Labour Party, as well as my colleague, Senator Norris, will be delighted to support.  It will give protection to employees and ensure that the tips customers think they are paying to waiting staff will actually go to them.  I cannot understand why the Government would oppose the Bill.  There have been indications that it will not be supported by Government, which is unfortunate.  Many of us, myself included, have worked in the service industry and all of us are well aware that there is an ongoing practice whereby so-called service charges are not paid to employees but are kept or withheld by employers.  We need to ensure that there is regulation in this area.  I will be surprised if the Government continues to oppose the Bill.</p> <p>I ask the Leader for a debate on women's health in light of the revelations that are emerging on foot of the publication of second Scally report earlier today.  My colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Kelly, has pointed out that the report is producing more questions than answers in many ways.  It appears that a laboratory in Manchester which was not accredited was analysing smear tests from women in Ireland.  A good deal of material is emerging.  In light of those disclosures and in view of what is happening with the national maternity hospital and the ongoing issues with ethical governance there, it would be useful to have a debate in due course.</p></speech>

It was an issue that came up on the doorsteps in the local elections, when people asked about inclusivity in sport as part of local recreation strategies.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Ross, or the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, to the House to talk about a national strategy for inclusivity in sport.  They should take the example of the brilliant Union Cup and the excellent voluntary effort of the Emerald Warriors to spread it out across the country.</p></speech>

On Friday, 31 May the HSE announced that all temporary staff would not have their contracts renewed and that all agency staff would be let go with immediate effect.  This came as a bolt from the blue for the staff, the community and the GPs, including myself.  If staff numbers are diminished it would lead to a direct degradation of the hospital.  It has been fiercely opposed by the community and I commend Senator Conway-Walsh for facilitating a public meeting last night, at which there was a massive turnout.  I have spoken on many occasions in this House, on the Order of Business or in Commencement debates with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, about the district hospital network.  These hospitals play a vital role in preventing admissions to, and facilitating discharges from, acute hospitals and this is especially important in the case of the hospital to which I refer, which is over 50 miles away from Castlebar.</p> <p>The district hospital network should not be seen as a relic of a bygone era as, with appropriate investment, its hospitals can facilitate respite care.  GPs and public health nurses can admit patients to these hospitals and some of them even have palliative care beds.  They get people off trolleys in acute hospitals because patients can be referred back to the district hospital.  They are a vital cog in the delivery of a modern health system and I would be grateful if the Leader would arrange for the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, to come into the House in the next few weeks to discuss the national district hospital network.</p> <p>I am delighted with the announcement about Spinraza.  I am thinking of Grace O'Malley, the nine year old girl from outside Ballinrobe who came up here with her parents earlier on in the year, and it is a fantastic announcement.</p></speech>

Some publicans have told me that, over the past three years, their insurance costs have risen by 33% while a hotel owner has told me that, this year, his insurance cost has risen by 50%.  I also asked them about payouts and claims.  When will the Judicial Council Bill 2017 be back before the House?  How quickly will we enact it?

We were accompanied by a number of representatives from transport companies north and south of the Border, many operating in the transportation of food and perishable products.  Last night, I visited a refrigerated freight company less than 20 miles from the Border, which is responsible for nearly 30% of the agrifood freight between North and South, in order to see at first hand how complicated a process this was.  It is a depot where over 2,000 palettes per night were shifted in the business of feeding people north and south of the Border, seven days a week, 365 days of the year.  It paints a bleak picture of what will happen after Brexit and there are particular concerns within the freight industry regarding a no-deal Brexit, especially the impact in the area of agrifood.  Concerns were raised last week in Leinster House about the number of extra vets necessary to carry out inspections, with one company stating that it would need 35 vets per night because some loads would have to be inspected three times.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ian Marshall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2486"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2486&amp;amp;pid=IanMarshall&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Concerns were raised about groupage work and hundreds of loads with multiple drops per lorry every night.  Concerns were also raised about supply chains, resourcing and the potential impact on agriculture, farm businesses and, ultimately, jobs.  Concerns were further raised about stockpiling currently and the negative impact that has.</p><p>Seamus Leheny shared some interesting facts about cross-Border traffic on social media in recent days.  The A1 crossing between Newry and Dundalk is currently a frictionless, strategic crossing.  On 5 June, in one 24-hour period, 8,390 goods vehicles crossed the Border via the A1, namely, 3,038 articulated vehicles, 919 rigid vehicles and 4,434 large goods vehicles, averaging 167 vehicles per hour or one lorry every 35 seconds.  If we consider six of the 300 crossings, we find that 13,483 vehicles crossed in the same 24-hour period.  If we consider that the average delay at a border is ten minutes, with agrifood presenting extra complexity due to sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, controls, and the fact that 33% of the sales to the Republic of Ireland is agrifood, we can then deduce that at peak times this equates to 115 lorries carrying agrifood and subject to these controls, with up to 50% undergoing physical inspections.  These means that one lorry would need to be inspected every 32 seconds.  In one hour, there would be a backlog of 70 trucks stretching 1 km down the motorway.  Bearing in mind that these trucks work on a delivery window for perishable goods of 45 minutes at depots, very large penalties and costs will be incurred.  A no-deal Brexit will create paralysis on the Border, add costs and cause friction and congestion.  Ultimately, trade and business on both sides of the Border will suffer.  No technological solution currently exists.  The complexity of this situation cannot be understated and the potential damage to the economy cannot be overstated.  When this group was asked about the one takeaway point from the meeting, it cited uncertainty and lack of clarity as the main concern.</p></speech>

They have been long awaited and are much needed and they will alleviate the situation in which farmers and small businesses find themselves.  The new rules will see a three-year cap on a 7.5% contribution from farmers and small business owners.  This has been advocated by the farming organisations in particular.  In the course of my public representation duties, I have encountered individual farmers who have been severely impacted by the current regime under which no cap applies and people face the prospect of an unlimited fee, tax or charge being applied to an asset.  This provision impacts on the future viability of farms and small businesses because it is like carrying a massive charge or loan on a property.  The 7.5% contribution can be more than the income one would earn from a business or a farm in terms of one's profit.  The current regime means that many farmers delayed going into a nursing home when they needed that care.  We are all living longer and we have to look after our elderly.  We have to make provision for their care and it must be paid for.  People need to contribute towards that cost but it cannot be an undue burden that people cannot manage.  Some fairness has prevailed in this matter being approved by Cabinet.  Likewise, I hope we can begin to examine the introduction of a similar fair deal type statutory model for home care packages.</p> <p>With the Cathaoirleach's indulgence, I also warmly welcome the announcement today of the approval of the drug, Spinraza.  While the number of families concerned is small, the impact of its approval will be tremendous for them.  I am sure they are breathing a sigh of relief for their loved ones who badly need to know they can secure a continuous supply of this medication.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I wish them all well and I compliment the Minister for sticking with it.</p></speech>

I wish to talk briefly about reconciliation within the context of competing narratives, in particular as we continue to navigate our way through these most crucial years of the decade of centenaries, as they have become known.  I think back to the example that I hope was set in Belfast City Hall where councillors invested &pound;3.5 million in a permanent exhibition telling and reflecting the competing narratives and experiences of our collective past.  While it has been testing and challenging at times, all of us, right across the traditions, have met the challenge head on, even though at times it has been hard and difficult for us.  I think of that as one example.</p><p>I also think of the impressive sight of a portrait of the rebel countess, Countess Markievicz, being hung in Westminster as part of the centenary of the 1916 Rising and the 1918 election and history that was made.  In this building too we reflect in equal stature people from a pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty perspective.  We do not shy away from that, which is important.  As we head further into the decade of centenaries we will all have to think of how we challenge ourselves and challenge each other to respectfully engage with our past, learn from it and build a better future for all of us.</p><p>I will outline the piece of work that I will undertake as a Belfast man.  On this day in 1981 Kieran Doherty was elected Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan.  He was an Anti-H Block/Armagh candidate.  He was also a hunger striker in Long Kesh at the time.  He died a short period after being elected and never got to take up his seat in Leinster House.  Navigating again through the challenging and at times contesting and competing narratives of our past we reflect on how we also might reflect Kieran - his experience, community and constituency of that time who hold him in the highest regard, as we do in Belfast as well &ndash; his loss and sacrifice in this building alongside people who sacrificed in a similar vein.</p></speech>

They are taking the issue very seriously and we should respond in a serious manner to their request.</p><p>Following on from what Senator Lawlor said, I had intended raising the issue of insurance as it is the most crucial issue currently.  We have heard about many hard cases yet there has been no response.  An all-party group composed of the Government and the Opposition should be tackling this issue.  I do not know whether the Judicial Council Bill will make any difference.  I read an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>on 16 May saying that a judge said a crash victim was prone to exaggeration before awarding her &euro;10,000.  At one time I praised the President of the Circuit Court, Mr. Justice Groarke, because I thought he was doing great work.  In this case he said Ms Cantaragiu was &quot;prone to misdescription, exaggeration, misrepresentation, apparent falsehood and a lack of accuracy about injuries, previous medical history and her attendances with doctors&quot;.  He said he believed her complaint of injury to her neck and lower back was &quot;probably correct&quot;, and that he would award her general damages of &euro;10,000, jointly and severally against all the parties involved.</p></speech>

The cost of his insurance has risen fourfold from &euro;7,000 to &euro;30,000, which will put his business in jeopardy.  We are all wringing our hands and everybody, including the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is speaking about the issue, but nobody in the Government takes it seriously.  That is why I asked the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, to return to the House and outline what exactly is happening.  If the passage of the Judicial Council Bill is necessary, why can it not be passed?  We have plenty of time.  The House was adjourned last week.

I assume there are other cases of former Members who were elected to the European Parliament.  I wish Senator Grace O'Sullivan well.</p> <p>I support Senator O'Mahony's point about the redress board and the compensation awarded to people.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection now asks those claiming social welfare for various details.  When he was Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen apologised to people such as those outlined by the Senator for how they were treated by the State.  It is unbelievable that the Department would hound those people, given that the then Taoiseach apologised to them.  One wonders what a Taoiseach's apology is worth.  I hope Senator O'Mahony receives a prompt response to clarify the matter quickly.</p> <p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for apologising to Ms Angela Kerins following the recent Supreme Court decision.  In a recent interview on how the Oireachtas will conduct its business in future, the Ceann Comhairle indicated that an internal group of civil servants had been assembled to examine the decision's implications and the broader functions of the Oireachtas.  He also said the group was considering streamlining how committees function, perhaps by giving the Business Committee a role.  He went on to say changes were imminent and that he hopes to put proposals to the D&aacute;il in September to amend its Standing Orders.  Will the Leader outline the role of this House in the changes that may be brought about, or in setting up an internal committee to review how committees are established and their roles and responsibilities?  He might give some indication in that regard because in the past three years, the Business Committee has not shown any respect for this House.  If it is to have a role in how this House runs or in how we conduct our business, I will have grave reservations.</p></speech>

I hope I will not be repeating what other Members may have stated.  The Judicial Council Bill has received support right across the House from Senators of every view and outlook.  Amendments were facilitated on Committee Stage in order to see the legislation through.  We were promised that further amendments would be tabled on Report Stage.  The time to be taken to formulate those amendments, which was originally thought to be a week, has extended to more than a month.  Will the Leader tell us when it is proposed to take the remaining Stages of the Judicial Council Bill?</p> <p>Like Senator Leyden, I do not believe judicial guidelines provided for in the Judicial Council Bill will be the be-all and end-all when it comes to how the State deals with compensation culture.  As far back as 2004, the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which was introduced when I was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, facilitated the introduction of extensive powers requiring people to swear affidavits, created criminal offences and required solicitors receiving instructions in civil litigation to explain clearly to their clients the implications of exaggerating claims.  The courts were given the express power to throw out an entire claim if any part of it was materially exaggerated.  That was done in the naive hope that civil litigation would be made more reasonable as a consequence.  Perhaps it has become more reasonable as a consequence.  At least, that law is in place.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh tabled a perjury Bill which also received unanimous support in the House, as well as support from the Department of Justice and Equality.  I was given to understand Government time would be made available for that Bill in order that it might progress.  However, we are now about to have yet another session on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, for which there is no public demand and which is a solution in search of a problem.</p></speech>

I know she will be a wonderful MEP.</p> <p>Yesterday, I visited Westminster.  Like the Taoiseach, I am concerned with the tone of the Conservative Party leadership race.  Everywhere I went yesterday, I was asked about the backstop and whether it can be renegotiated.  Every time I stated that it absolutely cannot be renegotiated and that the only deal is the one on the table.  The next month will be trying for the EU, the Government and, indeed, the British people.  What is happening is a charade.  It is not understood that there is only one deal in town, namely, the withdrawal agreement.  I am concerned - the Taoiseach said this in the D&aacute;il only a few minutes ago - that what is happening in the UK represents a disregarding of the responsibilities of national politicians.  Yesterday, I told every politician who asked me about backstop that there is no way there can be a border on the island of Ireland and that the matter is not up for negotiation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frank Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I told them that there is no way there could be a border on the island of Ireland.

I join with all colleagues in congratulating our colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, on her election to the European Parliament.  We wish her well and look forward to the second by-election on the agricultural panel in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I also congratulate all Members elected to the European Parliament and wish them well in their term of office.  I welcome our colleague and friend, Michael Mullins, and the friends of Senator Hopkins to the Public Gallery.</p> <p>I also join with Members in raising the issue of Spinraza and congratulate everyone involved.  I pay tribute to the Minister for, as Senator Noone noted, his perseverance and willingness to continue the campaign.  I welcome the decision today.  </p> <p>Senator Horkan raised the remarks today of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  In the context of the conversation, the Minister and the Government note the remarks and articulation by Professor Coffey and other members of the council.  I remind Senator Horkan that it was the previous Government that set up the council in order to have an open and frank dialogue and to shine a light on our economic policy.  I challenge Senator Horkan to look at the proposals by his own party colleagues and front bench and every single promise made by Fianna F&aacute;il in the run up to the next general election - whenever that is - that, along with those of Sinn F&eacute;in, would probably bankrupt the country.  Let us be clear.  We are a small open economy and we are at risk.  To to be fair, the Minister recognises that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has a role to play.  He takes its advice.  Our surplus is 0.2%, we have balanced the books and put aside a rainy day fund, unemployment is down to 4.6% or below, and we are investing 25% more in infrastructure.  The Government has committed to reducing our debt burden.  We are creating more jobs than ever before.  However, I accept the point that there needs to be prudence.  This requires prudence on the part of everybody in politics so that they do not grandstand with the electorate and promise everything and we have an honest debate about what we can and cannot achieve.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House.  The summer economic statement will be put before the House before we conclude for the summer recess.  I take Senator Horkan's points regarding that.  </p> <p>Many of us share the Senator's concern that the ban on smoky coal should have been introduced a long time ago but as he knows, the ban is of benefit to the country in terms of health, health outcomes, fresh air and breathing.  However, we live in a litigious society and there is the threat of litigation.  As the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il today, that is part of the reason but I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter.  </p> <p>Senators Gavan and Bacik referred to tomorrow night's Private Members' business.  The Minister has articulated a view that we need to be careful in what we do to ensure fairness around tips for workers and that there is transparency in that matter.  Tips are for workers.  The Minister will bring forward a payment of wages Bill in due course.  We will have that debate tomorrow night and I look forward to the Minister coming to the House for it.  </p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke about the HAP scheme.  Again, rather than delaying the House in giving a huge amount of time to the matter, I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House for a debate.  Alternatively, Senator Gavan might be best served by raising the issue as a Commencement matter.  </p> <p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell raised the issue of healthcare assistants.  She spoke about the need to fill vacant positions and tackle the critical skills shortage that exists.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->She also raised the issue of being able to age with dignity and care.  We concur and agree with all of these points.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has always said it is not about downsizing; it is about right sizing.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House and have a debate on the matter in due course.</p><p>Senator Norris raised the issue of litter on the north side.  I do not necessarily agree with the Senator.  The issue has also to do with a cultural attitude to littering.  It is not about having plastic bags.  It is about getting the mind right regarding litter.</p><p>We all share the Senator's concern about the stabbing on O'Connell Street this morning.  Government has reopened Garda stations.  We have increased investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As Senator Norris may have seen from the latest report by the Garda Commissioner in the allocation of the new recruits predominately to the north side of Dublin and to Drogheda, the Government is committed to ensuring that there is adequate policing in the areas to which the Senator refers.</p><p>Senator Noone also raised the important issue of bottle banks being removed.  The point the Senator makes is that in the context of those on private property, but also on public property, we need to find alternatives to give people an option to recycle and to be able to become, as I say, culturally in tune with what is the right thing to do.  I commend the Senator for that suggestion.  I thank her also for raising the issue of the European Union being able to negotiate on the issue of our drugs basket.</p><p>Senators Davitt and Leyden raised the issue of the Parole Board.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, is acutely aware of the pain and trauma suffered by victims of crime.  The Minister takes great care in reviewing the recommendations of the Parole Board.  There is, as the Senators will be aware, a Bill imminent.  The Minister is working on that Bill.  It will be before the House as soon as it is ready.  The Minister is extensively engaging with others on that particular matter.</p><p>Senator Boyhan raised the important matter of sewage in Dublin Bay.  It is one to which a response needs to be activated quickly.  We saw the benefit of Irish Water where Cork Harbour is now clean and where we have seen the elimination of dumping of raw sewage into the harbour.  Dublin Bay will benefit from similar activity by Irish Water in tandem with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p><p>Both Senators O'Mahony and Paddy Burke raised the issue of the payment by the redress board to an individual in receipt of a social welfare payment.  Both Members make valid points regarding the issue.  It is one for which I do not have an answer.  It is one with which I do not necessarily agree.  Senators O'Mahony and Paddy Burke might be best served by putting a Commencement matter before the House.</p><p>Senators Horkan and Bacik raised in a roundabout way similar issues about women's health and men's health.  I would be happy to have them debated in due course.</p><p>I join with Senator Richmond in congratulating the Emerald Warriors on the successful hosting of the Union Cup.  It was a good weekend of inclusivity for men's and women's rugby in Dublin.  I congratulate all involved on what was a wonderful show-casing of Ireland, and as Senator Richmond rightly said, of the voluntary effort by the Emerald Warriors' committee.  I commend all involved.  I thank Senator Richmond, who is wearing the tie this afternoon in the House, for his support of, and representation of the Oireachtas at, the event at the weekend.  I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Ross, or the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, come to the House to have a debate on inclusivity in sport.  It is something that we need to see debated, but also we need to encourage men and women in sport to be more inclusive in attitude.</p></speech>

I understand both the Minister, Deputy Ring, and Councillor Gerry Coyle have been very active in the matter and have been engaged with the HSE, which has refuted the accusation that there will be no more admissions.  There is an issue around three temporary contracts from three staff members who have been redeployed and have been given the option following discussion with the representatives in the area.  The district hospital in Belmullet and &Aacute;ras Deirbhle are very important locally to the people of Erris and beyond.  I am told there is no imminent threat to the hospital.</p></speech>
