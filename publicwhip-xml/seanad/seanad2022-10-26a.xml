Trihalomethane is the issue before us today.  This matter is the result of an engagement with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, with which the Leas-Chathaoirleach will be very familiar, as we all are.  I want to put on the record our thanks to that organisation for the amazing work they do in their communities on the management of quality water.</p><p>I am very keen to hear from the Minister of State regarding the ongoing engagement between the European Commission and the Department on trihalomethanes and the issues around this.  I understand there continues to be ongoing correspondence between the Commission and the Department in respect of Ireland's failure to address trihalomethanes in several public and private water supplies.  I also understand that the Commission has indicated to Ireland its intention to escalate this case further, which may result in possible fines for the Government.  The National Federation of Group Water Schemes has urged every group water scheme impacted at this stage to engage with their local authorities and to seek best advice and best practice.</p><p>It is important that we have a balanced discussion.  The key message is that the use of chlorine to ensure safe drinking water is important and necessary.  Trihalomethanes are formed as a result of adding chlorine to water, although the chlorine is essential to ensure the quality of our drinking water.  Most drinking water in Ireland comes from surface water sources such as rivers, lakes and streams and it has to be treated because there is vegetative matter getting into the water streams.  As I said, most drinking water is treated with chlorine, which kills the bacteria and viruses commonly found in drinking water by disinfecting it.</p><p>I will use the term THM for trihalomethane.  I went on the HSE website today.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	THMs can be ingested (swallowed), if present in water.<br /><br />THMs may be inhaled (breathed in), if present in air, as most THMs in water evaporate.<br /><br />THMs can be inhaled or absorbed though the skin while showering or bathing.   </blockquote> <p>On the question &quot;How can THMs affect my health?&quot;, the HSE website states:</p> <blockquote> 	Some studies suggest a link between long term exposure to THMs ... and cancer and reproductive effects but the evidence is not conclusive.<br /><br />THMs are classified as &lsquo;possibly carcinogenic&rsquo; to humans...<br /><br />There is some evidence that THMs cause cancer in animals.<br /><br />Some studies suggest that very long-term exposure [to] THMs may be linked to ... increased risk of some types of cancer in humans, in particular bladder and colon cancer.  The evidence however, is not conclusive. </blockquote> <p>On the question &quot;What can I do to reduce my exposure to THMs?&quot; the website deals with that in great detail.</p><p>We have three organisations responsible for water, namely, Irish Water, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which has a serious role in monitoring the quality of water, and the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.  I do not want to be alarmist but there is an issue in this regard.  At the kernel of this is the European Commission, which has raised concerns with the Government and the Department.  I would like to hear how that is going and what the Minister of State&rsquo;s knowledge is of these concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#B00100"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising the important issue of trihalomethanes, THMs, in our public water supplies, which gives me an opportunity to give an overview of the work being undertaken to improve the quality and resilience of our public and private water supplies.</p> <p>The programme for Government sets out clear and ambitious commitments to ensure that Irish Water accelerates the resolution of schemes on the remedial action list of the Environmental Protection Authority, EPA, including that the formation of THMs is minimised.  We are also continuing to invest in a multi-annual capital funding programme to improve the quality of drinking water in community owned and run rural group water schemes.</p> <p>For public water supplies, the Senator will appreciate that since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  The maintenance and remedial work necessary in our water system is ongoing and being actively pursued.  It is likely that it will take a number of years and investment cycles to fully resolve all the issues and risks and address the pressures of an increasing population and a changing climate.  In response, the Government is providing substantial funding to Irish Water to fulfil its role and has committed to an ambitious, multi-annual funding plan.  The Government is delivering on the &euro;8.5 billion funding package committed to in Project Ireland 2040.</p> <p>Irish Water has completed large and complex projects such as a new water treatment plant at Vartry and a full upgrade of the Leixlip water treatment plant.  These two projects alone improved water quality and supply resilience for 717,000 people.  Irish Water is taking action to remove the risk of elevated levels of THMs forming in all public water supplies.  At the end of 2016, there were 71 supplies on the EPA's remedial action list for THMs, impacting 464,791 customers.  As of 30 September 2022, there were 24 supplies serving 243,137 people on the remedial action list for THMs.</p> <p>For private group water schemes, each local authority acts as the supervisory authority for its own functional area under the drinking water regulations and is supervised in this role by the EPA.  Each group water scheme is community owned and run.  The Department is working directly with local authorities to resolve remaining issues with private group water schemes that have THM issues or risks.  The adoption of effective measures to ensure compliance with the directive requires local authority liaison and co-operation with the management and members of these schemes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#B00200"><p>I appreciate the Minister of State's detailed and comprehensive reply, which confirms that the European Commission has been raising these issues since 2014 which is a long time ago.  It also confirms that there was an issue with approximately 70 water supply zones.  Correspondence from the Commission issued to the Government in November 2021 indicates that it believes the drinking water directive has been breached in 30 water supply zones.  Would it be possible to publicly identify those 30 water supply zones?  It is important for the people who are drinking that water to know that issues relating to it are being contested between the Irish Government and the EU.</p> <p>The Minister of State has shed some light on the matter and given us some detail, which is very helpful.  He has given us facts, which are very important in the context of our water supply, public health and transparency.  Clearly, the Government is going to contest the Commission's findings and I ask that the Department keep us informed in that regard.  Again, I thank the Minister of State for shedding some light on this matter and sharing some of the facts of this case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#B00300"><p>I highlight the fact that solutions typically consist of water treatment plant upgrades, a new connection or water schemes being taken in charge by Irish Water.  The works to resolve the water quality issue are being funded under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's multi-annual rural water programme.</p><p>As the Senator said, the European Commission first raised the issue of THM compliance in Ireland back in 2014.  At that time, the Commission had concerns regarding 73 public water supplies and 24 private group water schemes.  The Commission has publicly recognised that Ireland has made progress in addressing elevated levels of THMs in drinking water.  However, in November 2021, the Commission referred Ireland to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failure to comply with the requirements of the drinking water directive.  In the referral, the Commission alleges that the level of THMs in drinking water has exceeded the parametric value established by the drinking water directive in 30 water supply zones, although this figure will be contested by Ireland during the case.  Ireland is currently finalising its defence to the case, with the assistance and advice of the Office of the Attorney General, and this will be submitted to the court at the end of October.</p><p>For the Senator's information, the EPA publishes its full remedial action list on its website at<i>www.epa.ie.  </i>This list provides a comprehensive picture of public water supply compliance and risk on an ongoing basis.  The EPA also publishes all of its audit results on its website.</p></speech>

According to the most recent census, the population of Ballinspittle has grown by over 10%.  It is a unique little part of the world that has so much going for it but there has been an issue with schools in the area for at least a decade.  The majority of the schools in the locality, taking in Kinsale, Ballinspittle, Rennies, Minane Bridge, Belgooly and Dunderrow, have been upgraded but there are two schools in the district that have not been upgraded.  One is Summercove National School and the other is Ballinspittle National School.</p> <p>I seek clarity on the next phase for Ballinspittle National School.  A substantial project went to tender during the summer comprising a brand new second floor, a library, offices, a general purpose building, a special education room, an administration room and a store room.  The tender closed at the start of August and the question now relates to the next phase.  I want to get clarity on how this project will be progressed.  What is the timeline in terms of when we will see shovels in the ground?  This development will have a hugely positive impact on the community.  I accept that this is a complicated building project that will probably take place over two phases.  It may be necessary to knock half of the school and then build the other half.  Clarity on how this project will proceed is very important.</p> <p>There has been significant development in the area in recent years.  There are eight mainstream classes in Ballinspittle National School.  There are four special resource teachers, two SNAs and over 200 pupils attending the school, which is a significant size in that part of the world.  The newly appointed principal, Ms Sheila Wall, is doing a fantastic job.</p> <p>I seek clarity on the next phases of the project.  Tenders have been received.  Have they been opened?  Is there an approved tenderer and what is the timeline for this new school to be built?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#C00100"><p>I thank Senator Lombard for raising this important matter regarding a statement on the progress of the new extension for Ballinspittle National School and an outline of the timelines for each project stage.  The major building project for the school is included in the Department&rsquo;s construction programme, which is being delivered under the national development plan.  The brief provides for the demolition of the existing buildings to provide accommodation for a new 12-classroom school, with three classrooms for pupils with special educational needs on the current site.</p> <p>This project entered architectural planning upon the appointment of the design team in July 2018.  Stage 1, preliminary design, was approved in July 2019, and the project then progressed to stage 2(a), developed design, where the design team developed the agreed design option and accurately cost planned the project so that it could be lodged for statutory approvals, including planning permission.</p> <p>Stage 2(a), developed design, was approved by the Department in August 2021, and the board of management and its design team were subsequently authorised to commence stage 2(b), detailed design.  Stage 2(b) included the applications for planning permission, fire safety certification, disability access certification and the preparation of tender documents.  Planning permission was secured for this project in April 2022.</p> <p>The stage 2(b) submission was received by the Department in late August 2022.  Following the Department&rsquo;s review of this submission, an initial stage 2(b) approval letter was issued to the board of management last week.  This included Department stage 2(b) comments for a design team review and a request for confirmation from the design team that, upon completion of this review, they are satisfied their tender documents are complete, correct and in compliance with Department technical guidance documents, building control regulations and public works tender-documentation requirements.</p> <p>The design team was authorised to carry out the pre-qualification of building contractors in June 2022, in parallel with the completion of stage 2(b).  The design team recently provided the Department with a draft pre-qualification report, which is currently under review.  Upon receipt of the design team stage 2(b), confirmations and completion of pre-qualification process, the Department will contact the board of management regarding the progress of this project to tender stage.</p> <p>The tender stage normally takes between six to eight months to complete and thereafter, subject to no unforeseen circumstances, the project will then progress to stage 4, construction.  Currently, the design team estimates a construction period of 20 months.</p></speech>

It is important to get clarity on the construction phase.  The period of 20 months is a similar period of time.  I am aware the proposal is to knock half of the existing school and to build a new structure, and then to knock the other half and build the other structure.</p> <p>I refer to the 20-month building timeframe.  When will we get to a point by which the appropriate tenders are done so that we can get to the next phase and have a definitive timeline of when the building will be opened?  I stress the need for this development as the population is growing.  It is a positive school, both socially and for the community.  Can we get clarification on when the new school will be opened?</p></speech>

I hear the Senator's concerns about the population growing, how there is a real need for this school in a strong community that is very positive towards it, and about the delivery of this new important project.</p> <p>From the information provided to me, I understand the project is at the end of the design team stage 2(b), confirmations and completion of pre-qualification process.  As soon as that is complete, which I believe will be soon, it will then move to tender stage which takes between six to eight months, with typically 20 months thereafter for the construction period, although that can change depending on the complexity of the construction.</p> <p>That is all the information I have to hand.  If I can get further information, I will endeavour to provide it to the Senator. </p></speech>

Following independence, Ireland and Czechoslovakia developed contacts at various levels, particularly at the League of Nations.</p> <p>Similar to Ireland, the Czech Republic has gone through periods in its history of being without independence.  Today, the Czech Republic is our partner within the European Union, where we hold shared values.  It is particularly important to remember our European bond this year as the Czech Republic holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.</p> <p>Closer relations followed the Velvet Revolution in 1989 and, in 1995, the Irish Embassy was established in Prague.  President V&aacute;clav Havel visited Ireland in 1996, during Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency.  Former President Mary Robinson said she agreed with EU enlargement and understood how important EU membership was for the Czech Republic, which joined the EU in 2004.  Ireland and the Czech Republic continue to share common values and commitments, including membership of the EU - as I alluded to earlier - and of the United Nations.</p> <p>In the front entrance of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, a bronze bust of renowned playwright V&aacute;clav Havel, the first President of the Czech Republic, was unveiled in mid-June 2015.  This was a significant and symbolic moment for Czech-Irish relations.  After the United States of America, Ireland became only the second country in the world where a national legislative assembly decided to permanently honour the legacy of former President Havel.  The two countries have been mutually enriching each other in many areas.</p> <p>The relationship is a long-standing one, as Irish Franciscans - colloquially called Hibernians - found refuge in Prague in 17th century.  After the Second World War, Czech glass manufacturer Charles Karel Bacik, found refuge in Ireland and later co-founded Waterford Glass.  His granddaughter, Deputy Ivana Bacik, is a renowned Irish politician and academic.  She is a distinguished former Member of this House and is now a Member of the Lower House - the other part of the bicameral Parliament - as well as leader of the Irish Labour Party.</p> <p>On this occasion, I wish the ambassador, H.E. Mr. Petr Kyn&scaron;tetr, and the over 8,000 Czechs living in Ireland a happy independence day.  I again welcome the delegation to Ireland.  It is wonderful to have them here.</p></speech>

I look forward to hearing the official response because for too long, Ireland has had the unfortunate title of being the puppy farm capital of Europe.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Government after Government has failed to get to grips with the situation and the dog-breeding establishment, DBE, guidelines are just that - guidelines.  Even if they were followed to the letter, which they are not, it would be perfectly reasonable in the eyes of this Government that a DBE keep hundreds of breeding bitches and have one staff member looking after 25 breeding bitches and all of their pups.</p><p>The use of automation, the industrial nature of puppy farms and the lack of human interaction are resulting in poorly-socialised dogs with a range of behavioural issues.  The fallout from this is becoming very clear in recent months as pounds are dealing with the Covid-regret puppies.  During the lockdowns, many people rushed into buying a puppy for the family without fully understanding the commitment that a dog is.  Puppy farms subsequently ramped up supply and churned out puppies to meet the insatiable demand.  They gave no thought to the misery they were inflicting on the breeding mothers or the welfare of the resulting pups.</p><p>Unfortunately, the chickens are now coming home to roost.  Some people are returning to work unable to look after the poor dogs, and others are dealing with young dogs that are manifesting a wide range of behavioural issues, many of which are due to the fact that they were born on these puppy farms.  PetBond vet, Dr. Tim Kirby, has rightly called such farms a chain of misery and said that mothers are stressed, overbred and pass on their fear and anxiety to their young.</p><p>Dogs Trust has seen a considerable increase in the number of dogs being surrendered and an overwhelming list from local authority pounds seeking shelter space with it.  In addition to the Covid-regret pups, those dealing in the sale of dogs are now faced with pups they cannot sell and an oversupply of breeding bitches.  Dogs Trust has had 54 pups in the past three weeks alone, 15 of which were crossbreeds taken in from the local pound with no mother to be found.  </p><p>To compound matters, the housing and cost-of-living crisis is impacting on the number of dogs being surrendered and abandoned.  Families with notices to quit or whose landlords will not allow pets are now having to surrender their much-loved pets, which is devastating and denies children the joy and life skills that pet ownership brings, which includes empathy.</p><p>When I visited the new Dublin county pound, I was told that up to 30% of surrenders are now down to housing issues and an increasing number of dogs are being abandoned or surrendered because they are old and have health issues.  Poor Lenny, a Shih Tzu, was left in a crate under a bridge recently.  Sam, an old cairn terrier, was found wandering along a busy road blind and covered in mange.  Maggie, the lurcher from Carlow-Kilkenny pound, was dehydrated and had acid burns, an untreated broken toe and a large growth on her hind leg.  There is no excuse for any of this and those responsible should be held accountable.  However, all of the shelters and pounds are saying the exact same thing: the phone will not stop ringing.  There is a tsunami of unwanted dogs.</p><p>What work is happening in the Department of Rural and Community Development to ensure that the local authority dog pounds are equipped for this situation?  What does the Minister plan to do in the long term to end the scourge of puppy farms and industrial dog breeding?  Cavan-Monaghan is home to some of the largest DBEs but the Minister of State's constituency of Wexford also has a large number of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#D00200"><p>On behalf of the Minister for Rural and Community Development, I thank Senator Boylan for affording me the opportunity to speak on this very important matter.  I understand there has been some concern about this issue.</p><p>The Department of Rural and Community Development has policy responsibility for dog control and dog-breeding establishments, while the local authorities are responsible for all operational activities.  These responsibilities include the dog-licensing and dog-warden service and the management and operation of the local authority pounds or shelters.  The Department of Rural and Community Development has no involvement in these operational activities.</p><p>With regard to the provision of pounds and shelters, section 15(2) of the Control of Dogs Act 1986 empowers local authorities to enter into arrangements with any person for the provision and maintenance of dog pounds or shelters.  The Act also provides for such persons or organisations to carry out the functions of the local authority under the Act with regard to the acceptance, detention, disposal and destruction of stray or unwanted dogs.</p><p>Section 15(3) of the 1986 Act empowers local authorities to enter into arrangements with any other local authority, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, or a person connected with animal welfare, for the exercise of all or any of its functions, other than its functions under sections 17 or 30 of the Act.  The procurement of any service related to local authority pounds is therefore a matter for each local authority and the management and operation of such pounds or shelters are matters solely for the relevant local authority.  Similarly, the enforcement of welfare standards for all animals, including the welfare of dogs in pounds or shelters, is a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and one in which the Minister's Department has no direct role.</p><p>The Department of Rural and Community Development publishes annual statistics on local authority dog-related activities including statistics on local authority pounds and stray and unwanted dogs and makes them available at <i>gov.ie</i>.  The 2021 dog-control statistics, made up of returns from all local authorities, indicate that there are 34 local authority dog shelters or pounds.  I am pleased to note that the number of stray, seized and unwanted dogs entering local authority pounds is decreasing year on year.  The figures are down from more than 26,000 in 2002 to 4,270 in 2021.  This figure was 5,310 in 2020; 9,162 in 2019; 9,961 in 2018; and 11,774 in 2017.</p><p>Similarly, the total number of dogs euthanised in local authority pounds has reduced dramatically in recent years.  In 2021, 168 dogs were euthanised in local authority pounds which was down from 172 in 2020 and 1,674 in 2016.  This continues the year-on-year annual trend in the decline in the number of dogs euthanised which is down from just over 215,000 in 2002.</p><p>These figures show the tremendous work being done by the local authority dog warden and pound service in the re-homing of dogs and their active engagement with dog welfare groups and charities.  Some 1,077 dogs were re-homed directly by local authority pounds and 1,934 were transferred to dog welfare groups for re-homing in 2021.  In 2020, 1,341 dogs were re-homed directly and 2,545 were transferred to dog welfare groups.</p><p>These statistics also demonstrate the success of the neutering and microchipping programmes operated by animal welfare charities.  These programmes operated by some animal welfare charities, with some limited support from the Minister's Department, have successfully reduced the number of unwanted litters of puppies.  Ongoing microchipping has also facilitated the reunification of 1,064 dogs with their owners in 2021 and of 1,286 in 2020 and 1,924 in 2019.</p></speech>

The Department of Rural and Community Development has the responsibility for the Control of Dogs Act but, once the dog is seized or surrendered, it is the local authority's problem and we had the same issue when the Minister of State's Department officials came before the committee.  They have taken their eye off the ball.</p> <p>The reduction in the number of dogs euthanised is due to dogs going to animal welfare organisations.  Dogs Trust alone has seen an increase of up to 2,100 dogs compared with 1,600 last year.  One database has shown a 46% increase in dogs microchipped in the past 12 months and many of those presenting at the pounds are not even microchipped.  We are back where we were ten years ago and face a tsunami of unwanted dogs.  It just shows why the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine called for all of the animal welfare issues to be brought into one Department.  They are scattered all over the place and nobody is focused on the tsunami of dogs that are coming down the line.</p></speech>

I ask members of the public to do their research if they plan to buy a dog this Christmas.  A dog is for life and owning one comes with many responsibilities.  Dogs are lovable creatures which can bring great joy and provide many physical and mental health benefits to a family or household.</p> <p>However, I ask that people consider their lifestyles.  A dog needs to be licensed, microchipped and exercised on a daily basis.  They need appropriate food, nutrition and veterinary care.  This can be quite time-consuming and expensive.  If, after considering all possible issues, member of the public wish to add a dog to their household, I ask that they consider their local authority dog shelter and-or local animal welfare shelter.  These shelters have numerous dogs available for loving homes and families.</p> <p>As we approach Christmas, the Minister and her Department will once again support any media campaigns regarding responsible dog ownership as they have done in previous years.</p></speech>

I have huge respect for the function of this House that is Commencement matters, which is why I do not table Commencement matters every week asking Ministers to come before the House.  This Commencement matter does not, with all due respect, fall under the brief of the Minister of State, Deputy Browne.  To have a Minister respond on behalf of another, to me, makes the engagement extremely dishonest and inauthentic.  The Minister of State has no idea what I am going to say in my four minutes or in my two-minute supplementary contribution and will come in with a script that has been pre-written.  The engagement is therefore not real and feels too much like theatre to me.  I would much rather re-table my Commencement matter when the Minister can have the integrity to respect the functions of this House and the one opportunity we get, through Commencement matters, to engage with Departments that look after the briefs in respect of which we ask Ministers to come before the House.  I therefore withdraw my Commencement matter.</p></speech>

I thank the Cathaoirleach's office for choosing this Commencement matter.</p> <p>As the Minister of State will know, the school meals programme provides funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged schoolchildren.  The programme is approved and funded by the Department of Social Protection, and funding is based on a rate of payment per meal per child, per day.</p> <p>I recently met with Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, GRETB, which very much values this scheme and does tremendous work for schools across its region, in both city and county areas as well as in Connemara.  GRETB is concerned about a number of issues.</p> <p>First, there has been no review of Department of Social Protection maximum rates of payment in over a decade.  The Department of Social Protection is aware of the extra costs currently facing suppliers.  GRETB understands that an independent evaluation of the school meals programme has taken place and that its preliminary findings will inform future policy decisions.  The Department, however, has provided no update.  Suppliers are no longer applying for school meals tenders, and current suppliers are withdrawing from the scheme to mitigate their losses.  This is a serious situation in that nobody is applying for tenders to provide the school meals for which the Department and the Government are paying.  That is one of the main issues GRETB is experiencing in respect of school meals.</p> <p>Merlin College was awarded DEIS status on 7 July of this year for school meals for 700 students.  GRETB ran an accelerated school meals procurement procedure during August, which received no tender response.  GRETB is at this time unable to recruit a supplier for Merlin College that is prepared to provide cold lunches at the price stipulated.  Therefore, students do not have access to school catering services.  Col&aacute;iste Cholmcille, Indreabh&aacute;n, and Col&aacute;iste na bPiarsach, Ros Muc, both DEIS schools, have been advised by their tender-holder that he is no longer able to provide school meals at the current price and that his losses are accumulating.  Elphin Community College, County Roscommon, which provides school breakfasts, has been advised by its tender-supplier that it is running at a loss and has been for the past year.  GRETB is aware of other ETBs experiencing issues with the appointment of tenderers for the school meals programme.</p> <p>As for the basic payment rates for breakfasts or snacks, the maximum rate of pay per child per day is 60 cent.  That requires the provision of two items.  An example is one serving of wholemeal or wholegrain cereal of bread plus one serving of fruit or one serving of milk, yoghurt or cheese.  For a lunch the maximum rate of payment is &euro;1.40 for one substantial item and one small item plus a drink.  That also includes a wholemeal or wholegrain sandwich or roll containing one serving of meat, poultry, egg or cheese, one serving of salad and one serving of fruit plus a drink - for example, water, milk or unsweetened juice.  For dinner the maximum rate of payment is &euro;1.90 per child per day.  That is for a hot meal and a drink.  That includes one serving of meat, poultry, egg or beans plus one serving of potatoes, pasta or rice, plus two servings of vegetables and fruit plus a drink - again, milk, water or unsweetened juice.  For a hot meal the rate is &euro;2.90.  That is per the nutritional standards document as well.</p> <p>This is a very important and much-valued scheme but it is under huge pressure.  I might use the word "crisis" at this stage because, as I said, when tenderers do not even apply to provide the scheme and when tenderers that are providing it are doing so at a loss in the hope that there will be a review and additional rates or that the situation will improve, that is a serious situation for the communities involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#E00500"><p>I thank Senator Kyne for raising this very important matter of the rates paid to providers of school meals across the country under the school meals programme.  The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,700 schools and organisations, benefiting 260,000 children.  The objective of the programme is to provide regular nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good-quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p> <p>A budget of &euro;65.1 million has been provided for the scheme this year, with an additional &euro;9 million provided to allow access to all newly designated DEIS schools from September 2022.  Funding under the school meals programme can be provided for breakfast, snacks, cold lunches, dinner, hot school meals and after-school clubs and is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal provided.</p> <p>As part of budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019 providing hot school meals in primary schools.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefiting 6,744 students for the 2019-20 academic year and was aimed at primary schools with no on-site cooking facilities.  An independent review of the hot school meals pilot which was completed in July 2020 found that all stakeholders indicated that the pilot project had a positive impact on children's diet, behaviour, attentiveness and psychological well-being.</p> <p>In budget 2021 the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, announced that an additional &euro;5.5 million would be provided to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children currently receiving the cold lunch option.</p> <p>Budget 2022 provided for the hot school meals to be extended from January 2022 to the 81 DEIS schools that submitted an expression of interest but were not selected in the extension to 35,000 children as referred to.  Every DEIS school that submitted an expression of interest to be included in the hot school meals extension announced in budget 2021 is now receiving funding for hot school meals.</p> <p>In March 2022, the Minister for Education announced an extension of the DEIS programme to an additional 322 schools from September 2022.  In July the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, announced that access to the hot school meal option would be extended to the 282 newly designated DEIS primary schools and that access to the cold lunch option would be extended to the 38 newly designated DEIS secondary schools from September, benefiting some 60,000 children at an additional cost of &euro;9 million this year.  Additional funding for the programme has been provided for 2023, bringing the total to &euro;91.6 million.</p> <p>The Minister is committed to continuing to expanding the school meals programme and building further on the significant extension of the programme in recent years.  In this regard, she commissioned the evaluation of the school meals programme to review all elements of the programme, including the funding rates currently being provided for the various meal options.  The final report is due to be completed by the end of the year.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it is important that such issues are raised.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the Department is looking at the rates and that decisions will be made by the end of the year, but I am afraid that that will be too late.  As I said, there are currently schools not receiving tenders to provide school meals.  I am gravely concerned that there is no fast-tracking of the issue of rates of pay for the meals.  It is a concern.  As I said, I welcome the fact that there is a review due to be completed by the end of the year, but I am concerned that a solution will not be provided for children in DEIS schools between now and Christmas and that those schools will be left stranded.</p> <p>T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil an Roinn ag d&eacute;anamh athbhreithnithe ar sc&eacute;im na mb&eacute;il&iacute; scoile faoi l&aacute;thair.

As I outlined, budget 2022 provided &euro;68.1 million for a programme, with an additional &euro;9 million provided to allow access to all new DEIS schools from September 2022.  Additional funding for the programme has been provided for 2023, bringing the total to &euro;91.6 million, which represents a 49% funding increase in the period since 2020.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has commissioned an evaluation of the school meals programme and all its elements, including the funding that is being provided for the various meal options.  The evaluation has involved close consultation with all stakeholders.  Workshops and interviews are being conducted with teachers, principals and children, as well as suppliers.  Key issues to be explored as part of the evaluation include whether the schools meals programme is meeting its aims, the practicalities for schools in moving to a hot school meal option, what works well and does not, how the programme can be better delivered, the extent to which the school meals programme has improved school attendance and educational achievement, how the scheme compares with programmes in other countries, the implications of extending the scheme and the implications of the European child guarantee for schools meals programme.  The final report is due to be completed by the end of the year and will help to inform future decisions around this important programme.  The Minister is committed to growing the school meals programme further and issues regarding the funding of it will be considered in the context of this evaluation.  I again thank the Senator for raising this matter and for a constructive engagement.</p></speech>

I would like to acknowledge the good work he is doing as Minister of State in the Department of Health.</p><p>I tabled this Commencement matter on foot of the retirement of Dr. Victor O&rsquo;Loughlin from his post as a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist for children with disabilities.  There has been no replacement found for this role.  We now have children in the south east of Ireland waiting indefinitely for psychiatric assessment because we do not have any psychiatrist.  Under the Disability Act, a child is entitled to have an assessment of needs completed within six months, including a service statement that lists the services the HSE proposes to provide to meet a child&rsquo;s needs.  However, this is not happening.</p><p>I would like to mention two examples of families and parents who are at their wits' end because of the lack of services within the HSE.  The first one is Mark Darmody, who is from my parish of Ardfinnan-Grange.  He stated: </p> <blockquote> 	Our son Neil ... is severely autistic and was diagnosed with autism in 2016.  He was reassessed in 2018, but his development has been almost non-existent.  The severity of his presentation is now obvious as he is 100% non-verbal, has almost no comprehension, is not toilet-trained and is sporadically violent towards himself and others.  We had been urging the HSE to intervene from early 2019 onwards as it was clear to us that Neil's diagnosis with a mild intellectual disability was not accurate for his presentation.<br /><br />In February 2020, as a result of a referral ... Neil was examined by Dr. Victor O'Loughlin... on behalf of the HSE.  He emphatically stated by letter ... that Neil was in the severe range of intellectual incapacity and that he required reassessment &quot;as a priority&quot; before [psychiatric services] could be considered.  This urgent letter was sent to three HSE managers.<br /><br />On the 29th June 2022, as a result of substantial pressure from us as parents, we received a letter of apology from ... [the] disability manager in Clonmel.  She stated that the letter of Dr. O'Loughlin was never actioned [on] and she speculated that she could only conclude that Covid must have been the reason.  What is certain is that our son was never considered for assessment ... during that time period. <br /><br />This situation is now [exacerbated] by a telephone call I [received from] the HSE services manager in Clonmel... who informed me that Neil would now sit on a waiting list &quot;indefinitely.&quot;  Despite my requests for an approximate indication of when he [would] be seen, she continued with her &quot;indefinitely&quot; statement.  She also informed me that there is no psychiatrist presently recruited by the HSE in the south east of Ireland.  </blockquote> <p>His wife, Noelle, is now attempting to source private therapies that could cost up to &euro;9,000 for the entirety of the type of service that Neil requires.</p><p>There is another lady in Clonmel and I do not have permission to use her name, so I will not.  She is at her wits' end as well.  Her boy needs to be assessed in order to be on the correct medication to ease his constant frustrations.  He constantly stims, so he is always shouting, hitting and breaking things in sheer frustration.  He even does it in his sleep.  His parents are reducing their working hours to ensure that someone is always there.  I will read out part of what she said to outline the frustration that she feels.  She stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Our home is now and has been at complete crisis point for a long time which ye are [well] aware of since our last emergency professionals meeting a number of months ago.  I would like to point out that our ability to cope is beyond that of the norm, however the current situation outweighs any degree of coping.  Simply put &ldquo;the demands are too high and the professional expertise is non-existent which is contributing to the bleakness of the present and future of our beautiful boy and family&rdquo;.  We have no support, we are at a point of total burnout and it has fallen on deaf ears.  There are currently so many acute and enduring issues in our home that we do not know where to turn. </blockquote> <p>Those are families who are struggling immensely because of the lack of services in the south-east region.  It needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

On 9 September, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, launched the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, intellectual disability model of service.  This marked a significant achievement for mental health services in line with the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to improve all aspects of mental health services and ensure they remain person-centred and accessible to all.  As the Senator knows, the CAMHS intellectual disability model of service was developed to enhance supports for children and adolescents with intellectual disability by advancing specialist mental health services nationally and standardising the care provided to children, adolescents and their families.</p> <p>Prior to the development of this model of service, there was no nationally agreed framework that would enable existing and future CAMHS intellectual disability teams to deliver services in a consistent and co-ordinated manner across the country.  This model addresses that vacuum by providing national guidance on how to deliver integrated person-centred services consistently nationwide.  It will increase the confidence and ability of service providers, both the HSE and independent agencies, to deliver successful and safe mental health intellectual disability services to a high-quality standard.  It proposes effective partnerships between healthcare providers, children and adolescents with lived experience, their families and local communities.</p> <p>The CAMHS intellectual disability model of service was informed by the broader policy context in which it was developed and Sharing the Vision, Sl&aacute;intecare and the findings of the Maskey report were also significantly considered throughout.  The process of developing teams in Ireland in line with Sharing the Vision recommendations has begun, with the development of several teams across the country.  The Sharing the Vision implementation plan 2022-24, which was launched earlier this year, will ensure we are closely monitoring the development of further child and adult teams.  The launch of the model of service coincides with the reconfiguration of disability services into the children disability network teams, which adopt the health and social care approach to the provision of relevant disability supports to children.  The model of service provides clear guidance to ensure these network teams work closely and collaboratively with CAMHS intellectual disability teams to the benefit of those accessing the services.</p> <p>North Tipperary lies within Mid West Community Healthcare in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 3 and south Tipperary lies within South East Community Healthcare in CHO 5.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A full-time mental health intellectual disability child consultant has been recruited in the mid-west area.  The consultant will work on a 0.8 whole-time equivalent basis.  The HSE is looking at how best to deliver the child service to the full population of mid-west community healthcare.  South-east community healthcare in CHO 5 recently interviewed for a CAMHS intellectual disability consultant for the region.  A candidate has been offered the position and the HSE is working through the recruitment process for a start date to be finalised.</p><p>South-east community healthcare continues to liaise with national colleagues to secure funding for the multidisciplinary staff required to populate the adult and CAMHS intellectual disability teams.  CHO 5 is endeavouring to populate this team at the earliest opportunity and it is a priority for the south-east community healthcare senior management team.</p></speech>

I know he has been working on this because we have spoken privately about it.  I am grateful that a candidate has been offered a position.  The start date cannot be soon enough.  A professional from the UK currently comes over once a month.  In this regard, the HSE is not fit for purpose.  Certainly from the perspective of parents of children with disabilities, it is just not accountable.</p> <p>Staffing and recruitment are issues.  The HSE should be using the work permits scheme more to find people outside of the jurisdiction to work in the sector.  It does not seem to be using it as much as it should.  Mark and Noelle Darmody have looked at prices to get a private assessment and it is approximately &euro;9,000.  Parents who go private should be able to claim back the cost.  It is not their fault they have to go private.  It is because of the lack of services we provide that they, for the good of the child, scrape to try to find money to make sure the child gets assessed as quickly as possible.  On the back of the HSE's incompetence, the State should reimburse people who go privately.  This should be done during the period we are waiting to get people into position so we can get the backlog fixed.  That would certainly recognise the pressure parents are under at present.</p></speech>

He has been very consistent on the lack of services.  The CAMHS intellectual disability model of service is being progressed in CHO 3 and CHO 5.  It reflects the ongoing commitment of the Government and the HSE to ensure that mental health services for children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities are on a par with services available to those in the general population.  This objective will be enhanced with record funding of &euro;1.2 billion for mental health in budget 2023.  The new HSE service plan for next year has now been finalised.</p> <p>Senator Ahearn raised the question of reimbursing parents who spend up to &euro;9,000 because of the lack of services.  That is a fair comment.  The service should have been in place.  The services will be available eventually but parents are at the pin of their collars trying to provide very important services for their children.  I will take this issue back to the Minister and see whether it can be addressed.  Again, I thank Senator Ahearn for raising this very important matter.</p></speech>

Ireland and the Irish have had an enormous influence throughout history, not only on Austria but on western and central Europe as a whole.  Austria gave refuge to generations of the Wild Geese and their descendants, with names like O'Donnell, Lacy, Browne, Kavanagh and Laudon having entered the annals of Austrian military history.  Maximilian O'Donnell saved the life of Emperor Franz Joseph during an assassination attempt in 1853 and received the title of Count from the Emperor.  The events of that fateful day still mark the Viennese skyline, with the landmark Votivkirche constructed in celebration and thanks for the Emperor's rescue.</p> <p>It is a source of great pride that a Centre for Irish Studies at the University of Vienna continues to be a place of outstanding scholarship, providing a home for high-level research by Irish and Austrian scholars alike.  In the military academy in Wiener Neustadt are 30 portraits of Austria's most distinguished commanders, at least 12 of whom are Irish or have Irish origins.  One was from a famous aristocratic family here.</p> <p>The relationship between Ireland and Austria has deep historical roots dating back to the Irishman Fergal or Virgilius, the Bishop of Salzburg in the eighth century.  The Irish monk Colm&aacute;n was martyred at Stockerau near Vienna in 1012 and for centuries was venerated as Austria's national saint.  Irish Benedictines were instrumental in making Vienna the capital of Austria.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day has been celebrated in the Austrian capital since the 12th century.  The dark days of the Second World War brought Austria&rsquo;s most famous export to Ireland.  Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger, the famous Austrian physicist and Nobel Prize winner, migrated to Dublin in 1940.  He was invited by &Eacute;amon de Valera personally and established the Institute of Advanced Studies in Dublin.</p> <p>Ambassador Thomas Nader is in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery today and I had the pleasure of speaking to him earlier.  I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the ambassador is on his second mission to Ireland.  He sought that mission because he has a tremendous love of our country and has developed a network of friends here.  He was thwarted somewhat by Covid-19 but is now embarking on what we hope will be a particularly fruitful second term.  We all look forward to interacting with him.  I have the great privilege of being a member of his friendship society, along with a number of other Senators who are present today.  We look forward to strengthening those relationships.  I wish Ambassador Nader and all Austrians, including those living in Ireland, a very happy national day.  It is wonderful to have the ambassador with us today.</p></speech>

I will start off with a very positive story.  A young woman from Westport, Shannon Sweeney, won a bronze medal at the European Elite Boxing Championships last week.  A homecoming event was held in Mayo on Sunday.  I congratulate her and her very proud coach, Mr. Martin Brennan.  I know that a lot of work over many years, not just by Shannon but by the team around her and the boxing club in Westport, went into getting her into a position where she had an opportunity to win a medal.  Her fantastic performance in the event meant that she won the bronze medal.  We have had some fantastic successes in female boxing in recent weeks and it is great to see the sport doing so well.  Katie Taylor paved the way but so many young women are now following in her footsteps.  It is great to see.  I wish Shannon Sweeney and her family well.</p> <p>The recent announcement by the Minister for Justice of proposals to change the licensing laws is broadly welcome, although a significant amount of concern is being expressed across the board, including by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, has acknowledged that reform is needed but it is concerned about how it will be managed in the context of resources and Garda numbers, given the potential for an increase in antisocial behaviour.  I understand the Minister and the Government will be providing additional supports for communities to help them to adjust to the new licensing laws.  Our licensing laws were out of date and did need updating.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In tandem with that, we have a significant issue with antisocial behaviour across the country.  It is not just a Dublin issue.  It happens everywhere.  One can look at other cities in the world.  I was recently in Krak&oacute;w in Poland and in other European cities during the summer.  There is a visible police presence on the streets that we just do not see here.  I am not sure what the difference is.  I was in Spain with my family during the summer and I do not think ten minutes passed without us seeing a member of the police force making people feel safe, because there were many tourists coming in who did not know the area.  For some reason, our capital city seems to be different.  It is the same for Galway, Limerick, Cork and even smaller towns, like my own town, Castlebar.  One just does not see as much of a Garda presence as people would like to see.  There is a consistent call from the public to have more garda&iacute; doing community policing, being on the beat and knowing their area.  A debate is needed on that.  I know other colleagues requested that yesterday.  I understand that the Leader's office has requested that from the Minister.</p><p>I welcome the change to licensing laws.  It is good for business and it is good to have flexibility, because it does not help to have everybody come out onto the streets at the same time.  Equally, we need to reassure the public that resources are there to protect people and that antisocial behaviour will be dealt with appropriately.</p><p>I know I am almost out of time.  Wind Energy Ireland made a presentation in the audiovisual room this morning.  There seem to be fantastic opportunities for renewable energy off the coast, particularly the west coast, where it is the windiest, but we seem to be moving at a snail's pace.  We were world leaders in renewables and wind energy ten years ago but now we are at the back of the class.  It would be great to have a debate in the House at the earliest opportunity about renewables, with a focus on wind energy and offshore wind energy potential.  My understanding from the Department's reply is that the technology is not available to install wind energy north of Mayo.  Experts who I have spoken to tell me that the technology is available and is currently floating off the coast of Aberdeen in Scotland.  It has it but, for some reason, we do not.</p></speech>

I am not sure if it means that he is wise.  The award was made by the Ukrainian President and is quite prestigious.  I congratulate the Cathaoirleach.</p><p>We read in <i>The Journal </i>today that the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Defence are at loggerheads over the continued service of a number of sergeants who joined the Defence Forces in 1994.  These valuable, highly skilled, highly trained people will be lost at the end of this year if the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does not stop its messing.  It is unbelievable that that Department has such reach into every single Department.  Why do we have Ministers at all?  Let us get rid of them all and let the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform run the entire country.  I have spoken about the power of the Civil Service.  It is becoming annoying.  Someone who wants to hire a secretary now has to ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and wait for its blessing.  This needs to stop.</p><p>I opened the <i>Irish Examiner</i>today and saw an article about my favourite organisation in Ireland, the Irish Coast Guard, once again.  It is about to spend &euro;400,000 plus VAT on pens, pencils, bags, hats, t-shirts and so on related to branding.  Will somebody please tell me what cost-benefit analysis went into this madness?  We are talking about water safety.  A sum of &euro;400,000 would cover a significant education programme for all water users, not just those lucky enough to turn up and get a free hat.  Will the free hat do much to save lives?  I do not believe it will.  This organisation is totally out of control.  I already mentioned that we are going to pay over &euro;1 billion for our search and rescue helicopters.  While the UK gets 12 bases with 18 helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and drones for &pound;1.6 billion sterling, we get five helicopters and top cover for over &euro;1 billion.  I believe the cost will be between &euro;1.3 billion and &euro;1.5 billion by the time this is signed off.</p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is stopping a few sergeants who are valuable to the Defence Forces from being retained.  What is the Department doing about the money being spent by the Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard?  The Irish Coast Guard did away with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, life jackets and brought in its own, which were found to be dangerous in 2015 and taken out of service in 2018.  Something is wrong with the governance of that organisation.  I have spoken on it until I have been blue in the face and I am getting tired of there being no corporate oversight.  I mentioned this yesterday.  Daniel O'Connell's article at the weekend referred to the lack of oversight and control that politics has over the Civil Service.  It is out of control.  Each of us has a duty to bring this country back to being one that is governed, not one run by faceless, unelected people.</p></speech>

This is the second time the project has been removed.  The Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport report was launched during the week.  The northern distributor road has miraculously disappeared from the agenda again.  It was previously removed but, following fierce opposition from local councillors and Deputies, the project was put back into the report, but in the final report from the National Transport Authority, it has disappeared.  It beggars belief.  Where has the road disappeared to?  It is necessary for the economic development of the area and for opening up the Moyross area.  I acknowledge that a railway line and new rail station were announced for Moyross last week.  While that is welcome, we still need the road.  We need it to finish the bypass of Limerick city and to stop unnecessary traffic from coming into the centre of the city.  The University of Limerick is looking at a significant expansion and many businesses are looking at opening in that area.  If this road project is not put back into the report, we will go nowhere.  It is a serious issue.  I would like the Leader's support on this.  I will speak to the Minister for Transport today.  It only came to light in the last 24 hours that this road is missing from the report.  I ask the Leader for her support on that.</p> <p>Limerick Going for Gold was held last night.  I congratulate Adare Tidy Towns on winning the overall prize of &euro;10,000 and Castleconnell village on coming in second place.  It was a highly competitive competition.  Many Tidy Towns groups in towns, villages and the city have actively engaged in cleaning up annually and carrying out environmental works in their local areas.  It is a wonderful competition.  I thank J.P. McManus and the McManus family for their sponsorship of the competition each year.  It helps areas, towns and villages to look well and encourages residents to participate.</p></speech>

Last week, Amazon officially opened its first warehouse in Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It likes to call them fulfilment centres.  I know that many will welcome the jobs that it will create locally but, for me, it is a reminder of why we urgently need legislation to ban the deliberate dumping of new non-food products.</p><p>In 2018, an investigation in Germany found that Amazon was destroying thousands of new and unused items in its warehouses and, despite the public outcry at the time and Amazon claiming it would do its best to resell and-or donate unsold items, the practice continued.  A subsequent undercover investigation in France and Britain revealed that hundreds of thousands of products are going straight to the dump.  A leaked spreadsheet from the British fulfilment centre showed products, including laptops, smart TVs, hairdryers, headphones, drones and books, all marked for destruction.  When goods go to landfill without ever being used, they do not just waste the product and all of the energy and raw materials that went into making them, but we are also facilitating the greedy overconsumption and unsustainable business model of large corporations.</p><p>It is disappointing that while the Government was introducing the circular economy legislation, it had a chance to clamp down on this morally bankrupt carry-on but, unfortunately, it chose not to and rejected the amendments we brought forward.  Instead, all we heard was the championing of the levy on plastic coffee cups.  That is why I have decided I need to bring forward the legislation that would introduce the ban on the deliberate destruction or dumping of new non-food items that would include those electronic products but also textiles, school equipment, leisure products and furniture.  It is too long now that the negative environmental costs have been borne by society.  It is time businesses were forced to bear the full costs of their business practices.  I hope the Government will adopt this common-sense legislation so it can move swiftly through the Stages and become law.</p><p>A final point concerns Commencement matters.  There were issues around the responses given to some Members last week.  Today, I would like to express my disappointment that my Commencement matter was not taken by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, or even by a Minister from within that Department.  I think it is disrespectful to the House that we do not have somebody who is at least aware of the policy area when taking those questions.</p></speech>

First, I welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Harris, to review postgraduate supports.  This is incredibly important and something I have been campaigning on for a very long time.  Only in the past few weeks, I met with the postgraduate workers union, which is doing very important work on representation for postgraduate students as workers.  A conversation we need to start having concerns where postgraduate students fall because they are falling into a halfway house between being students yet they are also working, and they are getting neither the benefits nor representation in either of those areas.  I support the calls of the postgraduate workers union and believe it has some very interesting and radical ideas about how we can address postgraduates and their framing within the system.</p> <p>I will not labour the point too much.  For context, in the past ten years, postgraduate supports have increased by approximately 3% from some &euro;18,000 to &euro;18,500 yet rents have gone up by 70%.  It is not a sustainable model.  We pride ourselves on being a land of saints and scholars but unless someone is one of the lucky few who can access scholarship funding or supports, it is not an option to undertake further study.  As I said, I welcome the Minister's commitment to reviewing this and I look forward to working with him on it, but if we are being realistic about it, there has been a 3% increase for postgraduate supports in the last ten years and a 70% increase in rents.  That is the state of play with regard to postgraduate supports.</p> <p>The other issue concerns the planning applications to be lodged for two transport projects in Dublin 11 and Dublin 9, one being the railway order for the ever-promised metro project and the other the Ballymun-Finglas to city centre core bus corridor.  It is important to note that these current planning consultations are not like the previous non-statutory ones.  They are the actual statutory planning processes and the final decision will impact the final constructed design.  I know people who have said &ldquo;Sure we are back at it again and we are being asked for our thoughts yet again on this bus corridor&rdquo;.  I emphasise that this consultation is the one that is going to impact on the final design.  It is all around walking, cycling, the provision of enhanced bus measures and so on.  I highlight that the deadline for submissions is 15 November 2022, which is coming up soon, and that this is the actual statutory consultation which will have an impact on the final layout and what the final construction design will be.</p></speech>

Again, it is regrettable that we are seeing Bills being taken at all Stages.  This Government has developed too much of an attachment to emergency legislation.  I am also conscious in the case of both of these Bills, and I was on the relevant committee for one of them, that the Government asked for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny and then is also truncating proper scrutiny in the Chamber.  I am very concerned that we are getting a lot of legislation, including in areas which have been well flagged, such as the manner in which we should be dealing with rental protection and protection against evictions, but we are dealing with it in an emergency way and that legislation is not getting proper scrutiny.  I know that is not the Leader&rsquo;s decision but I have to convey formally that this is not good practice.</p> <p>Similarly, I would agree it is not good practice to have Ministers from unrelated Departments dealing with Commencement matters.  Commencement matters must be a matter of engagement.  Ministers need to be able to come back and forth and answer, and that is why there is a two-stage process in that regard.  If Ministers coming in are not even from the relevant Department, that is a problem.  Specifically, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, perhaps needs to come to this House on a couple of topics, one of which, I would suggest, is the gender-proofing of our pensions system.  That is one where it would be very useful to have a debate.</p> <p>The main issue I want to highlight is one that is fundamental to Ireland's reputation and our credibility internationally.  Yesterday, in the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, we heard from representatives of Friends of the Earth, who spoke about the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty and called for us to take a lead in moving away from fossil fuels internationally.  This is complementary to what Senator Chambers has said.  In that regard, they highlighted that one of the reasons Ireland would have credibility to lead if it chose to do so was that &ndash; this is a near-quote - for decades Ireland, thanks to the dedication of successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs and officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs, has led the way on disarmament and non-proliferation issues at UN level.  They highlighted that at the time when the message from everywhere was that everyone needed nuclear weapons or else they were not safe, and that was the responsible thing to do, Ireland was one of the countries that led and said "No" because an arms race makes us less safe.  Similarly, we are sometimes being told that fossil fuels are part of what will make us secure in the short term but they are actually exacerbating our vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Sadly, however, the reason I have to raise this matter is that I am concerned that the credibility built up by successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs over many years is being undermined over the last short period of time.  I say that in the context of Ireland having led and been the first country, under Frank Aiken, to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and having been the country that hosted the successful ban on cluster munitions.  I was in Croke Park when we negotiated that.  However, Ireland is now in a situation where we have the Minister for Foreign Affairs just over a week ago speaking at an arms fair in the Aviva Stadium, which, if we want to insult the environment further, was called "Building the ecosystem &ndash; identifying connections for collaboration in Security, Defence and Dual Technologies".  This is a fundamental regressive step.  It is a shame to Ireland.</p></speech>

I would like to hear from the Minister on the growing problems with issues of governance and control that have begun to limit the creative freedom and the level of community involvement in some of these events.  In recent years we have seen a serious and very necessary tightening up in governance procedures in every walk of life.  We know the reasons for that.  However, there is increasing evidence that overemphasis on governance issues is leading to a paralysis in creative thinking on many boards, particularly those in which the arts are concerned.  The effect is that local endeavour is being chilled and local involvement diminished.  Listowel Writers' Week, with which I am familiar, is an internationally renowned festival.  Its model has been adopted as a template for similar festivals throughout the country.  It is now in its 52nd year.  It was the intention of its founders who included our local internationally renowned authors, Dr. Bryan MacMahon and Dr. John B. Keane, that the festival would be devised, organised and managed by the community of Listowel.  There was to be no &eacute;ir&iacute; in airde, no intellectual snobbery and no exclusivity about Listowel Writers' Week.  That is why it has succeeded.  This has been the secret of its success for more than half a century.  Recently, however, this community-based model has come under threat with a proposal that an excellent representative committee be abolished and that Listowel Writers' Week henceforth be run by a very small, exclusive board of directors with the help of a paid curator.  I need not state the reaction to this proposal in Listowel and in the wider world of literature.  It has been one of shock and horror.  I do not believe the Minister would wish to see community involvement replaced by small, exclusive boards that would have no answerability and no rapport with people on the ground.  The arts will never flourish in the culture of the closed shop.  I look forward to the Minister coming in to discuss these matters.</p></speech>

I ask for this because of the quality of water in my town of Dundalk, a town of 42,000 people, over the past 18 months.  Undoubtedly, Irish Water is very good at communicating with Oireachtas Members and councillors.  We all get emails and updates every day.  I cannot fault its level of communication, but what I can fault and want to call into question is the type of responses.  For the past 18 months in County Louth, we have been getting the exact same responses about why the water quality is so poor in Dundalk.  We are told that there is sediment in the pipes and when issues happen, the sediment rises up.  To put into context what that means, when you turn on a tap now in Dundalk, brown water runs straight out for the first minute.  The advice from Irish Water is to let the tap go for a minute and after that you can drink it.  That is not an acceptable solution.  It has been happening sporadically for 18 months.  I am not rising in the Seanad today just because it has happened in the past two days.  This has been happening consistently now for 18 months.  It is not acceptable for Irish Water to have the same excuse for 18 months.  It leads me to believe there is something else happening.  Is there another reason for this?  Is there something that Irish Water is not telling us?  It cannot be the same excuse consistently every time.  It is simply not acceptable in a town of 42,000 people that they do not have quality drinking water, that they are being forced to buy bottled water, and that they are afraid to use the water that comes out of their taps.  I am convinced it is not only an issue in my town.  I am sure it happens throughout the country.  I would appreciate it if the Leader could organise a debate on Irish Water at some stage between now and Christmas.</p></speech>

Let us hope that his term as Prime Minister will be one where there is a restoration in the quality of British-Irish relations.  Let us hope that we are now entering a period of stability and greater rapprochement and understanding.  Hopefully there can be important dialogue about issues such as the Troubles amnesty legislation and the Northern Ireland protocol in order that, at a time when the world faces so many challenges on different fronts, we can at least get our British-Irish relations right and start solving some of the problems and getting them out of the way.  I think everybody would wish him a fair wind.</p> <p>On the subject of wind, I attended a Wind Energy Ireland briefing this morning with other colleagues.  We heard about the exciting plans to develop wind energy.  I understand that more than 28 GW is being planned in the longer term.  The aim is to get to 10 GW by 2030.  We were informed that wind energy currently supplies around one third of the Irish electricity requirement, as we all know.  However, there are many problems, including issues such as whether the community is going to benefit directly.  There is a difference between money being given to the GAA locally and various kinds of community benefit funds and the kind of significant community stake in the benefits to be enjoyed for which there is a real desire among the public.  Just because we secure the supply of energy through wind energy into the future does not necessarily mean that the price of energy will be kept down sufficiently.  That was one of the many issues.</p> <p>We need to see a greater pragmatism from the Government about solving problems like modular housing, or striking the right balance between consultation with the community and getting things done.  I will mention Derrybrien briefly in this context.  Just because something was done wrong in the past does not obviate the need for a pragmatic solution at a time of energy crisis.  We need to get those windmills turning.  It cannot be beyond the wit of this Government to come up with a way to get that done.  I hope the Seanad Independent Group will offer a solution to that in the form of Senator McDowell's legislation.  It is crazy at a time of an energy crisis that the Government would stand over a situation where 70 turbines are not functioning, not producing electricity and not putting money into the economy.  We have so many problems.  Let us get real about the problems we face.</p></speech>

This is an essential part of infrastructure for Limerick city and the surrounding suburbs.  It would tackle a number of key issues in regard to traffic congestion and access to the National Technological Park and the Mackey Roundabout.  My party, Sinn F&eacute;in, and my colleague Deputy Quinlivan campaigned successfully to get the Coonagh to Knockalisheen road built.  It was supposed to be part of the northern distributor road, but it has been abandoned.  The Limerick and Shannon metropolitan area transport plan has no mention of it whatsoever.  I predicted this earlier this year.  I take no joy in saying so.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to be clear.  Colleagues on the Opposition benches need to take ownership of this decision.  It is a Government decision to abandon the northern distributor road.  It sits with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, but as collective Cabinet responsibility, this Government has effectively put the city of Limerick on hold, for God knows how many years.  We have already been waiting more than ten years for this road to be built.  The most ironic part of this is that the whole point of completing the northern distributor road and of hopefully connecting a motorway to Cork which also seems to be abandoned, was to act as a counterweight or a counterbalance for the west coast against the economic juggernaut of Dublin.  The Green Party and this Government have put it on hold so the people of Limerick face nothing more than years more of queueing, traffic, congestion and cars being stuck on the motorway because they cannot access the Mackey Roundabout.  Everyone in Limerick knows this is essential.  I have heard people from all parties bar the Green Party call for this to happen.  It is not going to happen.  The T&aacute;naiste said the door was not closed on the northern distributor road.  The fact of the matter is that this Government firmly shut that door yesterday regarding an essential piece of infrastructure for Limerick.  It is staggering and I call for a debate on the issue.</p></speech>

Unfortunately I was not able to make it but I agree wholeheartedly with many of the decisions and the sentiments expressed at the meeting.  I fully support the West on Track campaign for the extension of the rail line from Athenry to Claremorris.  It is needed.  I come from Castlebar which is 45 miles from Galway city.  Galway is our city.  It takes two hours to go 45 miles.  If one needs to go to the Galway clinic, the regional hospital or any of those places in Galway, it takes two hours.  We have to have a look at this and should have a debate in this House on balanced regional development.</p> <p>What is balanced regional development?  Does that mean one stops the growth of other cities such as Dublin and Cork and say we will grow Galway, Limerick and Sligo and wherever else?  There was a time when there were eight Deputies in Mayo.  There are now four.  There is a boundary commission in place and when it provides its report, there will probably be four in Mayo again.  We are getting an extension on the number of representatives sitting in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, maybe to the order of ten to 15 new or extra Deputies.  If we are really talking about balanced regional development, the west and the regional areas need a bigger shout and we should also have a look at the Constitution as regards the figures.</p> <p>In Scotland for instance, the Hebrides do not have to have the same population numbers to get a Member of Parliament elected as other parts of Scotland.  That should be the basis for our balanced regional development policy as well and there would be a bigger shout in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or wherever else for the regional areas.  That is if we are really interested in balanced regional development but there would be some obstacles if we were to bring that in.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on balanced regional development.</p></speech>

It is certainly very disturbing to read Conor Lally's article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>where we are told that 3,000 money mules have been used and &euro;12 million from fraud deposited into those accounts.  The sad thing about this is that many young people under financial pressure between the ages of 18 and 24 are becoming the victims of this.  This is going to lead to all sorts of trouble for these young people.  It will mean they will have a criminal record and they are getting tied up with undesirables.  That is the reality.</p><p>Bank intelligence showed, according to Conor Lally's article, that the average transaction was &euro;4,000.  This is shocking and this is what drug culture and drug issues are doing to people.  Now we have these criminals using young people.  This was a massive issue in England some years ago and still is.  We have to do everything in our power as Oireachtas Members to try to combat this.</p><p>I appeal to all young people today if they have money issues to talk to their family and their parents, even to their local politician.  I urge the financial institutions to look at some sort of scheme with a low interest rate where people who are in difficulty in terms of finances could approach their banks or credit union.  We do not want people going down this road.  It will cause so much destruction to families and young people and we have to try to stamp it out.  I reiterate my appeal to young people who are running into those financial difficulties, to turn their backs on these criminals and not to become a money mule because it will lead to a lot of trouble in their lives, their families' life and for society.  We need to stamp this out.</p></speech>

There has been a large amount of work done and I compliment the Minister of State on the amount of units that have been set up in the majority of secondary schools, particularly around Cork.  It has been of real benefit to communities and societies.  There is a gap in the market at the moment that we need to look at, particularly around special schools which kids who are autistic and do not fit into the mainstream programme attend.  Children are travelling from Skibbereen, Clonakilty, all the way into Cork city.  There is one child travelling an hour and a half on a bus each way.  He is getting a very good service in Cork city may I say.</p> <p>We need to put strategic plans in place so we have special schools in geographic locations so kids do not have to travel to that degree or spend an hour and a half on a bus.  We need a practical solution to a problem we have.  There has been much work done but we need to make sure the final pieces of the jigsaw are put in place.  Those final pieces are special schools for that cohort of kids who do not fit into the normal mainstream schools.  There are significant benefits here for the people involved, for the families and for the entire community.  I suggest we should organise a debate with the Minister of State with responsibility for special education about those special schools and where we can build on the work done by Senator Carrigy in particular who chairs a special committee on autism, to ensure we put a programme in place to prioritise these kids going forward and the last piece of the jigsaw can be put in place.</p></speech>

I did not know Senator Lombard was going to talk about it.  I also request a debate with the Minister of State with responsibility for special education on special schools and special needs assistants, SNAs, and teachers in particular.  It is important to recognise the amount of funding announced in the budget last month.  Some &euro;2.6 billion has been ringfenced for special education.  That is 27% of the educational funding in total.  As part of that, there will be an extra 1,194 SNAs right across the country which is really significant and is going to bring us up to approximately 20,000 SNAs.  We need to discuss the role of SNAs and the importance of the role they play.  I think we would all agree that financially we are not recognising the important role they play-----</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, visited Tipperary last week and she came to a number of schools.  She visited two schools in particular, the fantastic special educational schools that we have in Cashel, namely, Scoil Chormaic and Scoil Aonghusa.  She met the two principals, Lorraine Lowry and Siobhan Keyes Ryan, and we saw the phenomenal work that all of teachers and the SNAs do.</p> <p>As a Government, we really need to recognise that SNAs who work in special educational schools need extra recognition because of the difficult challenges they face, for obvious reasons.  The work they do gives such relief to parents during the time their kids spend in those schools.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On the greater conversation regarding special needs assistants, SNAs, we all give them platitudes for the service that they provide but they need to be given a salary and decent recognition for the work  they do.  Simple issues include flat-rate expenses.  Flat-rate expenses are given over a four-year term where one can claim money back.  They are given to almost every profession in the country, except SNAs.  Teachers can claim back &euro;500 over a four-year period because they are teachers but SNAs cannot.  It was introduced before SNAs ever existed.  Such measures need to be changed to recognise the work that they do.</p></speech>

Yesterday, we held a public session of the Joint Committee on Autism.  I thank the Leader for the support that she gave me while we were pushing to get the committee put in place.  It is giving the opportunity to parents, in particular, and families to come in and talk about the challenges they have and put forward recommendations.  Something that has come out, in particular, from the last number of meetings, was that 14% of children of over 8,000 children who are in the special schools in the country got a school-based summer programme in the summer of 2022.  That left more than 6,500 children.  The committee passed a resolution yesterday and we will lay a report on the summer programme before both Houses in the middle of November.  The resolution states:</p> <blockquote> 	  	That the Joint Committee on Autism <blockquote> 	&mdash;notes the evidence of parents of autistic children and other stakeholders about difficulties with the Summer Programme  </blockquote>and while not having met all the key stakeholders, given the urgency of the current situation, calls on the Minister for Education to: <blockquote> 	&mdash;ensure that all autistic children will have access to the Summer Programme in 2023;<br /><br />&mdash;ensure that all Special Schools will provide the Summer Programme in 2023;<br /><br />&mdash;provide sufficient resources to schools in order that they may offer a comprehensive provision of the Summer Programme in 2023;<br /><br />&mdash;liaise with the various stakeholders to ensure that increased numbers of schools participate in the Summer Programme, bringing the resources of Schools together where needed, thereby ensuring that a programme is available in every large town in the country;<br /><br />&mdash;mitigate any constraints to the provision of the Summer Programme including staffing issues such as delays in payment to teachers and SNAs (Special Needs Assistants), resolve any pay anomalies, and to broaden the potential workforce e.g. [employing student] OTs (Occupational Therapists), SLTs (Speech and Language Therapists), early childcare workers, and include suitable student placements; <br /><br />&mdash;mitigate any difficulties with Garda vetting to allow staff to move from one school to another school easily. </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>That is coming from a joint committee of all parties putting out our view.  A report will come before both Houses in the next number of weeks.  We want to see a situation where, in 2023, at a minimum every special school has a school-based summer programme.</p><p>The Government has put in place &euro;40 million for the programme.  The funding is there.  The principals and the boards of management know that the support will be there.  They need to start organising a programme for summer 2023 now.</p></speech>

Senators Buttimer and Lombard are looking over attentively at their arrival.  I understand that they are guests of the Taoiseach today.

It is important for citizenship to become aware of what happens in the Houses of democracy.  I hope we will impress them a little.</p></speech>

It should be specifically about special schools to ring-fence some time on that.  School building responsibilities sit with the Minister, Deputy Foley, whereas special education is with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  We need to balance that because it is about school buildings and then the supports within those buildings.  In Dublin 15, we fought for years to get our special school, Danu.  A committee of parents drove that.  They were promised a dedicated purpose-built building in Dublin 15.  Over the past couple of years, their children have been in accommodation that we thought would be temporary but that may become permanent in Rath Dara.  The demand is still there for a stand-alone purpose-built special school.  It is what those children deserve.</p> <p>I received a report in my inbox this morning from two students in Le Ch&eacute;ile school in Tyrellstown, Rebecca and Dalia, who did a report into the status of women versus the status of democracy in Ireland.  They have pulled out some important key points that I wanted to mention.  They disagree with the statement that the status of women reflects the status of democracy in Ireland and I agree with them.  It is surprising the number of people who do not agree with them.  They point to female political representation in Ireland being below the EU average, at 27.7% versus 31.2%; the fact that there are only 36 women in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann compared to 124 men; the gender pay gap is 1% higher than the EU average; and Ireland ranks 17th in the EU concerning political decision-making in respect of women.  They have pulled out some excellent recommendations that we gradually increase gender quotas in the D&aacute;il until it reaches 50%, that gender quotas be introduced in local authorities and that a weekly mandatory CSPE class for senior-cycle students is made mandatory.  Well done to them.</p></speech>

Ms O'Leary is the co-ordinator and she is very welcome.  She comes with very special privileges.  A former pupil of mine told me that his daughter was here today.  They are from a great club called Na Piarsaigh.  I will not call her out because she might be embarrassed but she knows who she is.  They are very welcome.  I commend the Christ the King transition year students here.  It is a tremendous school in Cork and we are lucky to have a school of that calibre in our city.</p> <p>I am glad the young women are here today because I want to raise the issue of LGBT rights in Afghanistan.  Yesterday, Deputy Gannon organised a briefing with LGBT Ireland of displaced men and women from Afghanistan who had to leave because of their sexuality.  As Members will be aware, in my case, as an openly gay Member of the House, I have the privilege and the sanctity and the freedom to come in here and speak my mind.  I can disagree with Members about whatever issue but I am free to come in here and speak.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on human rights around the world and on LGBT rights.  We are at a tipping point, in advance of the mid-term elections in America, given what is happening in many parts of the world, especially around Afghanistan where the Taliban, as we speak, are going into villages and asking the elders and families to identify and name their LGBT family members so that they can gain social credit with the Taliban as an example.  Let us think about it in the context of a man or woman who is lesbian, gay or transgender in Afghanistan and imagine having to admit to somebody one is gay, to plan an escape route out of Afghanistan, to go on that journey, and then to reach a point where one seeks and receives sanctuary.  My final point in this request to the Leader is around the issue of visa waivers from the Government.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I appreciate and accept that we have huge issues around refugees and in respect of housing and availability of accommodation.

This is an important debate we need to have in this House not just during Pride but also now in order that we can use our seat on the UN Security Council to herald and promulgate change.</p><p>Thank you for your indulgence, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.</p></speech>

Roughly &euro;40 million has been allocated to the programme.  I asked about it and principals came to me with some feedback.  One in four schools rolled the programme out last year but we need more of our mainstream schools doing so as well because we are looking to bring children with special needs into our mainstream schools and for our special schools to handle children with more severe to complex, challenging needs.  It needs to be made clear that, for our special schools, there are more challenging behaviours and that getting new teachers to come in to do the summer programme can be a challenge.  Some of the special schools have looked to see about central vetting processes for SNAs.  This is not about the schools themselves having to go to Garda stations and so on.  Perhaps there should be panels for teachers, particularly for special schools, because additional training may be required as opposed to special classes within mainstream schools.  Those are just some issues for the Minister, who might come in to speak to us, to take into consideration.</p> <p>I wish to raise two other matters.  We know about all the families and people living around Rahara and Ballagh, that is, around Lough Funshinagh.  There are the rising flood levels of the turlough.  Senator Murphy has raised this on a number of occasions.  I welcome the group appearing today before the agriculture committee.  Public representatives, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, and OPW officials met with the Lough Funshinagh group in July.  Further progress updates on the plans we need to put in place will take place in October.  This is a difficult situation because environmental assessments are required.  The matter has gone down the legal route.  There have been High Court actions.</p> <p>Finally, regarding West on Track, and to follow up on Senator Burke's contribution, I attended the meeting in Tuam to which he referred.  This is about how we develop that region and about investment coming into Galway and the west.  The Western Development Commission, the Northern and Western Regional Assembly, NWRA, and the Committee of the Regions attended the meeting.  We need to be conscious that we can provide regional cycleways while also developing our train tracks and bringing investment and tourism into the west.</p></speech>

It is lovely when somebody else, not just your own, recognises your brilliance.  I wish the Cathaoirleach congratulations and continued success.</p> <p>Senators Dolan, Carrigy, Ahearn and Lombard have looked for probably two debates.  One is about special schools and their locations and, particularly, the length of the journeys some of our children have to make in the morning just to attend a special school in the absence of having one in their own locality.  There was a mooted debate a number of years ago in the Department of Education to make a decision to co-locate a special school on the same grounds as every new school that was being built.  I am not sure if that has gone awry but I will certainly organise a debate on special schools and special education delivery.  Separately, I congratulate Senator Carrigy because the work of the Joint Committee on Autism is coming to a conclusion.  Maybe we will arrange to have a debate between now and Christmas, when the committee's report is due to be published, on the report distinctly and separately from a debate on the special schools building programme.  We will try to do both between now and recess in December.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on human rights, specifically LGBT rights, in light of the stories we have heard in recent days of members of the LGBT community fleeing Afghanistan and how horribly they are being treated.</p> <p>Senator Currie spoke of a report by two young ladies in Le Ch&eacute;ile Secondary School.  We like their style and would like to see a lot of what they have asked for implemented.</p> <p>Senator Murphy spoke about the horrendous story of the 3,000 young people being used as money mules by criminal gangs.  We need a hell of a lot more debate and research on and, particularly, assistance for people in that age group because they are susceptible to being used, as we can see.  Money is an allure, particularly for young people who do not have any.</p> <p>Senator Burke wants a debate on regional balanced development.  We will organise that.  Senator Dolan touched on that matter as well.</p> <p>Senator Gavan seconded Senator Boylan's amendment to the Order of Business.  I am happy to accept the amendment.  That is no problem at all.  Senator Gavan also asked for a debate on the final report of the NTA, as did Senator Maria Byrne.  I do not think Senator Gavan was here when Senator Byrne was present earlier.  To my mind, something underhand is definitely afoot.  We need to call on the Minister to make a specific statement today on the absence, for the second time, of the northern distributor road, it having been put back in when we brought the matter to his attention the first time.  I have made contact with his office and, therefore, as soon as I have any response I will come back to the Senators.  If, however, we do not get a satisfactory response, I will arrange the debate, in which case I will come back to the Senators beforehand and let them know.</p> <p>Senator Mullen spoke about his pleasure at the election of Rishi Sunak as the new British Prime Minister.  I hope I am not speaking out of turn in saying that I hope to see from today the return of dignity to politics in the United Kingdom, specifically with regard to the relationship that has faltered in recent years, during the terms of the previous two prime ministers.  The thing that gives me a little hope is the number of times during the summer debates Prime Minister Sunak mentioned Ireland and Northern Ireland.  I hope for a return to some respect and dignity in the relationships we share.</p> <p>Senator McGahon asked for a debate on Irish Water because of the ongoing two-year disruption and provision of brown water to the people of Dundalk.  He spoke about not only the quality of water but also the quality of responses, or probably the lack of quality responses from Irish Water.  We will try to arrange that debate.</p> <p>Senator O'Sullivan asked for a debate on the governance and control of arts and literary festivals.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, will be here on 8 November to talk about safe spaces and the arts report, so that might be an opportunity to discuss both matters.  I will come back to the Senator and see if that is acceptable.  If not, we will organise something different.</p> <p>Senator Higgins expressed her concerns about the order for tomorrow.  I totally take on board what she said and appreciate the concerns she raised.  She also mentioned some issues with Commencement matters.  Other colleagues have raised such issues in recent weeks.  It might be worthwhile for the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight, CPPO, to do an analysis in order that we can see what kind of a response we are getting and from whom.  I can appreciate that it is not acceptable for somebody who just might happen to be on the rota on a particular day to have to come before the House to take a Commencement matter because they will not necessarily know the lie of the land of the Department in question.  We will look at that in the CPPO and come back to the Senators on it.</p> <p>Senator Hoey asked for a debate on postgraduate funding and welcomed the review the Minister is doing.  She spoke about the statutory processes ongoing with regard to the metro project and BusConnects.</p> <p>Senator Boylan proposed the amendment to the Order of Business and discussed the Bill she hopes to bring forward  soon to discuss what is absolutely unethical behaviour on the part of one of the largest corporations operating in this country.  When we look at lists of the wealthiest institutions, industries and countries, Amazon appears a lot higher on such lists than probably some 40 or 50 countries, so its power is not lost on any of us.  I wish the Senator well with her legislation.</p> <p>As I said, Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the removal of the northern distributor road.  I will come back to her and Senator Gavan later.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Defence and the row they are having at the moment about sergeants.  I noted with some amusement Senator Craughwell's request this morning that maybe the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should just take over.  I am sure the Department would be delighted if we all decided that it should take over because it is at the centre of continuous discussions and disagreements with all other Departments.  I will raise the Senator's concerns as he raised them this morning with the Minister.</p> <p>Senator Chambers talked about the welcome changes to the licensing laws, although there were mixed reviews yesterday.  The thing that probably concerns me the most is that, whether patrons have mixed reviews, they are in charge of their response to the law as to whether they go to the pub later, but those who do not have any responsibility for the changes and for how patrons will act are An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I believe we need to see extra resources, particularly around the hours of the extensions.  The really worrying thing - and I agree with what the Senator said about this earlier - is that while we hear that never before have we had as many garda&iacute; in the force, which is true, it is also true that never before have we seen so few of them on our streets.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The growing concerns we have around antisocial behaviour need to be addressed, and I will try to organise a debate on that.</p><p>Senator Chambers asked for a debate on wind energy, as did Senator Mullen.  I look forward to a time by 2027 or 2030 when apparently our energy bills will be slashed, because they are not slashed today.  We need to have the conversation now.  If the technology is there and we are being told it is not, we need to find out why.  We will have a debate on this, which I will organise.</p></speech>

I will read the groupings again for the benefit of Senators.  I will call on the Minister to speak, but if any other Senator wishes to speak, he or she should indicate a wish to do so.  Amendments Nos. 19 to 28, inclusive, are related.  Amendment No. 26 is consequential on amendment No. 19.  Amendments Nos. 19 to 28, inclusive, may be discussed together by agreement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I appreciate the opportunity to resume the debate where we left it last week.  I thank Senator Ward for tabling amendment No. 19, which seeks to amend section 13.  The Senator's amendment provides for similar matters concerning lay expertise and knowledge in an amended subsection (4).  This version simply provides for a reordering of the four criteria.  The way they were set out was for no particular reason.  I can appreciate why Senator Ward has put them in a particular order, but I am reluctant to accept the change given the potential effect of having to send the Bill back to the Lower House.  There is no weight placed on the criterion in subsection 4(a) merely because it is the first on the list.  It is not considered to be above any of the others.  It is just the way the provision has been drafted.  I will not be supporting the amendment for the reason that it is just how the provision has been drafted.  I appreciate we should have looked at putting the criteria in order and considered what being first might indicate.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 20 to 25, inclusive, have been tabled by Senators Higgins and Ruane.  Amendment No. 20 would add administration, civil society and trade unions to the list of knowledge and expertise to be brought by lay members of the commission.  In terms of trade unions, I am satisfied that a person with experience in the worker representation field is not at all precluded under the criteria that have been set out in the Bill.  A person with public service experience, as provided for in paragraph (a), might well have experience in worker representation.  Similarly, the involvement of a person who has human resources experience is provided for in paragraph (b).  The same is true in subsequent paragraphs of a person with experience of the courts system or a person with experience of human rights.  We have tried to keep it broad and inclusive without being specific.  The moment we start to get specific, we potentially exclude people as well.  That is why we have set out the four areas.</p> <p>Amendment No. 21 would delete "business" and "finance" but leave "public service" on the list of matters that are relevant to the section.  The term "business" is broad and would include commercial activity, so that term would comprehend this aspect of the amendment.  It would be a positive contribution to the commission to have a person who would have that type of financial experience or knowledge.</p> <p>Amendment No. 22 would have the effect of adding as a criterion "relevant areas of academic research including the law or social policy ".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We were minded to include law or legal references in this provision concerning lay knowledge because we know there will be significant legal knowledge and knowledge of the law given the overall composition of the commission and the other members who will fill the other positions.</p><p>Amendment No. 23 would have the effect of adding a criterion concerning the environment, sustainable development and environmental law.  Again, I appreciate where the Senator may be coming from on this considering that we are moving to specific courts and looking at specific areas.  I would ask the question then of whether we would not include family law or other types of law as well.  Being so specific potentially excludes others.  Currently, a person with a background in the environment or sustainable development is not precluded from putting himself or herself forward.  It speaks to the point that we have tried to keep the criteria broad so that nobody is excluded.  </p><p>Amendment No. 24 would have the effect of adding a category relating to international law and international agreements.  This is another area of the law the Senator wants to the prescribe and I do not propose to do that for the same reasons.</p><p>Amendment No. 25 would change the phrase "protection of human rights" to "protection and promotion of human rights" as one of the criteria.  While I see where the Senator is coming from, I suggest that what I have proposed and what is being proposed here get to the same point and the overall objective is the same.  The most important point is that the Public Appointments Service, PAS, could select a person with experience in human rights and equality.</p><p>Amendment No. 26 picks up the earlier discussion about the nomination of a representative from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  We spoke about this matter last week.  While I considered specifically having a member from IHREC, on further consideration the fact that we are not nominating representatives from any other type of body with a human rights focus makes it hard to justify why one would be picked over the other.  I appreciate the significance and importance of IHREC but there is nothing to prevent members of IHREC putting themselves forward.  Given that the criteria for lay members clearly refer to persons with a human rights background and persons who will promote or protect human rights, I fully anticipate that we will have members of that standing.  Perhaps somebody from IHREC will put themselves forward and be successful.</p><p>Amendment No. 27 would have the effect of no longer requiring the Minister to appoint from among persons nominated by the PAS but allowing discretion on the matter.  Whether it is the judges having to go through the commission or the lay members of the commission having to go through the PAS, what we have tried to do is ensure we have a clear, transparent, visible and coherent system.  That is the logic we have tried to apply throughout the legislation.</p><p>Amendment No. 28 would have the effect of replacing part of the text in subsection (5).  The existing text provides that "the Minister shall appoint lay members from among the persons recommended by the Public Appointments Service".  No lay members can be appointed outside this process.  The amendment would also have the effect of providing that the Minister can appoint such other lay members as he or she thinks suitable and who have not been recommended.  As I said, we are trying to keep everything within a specific structure so that every individual on the lay side of the commission will come through the PAS.  I think I have covered all of the amendments.  I apologise for missing the discussion the other evening.</p></speech>

I understand the rationale behind the decision not to accept amendment No. 19 but I hope she will give it consideration before Report Stage.  On that basis, I will withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

I have been tasked with their job.</p><p>I understand the argument that things need to be kept broad and that this does not preclude X, Y or Z.  In reality, however, what we have found that does not always necessarily translate in lots of different ways unless something is prescribed.  I find this argument, which has been made repeatedly by different Government Ministers in respect of different Bill, interesting.  They argue that people are not prevented from doing something and without wishing to drag the discussion on to a different Bill, I will cite the example of a county councillor who applied to join the board of a governing body.  The body responded that there was no reason to appoint the councillor to the board, despite the fact that individual had applied through the regular process, because there was no longer any such stipulation in the legislation, even though, in theory, councillors were not precluded from applying.  I am not convinced of the argument that not precluding people from applying means that people may apply.</p><p>Senator Higgins has given me a note on amendment No. 20.  The amendment seeks to delete section 13(4)(a), which provides that the objective that &quot;the lay members will, having regard to the functions of the Commission, amongst them possess knowledge of, and experience, qualifications, training or expertise&quot; in &quot;business, finance or public service&quot;.  My understanding is that this amendment would replace the subsection with a broader provision that among the lay members of the commission there will be expertise in commerce, finance, administration, public service, civil society or trade unions.  A broader range of expertise being sought among the lay membership would be welcome and would go a way to ensuring that the commission is broadly representative of society at large.</p><p>Amendment No. 21 seeks to delete the reference to business and finance and refers to the expertise in corporate governance which would already cover the expertise that would seem appropriate for the lay membership of the commission.</p><p>Amendment No. 22 would provide that one of the areas for inclusion in relevant expertise sought by the PAS for lay membership of the commission would be relevant areas of academic research, including the law or social policy.  This would ensure there would be a guarantee of academic expertise in relevant areas on the commission.</p><p>Amendment No. 23 seeks to provide that one of the areas for inclusion in relevant expertise sought by the PAS for lay membership of the commission would be the environment, sustainable development and environmental law.  It is important that there be appropriate expertise in this area given that there is a large volume of cases being heard on questions of environmental law and a growing body of case law in this area.  Furthermore, there are significant international agreements and domestic legislation in operation in the State, such as the Paris Agreement and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  It would be welcome for expertise in such areas to be included as expertise being sought by the PAS.</p><p>Amendment No. 24 would provide that one of the areas for inclusion in relevant expertise sought by the PAS for lay membership of the commission would be expertise in international law and international agreements or conventions to which the State is a party.  This is complementary to previous amendments which cite specific areas of international law, such as climate or disability law.  Therefore, a broader range of expertise would be welcome.</p><p>Amendment No. 25 would amend section 13(4)(d) by including the phrase &quot;and promotion&quot; in the language regarding expertise sought for the lay membership in the area of the protection of human of rights and equality.  The protection and promotion of human rights are two different but complementary sets of expertise.  It would be welcome for both areas of expertise to be included in the lay membership of the commission.</p></speech>

I would argue that there is a huge focus on and need to have expertise in the area of family law, which raises the question of whether that should be included as well.  Business, finance and public service cover as broad a range as possible, as well as the specific amendments set out by the Senators.  Those points apply to all of the amendments, which are very similar in that they seek to set out the provisions in a more prescribed way.  What I have tried to do is to keep the criteria as broad as possible to include as many people as possible and not be specific as to who can or cannot be part of the commission.</p></speech>

As the Minister said, there are important areas of law that have not been mentioned in any of the amendments, such as intellectual property law, family law and land law.

I think it would have very unsatisfactory consequences if it were adopted.  To ask the commission to try to work out whether there is adequate diversity in religious opinion, if that is to be a criterion for selection, would inevitably involve asking people for their religious views to see whether this criterion is satisfied.  I do not know what "civil status" means.  Gender is fairly obvious, or I hope it is.  Regarding sexual orientation, are we going to have the commission ask candidates for judicial office questions to work out what their sexual orientation is?  Their age should be fairly clear to the commission, but I do not know what the idea of diversity in age is supposed to mean.  To be eligible to be a judge, you have to have done ten or 12 years practice as a lawyer, or the equivalent as a legal academic with some degree of practice as well, so we are not talking about diversity in age.  Is this really to be the case?  Let us remember a few things about this.  We are appointing people to a job which involves or does not involve their pensionability.  For most applicants, this would be an important point.  Are we to say that there should be a good rash of people in their late 60s because they are well represented in this area?  I am not suggesting that someone in their late 60s should not be eligible but I do not think it should be a criterion for appointment to say that we need people in their late 60s.  I really cannot see any advantage in this amendment.  I think it pushes unnecessary agendas.  I am, of course, prohibited from being a member of the commission but if I were there, I would not want to know whether I was being sufficiently diverse in my recommendations by reference to matters such as religious beliefs, sexual orientation or civil status, whatever that actually means.  These things are private matters for a candidate for the Judiciary and should not be the subject of examination by the commission.</p></speech>

They have been taken from the commission's own diversity statements.  I am quite surprised that Senator McDowell does not know what "civil status" is, considering the groups in question are all listed in the Equal Status Act.  These groups have not been randomly plucked out of thin air.  This is a list taken directly from the Equal Status Act.

It is to assist people who are discriminated against on those grounds in seeking redress and requiring others to protect them from unfair discrimination.  However, there is no logical connection between the criteria for unfair discrimination and a process whereby members of the Judiciary are selected by explicit reference to the characteristics mentioned in the Equal Status Act.  I know that my colleague did not draft this amendment, but it shows a degree of intellectual confusion if it is based on the proposition that because someone can seek protection against discrimination on these grounds, the commission should investigate whether the person belongs to any of these categories before appointment.</p></speech>

I understand where the reference to the Equal Status Act comes from.  However, the Equal Status Act is there for the purpose of enforcing rights and creates categories in which litigation can be conducted to protect people in those categories.  Broadly speaking in the context of this amendment while it is important to recognise that, of course, the Judiciary should represent diversity to the greatest extent possible and should reflect the community as a whole, that must be an aspiration rather than an imposition.</p> <p>We need to remember two things.  First, there is a limited number of judges.  The High Court, for example, only has a little over 40 judges and I think the Court of Appeal has 20, but it is a small number of people.  It will not always be possible to achieve the diversity across these nine categories that Senator Hoey might want to achieve because the reality is that there may not be enough people to do it.</p> <p>The second restriction is on the category of people who are qualified to fill the positions.  For example, obviously in certain diversity criteria such as gender, for example, it is relatively easy to achieve that diversity and that balance, but it might not be possible in respect of things like ethnicity, membership of the Traveller community, disability or age, as was mentioned.  In reality, someone cannot become a judge in this country before the age of 30.  By the time somebody qualifies as a lawyer and undertakes at least ten years of practice he or she will be over 30.  That is one entire category that could not be included in a diversity.  The Judiciary, on that basis, will never represent people under the age of 30, for example.  That is a fact of life.  It is not that there is any striving to exclude under 30s from the Judiciary, but the reality is that we simply cannot populate it with a diversity of our choice.</p> <p>The reality is that several other criteria need to come in.  It may well be that of the people who are qualified there may not be enough people who could be chosen to fulfil all of the nine categories defined under the Equal Status Act.  While I applaud the provision in section 28 relating to a diversity statement by the commission, putting into the Act that the commission must be aware of that diversity issue and must therefore strive to achieve diversity where possible, we must also remember that the reality of having at least one member of each court, for example, from each of the nine categories defined in the Equal Status Act is not necessarily achievable.  Perhaps it will be possible, but there is a very strong chance that it will not be in every court.</p> <p>The notion of restricting the commission's ability to do its work by putting in such a specific amendment to section 28 fundamentally misunderstands the role of the commission which is to appoint members of the Judiciary who must be first and foremost excellent, competent and professional.  Those must be the first criteria and after that to seek to achieve criteria relating to diversity, representation of the community as a whole and all that.  However, first and foremost we must strive to have a Judiciary that can do its job effectively, professionally and excellently.  I do not think this amendment would help us down that road.  In fact, I think it would substantially restrict the ability of the commission to do its work.</p></speech>

Diversity is clearly required and is not reflected on the Bench at the moment.  However, I am not convinced of such listed detail in a specific statutory provision.  I do not believe it is necessary and it could have an unintended consequence.  It could become a distraction and burdensome.  While a noble aim, it is disproportionate and misplaced to insert it in a statutory provision in this instance.</p></speech>

However, I share Senator McDowell's concerns.  The amendment proposes to insert: "references to the improvement of diversity shall be construed to include improvement of representation of persons or classes...".  How could that be done without having to ask each individual applicant in the interview process about his or her sexual orientation, religious belief or civil status?  I am not sure that is where we want to be.  It is obviously clearly set out in the Equal Status Act, which is there to protect people who may be disadvantaged because of one of these characteristics.</p> <p>The commission needs to set out a diversity statement within a period of time afterwards clearly stating that it should reflect the diversity of the population but also taking into account, as Senator Ward has said, a person's competence and all the other factors.  For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.  I understand the logic behind it but the consequences of the commission having to show that people were not disadvantaged would mean that it would need to go through this list and potentially ask people of their status which I do not believe is the intended consequence here.</p></speech>

This issue will come up in one of my subsequent amendments.</p> <p>It is very important to maintain the confidentiality of those who may apply for judicial office.  If that is applied, a whole raft of people, who would certainly be qualified and who might make excellent judges, will simply not apply.  The reality is that for people in practice, particularly at the Bar where they are dependent on briefs coming from a solicitor, if word gets out that they might be about to apply for a position in the Judiciary, it can totally compromise their ability to practise.</p> <p>This issue arises when interviewing people and the extent to which the commission should or could involve itself in very substantial investigations into that person involving other people.  There is a real danger that the information that that person has applied could get out and it will totally compromise the ability of the commission to do its work.

It is important that the Minister give the House some clarity on the intended purpose of the Bill.  Will she tell the House whether it is the intention of this Bill to make it unlawful or illegal for the Government to appoint a person who is eligible for judicial office where that person has not been recommended by the judicial appointments commission?</p></speech>

We are setting out a clear process that will apply to every individual regardless of whether he or she is a sitting judge or a solicitor or barrister applying for the first time.  Everyone will come through the same process.  I appreciate that the Constitution sets out that the Government appoints judges.  That is why I am not recommending that one name be put forward to the Minister or Government or that the three names be marked as the first, second and third preferences.  I believe there should be discretion.  At the moment, a Minister could be provided with up to 60 names.  I am not sure that is the best approach either.  While there may be a particular view that the three recommendations limit the Government's discretion, I have looked at this issue carefully and examined how people are put forward, presented to government and appointed in other jurisdictions.  This strikes the right balance.  In short, the answer is "Yes".</p></speech>

The Constitution refers to eligibility as a matter determined by law.  I have no problem with statute stating that somebody should have seven, ten or 15 years' experience as a lawyer to be deemed eligible but we are left with a strange conundrum here.  Is it seriously being stated that, if the Attorney General informs the Government that three or four people whom he or she considers to be entirely suitable for promotion from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, for example, have not been recommended by the commission, the Government cannot appoint one of these people?</p><p>I will go back to the point that, as things stand, it is a matter of statute law that any judge of the High Court or the Court of Appeal is <i>ex officio</i>deemed suitable to preside over cases in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court on the invitation of the Chief Justice.  If, for whatever reason, the Chief Justice wishes to ask a member of the Court of Appeal to sit as one of the judges in a Supreme Court decision in a court of three, five, seven or nine, such a person is eligible to do so.  However, what is being said here is that such a person, although eligible and entitled by statute to act in either of these courts if invited by the Chief Justice or the President of the Court of Appeal, as the case may be, may not be made a member of the court in question.  The conundrum I identify here is that if everybody who is a High Court judge is <i>ex officio</i>suitable to be invited by the Chief Justice to serve on the Supreme Court on a one-off basis, how can the Government be prohibited from making them a member of the High Court or the Court of Appeal under the Constitution?  It seems that we are giving a veto to the judicial appointments commission, although we are not admitting that is what we are doing.  We are telling the commission that it may constantly say that John or Josephine Bloggs, who is a senior counsel, senior solicitor or whatever, is not to be on the list and that, because it has said this about that person and although that person may already be a judge, the Government is prohibited by statute from making him or her a member of a court on which he or she is entitled to serve in certain circumstances.  I doubt the constitutionality of that.  </p><p>I know the Minister is not going to reveal to us the Attorney General's advice but, on this fundamental issue, the House is entitled to hear the basis on which the government of the day could be prohibited by law from appointing somebody by a concerted decision on the part of a judicial body of which four of the eight voting members are laypersons.  What it really means is that the Judiciary could blacklist somebody from appointment even though he or she could serve as a judge by reason of experience and is legally entitled to do so.  It also means that the Judiciary could decide that a particular member of the High Court or the Court of Appeal should not be appointed to an appellate body, whether the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, effectively on its own say-so.  I find it a somewhat repugnant idea that we are, in effect, giving a veto to the Judiciary with regard to who can be appointed to the courts at all and who of a number of judges can be promoted from the Circuit Court to the High Court, from the High Court to the Court of Appeal or from either of those latter courts to the Supreme Court.  We are saying that the Judiciary can consistently naysay an applicant.  </p><p>We had a detailed discussion about the Attorney General's role on the previous occasion.  The Attorney General would be in a position to inform the Government if a blocking majority on the judicial appointments commission seemed to have taken the view that a particular judge should not be a member of the Supreme Court and has consistently nominated three other people rather than that person or excluded him or her from the list of persons recommended for appointment, which is one of the justifications for having the Attorney General on the council.  This is a fairly fundamental point.  Under the Constitution, does the Oireachtas have the right to tell the Government that, although somebody is eligible for appointment, it is prohibited as a matter of law from appointing him or her?  It is a fundamental issue because, in my view, it is a rewriting of the Constitution.  It is saying that, while heretofore a government has always been accredited with the right to select a judge where that person is eligible, it is now prohibited from doing so simply because four judges constantly say not to, although not through naming the person or putting a black mark against their name but by constantly putting three other people forward and leaving the person in question on the sideline.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a novel proposition, constitutionally.  I have a doubt as to whether it is within the capacity of the two Houses of the Oireachtas to enact a law directing the Government to do this.  The Minister has mentioned that there will be a list of three and that the Government should have discretion.  Why should the Government have discretion?  Is that constitutionally required or is this just a concession to the Government that it can choose between three?  Why should the Government have such a discretion if it is permissible for these Houses to tell it how big the shortlist can be and how it can be ordered from one to three or whatever?  If those powers are open to the Legislature, it raises the question of why the Executive, under the Constitution, should have any discretion at all.  It is difficult to justify the democratic discretion that Senator Ward has mentioned on previous occasions if it is purely a discretion held by the Government on the grace and favour of the two Houses of the Oireachtas from now on.<br/><br/>I would go back to the former Senator, Shane Ross, and his efforts in the D&aacute;il.  I am not talking about the legislation brought in by the former Minister, Deputy Flanagan.  Prior to that, Mr. Ross attempted to introduce legislation, the gist of which would have been that a committee of the D&aacute;il, the majority of which was not Government Deputies, had to approve any member of the Judiciary.  That, to me, was manifestly unconstitutional.  I do not understand how the two Houses of the Oireachtas can say to the Government that they will give it discretion up to three and de facto give four judges the right to veto any candidate for any judicial office, but the Government still remain the people who can advise the President under the Constitution as to who should be appointed.  It is a serious issue with this legislation.  I do not know if the President will in the fullness of time, if this legislation comes before him in this form, ask himself whether he should refer the matter to the Supreme Court to see if it is legitimate.  Why is it legitimate that a list of three dictated by four judges can prohibit the Executive from appointing or promoting somebody who is otherwise eligible to a particular court?  We are not talking about people being made district judges on a wet day some afternoon.  We are talking about who composes the Supreme Court.  If six or seven members of the High Court and the Court of Appeal indicate an interest in becoming an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court, why is it constitutional for four judges to choose between them and knock people off the list, thereby prohibiting those people from being appointed to the Supreme Court?<br/><br/>I have said this on previous occasions but I will reiterate it now.  As Senator Ward said, the appointment of judges is, in the last analysis, a decision made with executive discretion carried out under the Constitution by people elected democratically to serve as the Government of the country.  If there is such a discretion, it seems to me that there must be a question mark over whether it is lawful to tell the Government that a group of four judges has consistently vetoed one member of the Judiciary from being appointed to any particular position.  I strongly believe that it is not constitutionally permissible to do that.  In this context, I remind the Minister of what is in section 42.  I know we are not discussing that now but it is hugely important when we consider whether this amendment is or is not permissible.  Section 42(1) states:</p><blockquote>	The Minister may request the Commission to make recommendations for appointment or for nomination for appointment to judicial office, as the case may be, where&mdash;  	(a) a judicial office stands vacant, or<br /><br />(b) he or she reasonably anticipates that there will be a vacancy in a judicial office.  </blockquote><p>If the word &quot;may&quot; really means may, it may also mean &quot;may not&quot;  If it means &quot;shall&quot; and, therefore, means it is obligatory on the Minister to request the commission to fill such a position, there are two ways of looking at it.  It could be &quot;shall&quot;, unless the Government has decided to leave the place vacant completely.  The Government might decide there are too many members of the Court of Appeal and since Mr. Justice or Ms Justice Bloggs has retired, it will just leave that place vacant and will not ask the commission to look at the matter.  That is one possible meaning of the word &quot;may&quot;.  If it is absolutely obligatory for the Minister, wherever there is a vacancy that is intended to be filled, to press the switch for the judicial appointments commission to make a recommendation, then the word &quot;may&quot; seems inappropriate in section 42.<br/><br/>My understanding in any event is this.  Senator Ward mentioned that there are 20 members of the Court of Appeal.  It would be remarkable indeed if among those 20 people, eight consistently sought appointment to the Supreme Court and four members of the Judiciary consistently vetoed five of those eight by putting forward three other persons.  That is a remarkable constitutional revolution.  I would like to see what constitutional justification there is for doing this.  I will not put the matter any further than that.</p></speech>

It is so central and fundamental.  It is like a belt and braces approach to the whole thinking and statutory intention behind the Bill.  It would have the benefit of, if needs be, saving the Bill from itself.  There might be a constitutional challenge at some later date but the Legislature should never fear a constitutional challenge.  That is part and parcel of a robust democratic system.  To look at the statutory intention, maybe the transcripts of these debates could be read into some court record at a later stage.  Senator McDowell is almost forcing the Government to nail its colours to the mast in blatant terms.  The Minister has replied that this is the intention.  She has clarified that issue beyond any doubt.  Therefore, the Legislature is prepared to put its head above the parapet.  That is what I interpret from today's debate.  Then we have to look at whether there are safety valves in the Bill in the way it is drafted.  I construe the word "may" in section 42 as having a different meaning, whereby the Minister is not forced to do anything.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent Martin:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The word used is &quot;may&quot;.  To accept in full Senator McDowell's well-intended amendment would be very bold.  It could set the Bill at naught.  We have to rely on a favourable interpretation of the words &quot;may&quot; in section 42 and, as regards the doctrine of the presumption of constitutionality of the legislation, that it would never be repugnant to the Constitution.  The Attorney General has given the Government advices to which we are not privy.  Has it done enough to save itself from potential challenge?  I would say it is very close.  It is for another academic discussion to ask who would have <i>locus standi </i>to take such a challenge.  How would one compile the necessary cogent evidence to show four members of the Judiciary had acted in a certain way?  I would like to think the Judiciary would not act in that way but I am alive to the possibility of an unconscious bias.  You would want to be really open-minded all the time and every day of the year to spot a talented person who might be diametrically opposed to you and your views on life but may make a very good judge.  There is a possibility of a judge in a powerful position inadvertently going down a road which may not necessarily be fair.<br/><br/>This is a fundamental amendment.  It is almost like a declaration within the Bill to leave the Constitution alone and the Constitution is sacrosanct.  I fully get that but is it necessary and is it not a given that the Constitution will always trump the legislator?  The Government of the day should not be fettered by the legislator.  If it is, at some stage there could be a challenge.  I am not sure how that challenge would manifest itself but our duty is to legislate in a constitutionally safe way.  I am sure the Minister will give us the assurance that this has been well thought out and that there is a safety valve within the discretion.  I am not saying it is tying the hands of the Government but there is a case to be made that it is tying one hand of the Government.  If that is so, we are in uncharted waters.<br/><br/>I will have to rely on the expert advice of the Attorney General on a very tricky, constitutionally discrete and volatile issue which opens itself up to different interpretations.  Will the Minister give us further assurance that this has been thought out?  It would be helpful if we saw the advice.  I know the chief adviser to the Government does not have to give a legislator advice but that would reassure me.  I am not entirely satisfied that this is constitutionally safe.  I get it and know where it is coming from.  I hope there are enough safety valves and assurances both in the Bill and from the advices that it will withstand a challenge.  If there is a challenge, so be it.  If the President, as the Senator said, refers the Bill, that is nothing to be afraid of.  It would help clarify the law for everyone.  We should never be afraid of challenges.<br/><br/>I would be concerned if we adopted this amendment.  Maybe that would become the rule and not the exception and then this is just a dressed-up academic exercise which means well.  I would prefer to rely on the Constitution.  I am not sure it is necessary to have a statutory provision reminding us we are not in contravention of an Article in the Constitution.  It would give great clarity, at the same time, but is it necessary to say we are at all times constitutional here?  That is the question.  Do we not presume we are acting in a constitutional way, to the best of our ability?  I would be grateful to hear further from the Minister if she wants to think about that.  The advices from the Attorney General would reassure some of us, as legislators who have the onerous task of deciding on this issue, which is not that simple.</p></speech>

I understand where Senator McDowell is coming from but I feel he has created a very forced scenario, which he has reinforced by suggesting there will somehow be a judicial veto.  I do not think that is the case, which is why the Minister has strived to have a small commission with a balance between judicial and lay figures.  Senator McDowell has put this together in a not unmischievous way.  When he was Attorney General he would not have thanked a Senator for standing up in the House saying his advice should be published.  The purpose of Attorney Generals' advice is not that it be debated in this House or the public domain; it is legal advice to the Government as the Attorney General's client.  That is why it remains confidential and there is not a requirement to publish it.  Otherwise, it would be second-guessed by everyone.  Legal advice from the Attorney General or an individual practitioner is always subject to interpretation.  That is the nature of law.  It is not a science but something that is subject to interpretation.  The only interpretation that counts is that of the court.</p> <p>I do not agree with the Senator when he contrives a scenario in which a group of four judges exercise what he calls a judicial veto on the appointment of people.  I do not envisage that happening, although I accept what he says on the possible contradiction arising from it.  He is trying in his amendment to ascertain the supremacy of the Constitution but that is, as has been said, a given.</p> <p>If I am wrong in this, I am open to correction.  Article 35.1 provides for the power of the President to appoint judges.  He or she does so on the advice of the Government.  That power in the Constitution will not be not undone by this Bill.  I do not agree that all of the provisions of the Bill are necessary, which is why I have tabled amendments to many of them.  Perhaps it is because I practise law in this country that I have a greater faith in the way the system operates than others do.</p> <p>Underpinning this legislation is a supposition that the Government should not be as involved in the appointment of judges as it is.  As I said on Second Stage and already on Committee Stage, it must be a fundamentally political activity to appoint judges, not because judges should be political - they are not political, in fairness to them - but because they are a branch of Government.  The democratic element of their appointment comes from the fact that the representatives of the people, through the Executive, appoint them to their position, albeit it is difficult to remove them from that position thereafter.  The people have their say through the Government and Executive at the point of appointment.</p> <p>I disagree with Senator Martin's suggestion that it is not for this House to fetter the Government.  That is exactly the job of this House.  Everything the Government does must be done under the conditions put in place by-----</p></speech>

The Senator is right that constitutionally there is a trump card there but as legislators, it should be our job to put in place legislation that fetters, controls or manipulates the powers of the Government.  That is why so much of what Ministers do must come back to these Houses and why Ministers are accountable to the D&aacute;il.  That is an important part of the checks and balances in our democratic system.  It is not a separation between the Executive and the Legislature because the Executive controls the Legislature.  It is not a separation of powers.  I do not believe it is correct to go from there and suggest that, because these Houses or this Legislature, through this Bill, will restrict the ability of the Government to choose somebody without going through the process laid down in this legislation, it is such a fettering of the power of the Government as to render it unconstitutional.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is not correct because at the end of the day the constitutional power is for the President to appoint the judge on the advice of the Government and under Article 35 that power endures.</p><p>If I have understood it correctly, the point that Senator McDowell makes is that the Attorney General could not arrive into the Cabinet meeting next week and say that Mary Murphy would be a great Supreme Court judge, that there is a vacancy and that she should be put in and because the provisions in this Bill will prevent the Government from doing that we are somehow interfering with the constitutional prerogative of the Government.  I do not agree that this would be a constitutional issue.  One must look at all the legislation because a constitution only operates within the confines of law in real terms.  Putting down legislation that defines a process that must be followed by the Government in the appointment of judges is not to fetter the constitutional discretion of Government in an unjustifiable way.  In every Bill that has been passed by these Houses, establishing other judicial appointments boards and bodies for the appointment of judges or for any other appointment that the Government makes under the Constitution via the President or that the President makes on the advice of the Government, they have all fettered that discretion and corralled the powers of the Government into a particular channel or process.  That is done for lots of legitimate legal and constitutional reasons.  The reason, as I understand it, behind this Bill is to put in place a system of transparent processes that will hopefully lead to the appointment of the best candidate into judicial office.  At the end of the day it leaves no question as to whether, for example, one individual, be it the Attorney General or another Minister or whoever, does not rock into the Cabinet meeting next Tuesday and say that Mary Murphy should be put into the Supreme Court.  The purpose of this legislation is to establish a process that is transparent and clearly set down in law, and that is followed by the Cabinet and the Executive before that recommendation is made to the President for appointment under Article 35.</p><p>I understand the point that Senator McDowell is making and I also understand that it is part of his remit to challenge and raise these issues, as is all of our remits in this Chamber.  However, he has shoehorned an issue into this discussion that would never arise, although that is not the point.  The point is not whether it will arise but whether it could arise.  What we have done in section 9 in establishing the membership of the commission is to have a body of people that is balanced and that has lay and judicial representation.  I lament the fact that there is no professional representation and I have made that point already.</p><p>The other issue that potentially arises in that context is what I was trying to do in amendment No. 30.  I am sorry that I stepped out and that the amendment fell but it was concerned with the casting vote in the event that there is a tie.  Perhaps the Minister has an answer to that point that I am not aware of.  The scenario that Senator McDowell envisages is not one that we have to fear because it is legitimate for the Oireachtas to decide that there is a process, that there are parameters and that there are restrictions on the exercise of the Government's power under Article 35 to advise the President in respect of judicial appointments.</p></speech>

There is a presumption of constitutionality when a Bill emerges from this House and the onus of proof of its unconstitutionality switches.  If a Bill has two possible meanings it is impressed with a constitutional meaning rather than an unconstitutional meaning.  However, there is no presumption of constitutionality at all for a Bill that is before us for consideration.  Therefore, it is not merely our right but our duty to test whether something that is put before us is consistent with the Constitution.  Earlier I noted that Senator Ward was not here when his amendment No. 30 was dealt with, and I am not criticising him for that.  Amendment No. 30 states: "in the event that there is a tied vote on any matter before the Commission, the chairperson, including a person acting as chairperson under subsection (3), shall exercise a casting vote".  This will mean that in most appointments the Chief Justice will have a casting vote.  What I say about the Judiciary effectively being given a power of veto-----</p></speech>

I notice that the legislation states that the commission can determine its own procedures.  However, this is a matter of significance.

If we are giving an entity, namely, this commission, the effective capacity to tell the Government who it can appoint and who it cannot appoint, and if that is the sum and bottom line of this legislation, then the very least we are entitled to in this House is to know what happens in an eight-person commission when they divide four against four.  We are entitled to know how that would be resolved.</p><p>The Minister cannot just walk away from Senator Ward's amendment or think that she will come back to it later; it is a hugely important point.  It does not matter whether they are all judges or non-judges, an eight-person commission effectively has the right to tell the Government who it can appoint, and by exercising that power, to tell the Government who it cannot appoint.  If it is not provided for in the legislation how an issue is to be resolved if they divide four against four then there is a fundamental defect in it because we are being asked to establish this body and to give it these powers, and we are not being fairly given an indication of how it is to exercise those powers in the event of an even disagreement among its members.  As Senators and legislators we are entitled to have clarity on that issue and the legislation should make that clear, whether or not amendment No. 15 was moved.</p><p>We cannot avoid the idea of there being votes.  If the Minister goes back to section 9 it states that the Attorney General shall be a member of this commission but that this is: &quot;subject to <i>subsection (3)</i>&quot;.  When one looks at subsection (3) one find that: &quot;The Attorney General shall not, as a member of the Commission, have a right to vote on any matter coming before the Commission for a vote&quot;.  The commission is now down to seven people in principle but if one person is not there and it is three against three, one is faced with the same dilemma.  I am worried by that.</p><p>The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was put in place by legislation drafted when Dermot Gleeson was Attorney General.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What it provided for in relation to lists of people recommended was that, first, they had to have a minimum size, not just a maximum size.  Apart from whether it was a good or bad idea, it did not say the Government shall only consider people on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board list; it said that in coming to advise the President, the Government should first consider the names coming before it from the JAAB.  I believe that is constitutional.  In other words, it is putting into place a recommendatory role to which the Government is obliged to pay some attention, but when it becomes more than that - the Minister has clarified that it is intended to do more than that and to prohibit the Government, as a matter of law, from advising the President to appoint somebody who is not recommended, even though he or she is eligible - then I think a constitutional issue arises.<br/><br/>Reference has been made by my colleagues to the whole question of the presumption of constitutionality and who would have status to challenge the appointment of a judge or to challenge the substance of this legislation if it comes down to the rights of citizens to challenge legislation.  I will make two remarks about that.  If the President were to refer this to the Supreme Court so that the constitutionality of this effective veto for the judicial appointments commission could be tested, the Attorney General would then have to present himself or herself before the Supreme Court, or through counsel, and say these are the reasons I say this Bill is constitutional.  He or she would have to make submissions then.  I fully accept what Senator Ward says.  I held the Office of Attorney General.  As legal adviser to the Government, there is a privilege involved.  One cannot have one's opinions just thrown around like confetti at a wake in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann just because somebody demands to see what the Attorney General did or did not advise the Government.  I fully accept that principle, but this is a matter of fundamental constitutional importance.  If there were an Article 26 reference, the Attorney General would have to make submissions and he or she would have to explain to the highest court in the land precisely why this is constitutional.  Therefore, we are left with the possibility that the President, under Article 26, having consulted the Council of State, would put this matter beyond doubt.  If it is not put beyond doubt, the question was raised as to who would have <i>locus standi</i>thereafter to challenge the outcome.  It could not be that one would have to be a disappointed applicant.  The right to be tried by independent judges appointed under the Constitution is a right of every citizen.  Any citizen, whose litigation came before any judge, be it in the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, is entitled to be assured that the constitutional rights of the Government in making the particular appointment of the judge before whom he or she is going to appear have been not merely done in a manner which is defensible but done in a manner strictly provided by the Constitution.<br/><br/>Senator Ward said I was trying to shoehorn something into this debate.  I am trying to shoehorn a real discussion into this debate because this House emasculates itself by saying that people can have seven minutes or five minutes to speak on important constitutional legislation on Second Stage.  This is a point of fundamental principle and it must be discussed.  We are entitled to a clear view from the Government.  We have got some clarity this afternoon - which is good - that notwithstanding the use of the word &quot;may&quot; in a later section, we are now saying it will be illegal for the Government henceforth to appoint somebody whose name does not appear on a list, even though he or she could be a senior judge already, for instance in the Court of Appeal, looking to be a member of the Supreme Court.  It will be illegal to do that because this commission will not have included his or her name in a shortlist to be considered by the Government.  I make no apology for raising this issue in the only effective way that the rules of this House permit, that is, to have a proper discussion where I can ask a question of the Minister rather than in a Second Stage speech to which there may or may not be a reply.<br/><br/>I fully accept a lot of what Senator Ward said, including that, in the end, any judge will be appointed by the President under the Constitution.  That means nothing, however, if the President is obliged to operate on the advice of the Government and if the two Houses of the Oireachtas have chosen to exceed their powers by telling the Government they rather than the Government will establish a mechanism to determine on what basis that advice will be given.<br/><br/>The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board legislation, crafted by the former Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson, made it very clear not that there was a prohibition but that it was the expectation of the Oireachtas that the advisory board's shortlist should first be looked at before an appointment was made.  If the President did refer this matter to the Supreme Court, the Attorney General would have to explain to that court why it is constitutional.<br/><br/>On a constitutional issue of such gravity and importance, when we are being asked to put the legislation in a position that it may be referred to the Supreme Court, it is not too much to ask to understand on what basis the Government has been advised that this is a permissible circumscription of the power of the Executive under the Constitution.  It is a matter relating to the separation of powers.  This is a point Senator Ward conveniently ignores.  It is perfectly permissible under the Constitution &ndash; in fact, it is required under the Constitution &ndash; that the criteria for the eligibility of persons to be appointed judges are laid down by law.  We cannot just go out onto the street and bring somebody down to the Supreme Court and say he or she is a Supreme Court judge because the Government appointed him or her this afternoon.  That cannot be done.  Once a person is eligible, and once the Houses of the Oireachtas have determined what eligibility means, especially when we are dealing with the position of an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court, for which 60 people would possibly be immediately eligible in conventional terms to apply, ignoring completely persons who were not judges already, members of the High Court and the Court of Appeal - we are now proposing to even extend it to the Circuit Court and to somebody with 12 years' experience in the District Court - what is the point, if they are all eligible, of having eligibility under the Constitution, if on top of eligibility there is disqualification?  In substance, we are dealing with a system of disqualification of eligible people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are saying that unless one gets a ticket from the judicial appointments commission, one is disqualified from appointment and is made ineligible, in effect.</p><p>Of course, we could go a long way down the road of saying that eligibility means the following things but, in the end, if we pervert the meaning of eligibility to mean, "decided to be suitable by somebody else other than the organ of State nominated by the Constitution", then eligibility is no longer the issue, discretion is the issue.  If we give the Government&rsquo;s discretion to a third party commission then we are entitled to see the arguments which are made for the constitutionality of such an arrangement.</p><p>I favour a system of transparency.  I said it before in this House and I will say it again, when I was Minister for Justice where the current Minister is now, and Rory Brady was the Attorney General, we made appointment after appointment which had nothing to do with the person&rsquo;s party political affiliation and was demonstrably disconnected from any such consideration.  </p><p>I make this point, however, that it does not follow from that, that party politics should not influence appointment to the Judiciary.  I agree completely with Senator Ward that judges, even if they had a party or partisan history, abandon it completely upon their appointment and take a declaration of office, which in effect prohibits them from having such a consideration because they are obliged to judge every case without fear or favour of any particular outcome.  Once that declaration is made, that is fine, but we are very much in a situation - and I return to all of the hullabaloo that the former Minister, Shane Ross, kicked up about this - that in seeking to avoid what I believe was an unwarranted charge of cronyism, we are now putting in place something which alters the meaning of the Constitution as it was understood by the Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson, as it was put in place before.  We are now putting a different mechanism in place which in effect says that the discretionary aspects of who should be on the shortlist, and therefore of whom may be made a judge, is transferred away from the Government to the commission.  </p><p>I say that there is a serious constitutional issue to be determined there.  I cannot put it any further but this is not a gimmick and is the only means by which this House can debate this issue.  There is no other means on our rather ridiculous rules and procedures where a serious debate of this issue can happen except by tabling an amendment which brings the issue to the centre of the debate.  I make no apology for doing that and all I wanted to do, and insist on doing, is getting an explanation in this House as to why this is constitutional because there is no presumption that it is.  </p><p>The fact that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann did not raise the issue or that Members of that House did not bother themselves with it is no reason this House should not do so, and in fact it is every reason this House should address the matter and seek an explanation.  This is not in respect of the advice the Government has received on the issue.  I am not looking for the advice that it received from the Attorney General but I am looking for the arguments as to why this is constitutional, as to why a three-person shortlist is considered constitutional, and as to why it is considered legitimate to say that the fourth person, the runner-up, can be consistently and effectively disqualified, as a matter of other people&rsquo;s discretion, from consideration by the Government.</p></speech>

I would make a general point with reference to invoking Article 26 of the Constitution, that it is rare that that happens.  Ideally, that would be a wonderful way of extrapolating the point on whether or not this issue is constitutional.</p><p>In the absence of that, this is an issue for an academic discussion at some stage as to the <i>locus standi</i>.  That is why what we are doing today is so important because it would be difficult for people with the obvious<i>locus standi</i>, who would have to think about it further, to mount a challenge that their rights were constitutionally breached whether that be in their capacity as a failed candidate, which is not inconceivable, to put such a challenge on such people&rsquo;s shoulders, even if the decision was overturned, and for them then to serve on the Bench given the manner in which they got there.  </p><p>Addressing Senator Ward, balances and checks are a vital component of the democratic process but if it is an imposition which crosses the line and is in breach of the Constitution, one obviously cannot go there.  This is not a <i>carte blanche</i>unfettered right.  The presumption of constitutionality takes effect after the promulgation and enactment of a Bill.  It is only a Bill at the moment.  Metaphorically speaking, if one considers this exercise as the building of a house and the putting of bricks in it, the builder, which is the legislator, would like to ensure that each brick he puts in would pass that test at a later date, would be a solid brick, would be put in with the very best due vigilance and diligence, would have one eye on what happens after the enactment, would like to be able to stand over the work of the Legislature, and that it is in compliance with the Constitution.</p><p>At worst, what Senator McDowell is saying could be dismissed - and I do not agree with this - as the conjuring up of a theoretical proposition.  How can it be otherwise, however, because it has never been tested.  Even if it is a conjuring up of something which may be enacted, it is a warning and the Senator may be flagging something that, in the interests of all, we would like to get right.  I do not believe that a black-and-white approach is the way forward.  </p><p>The Minister has been very good to come into the Chamber today to put her cards on the table and has made her intentions perfectly clear on this in respect of where the Constitution lies.  That is why I look forward to it if the Minister is going to make any further remarks.  If the issue was referred to the courts, that is a chance which would enable us to see a version of the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice, as it would all come out then in open court in the Supreme Court.  Notwithstanding that, we have a chief adviser and a constitutional officeholder of the Government who is in that very good line of predecessors, who are very ably qualified, and is a constitutional expert.  I just hope that he has pushed this issue out far enough not to get caught with a legal ricochet or bullet - if the Members may excuse the language and figuratively speaking - in a challenge later.  I trust him that he will not get caught and that he has pushed this every bit as far as he possibly can.  I am not, however, 100% convinced that this issue has not, in fact, crossed the line.  That is just my honest assessment of it as best I can make it.</p><p>As I have said, and as other speakers all agree, this goes to the very heart of who we are as a democratic society.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P.

First, I will touch on an area Senator Ward focused on, namely the purpose and intention behind this Bill.  One of the key elements of reform is the fact that any individual, be he or she a sitting barrister, solicitor, legal academic or a sitting judge, would go through the same process.  I appreciate it is a departure from what is there but it is to ensure that we have a clear and transparent process that upholds what I believe has been a good process to date and has resulted in an excellent Judiciary, which is remarked on and acknowledged as such.  It is so that we continue to uphold those standards but that we have as clear and transparent a process as possible.  To accept this amendment would completely remove what is a key element of reform in this legislation.</p> <p>Under the Constitution, judges in courts in Ireland shall be appointed by the President.  Article 13 provides that this function of the President shall be exercisable only on the advice of the Government.  It is important, first and foremost, that we adhere to and interpret the Constitution and that we apply it while also having regard to international standards.  That is what we have tried to do here in striking the right balance and making sure that the Government recommends that the President appoints but that we also adhere to and have regard to international standards.  The advice that I have, and I want to reassure colleagues that it has not been a single engagement but a constant back and forth with the Attorney General on this, is that we have struck the right balance and that the appropriate number is three and that it allows for discretion and also acknowledges and takes on board international standards.  Some would prefer that the Government had no discretion and that there was one name and that it was numbered but I firmly believe that because of the Constitution, the Government has to play a role.</p> <p>Senator McDowell spoke of prohibiting or disqualifying people from going forward.  Nobody is disqualified if they have the qualification but to suggest that somebody cannot, because he or she is a sitting judge, then I do not agree.  If someone is qualified and suitable then he or she can put himself or herself forward, apply and go through this process.  The Senator is suggesting that the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the Courts and the people - because it is not four people, it is eight plus the Attorney General - would consistently disqualify a person, and presuming that would happen and that the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the Court would stand over something like that.  Again, I do not accept that.  I would have confidence not just in the legal or judicial but also the lay side of the commission itself.</p> <p>On the Senator's ask around the voting, to date, it has always been that decision has been taken by consensus.  I do not see that changing.  There can be no situation where the commission proposes nobody to the Minister unless nobody puts themselves forward, which I would never see happening.  Regarding Senator Ward's amendment, which we did not get to, there should not be a casting vote by anybody.  We will not accept that for the very reason that they should be decided on consensus.  If a decision cannot be reached, then the members of the commission will have to work together to find that consensus.  It has worked to date.  There was never a situation that I am aware of, or has been since I have been in this position, where a vote has taken place.  It has always worked by consensus and I believe that will continue.</p> <p>On section 42 and the use of the word "may", the recommendation must be made if the Minister requests it.  The Senator outlined a scenario where it has been the case to date that where a position has lain vacant and there has not been a request from the President to fill that position.  The Minister may request but if there is a request not to, and to be honest the Supreme Court is the only time that has happened, for many other positions that would not arise.  It simply means that if there is a situation where a vacancy is not needed to be filled then it is not but a vacancy shall be filled or a recommendation must be made if the Minister requests that recommendation.</p> <p>Returning to the constitutional provision and the language that judges shall be appointed by the president, the function of the president shall be exercisable only on the advice of the Government is still very much the case here.  It is still very much the case that the Government makes recommendations but that we as the Houses of the Oireachtas set out the criteria by which those names come forward to the Government and there will still be discretion there.  I appreciate that we might not agree on this point but I have sought advice from and engaged with the Attorney General throughout this entire process.  I am satisfied that what we have set out here fits in with, supports and is in line with our Constitution but also has regard to international standards where standards are not necessarily always upheld and where we know significant challenges and concerns arise with governments as well.  It is important that we protect ourselves in that regard while also making sure that our Constitution comes first and foremost.  However, I do not think that anyone is prohibited or disqualified.  If someone is suitable and fits the criteria, even if they have sat on the Bench for one sitting because they have been asked by the Chief Justice, that should not mean that he or she never has to go through a process of promotion simply because he or she is a sitting judge.  I just do not agree with that.  If someone is seeking a promotion there should be no reason he or she would not go through the same process.  If he or she is suitable and qualified then there is no reason he or she could not be recommended.  Technically, a person could come through a process or apply and never be put forward but that can apply in any circumstance and to assume that the Chief Justice and others would make a conscious decision not to allow someone to go forward again is not a viable or realistic situation that might arise.  For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.  To return to my first point, this is a key element of reform that we have a single, clear, transparent process that everyone can be confident in and that upholds what I believe what has been an excellent Judiciary to date and continues the process in as clear a way as possible.  That would be completely removed were we to accept this amendment. </p></speech>

I am interested by what she said about international standards because they do vary.  We only have to look to Washington to see one standard that is radically different from any other standard.  We are the only major common law jurisdiction with a written constitution that provides for the mode of appointment of people to judicial office.  The British can do whatever they like; the Canadians and Australians likewise.  I am not sure about the position in Canada, which does have a written constitution, but I do not know on what basis the decision is made there so I must plead ignorance on that.  However, if we are talking about international standards, we cannot talk about European standards because the vast majority of the European community is not a common law jurisdiction.  The function of judges in European states is radically different from that in Ireland and common law countries. We have to remember that one of the most extraordinary features of our Constitution is that if a woman or man is appointed to the High Court, he or she has the right, subject to any appeal from his or heir decision, to invalidate by constitutional criteria any action of this House or of the Executive or combination of both.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a massive power to give to an individual man or woman sitting in the High Court as part of his or her full and original jurisdiction.  It does not apply in England.  There is judicial review in England but it is not by reference to a written constitution, and we hear now that the Tories are beginning to get impatient with the exercise of the non-constitutional judicial review powers.  Ours is the only common law country anywhere, with the exception of the US, where an individual member of the Judiciary is empowered to strike down any action of the Legislature or the Executive as part of his or her personal single jurisdiction.  When people talk about applying international standards to the appointment of judges, no other member of the European community has a system like ours.  They have constitutional courts and this, that and other, but none has a situation where an Act of Parliament can be annulled by a single judge on an afternoon in the Four Courts.  In no other country can an Act be declared under the Constitution to be null and void because that judge has been persuaded by the arguments put before him or her.</p><p>I am, therefore, sceptical of people saying GRECO says this or the Long Title says that.  Our system is fundamentally different.  I recently attended a conference in Lisbon where a member of the French council of state, its highest court, gave us an insight into how that court actually works.  It is almost like a permanent Article 26 court or a permanent attorney general looking at legislation.  It is a different thing.  The appointment of members of the judiciary in the civil law system is different from ours.  We do not have the same system as them.  Of course, eligibility and governmental discretion are not laid down in those jurisdictions in the same terms as they are here.</p><p>Is the Government to be amenable to anybody at all as to why it chose person A rather than persons B or C from a list?  The answer is "No".  Nobody would dream of saying it should divulge who was on the list, how it was they decided it was one of the three and why they discounted the other two.  People talk about transparency in this House and I agree with Senator Ward.  This is not a transparent process.  It is a uniform process and I agree with the Minister that it is uniform in that she is saying every candidate for every judicial position must go through exactly the same procedure, but it is not transparent and can never be transparent.  We can never ask the Government why it chose Senator Martin, say, rather than Senator Ward for a High Court appointment.</p></speech>

We cannot ask the Government and it cannot be compelled to answer it, and we are not entitled to know, as far as I can see, which of them was short-listed and which was not.  I agree with Senator Ward and nobody is against transparency.  When somebody stands up in this House and says he or she is a champion of opacity as opposed to transparency, that will be the day.  I always recall Charlie McCreevy deriding openness, transparency and accountability, &ldquo;the goddess OTA&rdquo;.  He said transparency, up to a point, is a nonsense politicians talk about and kneel before.  There is not anything transparent about this.  We will not know precisely how the process was decided.  We will not see the marking sheets of the people who conducted the interviews, we will not see why the Government chose one of three and we will not see why, if there were ten applicants for a position as ordinary judge of the Supreme Court, why seven of them were found to be less meritorious than three.</p> <p>It is not a question of transparency, and it is not a question of international standards either because the US system, which I do not suggest we should have, is radically different from ours in that the US Senate has to consider and approve, in the same way that the then Deputy, Shane Ross, once advocated when he was in opposition, a parliamentary vetting of every appointment by a committee in public.  That was one of his more exotic ideas at one stage in support of his campaign against cronyism, as he saw it.  We are not in that position.  International standards can be Canadian, Australian or from New Zealand or wherever.  To give an appalling example, the Indian constitution provides that the chief justice should be consulted on appointments to the higher courts in India, and the Indian supreme court - wait for it - ruled that the term "consulted" meant he had a veto.  When the houses of parliament tried to challenge that, the supreme court went on to hold that this was one matter of such fundamental importance that the houses of parliament could not interpret the constitution in a way inconsistent with the views of the supreme court.  I am making the point that if we look across the common law world even, there is not a single standard, and if we look across Europe, there is a radically different process involving judges of radically different powers.</p> <p>I want to be clear about this lest anybody misunderstand what I was saying.  I was not saying it was necessarily wrong that a judge should not be exempt from the same procedures as a non-judge in looking to be appointed or recommended.  I was only referring to the question of eligibility as distinct from discretionary choice and making the point that any High Court or Court of Appeal judge is entitled to serve in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court and is deemed capable of doing so if he or she is invited to do so by the president of either of those courts.  I have appeared before a High Court judge, acting up so to speak, in the Supreme Court and it is true they are eligible.  No one can say, "Sorry, you haven't been appointed by the Government to be here."  The statute states such a person can sit at the invitation of the Chief Justice.  If they are all eligible to be appointed and to act as a judge, it seems that if we then say that to be appointed by the Government as a permanent member of the court as opposed to being invited by the President of the Court of Appeal or the Chief Justice to act on occasion in that court, a permanent position requires that the Government be restricted in whom it can appoint.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It already has appointed the person in question, or the person stands appointed. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#VV00600"><p>I thank Senators for the invitation to make a statement to update them on the school transport provision for the current school year.  School transport was established in 1968.  It was created to facilitate access to primary and post-primary education for those children who, because of where they reside, might otherwise have difficulty attending school regularly.  Of course there have been considerable changes in Irish society since the scheme was first established but the scheme continues to provide a significant level of service for children and young people right across the State.  In the 2021-22 school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary, post-primary and special schools.  In 2021, the total cost of providing school transport amounted to &euro;289 million.  This includes direct transport services and grant payments.  It also includes funding to schools for the employment of escorts to accompany children with special educational needs whose care and safety needs require this support.</p> <p>In July 2022, the Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for eligible applicants for the 2022-23 school year as part of a wider package of cost-of-living measures.  Eligibility criteria remained the same as in previous years.  School transport ticket registration for the 2022-23 school year closed on 29 July, by which time almost 130,000 applicants or registrations were received for mainstream school transports.  This figures includes 44,299 new applicants as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.  Any application completed after this date is a late application and therefore many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.  Late applications will only be assessed after all on-time applications have been processed and there can be no guarantee of places for late applicants.  Already 126,000 tickets for the mainstream scheme alone have been issued to applicants for the 2022-23 school year.  A further 17,600 have been issued in respect of the special education scheme.  At the start of the last school year, there were approximately 103,600 children carried on mainstream school transport services so already in the region of 22,400 additional places have been created.  This is a 22% increase overall in the number of mainstream seats on the service.</p> <p>The temporary waiving of fees has led to an unprecedented expansion of the scheme, with many more eligible and concessionary applicants receiving tickets than ever before.  There has been an increase in tickets allocated across all counties with an increase of over 18% in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils compared with the start of the 2021-22 school year and an increase of over 27% in the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils in comparison with the start of the 2021-22 school year.</p> <p>Notwithstanding this, I acknowledge that the huge increase in applications has led to frustration over delays in issuing tickets and establishing services in some instances.  Given this unprecedented demand for school transport for the current school year, there has been an increased volume of calls to both the dedicated Bus &Eacute;ireann customer care centre and the school transport section of the Department.  The Department agreed to additional resources to facilitate additional staff in the customer care centre with a view to alleviating the waiting and call answer times.  There is also a facility in place whereby public representatives can email queries on behalf of their constituents directly to Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>It is very important to note that the waiving of transport fees remains contingent on applicants meeting the normal eligibility criteria of the scheme.  Tickets continue to be allocated in line with these criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest primary school.  At post-primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school or education centre are deemed eligible.  Any pupil or student who does not meet these criteria is deemed not eligible, otherwise known as a concessionary applicant.  Such pupils are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children or young people have been catered for.</p> <p>For this year, and in line with normal practice, all eligible children and young people who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022-23 school year have now been accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the school transport scheme, temporary alleviation measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022-23 school year.  Under these measures, transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school, and who applied by 29 April and registered by 29 July.</p> <p>Both the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are very conscious of the challenges faced by parents awaiting transport for students with special educational needs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Norma Foley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=NormaFoley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Families of children who are eligible for these services but experience a delay with accessing them may, therefore, apply for the special transport grant.  This is a once-off grant paid retrospectively to families to assist with the cost of private transport arrangements that the families have put in place until services are finalised.  Where a new service is sanctioned this means a procurement or vetting process is required.  In many instances, the school is also sanctioned to employ a transport escort and this necessarily takes time to put in place.  By accepting applications year round the Department can ensure that children with special educational needs receive the transport they require.  To ensure the efficient delivery of services to children and special educational needs school transport, Bus &Eacute;ireann assesses each application to assess the options available.  Where children can be facilitated on an existing service applications are processed immediately and arrangements are put in place with the families involved. </p><p>As part of the budgetary process some additional funding has been approved for the scheme, which will allow officials in the Department of Education, in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann, to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is initially focusing on where families applied on time and previously held concessionary tickets.  However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.  Constraints on sourcing of vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the county may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity.</p><p>The Department is continuing to conduct a review of the school transport scheme, which includes an examination of the current scheme and how it is operating, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families.  The steering group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.</p><p>Once again, I thank the Senators for the invitation to appear here today.</p></speech>

Many thousands of families have benefited.  It was a really good news story that may not have received the feedback that it deserved because a lot of focus was placed on the smaller problem of the small numbers of students who were not accommodated immediately, which we are still working towards.  It is important to acknowledge that there was a significant investment in school transport at a time when many families needed it and that help was really appreciated by many families.</p> <p>In terms of the eligibility criteria and how we assess school transport, I thank the Minister and her office for their consistent engagement, getting back to people and working with us on a case-by-case basis to assist people.  Those efforts are appreciated and I know that it took a lot of work to do that.</p></speech>

We must move to a space where any child who wants to get a bus to school should be allowed to do so.  We want to get people out of their cars.  It does not make sense to have parents in a situation where they must drive their children to school.  In an environment and society where for many families, if not the majority, both parents work getting children to school is a huge stress on many families.  That is why many parents who had concessionary tickets found themselves in a situation where not having access to a bus made it really difficult for them to get to work on time and to juggle family life, which is already quite stressful for many.  That is why I would like us to move away from that situation.</p> <p>Provision of school transport should be within reason.  I acknowledge that in many instances it is not safe for children and their families to walk or cycle to school.  Local authorities must provide proper walking and cycling infrastructure because many families would avail of same.  Families with children attending primary school are not going to walk very far.  A distance between a school and home might seem short to us but it would be a big distance for a primary school student.  School transport should be available as close as possible to schools so that anybody outside of that bracket qualifies for a ticket.  I ask that the Department provides enough buses to service that.  Ultimately, that is where this debate will have taken us.  We are now looking at that.  The time is right as it makes sense to use school transport with the climate agenda, and it would get people out of their cars and travelling together.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for the work that she has done to tackle this school transport issue.  It was a challenge because this year thousands more people sought bus tickets than the previous year.  The Department has done a good job in contacting people.  I know that there were challenges in securing extra buses and drivers.  It was not acknowledged that the Minister cannot simply magically provide extra buses and drivers where they do not exist.  There was also a particular pressure caused by trying to get buses and drivers during the tourism season because other people used their buses for different jobs.  Unfortunately, there was some commentary throughout this process that sought to amplify the issue and problem.  That was mainly done for political gain by some parties but not everyone.  Rather than whipping up anger the time would have been better spent working with local communities and the Department to source buses.  Lots of people did that but not everyone, which is regrettable.  We will learn from the experience.</p></speech>

I say that because what started out as a fantastic initiative has caused a hell of a lot of difficulties and division in rural areas.

The initiative is fantastic but I, like many representatives here and every public representative, have had to deal with families who were in tears when telling me about trying to manage work and leave in time to collect their children because they could no longer rely on buses that they had availed of for years.  I must admit that I am pretty taken aback.</p> <p>The Minister spoke about effectiveness and sustainability.  When will we see the school transport report?  Will we see it by the end of this year?  I ask because we need notice; Bus &Eacute;ireann and its teams also deserve notice from the Department of Education early enough to allow them to plan ahead.</p> <p>We have fought for budget and there has been a budget allocation.  There are also challenges with capacity and Bus &Eacute;ireann needs early notice in order that it can manage capacity challenges.</p> <p>The school transport issues are hugely challenging in rural areas as they do not have public transport and infrastructure.  As the Minister will have seen here, Senator Lombard represents west Cork, I represent east Galway and County Roscommon, and Senator Garvey represents County Clare.  I refer to all of the Senators who are here to speak about school transport.  It is important, as has been noted, that when we consider this model for next year, we ensure it benefits families across Ireland.</p> <p>In terms of a driving career, we need to incentivise people, particularly those who live in rural areas, be it part-time farmers or party-time carers.  What can be done to incentivise those groups who live in rural areas to think about becoming bus drivers?  How can we incentivise them to think about having a Class B or Class D licence and a people carrier or minibus, and being able to sign for a PPQ with Bus &Eacute;ireann?  The Department needs to incentivise people and, along with Bus &Eacute;ireann, roll out an attractive package.  We need to ensure that there is better access to capacity and resources.  I ask for these things because I never want to hear again the stress and anxiety among people and families which was caused by the mayhem in bus transport provision and providing concessionary tickets.  It is more beneficial to have more transport in rural areas, and to have safer pick-up and drop-off zones around schools.  I found it very difficult to see the stress, anxiety and mayhem that occurred in the last couple of months.  </p></speech>

I have met her twice today as earlier I met her while we attended a committee.</p><p>I wish to start by discussing special education.  School transport is a huge issue and one that affects the lives of a great numbers of people.  School transport is even more important to families who have a child with special educational needs but it is mid-term break and there are still no places, which causes serious issues.  I wish to mention three cases - Innishannon to Cork, Ballinhassig to Cork, and Belgooly going to Cork.  These cases have been well flagged with Bus &Eacute;ireann but that company has made no response.</p><p>Earlier the Minister spoke about the dedicated email address provided to deal with requests.  My office staff sent me a text as she was speaking to inform me that they have never gotten a response from the dedicated address.  No response ever has been received.  We have emailed Bus &Eacute;ireann about these children and we cannot get a response for their parents.  Senator Dolan mentioned the stress caused.  When people have a special child and <font color="#242424">need that actual support but do not get responses, we have a big issue with that. </font><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have contacted the Minister's office about this issue.  We have a cohort of perhaps 35 children - I could probably name them - in west Cork who do not have a school bus place at the moment.  There are seven in Rossmore, 15 in Ballyhass, four in Nohoval, two in Dunderrow and others in Newcestown and Crossbarry.  I have parents ringing the office every week.  Every time school transport is mentioned in the Seanad they are listening in.  They call my office to find out what the story is, where they will get information and if and when the will get a school bus ticket.  An announcement made after the budget raised expectations and parents thought tickets were to be granted.  They do not know when, where or what is going to happen.  The mid-term break is approaching and I have no answer for them.  I cannot tell them to get appropriate transportation because there will be no school bus for them this year.</p><p>The majority of the parents have told me they made the application in April and went through the process like they do every year.  Some have said they did not get the link and others have said they did not tick the link, but the majority went through the application process in April.  This is a significant problem for us.  I am looking for clarity on this from the Minister.  What do I tell these parents?  Do I tell them there is no hope?  The majority of these children were on school buses last year.  Do I tell them to keep on trying and we might get there eventually?  The Hallowe'en mid-term is next week and we still do not have any light at the end of the tunnel with regard to this issue.</p><p>This is a significant problem and I do not have answers.  Senator Dolan and I, and other Senators, sought this hearing to find out what the pathway is.  The Minister might advise us of that.  Is there no hope for these children now?  Are we to say these tickets may come?  Where do we go with this issue?</p><p>There are other issues.  I have had bus companies contacting me to say they have bus capacity and could sort out the service but they lack direction from Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I believe there has been a complete breakdown of communication between Bus &Eacute;ireann and the parents involved.  I cannot speak for the Department.  We need to have a roadmap but we do not have one.  As other Senators have correctly stated, we need to have a policy in place that leaves no child behind.  At the moment we are leaving children behind, even children with special needs, which is terrible altogether.  What are we to tell these kids now?  Where is the roadmap?  Where does the Minister believe we should go?  Is this the end of the road for these children?  Must they wait until next year to try their luck?</p></speech>

We cannot put all of the blame on her, especially when her role requires her to deal with every single aspect of education and not just school transport.  The school transport section has let the Minister down and has been letting people in rural Ireland down for many years, not just this year.  Every single September for the past three years and since I got involved in politics, I have been plagued by people begging me to sort out school bus tickets.  They are getting no communication from the school transport section of the Department.  There is a serious issue and goes back long before the Minister was appointed.</p> <p>When free school transport was offered it was a brilliant idea.  Unfortunately, its roll-out, as the Minister will be aware and other Ministers have explained, has been disturbing, to say the least.  When I brought this matter up last week, I asked two specific questions, neither of which was answered by the Minister's officials.  I am aware the Minister does not write her own answers and I could not possibly expect her to, but the answer from her officials was insulting.  They did not answer the questions we asked.  As a result, we had to get the Minister into the Chamber today for an hour to try to get some real answers.  I asked two simple questions on the day.  The first was what the Department had done in preparation for implementing this great idea of providing free transport to increase the number of available bus drivers.  The second was whether there is a plan to do a recruitment drive for bus drivers.  Neither question was answered.  That is not the Minister's fault but it is not good enough for people who take the time to contact me or for me, having taken the time to raise the matter in the House.  The purpose of Commencement matters is to get answers to questions from Ministers in different Departments.</p> <p>There is no logic or cop-on in the school transport section.  Bus routes are often out of date and do not pass areas where students need to be picked up.  The Minister has been told the students who applied for their bus tickets in time all got their bus tickets and are all happy now.  Unfortunately, that is just not true.  I have lots of cases of students who applied for the bus ticket for the first time ever and got one, whereas students who have always paid for a ticket did not get one.  I am delighted for those students who got a ticket for the first time.  I am really happy for them because school transport should always have been free for everybody.  I have been asking for that for years having worked with school transport.  Unfortunately, that causes divisions and the last thing we need in rural communities is division.  We want to try to bring communities together.  There are inconsistencies in that regard.  I do not know who is responsible in the Department or the school transport section.  I cannot blame our local inspector in Bus &Eacute;ireann in Limerick and Clare because she has been doing stellar work trying to sort out drivers for buses because of the shortages.</p> <p>It is just not true, as the Minister has been told, that all students who applied for bus tickets on time got them.  That is not the case, unfortunately.  It is also not the case that all buses are full.  Students are being told they cannot get a bus ticket because the buses are full, yet the buses are being driven around half-empty.  I am not making this up.  That is a fact.  I have seen the buses myself.  Parents are also driving behind buses because one child got a ticket and a sibling did not, so the parents still have to drive their children to school.</p> <p>There are also issues with the rule that students must live a certain distance from their school.  We should remove the distance rule in the long term because until we have proper walking and cycling infrastructure, taking a bus is the next best option.  The limit is set at 2.4 miles, I believe.  That was grand 40 years ago when the rest of us could walk and cycle safely to school, but it is not an option now.  We must look at that distance barrier because it is prohibiting people who live too far from school or cannot walk or cycle safely to school from getting the school bus.</p> <p>I would like it if we did not have to continue pestering the Department of Education using the email for public representatives to try to get answers for parents basically because the parents are not getting answers themselves.  The email system has failed and is not working.  The facility is being centralised in Dublin and there is no longer an email or phone number available for Limerick.  Schools in Clare and Limerick used to have that.  When we eventually get through to Dublin, the people on the line do not have a clue what we are talking about because they have not received the email that was sent in.  There are lots of issues.</p> <p>I praise the Minister for introducing free school transport.  It is a brilliant idea.  Petrol and diesel prices are a big part of the reason people have applied for tickets who may never have applied before.  As a single parent, I remember when my son was younger I only needed him to get a lift home from school in the evenings.  I just did not have &euro;350 for a ticket and I could not get a half-price school ticket even though I could get him to school in the mornings.  There are lots of different issues, including legacy issues that arose long before the Minister's time.  I would love to work with the Minister on this.  I worked on modal shift with schools for 12 years full-time, including on school transport.  I worked well with bus drivers on turning off their engines.  Engine idling, or leaving engines running, is a major issue.  The bus drivers do not pay for the fuel.  The Department and the taxpayer pay for it.</p> <p>We need to do the basics for people.  They need to receive replies to emails and phone calls.  I do not know if the Department needs more staff or what is happening but it is not good enough at the moment.  It is not our job to follow up about every single bus ticket.  That is a waste of our time.  We have been doing that because we want to serve our constituents, but if the system was improved, it would free up our time and parents would be treated with the respect they deserve when they try to get their child a place on a school bus.</p></speech>

We could have another one-hour session on it.  I have parents crying down the phone to me.  Then, because of something I did, I may get them a transport service but I do not want to be the one who has to do that.  I want the system to work for everybody equally, not only for those who get on to politicians who know the best way to get things done is to harass the Department to get an issue sorted.</p> <p>Does the Minister have figures on the increase in the number of bus drivers or in the bus fleet?  That is also an issue.  Another issue is the 56-seater buses being driven round with only 20 pupils in them because there are not enough smaller buses.  That is a waste of fuel.  On small country roads, if there are not 56 kids to collect, it is crazy to have a 56-seater bus.</p> <p>I wish the Minister the best and I look forward to working with her on this issue.  It is brilliant that school transport is free.  If we addressed the distance rule, we could completely remove cars from the road, make our roads safer again and reduce costs and stress for parents.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not have a kid looking for a bus but even just dealing with all the parents and their stress has been stressful.  I cannot imagine what it is like for the people being left at the side of the road.  In my village of Inagh, we had 52 kids left in the rain on a Tuesday morning.  Nobody picked them up.  Nothing was communicated and nobody knew what was happening.  It took a good ten days for it to be resolved.  We need to do better.  There are also inconsistencies with the way the contractors get the money.  Some contractors pay their bus drivers very well and some are offering them less than minimum wage.  That is not going to encourage people to take up the jobs either.  There are many issues here.  Go n-&eacute;ireoidh leis an Aire leis an bhfadhb seo a r&eacute;iteach.

T&aacute;im ag glacadh na r&aacute;itis seo ar son mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir Warfield, nach bhfuil ar f&aacute;il anocht.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to address the Minister on these important statements, the reasons for which colleagues have outlined.  Every year, we have a situation where children and young people are tuned away from school transport because of a failure by the Government to recognise demand and invest in extra capacity.  A number of months ago, Sinn F&eacute;in called for 10,000 extra places to be funded and made available to help meet demand when parents across the State were getting notified that they had failed to secure a seat for their child on the local school bus.</p><p>Each and every year, the school transport scheme is significantly oversubscribed.  Instead of harnessing that demand, Government Deputies sit on their hands.  The Government has allowed the situation to repeat itself year after year.  F&aacute;inne f&iacute; at&aacute; i gceist leis seo<b>. </b>We need to stop this repetitive cycle.  This issue causes huge headaches and problems for parents who are trying to juggle their work commitments.  It gives Senator Garvey terrible anxiety, as she outlined very clearly.</p><p>School transport chaos is the new normal for so many families due to Government incompetence.  In the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, we have a situation where parents across the State are now faced with the reality of giving up work because of the mess. <b></b>In addition, we turn thousands of children away from a public transport option.  That is totally at odds with our climate ambitions.  It results in thousands of extra private car journeys to and from schools each and every day. </p><p>While a decision by Government to temporarily eliminate school transport fees for the 2022-2023 school year was welcome, it did nothing to address the capacity constraints.  The Government should have anticipated there would be increased demand.  More needs to be done going forward so that we are not having the same conversation once again next year.  For our part, Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly called for 10,000 extra seats to be added to the system.  We need to invest in new school buses and eliminate school transport fees.  By expanding the school transport scheme, we can cut transport emissions, reduce dangerous traffic congestion outside schools and provide parents and guardians with a convenient method of transport for their kids.  All this would be a win-win situation for parents and the environment.  I would, therefore, encourage the Minister and her colleague, the Minister for Transport, to use the time in the academic year to increase capacity to ensure as many children as possible can be accommodated going forward.  D&eacute;anann s&eacute; ciall, go huile agus go hioml&aacute;n, an cinneadh seo a ghlacadh.</p></speech>

I am delighted to speak on the school transport scheme today.  For so many families, not just those in this particular calendar year but going forward into the future, this will be transformative in how they carry on their days, especially working families and parents.</p> <p>Having a free school transport scheme will be transformational.  Parents will not have those difficulties of picking children up from and dropping them off at school.  It is really hard for anyone to stand up today in this House and diss this scheme.  Obviously, we all know there will always be teething problems with huge investment.  This is such a welcome measure.  I do not think one parent in the country will say it is not.  There have been teething problems and issues around the country.  On the whole, however, I think those issues have been resolved.</p> <p>We do not have a huge need for school transport in Dublin.  Unfortunately, school transport comes into the picture when it comes to children in special schools who have to be transferred to schools outside their catchment areas, which is a separate issue.  School transport exists in that setting in areas in the city, however.</p> <p>This scheme must be commended.  I cannot see a downside.  How families in rural Ireland live over the next decade will be completely different from how they are living now in terms of their daily morning and afternoon routines.  It will make life much easier for parents and families, not just for their purse but for their time.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#YY00500"><p>Senator Ahearn will not be here as far as I know.  The Minister is welcome to the Chamber.  I acknowledge, as I have previously, that this was a cost-of-living measure and the right thing to do.  I will read for the Minister an email I received this morning:</p> <blockquote> 	I desperately need a ticket please.  I find it unacceptable that children in desperate need of a ticket in order to access education are finding it so difficult to get them.  Thank you so much for your attention.  I look forward to hearing from you.  I cannot stress enough how much I need to get my daughter onto a school bus please. </blockquote> <p>That was from a parent who made a late application, in fairness, because that family bought a house and had only moved to the area.  The issue that parent faces is that they can see the bus going from Rosscahill to Oughterard and the bus is three quarters to half-full or half-empty, depending on which way one wants to look at it.  The seats are allocated, however.  Parents have the tickets and are not using them.  That is a frustration for parents.  How do we counteract that?  I do not know.</p><p>I have spoken to inspectors who, in fairness, are doing a tremendous job in trying to placate us with regard to reducing the number of parents and children affected.  As I said, however, parents still see a half-full or half-empty bus and they cannot get their child on board.  The inspectors have written out to parents without success to ask whether they can surrender and give up any tickets they are not using.</p><p>There are a number of solutions.  Obviously, the first solution is more buses and more drivers.  We know that has been a challenge.  It was suggested before that the prohibition on people aged over 70 driving a school bus could be looked at again.  is there any update on that?  It may be a matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  People aged over 70, who are fully fit and able, drive buses to bring the same children to football games or elsewhere but they cannot bring them to school.  That is one solution.</p><p>There is another solution.  From talking to Bus &Eacute;ireann staff on the ground, they do not know which children are not availing of the seats.  They cannot find out because of general data protection regulation, GDPR, and whatever else.  Surely, and perhaps this is not for this year but maybe into the future, there might be a possibility that a child could swipe and be registered as he or she enters the bus.  After a while, if a child is not using the ticket, we could say, &quot;Sorry Johnny, you are not using this.  We will give it to someone who can.&quot;  It would mean using technology to find out who is actually using a ticket and who has one in his or her back pocket in case it might be needed sometime during the month or whenever.  Unfortunately, that is happening, which is a pity because this is a right measure and a right move.  It is alleviating hardship for those who have had to pay in the past, but it is causing problems.</p><p>We should see what can be done  in the short term regarding providing additional routes. One example with which I have been dealing is that of children on the bus from Killane and Rosscahill into Oughterard.  There are other cases, however.  I cannot understand why there is no bus, for example, to the Educate Together school in Galway from Moycullen, but there are seats on other buses that will get students in proximity to that school.  We do not seem to be able to get that sorted.  There are issues and ongoing problems here.</p><p>I acknowledge the importance of the scheme and why it was brought in.  It is saving parents money but it is also causing frustration to those who see empty, half-empty or three quarter-empty buses onto which they cannot get their children.</p></speech>

Many of us deal with parents.  Senators Garvey and Lombard eloquently touched upon the emotions involved.  The raw emotion of students and their families impacts on us as well.  I am dealing with the case of 15 students from Ballinhassig who are travelling to Kinsale without a bus ticket.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The bottom line relates to the human emotion of frustration and the lack of certainty and clarity.  I commend the Minister on fighting for and achieving in the budget the waiver of fees and the increase in the number of places.  Sinn F&eacute;in talks about how the Government did not plan.  That is the new Sinn F&eacute;in mantra for everything, including in regard to the refugee crisis, for which, of course, the Government could not prepare.  I challenge Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile in that respect.  How could the Government have prepared for 100,000 refugees to come into the country at the drop of a hat?  In this case, 21,000 additional places have been given, which is a positive.</p><p>Opposition Senators have been listening to this debate.  A total of 121,000 students have availed of the scheme, including 15,500 special needs students.  Senator Garvey is correct; we could spend an entire month debating special educational needs in this House and I would love if we could do that because the issue is in need of reform.  To be fair to the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister, there is a strong presence in the Department of Education.  A total of &euro;289 million was given to the scheme in 2021.  What we need to see is a roadmap to avoid the frustration, annoyance and anger of parents.</p><p>This is not a political issue.  The Minister was an educator and, like me, she understands the importance of a happy child and a happy parent in a school environment, and on the continuum of the provision of education.  To those who criticise the scheme, let us look at what we have achieved in the additional places and the waiver of the fee, but we should accept that we can improve the scheme.  It is about talking to the local bus inspector, the school community being kept informed and the certainty and clarity.</p><p>I thank Senators McGahon, Lombard and Dolan for their contributions on our side of the House.  They have been strong in advocating on this issue.  All of us on this side who have raised the matter are doing so in a purely political atmosphere here in the Seanad because it is our forum, but we are trying to achieve, in consultation and agreement with the Minister, a roadmap and a pathway for school places on buses for students and children.  I see my nieces and nephews going to school and recognise that, in some cases, not all students avail of their seats on the bus even though they have been allocated them.  I would like to see the statistics on this.  Additional tickets have been allocated, but how many students are not taking their seat on the bus or availing of it, and can we do something in that regard?  It is important to recognise there are still spaces on the buses.  Senator Kyne referred to the over-70s.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  Representatives of the bus and coach industry appeared before us last week and we raised the matter of bus drivers over the age of 70.  As for the free seats that are not being taken up on buses, is there a mechanism whereby we can allow that seat to be availed of by students who cannot get one?</p><p>I thank the Minister for being here.  She has my full support in tackling this issue.  It is an important one.  The mid-term break next week will give some relief to families and students, but in the winter months I hope we can bring certainty.  I will share my remaining time with Senator Carrigy.</p></speech>

I am Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Autism and that is an issue we have highlighted.  We passed a resolution at yesterday's meeting and will issue a report to both Houses.  The funding has been put there by the Government for the programme, and we just want schools and principals to take up the scheme and ensure that all children will be able to avail of the school-based programme next year.</p> <p>Many of the points I had intended to make have been made.  I spoke on the previous occasion about the number of issues in schools in Longford, some of which have been sorted while others have not been sorted.  We do not even have a point of contact within Bus &Eacute;ireann or the Department to whom we can speak to identify these local issues and ensure they are sorted out.  That is a source of much of the frustration we have as public representatives.</p> <p>The issue of over-70s bus drivers was mentioned.  To give an example, my uncle owns a bus company.  He is over 70 years of age.  He cannot drive a bus from Ballinalee, where I live, to a fine community school about 11 miles away, but he can drive it from the school to Belfast, Cork, Dublin or Galway and bring the same students on the bus to a football match, a basketball match or whatever.  He cannot bring them to school, however, because the contract is with the school transport office.  That needs to be looked at.  He is medically fit to drive that bus anywhere in Ireland but he cannot drive it to the school.  That should not be used as an issue and it should be dealt with.</p> <p>I also raised the point about a 59-seater bus in respect of a route with a 53-seater contract.  A 59-seater bus that is parked in a yard could travel on that route and bring an additional six kids, but that will not or cannot be changed.  These are the little issues that could be resolved if we had points of contact, and they need to be looked at.</p> <p>As Senator Buttimer noted, on every route in the country, there are families who have been allocated tickets and have probably never used the seat so far this term.  We need to consider some sort of a system whereby, after a certain period, if that ticket has not been used, it should be withdrawn and allocated to a family who need it.  This issue applies to every route going to every school in the country.  A number of seats have never been used, yet there are people standing on the side of the road or being brought by their parents.</p> <p>I wished only to highlight those issues.  They apply in particular to the schools in Moyne and Ballymahon.  We should have a point of contact within the school transport office, because it does not reply, to which we could highlight these issues and point them out.  Where there are simple solutions, let us use them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1629" speakername="Garret Ahearn" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#ZZ00300"><p>To pick up on that point, it is infuriating given there are obvious, simple solutions that do not seem to be listened to when we put them forward.  This was well intended, but a lot of the problems we are talking about have been caused by us, the Government, and that is just a fact.  Everyone who has been in that situation and who has been left without a seat on the bus is well aware that because it was made free for everyone and, therefore, everyone decided they were going to take it, that even included people who did not necessarily need it.  Because of the announcement in the budget, people thought all of this was going to be resolved, but it has not been resolved and that is just a fact.  A certain number of people now take the bus and they are very grateful for that.  Their way of life has gone back to normal through being able to get on a bus and go to work and not having to make changes on the back of it.  However, there are still people who cannot get on a bus.</p> <p>As recently as today, I received an email from the principal of a school in Cahir, who told me that even kids who attend the autism spectrum disorder class in his school are still not sure when their bus is going to be available.  The school has parents who bring children from Clonmel and Kilsheelan every day, and one pupil who is meant to come from Fethard has been unable to come because no transport is available for him.  The principal stated the school has been waiting eight weeks into the school year, with Hallowe'en next Monday, and that notwithstanding all the problems with school transport this year, children are still unable to attend school, particularly those with additional educational needs.  He went on to write that the school has not heard final confirmation of when the service is to start and underlined that that is not acceptable.  The fact that kids with additional educational needs cannot get to school is just unacceptable.  The principal keeps trying to contact the Department of Education and keeps coming to us looking for information on how we can resolve these problems.  If we cannot resolve these ones, what are we at?</p> <p>I recognise that much has been done over recent weeks, but we are eight weeks in and we are still getting emails like this about cases.  I am sure other Senators are in the same position.  Vulnerable people, at the very least, need to be supported to get an education.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#AAA00100"><p>I once again thank Senators for the opportunity to update the House on school transport for the current school year.  I will reiterate what I outlined at the outset, which is that 126,000 tickets have been issued to applicants for the 2022-23 school year under the main scheme alone.  At the start of the last school year, approximately 103,600 children were being carried on mainstream school transport services and, therefore, in the region of 22,400 additional places have been created.  All eligible pupils who applied on time this year have been facilitated on a service for the 2022-23 school year.  There has been an increase in the number of tickets allocated across all counties, with an increase of more than 18% in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils and an increase of more than 27% in the number of concessionary tickets issued to pupils when compared with the start of the 2021-22 school year.</p> <p>While the temporary waiving of fees has led to an unprecedented expansion of the scheme with many more eligible and concessionary applicants receiving tickets than ever before, I acknowledge that the increase in the number of applications has led to frustration over delays.  However, it is important to note that the normal eligibility criteria for the scheme still apply and that tickets continue to be allocated in line with these criteria.  As I said previously, there has been an unprecedented increase in applications from families whose children are eligible for school transport this year.  These children and young people must be prioritised as dictated by the scheme.  I am aware that this had led to a particular frustration this year as some families whose children attend their third, fourth or even fifth closest school or who live within the distance limits and who have held tickets previously did not receive one.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is continuing to assess options to provide transport to pupils who held concessionary tickets in previous years where temporary additional capacity is available to do so.  It is again important to stress that constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may mean that it takes some extra time to explore solutions to providing this additional capacity for those who did not meet the eligibility criteria.</p> <p>As I mentioned, the Department is conducting a review of the school transport scheme.  Wider considerations relating to the operation of the scheme are currently taking place in this phase of the review.  As Senators will be aware, this review is long overdue and I am pleased that, as Minister, I initiated it.  As part of the current phase of the review, the technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation, including running a public survey for parents, guardians and students who use the service and, perhaps more important, for those who do not use the service but would like to.  These engagements have yielded extensive data for consideration.  The group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives, other Departments and our European counterparts.  While work on the review was somewhat impacted by challenges posed by the pandemic and the current conflict in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the final phases of the review will be completed shortly with recommendations to issue on the future operation of the Department's school transport scheme.  The steering group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.</p> <p>I will conclude by again acknowledging that, when school transport fees were waived, which was a cost-of-living measure as Senators have acknowledged, it was clear that this was for those who met the eligibility criteria.  It behoves everyone within this Chamber and elsewhere to acknowledge that there have always been eligibility criteria.  There are distance limits of 3.2 km from the nearest primary school and 4.8 km from the nearest or next nearest post-primary school.  Those are the criteria.  I am not for one minute suggesting that everything about the existing criteria or the existing operation is perfect.  It is for that reason that I took the decision to undertake a root-and-branch review of the entire school transport system.  This was not before time.  There were opportunities previously but they were not taken.  As I have articulated, that review is ongoing.  Let us be clear that this waiver of school transport fees was introduced for those who met the eligibility criteria.  </p> <p>Let us also concede that a significant number of additional tickets have been provided for.  The Senators all represent different areas and come from different backgrounds.  In County Galway alone, 8,352 tickets were issued last year; this year, 10,372 have been issued.  In County Kildare, 4,607 tickets were issued last year and 5,699 this year.  In County Cork, there were 14,047 last year and 16,782 this year.  In County Clare, there were 3,052 issued last year and in excess of 3,771 have been issued this year.  This time last year, 103,6000 tickets had been issued and 126,000 tickets have been issued so far this year.  This represents an increase of 22% in the number of tickets issued.  It must not be forgotten that there has also been an increase of 18% in the number of concessionary tickets, which is far in excess of the 10,000 Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's party suggested should be catered for.  </p> <p>The Senator specifically referenced special education.  Children with special educational needs are eligible to apply for the transport scheme at any point in the year.  There is no particular cut-off point.  At this point, 4,775 new applications are being provided for and there are 17,600 places for children with special educational needs, SEN, in total.  This represents an increase of more than 2,000.  Because applications can arrive at any point in the year, there can at times be additional difficulties in sourcing transport where there is not capacity.  For that reason, grants are made available in the interim until bus transport can be provided.  There are also issues in recruiting personnel to support the students as they travel on the bus.  However, it is important to say that students with special educational needs can apply for school transport at any point.</p> <p>I acknowledge the comments regarding summer provision.  I note the Senator's particular interest in this area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and myself were pleased to announce that &euro;40 million for children with SEN and children at risk of educational disadvantage.  Work is ongoing to see how this can be broadened to ensure the greatest number of schools are supported in offering this provision to the maximum number of students.</p> <p>I acknowledge the other points the Senator raised regarding bus drivers and the cut-off point at 70 years of age.  That is a matter for consideration by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The company informed us that it keeps this under continuous review but that is its current cut-off point.  There will always be a particularly stringent threshold when transporting children but this is being kept under review.</p> <p>I acknowledge and appreciate Senators' interest in, and ongoing commitment to, these issues.  In the broadest context, it is important to say that we have seen a significant increase in the number of tickets being made available.  There has been an increase of more than 22% in the number of tickets for mainstream transport and an increase of 18% in the number of concessionary tickets while more than 2,000 additional places have been provided for those with SEN.  The work continues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1684" speakername="Mark Wall" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#BBB00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p> <p>I welcome the Minister for Social Protection to the House to debate what we feel is an important and necessary change to the social protection system.  I want to heartily welcome some visitors to the Gallery: Damien Peelo, chief executive officer of Treoir, the national federation for services for unmarried parents and their children, and some of his staff; and Johnny O'Meara and Maria Doyle, from two families affected by the situation we are debating.  I wish to share time with my colleague, Senator Hoey.  </p> <p>There can be no doubt that the concept of family has changed and evolved in recent years in this country.  Marriage rates are declining and many couples choose to build a life in a home together before considering marriage.  The 2016 census showed the number of couples choosing to cohabit is increasing.  There were 152,302 cohabiting couples from that census, an increase of 6% on the 2011 census.  We can anticipate this figure will rise again when the 2022 census report is published.  Against this changing social landscape of households, the Labour Party believe changes must be made to legislation to reflect the modern shape of our country.  As a proud nation, we should take a compassionate approach to all families and provide support when it is needed most at some of the darkest hours for some families.  Simply put, we must treat all our citizens fairly and equally.</p> <p>Eligibility for some social welfare payments for cohabiting couples is in place.  There is a comprehensive definition of "cohabiting couples" in legislation and it is used for payments such as jobseeker's allowance and carer's allowance.  This leaves an unexplained and huge gap in our social protection system for those bereaved and cohabiting, and for their families. It is time to act and change this.  If a partner in a cohabiting couple dies, the surviving partner has no entitlement to a widow or widower's contributory pension from the Department of Social Protection, even where the couple has been working for a considerable time and paying taxes.  This is wrong and discriminates against the surviving partner and their family.  It potentially discriminates further in more than 50% of these cases as the family will lose out on an &euro;8,000 bereavement grant where children are involved.</p> <p>This unacceptable outcome was brought to our attention in the Labour Party by Deputy Alan Kelly and his constituent, Johnny O'Meara.   As I have said, Johnny joins us tonight in the Visitors Gallery.  Johnny lost his beloved wife, Michelle, in January 2021.  In the recent High Court case Johnny took against the Minister for Social Protection, Ireland and the Attorney General, the judge described Johnny and his family as being "part of a loving family in the sense in which the term 'family' is generally understood in our society".  The judge described the role of the Oireachtas in the delicate exercise of decision-making in respect of finite funds, going on to say that making such decisions "is not a role which this Court can legitimately play".  He said this was a matter for the Oireachtas and that is why we are here tonight.  The State failed Johnny and his children when they needed it most and that must change.  That was wrong then, is wrong now and must be changed to assist families like Johnny's at their time of need. </p> <p>Over a long period, more and more examples of how this legislation has affected surviving partners over the years have been brought to our attention.  Colleagues in the House will bring forward other heartbreaking stories but I will reference another widower typical of the many people who have contacted me in the past year, particularly in the past couple of weeks.  This man lived with his partner for more than 20 years.  They lived happily together until his partner was diagnosed with a cancer a few years ago.  During her recovery period, the couple began to plan for a wedding both of them wanted and had dreamed of.  However, his partner's disease, as in so many unfortunate cases, came back and in the short time she survived, they were unable to give the State the three months' notice required for the State papers.  This man told me it was his wife he lost that day as they got to pass their church vows in the hospital where she was to die a day or so later.  Unfortunately for him, he met the same obstacles when he inquired about a widower's pension as Johnny and many others have met.  I could give many other examples.  </p> <p>We have been sent the amendment tabled by Government to effectively kick this important matter down the road for another year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We find it unacceptable that the Government has still not started a comprehensive consideration of the implications of this Bill, considering it was published over a year ago.  I and colleagues can refer to many debates and questions on this matter over the last number of years.  We will of course wait to hear the Minister's comments but I would ask her to consider this Bill as part of the forthcoming social welfare Bill.  I ask her to ensure amendments are put down, where possible, to address this important matter.  If it is not possible to do that in that timeframe, I ask her to put in place interim measures through the community welfare service, for example, to deal with this matter and provide for the many cases that colleagues across both Houses are dealing with at this time, while any further consideration is under way.  For the O'Meara family and thousands of others like them, the Government needs to act.  Supports must be put in place to help those who need State help, particularly at what can be one of their most heartbreaking times and hours of need.</p></speech>

I echo Senator Wall's thanks and welcome for the people in the Gallery.  Maria, Johnny and Damien gave us an excellent briefing earlier and everyone has given so much of their personal time and experience to this issue.  This is an issue that we cannot talk about in the abstract, up here in the legislative sky.  These are real people, real families and real children who have been touched by tragedy, loss and death and are, quite frankly, being punished by this Government and by successive Governments for not being married.  I think that is wrong and we in the Labour Party think that is wrong.</p><p>We are coming to the Government with legislation to deal with this issue.  We are taking the advice of Mr. Justice Heslin, who said this can be dealt with legislatively.  If the Minister is unable to accept this legislation today, there are alternative routes she can take through the social welfare protection Bill and through the community welfare service.  We have done this before in Ireland, where we have recognised that there is a constitutional problem and we have found a way to deal with it before changing the Constitution.  We did this with marriage equality.  We brought in civil partnerships.  It was a legislative framework we were able to use in order to deal with the issue and, later, we went to the people and we all saw how that worked out.  There are ways this can be dealt with.  We have laid out multiple ways today.  I want to hear what the Minister has to say because this is not just a piece of legislation.  We have offered a couple of solutions if she is interested in following through on any of them.</p><p>I will take a moment to reflect on what has happened in the past couple of weeks, particularly with regard to the case Johnny O'Meara took.  The Labour Party and my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, were working on this legislation before that court case but it has driven home exactly what it is we are doing.  Johnny O'Meara was with his partner Michelle for 20 years.  She had an untimely death.  They had three children together.  In the court, Mr. Justice Heslin recognised that Johnny and Michelle and their children had been a loving family, that they were a family, but because of our archaic system and laws and their interpretation of what a family is, they could not be recognised as such when Johnny sought what was not an enormous request.  I think anyone would agree with that.  All he wanted was a bereavement grant of &euro;8,000 and a widow and widower's pension; something to help support the family unit and children.  There are often children in these cases who are being punished.  It is State-sanctioned punishment because of decisions their parents made.  Their parents should not be forced into a decision to get married.  I often hear people, particularly among my peers and colleagues, saying they have no interest in marriage and are just doing it for tax purposes or some other reason.  That is not how we should treat something like this.  We should not be forcing people into a marriage, if that is not what they want to do.  This piece of paper should not define what their family unit is.  It should not define who they are or what their family unit is.  It is a throwback.</p><p>I keep thinking about how archaic this feels.  It feels like something that belongs in our past, not something that belongs in the Ireland we have today in 2022.  We have had enormous social change.  We have been a beacon across the world for progressive social change and yet we have this farcical interpretation of what a family is.  We have decided that a family is based on this legal sacrament.  It came from a sacrament.  We have decided that a family is only defined based on that and not based on the loving and bonded unit people create for themselves.  It is so unprogressive.  It does not make sense to me in a country where we recognise marriage equality and we have trans rights and all of these things and people can do what they want with their bodies.  However, families cannot be recognised because they have not participated in the sacrament of marriage.  That is wrong.  We have a system where the family unit is recognised and couples are jointly assessed for various social welfare benefits.  They go in and are assessed as a unit and as a cohabiting couple.  A lot of the people we are talking about here have had lifelong commitments to each other.  The people I have spoken to have been together for 38 years, over 20 years, 32 years and 22 years.  Those are significant amounts of time for people to have spent together.  They are life partners.  At the end of that, if one of the partners passes away, they are left with this legal mess.  There is no reason for that legal mess to exist.  As I have said, we have put forward legislation that can deal with that and there are other ways it can be dealt with as well.</p><p>When we were talking earlier, we had conversations about what this means for families.  I might take a moment, if the Acting Chair will indulge me, to talk about some of the people who have spoken to me about their families and the family unit they have created over time.  One person said:</p> <blockquote> 	My partner and I of over 20 years jointly own our own home.  As cohabiting couples do not have the same rights in regard to property inheritance tax, we find ourselves forced to marry as we are unable to afford the 33% inheritance tax bill we [c]ould incur in the event of one of us passing away.  We find it confusing and insulting that we do not have a right to inherit our own home.  This law is unfair and discriminatory and needs to be changed.  We should have the right to choose whether or not we wish to marry and anything else is an infringement on our rights as citizens of this country. </blockquote> <p>For a country that has had such a strong campaign around choice in lots of different ways over the past few years, forcing people to make the choice to get married in order to be able to avail of certain benefits seems anathema to that.  Another person spoke to me whose partner recently passed.  They had no idea they would not be entitled to the widow's pension.  They were horrified they had no access to it.  This person has three children and they did not know why.  I spoke to the person on the phone and they were baffled.  They just do not understand why the family unit that they and their partner had created, the loving family unit they had set up, was not entitled to this pension.  They had a home, three kids, a dog and all those things.  They had built a life together, the life they dreamed of having, and they just do not understand why that life is not recognised.  It is wrong that that life is not recognised.  It is wrong that that family unit is not recognised and it is wrong that there is a State-sanctioned punishment of that family unit.  I will keep saying that because I think that is what it is. </p><p>I do not want to get overly emotional about this.  A lot of us have spoken to people about this and it is a difficult topic.  When people come to us who are affected by not being able to get a bereavement grant or a widow's or widower's pension, it is because they have lost their life partner.  They have lost someone they love.  They have lost a father or mother to their children.  They have lost the person they had created a life with.  For all other intents and purposes they are a family, except when it comes to this small State support and a basic recognition of their family unit.  It is important that we think about the message we are sending today.  By kicking this down the line, what are we saying to these families?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What are we saying to the families here today about the value of their family unit and the value of the life that they led with that partner who is no longer here?  I think it is really important that we think about what we are saying to them.  It is not good enough to tell those families that because they are missing a marriage certificate - a piece of paper - they are somehow lacking in something as a family.  Some people I have spoken to are more of a family than any of the other families I have dealt with.  They are more committed to each other, they have created a life together and they have shown so much love and strength in having to fight this.  I want to commend Johnny on the work that he has done, and on taking that case and really putting it to the Government.  The judge said that this can be dealt with legislatively.  I am asking the Minister to outline to us how she is going to deal with it legislatively.<br/><br/>If Members will indulge me, I will tell one more story of a woman who spoke to me.  She stated:</p><blockquote>	My partner of 32 years passed away in April [2022].  We had 3 daughters together and [I could not believe] I had no access to a widow&rsquo;s pension and no rights when it came to settling his estate.  [I am devastated].  This is so wrong and something should be done. </blockquote><p>We are asking the Minister, on behalf of many of those families and couples, to do something.</p></speech>

It is really difficult to bring any sort of case against the State, and it takes a lot of grit and determination.  I am glad that Johnny and his family have done so and I am glad the Labour Party has brought this Bill forward.  However, we must remember that the Minister is not shutting down the Bill or not accepting it.  She just needs a bit more time to put in train the different legislative changes.  In Fianna F&aacute;il, we very much welcome the debate but we also welcome the Minister's proposal for a timed amendment to the Bill being discussed today.  A timed amendment will allow for 12 months for, among other things:</p> <blockquote> 	... a comprehensive consideration of the implications of the Bill through engagement and consultation with other relevant Departments and the Attorney General and an examination and response to the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality and its recommendations, including any proposals for Constitutional reform. </blockquote> <p>It is important to note that the policy and legislative implications relating to the recognition of the status of cohabiting couples requires a whole-of-government response, including consideration of the output of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality and the recent High Court decision in Johnny's case.  This matter obviously has to be considered thoroughly.</p><p>I know that my colleague Senator Hoey raised questions about the idea of marriage and entering into a civil partnership.  As a solicitor by trade, I often find when I meet clients that they just do not understand all the rights and obligations that come with being in a marriage or even in a cohabiting relationship.  Many rights stem from such relationships.  Obviously, those rights do not include inheritance rights, the right to a widow's pension or the bereavement grant.  I fully support cohabiting couples getting those rights down the line.  There is legislation giving cohabiting couples certain rights.  Those rights do not extend just to what Johnny looked for and fought for.  That is not to say that he does not have the support of this House and will not get that support.</p><p>I cannot say how many people I have met who might have married in the 1970s or 1980s but were with other partners for 30 to 40 years and got nothing at the end of it.  I have advised many people to divorce their first spouse and marry their current partner.  People are so fearful of that.  The idea that out of sight is out of mind is a huge part of it.  I think people do not really understand all the repercussions of staying married to a person and not marrying someone else.  The idea of marriage was mentioned.  Is it still a sacrament?  I am not a religious person.  It is not a sacrament for me.  When I entered into a legal contract with my husband, I understood all the rights and obligations that stemmed from that.  From the State's point of view, we might need to have an education campaign for people who are in these limbo situations where they are married but have been with other partners for years, and do not really know what will happen to their partners from a financial perspective when they pass away.  Many people have been with their partners for 30 or 40 years, but have not divorced their first spouse.  They do not leave a will and the first spouse has an automatic entitlement to two thirds of the estate, which is their legal right.  People really do not know that when they decide to move on.  I think the State has an obligation to educate people on the rights and obligations of entering into a marriage, because people really do not know the facts, particularly those who might have married years ago and do not have the same level of education.</p><p>I am delighted we are debating this Bill in the House today.  It is really important.  I will support the Government's amendment to allow for 12 months to consider the implications of the Bill.  Regardless of whether the Minister decides to extend the provisions of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 or to take on this Bill verbatim, and regardless of whether the Department decides to take this on matter on a cross-party basis, there is obviously a huge body of work to be done.  It is not as simple as making one stroke of the pen.  The issue cuts across many Departments.  There is also a body of work to be done to educate people on their rights and obligations.  I feel strongly about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.288" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#DDD00300"><p>I thank the Labour Party for its work on progressing this Bill and for providing the House with an opportunity to discuss this important matter today.  I want to acknowledge Johnny, Maria and others in the Visitors Gallery.  At the core of this issue is human loss.  I know there are many cases of personal pain which are known to Senators across the House.  Senator Wall was in touch with me directly last week on this matter.  I fully accept the spirit in which this Bill is being brought forward in.  I know the motivation behind the Bill is the very sad case of Johnny O'Meara who lost his long-term partner, and the mother of his three children, Michelle.  Unfortunately, Johnny did not satisfy the eligibility requirements for the widower's contributory pension on the grounds that surviving cohabitant partners are not eligible for the payment under the current law.  I have huge sympathy for Johnny O'Meara and the tragic circumstances of this case, but the issue I face as Minister is that this is an area which has much wider implications than those pertaining to the Department of Social Protection.</p> <p>When you get married or enter a civil partnership, that confers certain legal rights, for example in relation to inheritance or property law.  There are also certain tax reliefs for married couples.  There are issues here which go far beyond the Department of Social Protection.  For that reason, I believe it is important that this issue is considered holistically across government in consultation with other Departments and with the Attorney General.  In addition, the citizens' assembly has made some recommendations in this area, and those issues are currently being considered by the Joint Committee on Gender Equality.  I think it would be very useful for this Bill to be referred to that committee so that it can be considered in detail as part of the broader piece of work it is undertaking.  While I am not opposing the Bill today, I stress that this matter needs to be given detailed consideration.  Indeed, there might be a need for constitutional reform in this area, which is something the Oireachtas committee is examining.  For these reasons, I have tabled a timed amendment to provide time for that work to be carried out.</p> <p>For the benefit of the House, I will go through some of these issues in greater detail now.  The widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension is paid to the husband, wife or civil partner of a deceased person.  For the purposes of my remarks today, I will use the phrase "widow's contributory pension" when referring to this pension.  The widow's contributory pension is a weekly pension, available to those who satisfy the necessary PRSI contribution conditions, either on their own record or on that of the deceased spouse, subject to certain criteria.  Surviving cohabitants are ineligible for the payment.  The Government recognises that this issue is important for many people who find themselves in a similar position to the O'Meara family.  However, as I have said, it is an issue that is wider than the social welfare code and deserves to be considered in the round.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Heather Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The legal context governing relationships such as marriage is broader than the social protection system.  Marriage and civil partnership are regulated by the Minister for Justice and are provided for in various civil partnership, marriage and family law Acts.  Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties distinct from those between cohabiting couples.  Widows, widowers and surviving civil partners, who become bereaved, therefore lose someone who had legal duties towards them, and the social welfare code recognises this by providing a pension to them, subject to certain conditions.  Where the legal framework changes, the social welfare code is examined for appropriate changes and so it was that the widows' contributory pension was expanded to include widowers in 1994, surviving civil partners in 2010 and same-sex surviving spouses after the passing of the marriage equality referendum in 2015.</p><p>Changes on the basis suggested in the Bill would have the effect of expanding the rights of cohabiting couples beyond those currently regulated under the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, where property rights and financial reliefs are subject to an application to a court in certain circumstances, such as during the lifetime of the other party to the relationship, and where financial dependence is established.  While a surviving cohabitant can make an application to the court to seek provision from the estate of a deceased cohabitant, this is in limited circumstances.  Were these amendments to be introduced, there would be significant policy and operational changes required in implementing the changes to facilitate surviving cohabitants, which would require extensive consultation and interdepartmental co-operation.  Therefore, any changes to the social welfare code would require consideration of existing legislation and consultation with other Departments and the Attorney General.</p><p>In the programme for Government, we committed to responding to the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.  The assembly issued its report and made a series of recommendations in June 2021.  As part of our response to those recommendations, the Government established a Joint Committee on Gender Equality.  The joint committee is currently working hard at considering the citizens' assembly report, including issues around the status of the non-marital family.  These include complex constitutional and family law matters.  The joint committee issued its interim report on constitutional change in July 2022.  This report recommends that Article 41 of the Constitution be amended so that it would protect family life, with the protection afforded to the family not limited to the marital family.  The joint committee is expected to issue its final report by the end of the year.  Following this, the Government and the Oireachtas should be allowed time for a holistic and careful consideration of the committee's findings, and any subsequent necessary legislation or possible constitutional amendments that may be required.  Out of respect to that process, changes to the social welfare code should not be made in isolation.  </p><p>While accepting the spirit in which this Bill is being brought forward, there are number of technical difficulties with the Bill in its present form.  The Bill, as drafted, adds the term "surviving cohabitant" to the Act wherever the terms widow, widower, or surviving civil partner appear without considering how this would operate in practice.  For example, the definition of "surviving cohabitant" is "a cohabitant who was a cohabitant with a deceased cohabitant at the date of the death".  However, no other components of the relationship required to establish this status are included in the Bill.  There is no requirement to be in a committed or intimate relationship or to have been in such a relationship for any length of time.  The Bill, as drafted, introduces rights for cohabitants to the widows contributory pension but does not contextualise these rights when compared to marital spouses' rights.  This could lead to situations of potential conflict and confusion between marital spouses' rights and cohabitants' rights.  The current rights enjoyed by a marital spouse include that these rights continue if the marriage is dissolved and the spouse remains unmarried or does not cohabit with another person.  In some cases, providing rights for cohabitants could result in the diminution of the rights of marital spouses and there are concerns that this would be in conflict with Article 41 of the Constitution.</p><p>The Bill, as drafted, is also silent on the impact of this proposed change on other areas of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, which is the principal Act, leading to an inconsistent position in relation to other contingent benefits such as death benefit, widowed parent grant or the widows non-contributory pension.  l am advised that there are up to 400 references to "widow" in the Act, which would require review in light of the proposed change.  </p><p>As I said, while the Government is not opposing the Bill this evening, we are calling for time to consider the many complex matters that need to be addressed before the Bill proceeds.  I want to be absolutely clear that we are very concerned with the position grieving families find themselves in and wish to highlight the supports available to those who do not qualify for the widows contributory pension.  A surviving cohabitant who was not married to their deceased former partner may be entitled to other weekly social welfare payments if he or she has an income need.  Child benefit is also payable to all persons with dependent children, regardless of household income, contribution record or category and is financed from general taxation.  For those who are suffering a terrible loss, there is no difference in that pain if they are married or not.  However, for the reasons I have outlined, this is not a straightforward issue and is much wider than the social protection code.  The Government seeks to defer consideration of this Bill for 12 months, to allow for it to be thoroughly assessed in the wider legal context and in light of the impending recommendations from the Joint Committee on Gender Equality.</p><p>I believe this time will provide the Government and Members of this House an opportunity to consider the matter in a holistic and integrated manner and to avoid any unintended consequences of implementing the measure at this time.  I look forward to further constructive debate on this issue, while being mindful of the overarching aim to protect those who are bereaved as best we can.  I thank the Senators for bringing forward the Bill and all the Senators who have highlighted how important it is for surviving cohabitants to be supported at the time of bereavement.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Wall and the Labour Party on this Bill.  I apologise that I missed the briefing by Treoir but I commend it on its great work from which we have all benefited as Members of the House.</p> <p>What was said in the Minister's statement is very true.  This debate is about human loss and about grieving.  Those of us who have been in relationships and who have met cohabiting couples constituency offices know that grief has no boundaries.  It does not matter whether a person is married or not, the pain and the hurt is still the same.  That is why this Bill is very important.  I am hugely conscious that my words do not betray the support we, as a State, need to give to cohabiting couples.  I welcome the debate and the fact the Minister is not opposing the Bill.  I recognise she has tabled an amendment and I understand the rational behind it.</p> <p>I have had the pleasure of knowing the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, for nearly 15 years and she is a very compassionate, progressive and understanding Minister of her Department.  She does not just take the advice of civil servants or officials but she is her own person.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why I very much welcome what she said following on from the report of the Citizens' Assembly and what Senator Ardagh said about the Joint Committee on Gender Equality and the need for all of us to approach this debate in a non-political way and bring about change and the result sought in the this Private Members' Bill.  That is positive.</p><p>This is about providing support and recognising that the concept of family has changed.  We are debating real people and real-life experiences.  We have made significant legislative advances over the years in the areas of divorce, civil partnership, tax breaks and changes in Finance Acts and marriage equality.  I have from the graciousness of the Irish people in voting "Yes".  I can wear my wedding ring and celebrate my union with my husband thanks to the Irish people.</p><p>I hope we can take from tonight the need to ensure the scaffolding the Minister spoke about is built into the Government's response.  I believe a referendum is needed to bring constitutional change.  We can argue the minutiae of legal advice but when we consider what Governments have done over the years on marriage equality and other issues, that took referendums of the people.</p><p>This is about us as a society and a nation and the Bill reflects that.  Society is ahead of us.  We as legislators and a country are playing catch-up.  Society has changed, evolved and moved on and relationships and the nature of relationships have changed.  I hate the word "cohabiting".  These couples are living together because they want to and are in love.  Their relationship is no different from that of the man and woman or the two men or two women married, except legally in the eyes of the State.  I have sat in my constituency office with surviving partners and they and I are at a loss.  I am bereft when I see the huge loss they have experienced and that the State does not put its arm around them in the way it should.  </p><p>I know some will cynically say the amendment will kick this further down the road.  I hope it does not do that.  I do not want that and in her very good speech, Senator Ardagh, who is a solicitor, outlined cases she deals with and the advice she gives people.</p><p>This is about ensuring the State does the right thing.  I take great hope and solace from the Minister&rsquo;s speech and the language she used regarding constitutional reform.  This is something we need to do.  In her final contribution, the Minister recognises the pain and hurt and the need for action.  </p><p>It is important that we recognise that this is about people and the children and partner who are left behind.  It is about marrying grief with the need for real support.  I hate the phrases &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo;, &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; and &ldquo;ineligible for benefit or payment&rdquo;, which we sometimes read in replies to Commencement matters or in replies to Deputies' parliamentary questions.  I know the Minister is a genuine person.  We have had a very good debate tonight so far and I believe there is consensus among us all that we need to see change.  I hope that we will have that.</p><p>I thank Senator Wall for introducing this Bill.  I hope we can find a way forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.293" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#FFF00200"><p>I extend my deepest sympathies to the O&rsquo;Meara and Batey family.  It is important to remember that all legislation is there to support people in our State.  Its ultimate function is to have a scaffolding that ensures that people&rsquo;s rights are fulfilled.  This entire Bill is about equality.  That is what it comes down to.  I agree it can be challenging within a scaffolding that already exists to fit something else in, but we have to do that.</p> <p>I am the Vice Chair of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality and I take that responsibility very seriously.  There are three recommendations around the Constitution.  One is on family status and ensuring that all families are respected in the Constitution.  A second is on ensuring that carers of whatever gender are supported and respected under the Constitution.  That element of care is also an important point to mention.  I have been a solicitor in family law.  People who come to a solicitor do not always know their rights under the law.  Some do and they force themselves to get married because they know ultimately what will happen.  Nobody should be placed in that position.</p> <p>It is our job to vindicate everybody&rsquo;s right to the marital status they choose.  I do not like using the term &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; but that is what is provided for under the Equality Acts.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, is doing a review of those Acts, which will be important.  We must get the constitutional piece right.  I ask the Minister to ensure that is done as quickly as possible.  It is a commitment in the programme for Government, which also includes a commitment to ensure that family carers have pension entitlements.  The Minister has followed through on that commitment and I understand we will see that in place by 2024.  The majority of those who care in the home are not deemed eligible for some family caring entitlements.  They cannot be left out because everybody does valuable work, whether they are paid with State contributions or not.</p> <p>With regard to pension entitlements, what is interesting in law is that cohabitees are seen as equal when it comes to paying things but are not seen as equal when it comes to having entitlements.  That is not the fault of the Minister but it is a fault of our law, which is why we have to change it.  It is also a fault of our Constitution that did not envisage different types of family.  As Senator Buttimer said, we have come a long way in some ways but that is cold comfort at this stage to people who find themselves in the tragic circumstances that I know the O&rsquo;Meara and Batey families did.  They are not the only ones.</p> <p>The Green Party is very supportive of pushing this legislation through.  It has to be done in the correct way so that everybody&rsquo;s rights are vindicated and we do not find ourselves up against a constitutional challenge or encounter issues with the Equality Acts.</p> <p>I thank Senator Wall and all of the Labour Party Senators for bringing this Bill forward.  It is an issue I feel passionate about and I am hopeful, based on the Minister&rsquo;s words today, that we will see some action on this matter very soon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#FFF00300"><p>The Minister is very welcome.  I also welcome our friends in the Public Gallery, Maria, Johnny and, of course, Damien, who gave us a very good and clear explanation in the briefing beforehand.  I commend our colleagues in the Labour Party on this important and timely Bill, on which we are having a very good debate.  All the contributions have been valuable and measured.</p> <p>As an old-fashioned republican, I believe in a complete separation of of church and State.  That is what we have to achieve and aim for.  Frankly, it is offensive in 2022 that we discriminate between families who are married and those who are cohabiting, to use that phrase.  It is just not right and it is not what a republican would ever believe in.</p> <p>Let us talk about the figures.  According to the 2016 census, Ireland had approximately 150,000 cohabiting couples, of whom more than 75,000 were cohabiting couples with children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What I hope we have established this evening, thanks to our colleagues in the Labour Party and the Bill, is that we need a major overhaul in legislation to improve the rights of these couples across the board.  The Bill is a significant step in that regard and Sinn F&eacute;in supports it.  We make no bones about it.  The Bill will ensure cohabiting couples will have equal rights to the widow's pension and be treated in the same way as married couples or civil partnerships.  It is important to point out the hypocrisy in our legislation at it stands.  As has been pointed out, cohabiting couples are recognised for the purposes of calculating the income of social welfare applicants.  When it comes to the widow's pension and the widow's grants, there is no longer recognition of a cohabiting couple even when they have children.  To lose a loved one and then discover that the State does not even recognise the relationship reflects a cruel and antiquated view of family relationships.  Our legislation needs to keep up with the times and the issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible.  I agree with Senator Buttimer.  Our country is way ahead of us in this.  It is something we should have acted on before now.  </p><p>My colleague, Deputy Kerrane, among others in the D&aacute;il has raised this with the Minister many times.  In fairness, the Minister said she would look at it.  However, I am not clear from her contribution exactly how much work has been done to date.  I acknowledge that we seem to be in a process, particularly in respect of the joint Oireachtas committee and those recommendations that will come out, hopefully before the end of the year, as she said.  The point that concerns me, and I do not mean this in a cynical way, is in respect of the timescale we are working towards.  I ask the Minister and her colleagues on the Government benches to think again about postponing the Bill for 12 months.  In 12 months, we are going to be three and a half years into the lifetime of the Government.  There will only be a year left.  This will not be a popular thing to say but I am going to say it: I do not see changes happening in that last year, particularly if a constitutional change is required.  We should move more quickly.  As someone who has steered two Bills through this Seanad, it is not something we do quickly.  It takes time.  I do not see the need to postpone the Bill for 12 months.  It would be far more constructive to acknowledge that we all broadly agree on the need for change.  That has been made clear across all the benches here this evening.  Why go to the trouble of postponing the Bill for 12 months?  Why not acknowledge that this is an important contribution to a debate that we all feel needs to happen?  We all believe we are behind the times in addressing this.  There are real families affected by this.  As others have mentioned, we have all dealt with people in our constituencies and clinics who are bewildered by the fact that right now when they most need help, there is no help available to them.  That is fundamentally wrong.  </p><p>I take the Minister at her word and note the line in her speech where she rightly said that for those who are suffering a terrible loss there is no difference in that pain if they are married or not.  She is absolutely right.  The people who are in the Gallery want us to address how we are going to move forward.  With the greatest of respect, we are not going to move forward by postponing this Bill for 12 months.  The great thing about the Seanad is that on a number of occasions we have worked collegially across party lines.  We have done it on a number of issues.  We should do that here this evening.  We should not postpone a second reading of the Bill for 12 months.  We should recognise that we all agree on the broad principles we need to apply.  I accept that it is complicated.  The Minister should send these people a positive message this evening and the best way to do that, on which I appeal to Government colleagues in a collegial way, is for them not to appoint tellers if they are going to press this amendment.  They do not need to press the amendment.  Let us give this Bill room to breathe and grow.  There may well be significant amendments that need to be made but we have time to do that.  If we postpone the Bill for 12 months, given the way governments work, with the best intentions in the world, unfortunately the reality is that we probably will not see real movement on this issue until another government is formed.</p></speech>

If it did not matter, John would not have had to take a case against the State.  It matters financially.  When I was ten years of age my mother passed away.  It was her anniversary this time last week, the same great, wonderful person - I speak about her very often.  If my father had not been entitled to the widow's pension, I do not know where I and the rest of my family would be today.  It was by a stroke of luck - and I know how difficult it is to grow up in a one-parent family with little or no supports.</p> <p>Along with my Civil Engagement Group colleagues, I fully support Senator Wall's Bill.  For me it is a no-brainer.  As was said earlier, Ireland is changing.  Couples are changing.  We should acknowledge that by treating couples equally.  We are not doing that within our society.  There are 150,000 people who are cohabiting with partners in society.  I appreciate the Minister saying we will come back to it in a year.  However, in my opinion and other people's opinions, that is kicking the can down the road.  We have seen many a time in both Houses where we kick the cans down the road.  That is exactly what the Minister's Department is doing this evening.  Oireachtas Members have brought the legislation, people have worked really hard and have listened to cohabiting couples and young people growing up in these families.  Last week we tabled a motion in the House on poverty.  I am thinking of people who are from the likes of Ballyfermot or Crumlin and are left with a one-parent family with no supports just because of their marriage status.  I urge the Minister to think.  I am sorry; the Minister is whispering with Senator Ardagh.  It is actually a bit rude.  I will just have a seat.</p></speech>

This is an issue I feel strongly about.  We have raised and discussed it at the Joint Committee on Gender Equality, which the Minister has mentioned.  It would be regrettable if the committee, which is in place to expedite and press for action and monitor what actions are happening in respect of the many recommendations of the citizens' assembly, was in some way used as a reason not to do things that move us forward in terms of equality in the State, or to wait.  They made a number of recommendation.  On some of them progress has been made.  On others, there should be progress now and the committee should not be regarded as any kind of pause button.  It is important that we be clear on that.  We already have the interim report of the committee in respect of the substantive question, the point which was made by the citizens very clearly.  They called for Article 41 of the Constitution to be amended so it would protect private and family life with the protection afforded to the family not limited to the marital family.  We know that is the view of the citizens.  The committee has also endorsed that view.  We do not need to wait for a constitutional referendum to start getting the legislation in place.  The fact that there has been a call for a referendum next year is a reason to start getting the legislation in place.  At the moment we have a piecemeal effect.  We have legislation that is outdated and based very much on a hierarchy of what units in society are recognised, be they married or not.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Then we have some legislation that has tried to promote equality, such as the Children and Family Relationships Act and the Equal Status Acts.  There is nothing to stop the promotion of equality through legislation.  Indeed, legislation has done a lot of the heavy lifting to repair what is an inequality of recognition at constitutional level.  This has enabled us to have a referendum that simply deals, in a clean way, with the recognition of all families, including lone-parent families, which make up almost one quarter of families in this State, as well as the 150,000 persons in cohabiting couples about whom we have heard.  That is the referendum, but we do not need to wait for that to fix the legislation.  It is much better if we fix that which we can fix early on, as we did with the marriage equality referendum and in other cases.</p><p>Let us look to the ruling of the judge again.  The crucial and fundamental point was that this is a loving family in the sense in which a family is generally understood in our society.  There are many more loving families like this across the State.  The problem, according to the judge, is that the legislation as it is currently drafted - the dated legislation that this Bill is rightly trying to update - seeks to support and promote the marriage contract and not families.  Why not have legislation that supports and promotes families?  There are many areas that we need to address.  When we have one we can start addressing, we need to start doing that.</p><p>Let us be clear on social protection.  We need to look to the primary goal of the legislation from the Department of Social Protection.  Is the primary goal of our widower's pension system and our social protection payments for families that have suffered a horrible loss the protection of those families or is it the promotion of the institution of marriage?  It is within our power to ensure that at least the social protection legislation, whatever about inheritance legislation and all those other areas that have been flagged and that we will need to address in time, prioritises social protection and the protection of all those parts and units of society which are families, whatever their form may take.  It is within our power to do that.</p><p>Even if there is a concern for the marital family and cohabiting when there may be multiple families, those are issues that could be addressed in amendments.  There is nothing to stop those issues being addressed by amendments on Committee Stage and through a constructive debate at that time.  Bills move slowly in these Houses and it would be at least a few months before we would see this coming back.  Let us have a Bill that is moving.  If the Minister really feels that she cannot support this moving forward or that she needs to delay it today, the onus comes on the Department to address it through the social welfare Bill.  We hear a lot about inadvertent consequences but sometimes when we talk about avoiding unintended consequences, we need to look to what our intentions are when we know there is harm not as an unintended consequence but as a known consequence of how the legislation is drafted.  A known consequence is that real families - the kinds of families all of us across the House have spoken about - are experiencing grief and not getting the social protection and support they need.  When we know that, we cannot fail to act.  In that context, it is crucial that there would be a sign of action.  It should be taken in this Bill but it also needs to be reflected in the social welfare legislation.  It should spark a wider review of the social welfare legislation, which we need to see.</p><p>We are meeting officials from the Department of Social Protection in the Joint Committee on Gender Equality tomorrow morning.  I am sure other members of the committee would agree that the Minister would be welcome to join the committee and engage with us on those issues in a constructive way tomorrow morning.  That would be a good opportunity for us to tease these issues out further, not only with the officials but also with the Minister.</p></speech>

This important matter first came across my desk in my office in Dundalk a number of months ago.  It came across my desk because somebody's partner had passed away and they came into my office to see what kind of financial supports were available.  I instantly thought of the widow's pension or something like that.  I thought that this already existed and that there was already something for people who were cohabiting.  That shows my total lack of knowledge.  I have been a councillor for six years and a Senator for two years so I deal with social protection queries a lot.  I was amazed to see that there is an anomaly within the system and that this is not there.  That happens all the time in legislation and with social protection.  Things come along and we notice that there is an anomaly or a grey area.  For some reason or other, something falls through a crack and then it is up to us as legislators or to the Minister to try to rectify and fix it.</p><p>It was brought home to me a number of months ago when this individual met me in my office.  It was brought home to me again this morning when I got an email from a person from my town called Maria.  I will not read out the entire email but I will summarise it:</p> <blockquote> 	Alan, my long-term partner died suddenly last year at the age of 38.  Despite living together for 18 years, having 2 children together and both of us paying taxes all our adult lives, I am not entitled to The Widow's Pension from the Department of Social Protection because we were not married.  [Quite rightly she believes] The law discriminates against cohabiting couples and doesn't reflect modern Irish society. </blockquote> <p>She made another point, which is true because I deal with this at every stage.  She said that at every stage throughout Alan and Maria's lives, whenever a social protection query or funding was going into the house, both of their incomes were assessed despite them not being married.  On one level, for any social protection payment the Department assesses both incomes, whereas for this particular payment the Department does not assess it at all.  It is a grey area that needs to be resolved for thousands of people across this country.  We all agree that this has to be rectified.  No one on this side of the House is saying this should not be done; we all want to get there.  I am sorry that I was not here for the Minister's speech but I have read it briefly.  She said that she wants to take time out to look at the legislation and to have it considered properly within 12 months.  I know that is difficult for people.  If we could introduce this tomorrow morning, we should do so.  I am not saying this because the Minister is in my party or policy area but one thing I know about the Minister is that she sticks to her word.  I have seen that time and again in my working life with her and in this House.  I am confident that whatever the Minister has said this evening about this, it will be followed through on, and I know that for a fact from my previous dealings.</p><p>This period of 12 months seems like a long time.  It can be very difficult for families that have campaigned for this for so long and it can be difficult for people like Maria, who lost her partner last year.  At the same time, we have to get it right and make sure it is done in the right way to get that support to those families that deserve this payment.  I do not know what the solution is but from reading the Minister's remarks I am happy to follow her lead on it.  I know she has the best interests of this particular issue at heart.  That is the point; we are all on the same page, we all want to get the best outcome and we want to do it as soon as possible.  The legislative process can be difficult, as we all know, but on the flip side all of us were legislators during Covid and we saw how quickly legislation can come about if we really want to do that as a Government.  This is an important debate and I commend the Labour Party on bringing it forward.  We are all on the same page.  I know I am and the reason I am on that page is because of the experiences I have had with people coming into my office.  Maria's email this morning struck me particularly hard.</p><p>I am 31 years of age and perhaps I will be married in the coming years.  Who knows?  I am not making light of it but the point about it is that more and more people in Irish society are maybe not getting married.  Some 30 years ago, in my parents' generation, it was natural to be married in your early 20s.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If someone was married at that age now one would look at them as though they had two heads.  I have no doubt that when people of my generation or younger grow older they will ask what the point is in getting married or in having a religious ceremony and stuff like that.  Irish society is changing.  As we move on, the concept of cohabiting seems simpler and easier.  That is the way that I believe Irish society is moving.  Looking at the concept of marriage over the last 20 or 30 years that is very clear.  Introducing what the Labour Party proposes here recognises where Irish society is going.  It is something we should do and I know the Minister thinks that too.  I know that she means what she says and she is inherently decent and this is a strong thing to her.  </p><p>I have discussed this in depth with her special adviser in recent weeks.  He has been very helpful and has reiterated the Minister's commitment.  We are in her hands and relying on her to do her best on this very important issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-26a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102600002#JJJ00200"><p>I want to pay tribute to Johnny O'Meara and his three children, Jack, Thomas and Aoife.  They have been through so much with the loss of their beloved Michelle.  It took immense courage to take the judicial review on the refusal to grant Johnny the widower's pension.  I also want to pay tribute to the work of Treoir, which is represented here this evening, and to those who have come forward to tell their stories, including Maria Doyle, Sheila Duffy and many others.  It is important to say that it is through the work of my colleagues, Deputy Alan Kelly, who is in the Gallery, and Senator Mark Wall that we have this Bill before the Seanad.  I am very grateful for their huge work to bring this issue to public attention.</p><p>It has been said several times during this debate that there is a fundamental injustice in our social welfare system and that goes to the heart of why we are bringing forward this Bill.  The State and its social welfare system recognises cohabiting couples as a family form when it comes to means-tested payments like carer's allowance or jobseeker's allowance.  However, while it recognises cohabiting couples in life, it has arbitrarily decided to ignore cohabitation as a family form when it comes to death.  It is unfair and wrong and reflects a miserly attitude towards those who choose to cohabit in this country.  </p><p>There are also fundamental inconsistencies in our social welfare system.  While qualified child payments are made to recipients of jobseeker's allowance, for example, to those who are parents of children, marriage is not a precondition of eligibility to that support for a dependent child.  The widow's or widower's contributory pension, WCP, also has that recognition of dependent children yet marriage is set as a precondition to access that benefit.  That exclusion matters because families such as Johnny's are left high and dry by the State after their families suffer that life-changing and devastating loss of a partner and mother of their children.  There is inconsistency because families in the very same situation with the benefit of a marriage contract will be eligible for those supports.  </p><p>While many of us would like to think that all children are born equal in the eyes of the law in this country, clearly that is not the case in our social welfare system.  Children born to a lone parent or parents who are not married or in a civil partnership are very clearly being discriminated against.  I read the judgment in the judicial review taken by Johnny O'Meara and his children in the High Court.  The judge was very sympathetic and we have heard sympathy from the Minister tonight and no doubt the State's legal team in the case was sympathetic too.</p><p>The case clearly put forward by the State is that the widow's or widower's contributory pension is intended for the deceased spouse only.  Mr. Justice Heslin's judgment said:</p> <blockquote> 	The proposition assumes that the aim of the WCP is to support families.  It is not. </blockquote> <p>He goes on to note that the intention of the Social Welfare Act 2005 in providing for the widow's and widower's contributory pension is to support the institution of marriage.  I am paraphrasing when I say the institution of marriage but that was effectively what was in the judgment.  However, we know the very design of the WCP goes well beyond support for the institution of marriage because it also provides for dependent children if they so exist.  The judge also noted that were the allowance for qualifying children intended to be an actual support to them then the level of payment would not be set at a fraction of the deceased spouse's rate.  However, we know from the qualified child increase allowed in jobseeker's allowance or, indeed, with regard to child benefit, that it is a contribution toward the rearing of the child.  It is not a comprehensive cost to cover all the costs of raising a child.  </p><p>There is a choice here for the Government.  Do we really believe that the WCP should be just conceived as a support to marriage and no more, or should it be a recognition of the loss of income and the massive impact on a family when one parent or person in a family unit dies whether they have children or not?  That is the choice before us.</p><p>When preparing for this debate I went back to look at when the widow's pension was first introduced.  It was in 1935.  I will quote a little from the opening of the debate on Second Stage which was opened by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, Deputy Se&aacute;n T. &Oacute; Ceallaigh.  He stated, &quot;The general purpose to which all social legislation is directed is the alleviation of the hardships accruing from risks to which all persons are exposed, and to meet which certain classes of the population are of themselves unable to make adequate provision&quot;.  He outlined that, &quot;the scheme for which the Bill provides has been framed mainly on the idea that during the working years of life contributions should be paid to provide for the protection of the worker's surviving widow, children or orphans in the event of premature death&quot;.  How have we moved from a place in 1935 where the widow's pension was very clearly to provide for the bereaved family to a view now put forward by the State's representatives during that judicial review that the WCP is solely to support marriage and no more?</p><p>It is a source or shame to me and to many here, notwithstanding that there has been progress in our legislation over the last decade and a half, that it remains the case that cohabiting couples and lone-parent families continue to be treated like second-class citizens, particularly when it comes to eligibility for the WCP and other entitlements.  </p><p>Our Bill is very simple in how it is composed.  We are very open to amendments.  It is a real shame that we will have this protracted process of consultation and discussion within the Government before there are any proposals.  I want to leave those who will vote on the amendment tonight with this final thought.  In 2021, some 2,383 persons between 24 and 54 years lost their lives.  If we extrapolate from the general population statistics, a sizeable share of that population will be parents of dependent children.  We have to pose the question to ourselves, if by delaying action on this and giving cohabiting couples and their children a right to support in the event of one person losing their lives, how many of those 2,000 people in that age bracket who will lose their lives this year, next year or the year after that will not be supported by the State?  We all have to reflect on that because every day that we do not move on this there is yet another family who will be very sore because they have been let down by the State.  I urge the Minister to work with us.  We are open to amendments but it is not good enough to kick the can down the road, to use Senator Buttimer's phrase, because that is exactly how we see it.</p></speech>

That is very welcome.  I think the Minister will also acknowledge that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We all set out to acknowledge that there is a problem here and we need to fix it.  That is where we need to get to, and we must do so as quickly as possible.</p><p>I will refer to contributions made by my colleagues.  Senator Hoey stated that most of what is in this legislation belongs in the past.  We have all seen enormous social change in recent years.  That is why we are here tonight.  In my opening remarks I spoke about the Ireland we have now.  As Senator Hoey outlined, the concept of family has changed and that is why this Bill has been introduced by the Labour Party.</p><p>Senator Ardagh spoke as well about the need to get there.  In fairness to her, she explained some cases she has come across in her daily job.  I am sure the Minister hears in her clinics what we hear in ours.  People come in asking for direction.  That is what this is about.  We must give direction.  That is the reason we are elected.  We are legislators and that is why we have introduced this Bill tonight.  I acknowledge that Senator Ardagh accepts there is a problem and that we must work on it.</p><p>As ever, Senator Buttimer acknowledged that the Labour Party has introduced this Bill and he gave his support to it.  He also acknowledged everything the Minister has done in her time in the Department of Social Protection.  He spoke about scaffolding.  It is a very good word, and one on which I would like to concentrate for a moment.  Scaffolding is great for those who have it but, unfortunately, many of the families that have come to us do not have scaffolding in their hour of need.  That is what the Bill is about.  It is about putting the scaffolding together as quickly as possible.  That must be acknowledged.  Senator Buttimer spoke about society and acknowledged the debate on what we have and what we have gone through.  We acknowledge Senator Buttimer's contribution tonight.  "Scaffolding" is a very appropriate word in the context of the debate.  Unfortunately, the scaffolding was not there for Johnny, Maria and the Maria about whom  Senator McGahon spoke.  That is what we are trying to do here.</p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly stated the Green Party wants to contribute to the Bill and find solutions.  I have no doubt her party will do so and she has done that tonight again.  She mentioned the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, carrying out reviews in his Department, which is important.  She also spoke about scaffolding.  We need the scaffolding to be in place now and that is our intention.</p><p>Senator Gavan mentioned timely Bills and measured contributions.  Every speaker was measured, which is the way it should be.  As he said, that is the way this House would be.  I support his call to our friends and colleagues on the opposite side to acknowledge that we have a workable Bill.  For the sake of those in the Gallery, those listening in and those who have contacted all our offices, we must not kick it down the road.  All the Senators who spoke acknowledged that they had dealt with these issues for people they represent.</p><p>As she always does, Senator Flynn made a contribution relating to her own circumstances.  That is to be welcomed.  Unfortunately, she had to leave after her contribution, but I am sure she will be back again, as she always is.</p><p>Senator Higgins, as a member of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality, stated she does not want to see the committee act as a pause button.  That is a very important statement.  The committee was never set up to act as a pause button and for one of its members to say that tonight must be acknowledged by everybody in this Chamber.  It is about bringing forward legislation rather than allowing it to rest and, as Senator Higgins said, to be a pause button.</p><p>Senator McGahon spoke about his concerns.  Senator Sherlock also raised issues.  In the short time I have remaining, my one ask for the Minister is that she work with us and, as per the invitation from a member of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality, that she go to the committee tomorrow.  We must not kick this Bill down the road.</p></speech>
