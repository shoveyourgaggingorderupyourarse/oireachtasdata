    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#A00300"><p>My understanding is that I had six minutes speaking time but I will endeavour to fill the eight minutes allocated to me.</p> <p>As Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion I am very grateful to have the opportunity to introduce and talk about this urgent piece of legislation, the Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022, in the Seanad and to discuss how it is intended that this legislation will work to support children with special education needs to gain access to specialist class placements which can meet their needs.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, continues to advise my Department that just over 100 children in the Dublin region require a special class or a special school place for the coming school year.  While my Department and the NCSE will continue to engage with schools to open more classes, I am confident that the provisions in this legislation, if enacted, can also play a key role in supporting this work.</p> <p>I will begin by thanking the Leader of the Seanad and Senators for facilitating such a quick opportunity to discuss this Bill in the Seanad after it had passed through the Lower House last week and I am happy to report that this legislation received support from all sides in that House.  I was also very happy to see that a number of special educational needs advocacy groups and parents&rsquo; representative bodies, such as AsIAm, Inclusion Ireland, the National Parents Council Primary and Special Classes in Schools Ireland have all welcomed this legislation and have called for it to be progressed and enacted into law without delay.</p> <p>Our Special Education Consultative Forum has played a significant role in advising on the need for this legislation.  I also want to acknowledge the co-operation of Senators who are members of the joint committee on education for agreeing to a waiver of the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill given the urgency of the situation.  I look forward to our discussion of the Bill today and later in the week on Committee and Final Stages.</p> <p>In my opening statement I wish to briefly talk through the main provisions in the Bill and in my closing statement I might just touch on two particular issues: first, the commitment of my Department and the NCSE to continue to engage and collaborate with schools to open new classes; and, second, to highlight both my Department&rsquo;s and the NCSE&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to provide the appropriate resources for schools opening special classes.</p> <p>On the provisions in the Bill, there are 12 sections and as I have only a limited amount of time I will focus on two key sections of the Bill.  The key provision in this new legislation is section 6 which provides for a truncated section 37A process whereby the Department of Education can direct a school to make additional provision for children with special educational needs.  This new process would allow me, as Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, to serve a ministerial direction on a school, on receiving a report from the NCSE setting out its opinion that there are insufficient school places in a certain area.  While efforts will continue to encourage more schools to open special classes, it is considered necessary to provide a revised section 37A process to enable the Minister to direct schools to open a sufficient number of additional special classes to ensure that children have a special class placement for the coming school year.  The revised process will still give schools the opportunity to respond to an initial notice and to a draft direction from the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion before I may ultimately direct a school to open a special class.  It is intended that the revised section 37A allows me to issue directions to schools within a period of six to eight weeks after receiving a detailed report from the NCSE.  </p> <p>This legislation seeks to ensure that a child-centred and -focused approach is taken to the provision of special education classes.  As well as addressing the issues relating to section 37A, the draft legislation also seeks to strengthen the obligations on schools to co-operate with the NCSE when requested to open a new special class or expand special school provision.</p> <p>Section 8 relates to section 67 of the Education Act, which provides for the NCSE or Tusla to designate a school place for a particular child.  To date, this section of the Act has not been commenced.  Section 8 provides for the amendment of section 67 of the Education Act by removing the provision for an appeal by a school board against a decision of the NCSE or of Tusla to designate a school place for a child.  </p> <p>The provision allowing a parent to appeal a decision of the NCSE or Tusla not to make a decision to designate school place when requested by a parent to do so is also being removed.  It is considered that this provision is not necessary, given the option available to a parent to appeal a decision of a school board to refuse to admit under section 29 of the Education Act and the fact that it is expected that the NCSE will make a decision to designate a special class or special school place in situations where there are places available.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Josepha Madigan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Where there is a lack of places, this can be addressed through the section 37A process.</p><p>Provision is made to allow a school board to make representations to the NCSE or Tusla where a school is directed to admit a child.  Where the NCSE or Tusla, after consideration of any representations, remains of the opinion the designation is necessary, it shall confirm the direction in writing to the board.  A board shall comply with such a direction.</p><p>It is my intention to commence section 67 once this legislation is enacted.  This will provide an important new power to designate a school place for a child with special educational needs.</p><p>I look forward to working with colleagues in the Seanad to progress this urgent legislation before the current term ends.  In regard to possible amendments to the Bill, I ask Senators to understand the very short timeframe available to us and that it might not be possible to accept a number of amendments to the Bill.</p><p>I very much commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing all of the contributions.</p></speech>

I watched the full debate on the Stages of the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  I point out all of the Topical Issue matters, all of the parliamentary questions, all of the oral parliamentary questions and all of the Commencement matters the Minister of State does on top of all of the other work she does all of the time to advance the case for children with additional educational needs.</p> <p>There is no question that this is urgent legislation.  The Minister of State knows of and has kindly met with groups like the Dublin 12 autism advocacy group and Involve Autism just to see how not having places has such an effect on children and on whole families, including parents and siblings.  Involve Autism has had a number of public meetings, and the Minister of State addressed the most recent one herself.  In that context, at the first meeting, we heard from parents who had put in 30 to 40 applications for places for their child and they still did not know if their child was going to get a place in a school anywhere near their home.  In this year, I have been working with the Minister of State&rsquo;s office and we have heard of situations of children in Drimnagh being offered places in Blessington.  That is not sustainable for any quality of life for the child because their friends are not going to be local friends.  Places need to be as local as possible.  I support how strongly the Minister of State has come out and advocated for that, including naming, where necessary.  We have had instances &ndash; people have come to the Minister of State and I have supported that - where entities have been economical with the truth when it comes to availability and the possibility of putting in classes.  It is very important we ensure that happens.</p> <p>I welcome the commitment of the NCSE and the Minister of State's assertion of the NCSE&rsquo;s commitment.  A representative from the NCSE was at the Involve Autism meeting and, to be fair, took it on the chin.  There was a lot of criticism, particularly of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, in that their role does not appear to be properly defined, or if it is defined, it is not meeting that.  Giving parents a list of schools is not supporting them in finding a place for their children.  That is very important.</p> <p>A further issue is that the people who are making decisions in schools are the boards of management and, at times, there is no transparency as to who those people are.  In the early autumn, I will be bringing forward a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to ensure that level of transparency because it is important we know who is making the decision on whether a child is in or out of a school.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#B00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I echo the compliments to her on the work she has done in this area.  She has done a huge amount of work and even the fact we are here to take this legislation today is groundbreaking for special education.  When we met the Minister of State last week in the Joint Committee on Autism, one of the major focuses of attention was this legislation, and those of all parties and none are fully supportive of it.  I welcome the great support that has come from all of the advocacy groups.</p> <p>I will be honest and say I am disappointed with the comments from the INTO.  As we know, the reason this legislation has been brought here today is because there are children for whom there is no school place next September, which is unacceptable in the 21st century.  Every child should be able to be educated with their siblings in their local area and local community.  We should not have the situation of people having to travel up to 50 km in rural areas, or of a significant amount of State funding being used to bus people across Dublin city where there are no schools in their local area.</p> <p>I am fully supportive of this and I say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo;.  However, there are still a number of issues within special education we need to look at.  A substantial number of extra classes are being provided at primary level but are we prepared at secondary level, given the higher number of children who are being diagnosed with autism?  In particular, do we have a sufficient number of secondary schools in place for September 2022 and September 2023?</p> <p>The issue of the July provision encompasses the Minister of State's Department.  There is a situation throughout the country where a significant number of special schools are not giving the July provision, which is unacceptable.  We may need to bring in legislation so every single special school has the July provision for parents for the summer of 2023.  I recently saw a calendar for a special school for next year and already, 12 months out, it does not have summer provision for 2023.  That has to be addressed immediately.</p></speech>

The area of special education in our schools is a sensitive one.  It is an area where we might be slow to act for fear of getting it wrong, but it is also an area that is so essential and so deeply personal to the parents, the children and the families whose lives are either blessed by access to an educational experience that is appropriate to their needs or needlessly burdened by the difficulties in achieving that for a member of their family who lacks it.  Anyone who has taken the time to listen to parents whose child or children may have special educational needs knows how central it is to their lives that their school has the right supports for that child.  It is night and day between a child who is surrounded by appropriate trained professionals who can use their expertise in teaching, nurturing and caring to allow that child to reach his or her fullest potential, and a child who, through no fault of their own, on account of their location, or age or the delivery of services, is deprived of this.  That is why the move to ensure every child with special educational needs who requires a special class or special school placement gets one is a welcome step indeed.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Foley, informed the Lower House earlier this month that the National Council for Special Education had advised that just over 100 children remained without an appropriate special educational needs placement for the coming school year.  Each of those children has a name and a family.  They have all been massively let down.  I hope the shortening of the process to allow for schools to be directed to open additional classes, as contained in this Bill, will be an effective tool with which to tackle the problem.  The risk, of course, is that directions can meet with bare minimums and delivery via a tick-box mentality.  This must be avoided at all costs as it only results in driving the lack of care out of the official figures but not eliminating it in reality.</p> <p>Schools must be directed to open additional classes but they must be provided with the necessary resources and trained staff.  It is vital that all teacher training includes training for special needs education, from behavioural therapists to special needs assistants, SNAs, and from rooms with equipment to outdoor play and nature areas.  If we are going to ask a school to step up to the plate in this way, we have got to put our money where our mouth is.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we were to poll all of Ireland and ask the people how the Government should spend tax money I guarantee that education would be on the finish podium.  Let us do right by our children and take every step to get each child the care, support and education he or she needs.  I am happy to support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#C00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  The fear is that if there is a failure to ensure adequate resources are made available to schools opening special classes, and if there are not proper supports, including supports from the HSE such as occupational therapy and speech and language supports, as well as psychological supports from the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, the legislation could be seen as a box-ticking exercise.  Worse, it could be seen as an attempt to place blame or to be seen to be doing something by blaming others but not putting the resources in place.  There cannot be unwillingness in the Department to provide funding for the required capital investment in classes.  Children in this situation are sometimes placed in prefabs and left there for a decade.  The provision of sensory rooms and sensory gardens is best practice.</p> <p>My concern is one that has been raised with the Department, namely, that there is a defect in section 3 of the Bill.  The Minister of State is seeking to amend section 8 of the 1998 Act by inserting a requirement that the patron shall co-operate and ensure co-operation from the board of the school with the NCSE and the performance of the council of its functions.  In other words, a requirement to co-operate on the provision of education to children with special needs, particularly through the provision and operation of a special class or classes when requested.  The Minister already has the power provided in section 37A of the Education Act 1998, as amended by the Education (Admission to Schools) Act, to put in a process that requires the co-operation of patrons and boards of management.  On the face of it, the Bill seems to nullify all of this by simply requiring that at the whim of the NCSE, things have to happen.  This looks like bad legislation.</p> <p>I understand that some of the patrons have been in touch with the civil servants, who have said it is not the intention of the Bill to nullify the existing legislation.  It looks like a shortcut that will cause confusion when it comes to be interpreted, perhaps in years to come.  Are we looking at the same old situation with the guillotining of legislation that is being rushed through this week whereby we will end up with problems?  This approach to legislation does not respect democracy or the people whom democracy is supposed to serve.  I would be very grateful if the Minister of State would address in particular the concerns I am raising about whether the proposed section 3 will cause confusion when there is an existing process set out in legislation that requires the co-operation of patrons and boards of management in the provision of necessary facilities for children with special needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#C00300"><p>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il is totally supportive of the work she is doing in this area and I certainly welcome the publication of the Bill.  The relevant section was put into the original Bill at the suggestion of me and Deputy Thomas Byrne, who is now a Minister of State, when we served on the education committee in the previous D&aacute;il.  We felt it was vital that the Minister of day had the opportunity to be able to direct schools, boards of management and patrons to take on children with special needs when that need was clearly demonstrated in the community.  It is very important.</p> <p>As for what lessons have we learned, it was interesting that even though it was agreed that the provision be included in the Act a number of years ago, approximately 27 sections had to be dealt with.  This is why there is such a long period of time between beginning and completing a section 37A process.  I understand it can take up to 18 months.  There would then there would be further delays to organise building the room and resourcing it.  We have learned that simplification is very important.  When legislation is introduced, we must try to ensure it is as practical and pragmatic as possible.  The fact the process can be reduced to eight weeks is very important and will serve the young people we are speaking about in their communities.  It is very important.</p> <p>When we speak about providing accommodation for special education centres and classes, we are not just talking about the four walls or the physical building.  We are speaking about the resources, the special educational assistants and the intervention therapies that are needed.  At present, as the Minister of State is aware, there is a huge gap in these intervention therapies.  I appreciate this is outside the remit of the Minister of State but we need to see more co-ordination on these intervention therapies between the Department of Education and that of the Minister with responsibility for disability.  The services are greatly needed.  We all know that early intervention is very important and can make such a difference in the life of a young person and in the lives of their families and the people in their communities.  They all need the opportunity to fulfil their potential in as large way as possible.  Sadly in many cases they are being failed due to a lack of intervention therapies.</p> <p>Summer provision has been mentioned and I agree with what has been said.  While financial resources are being put in place, it is incumbent on schools, particularly special schools, to have summer provision.  I believe that all schools should have summer provision to help support those children who need it.  These are children with a disability and those who are vulnerable in other ways.</p> <p>I want to raise an issue on which I have been in contact with the office of the Minister of State.  This is with regard to Kildare Town Community School.  It has excellent special education facilities.  It has been progressing very well in this area.  It found out on a website, as opposed to being told directly, that it would lose two special needs assistants from September.  Inclusion is at the heart of education as is having an inclusive practice.  Special needs assistants at the heart of every school.  Unfortunately, many of the supporting activities for the children in the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit in this school will be curtailed.  It is very important that children in ASD and special educational needs units have an opportunity to be involved in transition year, the leaving certificate, the junior certificate and the leaving certificate applied if they have the ability to do so.  This loss of staff will reduce their opportunities to do so in this school.  I ask the Minister of State to look at this again.  It is very clear from the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and the Education Act that the Minister of State has the authority to examine this area.  Where the system is working for the young people for whom it is meant to work, we should not tinker with it or change it.  We need to do all that we can to ensure this happens.</p></speech>

As a member of the Oireachtas joint committee I can say there was cross-party support from the Government and the Opposition sides to waive the pre-legislative scrutiny.  There was no disagreement on it.  I thank the Department for the helpful briefing for party spokespersons on education.  Every effort has been made to bring people on board.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Notwithstanding that a quarter of the entire education budget goes to the education of children with special needs, that 300 new special classes were opened in the last academic year and that at least 315 will be opened in the next academic year - an increase of 600 in two years, bringing us to almost 2,500 special classes across the country - as the Minister of State has acknowledged, some children are not getting access to schools.  Therefore, it is the correct action by a responsible Minister, such as the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to put at her disposal everything to ensure that every child with special needs - indeed every child - gets the education they deserve under the Constitution and under legislation.</p><p>Schools are sometimes concerned that they will not get the resources.  However, the 1998 Act requires the Department to provide those resources.  For every class of six children with special needs, two SNAs and one teacher are now provided under the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister, Deputy Foley.  For secondary schools it is 1.5 teachers and two SNAs for a class of six.  That is the correct course of action and should give schools some comfort.  Senator O'Loughlin mentioned the interdisciplinary and cross-departmental element, which many parents are concerned about.  For instance, the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, waiting list is a matter of real concern for many parents, making it also a matter of concern for the schools.</p><p>My colleagues and I listened to the debate in the D&aacute;il.  Opposition Deputies acknowledged that some schools are not doing their best to open these classes.  That is why this action is required.</p><p>Representatives of F&oacute;rsa and individual SNAs appeared before the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  They expressed concern over contracts and terms and conditions for SNAs.  It is important to get that part right.  As I said at that committee, when I was the chair of a school board of management, the two school representatives on the board were the principal and an SNA.  However, that kind of involvement in leadership within a school is not the experience of every SNA and it needs to be if we are serious about backing up the resources with the support for the staff.</p><p>This legislation provides that the NCSE may co-ordinate school places in certain areas.  That would be a massive leap forward for many of the families I speak to who need to go door-to-door to all the schools to find a place when they are actually entitled to that place.  In the briefing we received, departmental officials described this to me as more of a co-ordinating role.  That is also an important part of the legislation.</p><p>The Minister of State has the support of the Green Party for this legislation and for the work she is doing.  It is acknowledged that more resources are required, but 600 additional classes over the last two years is a major improvement.  Opposition Deputies said in the D&aacute;il that there has been a significant leap forward in services.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is very welcome.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes and supports this legislation, which will shorten the notice period for schools being instructed to accommodate pupils with special educational needs.  Many families are trying to secure appropriate education for their children as is their human right.  I commend all the families and campaigners who have fought tirelessly for fair treatment for their children.  We would not be here discussing this Bill if it were not for their campaigning.  It is very troubling that in addition to raising their children, they need to be politically active in order to get equality of opportunity for their children.</p> <p>Children have a right to an appropriate education.  We will work with the Government to ensure that solutions are delivered urgently for the children affected.  Everything that can be done should be done to ensure families get clarity as soon as possible.  I am conscious that confusion within Government caused unnecessary stress for families.  As my colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, said, we are debating this at a time when parents, particularly those in Dublin but also in Kildare, Meath, Cork, Limerick and elsewhere, do not have a school place for their children for September.  That is not acceptable.</p> <p>The report of the Ombudsman for Children was published recently and the Minister of State accepted it was discriminatory that the State did not have adequate places for these children.  That report pointed out that the Department of Education is failing children with special educational needs, particularly in black spots such as Dublin and Cork regarding the provision of suitable school places.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Warfield, has tabled a number of amendments to this legislation, which we will discuss again on Wednesday at 6.30 p.m.  Last month Sinn F&eacute;in tabled a D&aacute;il motion raising many issues relating to this subject, including the call to introduce emergency legislation to expedite the section 37A process to ensure all children have an appropriate school place within a school community.</p> <p>We welcome the Bill but have proposals to improve it and hope they will be accepted.  I also ask the Minister of State to accept my apologies.  I need to go somewhere else, but I will be following the debate from my office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#D00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  We welcome and support any measures to increase the number of special educational or additional needs education places and supports.  However, I see this legislation as a very small measure in the overall need to ensure we provide for children with additional or special needs.  Once children are diagnosed, they are entitled to a certain number of services.  However, time and again I come up against the basic issue of getting a diagnosis.  In the Cabra-Grangegorman children's disability network team, CDNT, there is a wait of more than three years to get a diagnosis and all the while children and their families are left in limbo because they do not have that diagnosis.  I hope the Minister of State looked very closely at the recommendations from the Ombudsman for Children on creating alternative pathways to additional needs and special needs support in schools.  It is simply appalling that some of us need to recommend to families to go away and spend between &euro;1,000 and &euro;3,000 to get a private diagnosis in order to get their constitutional right to an education.</p> <p>I am slightly uncomfortable about the narrative around the Bill which is about directing schools to make provision.  For me the elephant in the room is that there are many DEIS band 1 schools going over and beyond to ensure provision for the children attending their schools while other schools are shunning their responsibilities.  Because of that precise situation, I need to raise with the Minister of State comments she made when she singled out four schools in recent weeks.  She said the schools have not been forthcoming in opening special classes in specific circumstances where they know they have capacity.  She said the decision to name schools was because they were not engaging at all and they were just ignoring correspondence.</p> <p>As a lawyer and as a Minister of State, she knows that words can do enormous damage.  Her words have caused enormous distress to the teaching staff and to the families who attend St. Gabriel's in Stoneybatter.  It was never the case that that school was not engaging or was ignoring correspondence.  In fact, the school has been engaging with an architect engaged by the Department since last autumn, to discuss the refurbishment of two school rooms so that they could open an ASD unit in 2023.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It has eight class teachers and six resource teachers.  It could not be further from the truth, therefore, to suggest this school is not committed to special needs.  In fact, so much of what it does is about providing for children with additional needs.  It is telling that the Department sent an email at 7.30 p.m. on a Friday, 17 June, to the Archbishop of Dublin, the patron of the school.  The Department did not even have the grace to email the school directly to inform it that it was going to publish its name unless it communicated.  The school responded within hours, yet that did not matter because the Minister of State, unfortunately, proceeded to name the school.  Those teachers are now looking back on a decade of progress and asking what the Department and the community think about its work.  Will the Minister of State please engage directly with the school and issue a public apology, given it is not true that it was not engaging and in light of the considerable hurt in the community?</p><p>In the context of what I would call a whole-of-education approach, I understand this Bill is very much directed towards ensuring there will be adequate provision within primary schools.  As I said, we support that, but we also need to look at the continuum into secondary schools and also within preschools.  Anybody who understands special needs knows it is about early intervention.  The decisions made in respect of St. Gabriel's in Stoneybatter have meant that a preschool within that school has had to close.  Two children with additional needs, who were getting great support within that preschool, will now have nothing for this September.  At the age of four, they will have no special needs intervention in a preschool setting but they will have fabulous facilities once they begin primary school in the following September.  What about the 12 months in between?  Weeks and months matter in children's lives at that age.  What are the Minister of State and the Department doing to ensure children across the board are being looked after?  Unless we get those early interventions right, we will store up all sorts of problems, as we are seeing, within both the primary and secondary school system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1648" speakername="Emer Currie" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#E00200"><p>I am sharing time with Senator Maria Byrne.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State and commend her on her commitment to special educational needs.  Her office is always available, as is she, and we are very grateful for that.  I hope her legacy will include the reorientation of this system that puts the weight on parents and families to secure appropriate accommodation for their children instead of the State automatically stepping in.  The experience parents have is upside down and it forces people who already have too much on their plates to fight for vulnerable children.  They must compete for places in schools and undergo an arduous application process, with rejection after rejection.  The planning and application process must work seamlessly in order that children will be guaranteed a place in their local community that is led by the SENOs.  That has not, unfortunately, been the case in Dublin 15.  It should not have to be led by the parents.</p> <p>I will support this legislation like everyone else.  While nobody wants to see it used in the first or the last place, it is necessary for schools that have not responded appropriately to the urgency and stress this causes families.  The Minister of State's number one priority is to increase the numbers of special schools and special class places until every child in the country has a place in his or her community, and she oversaw the opening of 300 special classes last year.  Moreover, as we have seen, July provision is not always being delivered.  Nevertheless, the schools in Dublin 15, which I work with and can speak for, only want the best for their students.  They are committed to inclusive, child-centred and rights-based environments, including for Ukrainian children who have been welcomed into the classroom, through responding to changing and growing special educational needs by opening classes or managing multilingualism and different ethnicities in a respectful and sensitive way.  There is a disconnect between what the Department or the NCSE describes as &ldquo;reasonable efforts&rdquo; to support a school in making the required provision, on the one hand, and schools' concerns about their resources, facilities and supports, on the other hand.  That gap between the NCSE and schools has to be bridged for the system to work and for us to avoid having to use section 37A in the first instance.</p> <p>The Minister of State might comment further on Danu Community Special School, which she visited before the classes moved in and which Mr. John Kearney visited last week.  We discussed this previously, but she knows about the demand there for a behavioural practitioner.  I ask that such a practitioner be granted to Danu, which desperately needs it whereas other schools have one.  When it comes to ratios, this is a system where the one-size-fits-all approach does not work.  We need to examine those scenarios with SNAs, special classes and special schools where the ratios are not meeting the demands of the school staff.  Moreover, on the site for Danu, we committed to a purpose-built, state-of-the-art building and the needs are only growing.  Will the Minister of State please consider the urology site in Blanchardstown?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1695" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#E00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for appearing before the House to discuss this important issue.  As she will be aware, I am involved in a special school, which she has visited with me in the past.  In April, I held an online meeting on this area and I thank her for contribution and commitment to the area of special needs.  A number of issues were raised that evening and she subsequently resolved them, and I thank her publicly for that because it shows her commitment and dedication to the area.</p> <p>Behind every child there is a family, and the Minister of State takes these issues seriously.  Some schools may not be as forthcoming in offering places to children with special needs and it is sad that section 37A has to exist, whereby the Minister of State has the right to direct schools in that regard.  It is a reality, however, and I can certainly understand why the section is provided for.  So many people are dependent on the provision.  I previously dealt with a case in Limerick where a student had been refused a place in two schools and their parents then had to bring them to another school more than one hour away.  That was not recognised by the NCSE, however, because there were two schools within an hour's drive of the student's home, even though there was not a vacancy in either of them.  Perhaps the Minister of State would examine that, although it might since have been resolved, given it happened quite a while ago.  The family had to drive to Charleville rather than have the child attend either of the two local schools, given there was no vacancy.</p> <p>There are so many sensitive issues in the context of special needs but we have come a long way in regard to what the Minister of State and the Department have been delivering, not least when compared with a few years ago.  It is wonderful that there is now greater inclusivity of children who require that additional support.  I pay tribute to SNAs and the various support staff who are in place because the work they do daily with the children is to be commended.  They almost become part of the family because the children often have a special attachment to them.</p> <p>I compliment the Minister of State and thank her for her work to date.  I look forward to supporting the Bill.</p></speech>

This legislation is very important and needs to be passed before the end of term.  I fully support her decision to name schools.  Words matter, but actions matter more, and when there is inaction, words need to be used to create action.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, actions matter more.  When there is inaction, words need to be used to create action.  As somebody who fell under the category of a young person who needed and would have benefitted from special education, I just wish back in the 1980s and 1990s there was a Minister with responsibility for special education in the first place, and one who would have had the courage of her or his convictions to actually name and call out the education institutions and universities I had to attend where there was precious little support.  I wish there was a Minister then who actually named institutions and got results.  Even in here I have had to threaten to bring things up on the floor of this House in order to get action.  The Minister of State made the right decisions.  I 100% support her.  There are people upset, but at the end of the day, if she gets the result, which is to provide spaces for young people in schools near their homes, then it is a good day&rsquo;s work.</p></speech>

I might just deal with Senator Mullen&rsquo;s particular issue because it was a kind of a technical matter.  I want to thank Senators Seery Kearney, Keogan, O&rsquo;Loughlin, Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly, Gavan, Sherlock, Currie, Maria Byrne, Carrigy and Conway for their contributions.  I might come to them at the end of my closing statement if I have time and go through the Senators' individual points.</p> <p>I just want to speak to Senator Mullen on his particular issue.  As he knows, we are putting in new general provisions or functions on patrons and boards in this legislation.  That is aimed at making it unequivocal in making our schools child-centred and child-focused for all children, not just those with additional needs.  That is all that section 3 is about.  It is making sure that patrons and schools co-operate with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, when they are consulted to open a new class.  That is what the Bill, in essence, does.  It is outside of the section 37A process.  It is asking the board of schools to co-operate, ultimately, with the NCSE.  As the Senator knows, that is the regular co-operation that already happens in the majority of cases anyway.  Section 37A is separate and a power that I am reluctant to use, but on occasions I have no option but to do it.  However, it will not defunct the provisions in the Bill ultimately.  As the Senator knows, the Attorney General obviously has contributed to this legislation as well and everything has gone through him in terms of the drafting process.  Therefore, I am confident the provisions are not contradictory and will work together.  I hope that answers the Senator&rsquo;s question.  I just wanted to specifically deal with that.</p> <p>As the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, I am committed to making a difference for students who have special education needs as part of an inclusive education system.  Children with special education needs should be supported to access the education system.  As a Government, we fully recognise the importance of an inclusive and all-embracing education system.  Never is it more important than in the case of children with special education needs.  I fundamentally believe that our most vulnerable children in society must be prioritised.  </p> <p>Government policy on supporting children with special education needs aims to ensure that all children will have access to an education appropriate to their needs.  Our policy is to provide for inclusive education and ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools.  Where pupils require more targeted interventions, special class or special school placements are also provided.  </p> <p>On investment, the Department of Education is investing more than &euro;2 billion in making additional provision for children with special education needs in 2022.  That represents in excess of 25% of the Department&rsquo;s total annual budget.  Access to education by every child with special education needs is designed to provide the appropriate and necessary supports to ensure that the full potential of each child is realised.  </p> <p>In my opening statement, I highlighted that I wanted to return to two issues, namely, consultation and resources.  First, on consultation, the vast majority of schools, when approached and consulted with by the NCSE to make additional provision for children with special education needs, agree to open a new or additional special class.  Both my Department and the NCSE have developed a number of strategic initiatives to forward plan for the provision of special class and special school places.  These developments in relation to forward planning and the ongoing collaboration with schools are bearing fruit.  Some 300 additional special classes were opened in the current school year and at least 315 more classes have been sanctioned to open for the coming school year.  I want to confirm that my Department and the NCSE are committed to continuing to work with schools to provide new or additional special classes in this way.  </p> <p>All parties would obviously prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from the Minister.  The evidence available this school year is that schools are willing to work collaboratively with the Department and the NCSE on the provision of new school places for children with special education needs.  I am grateful to all concerned for their ongoing work in this regard.</p> <p>However, where the NCSE identifies a need for additional special classes in an area and have been unable to find schools agreeable to opening new classes after consultation, the section 37A process can be considered.  I recently announced the section 37A process has been initiated for the third time in relation to the provision of special classes at primary and special school places in Dublin region.  The NCSE wrote to me to advise that it formed an opinion that there is insufficient special class capacity in primary schools and special school capacity in Dublin.  I mention Dublin only because the NCSE assured me that there are sufficient special school and special class places outside of Dublin.</p> <p>Where the existing section 37A process has been used twice already, those processes took more than four months and 18 months, respectively.  This underlines the need for a new process, as all relevant parties agree that the current section 37A process is too long and too complicated.  The key provision in this legislation provides for a truncated section 37A process whereby I can direct a school to make additional provision for children with special education needs.  It is envisaged that this new process can lead to a ministerial direction to be served on a school within six to eight weeks of receiving a report from the NCSE setting out its opinion that there is insufficient school place in a certain area.  This shortened process still allows two opportunities for school patrons and boards to make representations to me ahead of a direction issuing. </p> <p>On resources, which practically all of the Senators mentioned, I want to take the opportunity to confirm that both my Department and the NCSE are committed to providing appropriate resources to schools opening new special classes.  I think we can all agree that a new special class is much more than simply four walls and a room, and this is very much reflected in the resources that are provided. </p> <p>Mainstream schools opening new special classes are informed in advance of the range of supports available from both the Department and the NCSE.  The Department&rsquo;s planning and building unit is available to work closely with schools opening new special classes and my Department has a framework of contractors in place to facilitate necessary works in schools.  All works are 100% funded by the Department.</p> <p>On staffing resources, as was mentioned, one additional teaching post is sanctioned at primary, 1.5 additional teaching posts are sections at post primary and two special needs assistants, SNAs, for every autism spectrum disorder, ASD, special class of six children.  The NCSE provides a programme of professional support for schools with newly established special classes.  They include a seminar for principals, a four-day intensive training course for teachers, a two-day training course for new teachers, whole staff continuing professional development, CPD, and the school is also linked with an NCSE adviser.  In addition, the Department provides enhanced funding through increased capitation rates, a special class start-up grant, furniture and ICT grants.  It is vitally important that we appropriately resource schools opening special classes.  I want to confirm the commitment of both my Department and the NCSE to continue to provide these supports for all schools opening new special classes.</p> <p>As I have one minute left, I will address Senator Seery Kearney, who was the first to speak.  She mentioned the Dublin 12 autism advocacy group and Involve Autism, which I know she does much work with on a regular basis.  I am happy to liaise with her on any assistance I can give her in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Carrigy mentioned summer provision and getting special schools to increase the uptake.  There has been a significant uptake over the past two years, but I agree with the Senator.  We have 129 special schools now and want to make sure we do everything we can to support them to provide the summer provision.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Josepha Madigan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As the Senator will know, we outlined a number of new measures to do that this year.

As I said in the D&aacute;il, the defective concrete block disaster has haunted the lives of people in Donegal, Mayo and beyond for far too long.  People who built and bought family homes have had to watch those same homes crumble before their eyes while others potentially face that prospect.  With no other help available, they turned to the State for support.  When the support was introduced and was found wanting, they took their message directly to the Government through all routes available.  We have listened to that message and heard it loud and clear.</p> <p>The scheme that today&rsquo;s legislation underpins is a dramatic leap forward towards a 100% grant scheme.  It goes a long way towards addressing the fundamental concerns and needs of homeowners.  However, I recognise homeowners' concerns and fears.  I assure them that we are committed to making this scheme work.  No scheme is perfect.  I have said repeatedly that schemes evolve and I am sure this one will too as the science is developed and lessons are learned.  I assure Senators that I will not be found wanting if and when changes to the scheme now being legislated for are required.</p> <p>The intense engagement with homeowner representatives over the past year has fundamentally reshaped this scheme for the better.  It is a scheme of State support that is unprecedented anywhere in the world.  It is the State stepping up to help those who have no other way forward.  It is light at the end of a long tunnel for affected families.  I pay tribute to the homeowners and their representatives who have engaged with this process through the working group, Oireachtas hearings, submissions to the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, and the expert group and through frequent meetings of the homeowners' forum.  That work has shaped this scheme and, where agreement could not be reached, it at least shone a light on the issues.  I particularly acknowledge and thank John O&rsquo;Connor for taking on the role of homeowner liaison and for his hard work and commitment to improving the scheme.  I also thank my officials, who have worked diligently on this issue along with colleagues in local authorities.  In addition, I acknowledge my Government colleagues from the impacted counties who have been tireless advocates both publicly and, more often, behind the scenes in pressing the case for impacted homeowners not just over the past year, but over several long years.</p> <p>Today's draft Bill follows on from the general scheme and reflects the decisions made by the Government in November 2021.  I will now draw attention to the key decisions made and the differences from the old scheme and highlight the major steps forward.  There is provision for 100% grants subject to an overall maximum grant of &euro;420,000 per dwelling; this is an increase from the &euro;247,500 available under the current scheme.  The grant rates are in keeping with the construction cost report prepared by the SCSI in February 2022 and provision has been made for a review mechanism for the overall grant cap and a review of the grant rates, as required.  This was a particular request of homeowners that I acceded to.  They sought independent costings and I accepted this suggestion without change.  There is to be a Government guarantee in regard to remediation works other than full demolition and rebuild works through eligibility for a second grant, if required, for a period of 40 years.  This 40-year guarantee is another very significant request from homeowners that we have acceded to.  There will be a revised application process which removes the &euro;5,000 to &euro;7,000 financial barrier to scheme entry in favour of a low-cost building condition assessment report.  An independent appeals process for applicants is to be introduced with all key decisions under the scheme appealable.  Alternative accommodation, storage costs and immediate repair works to a maximum value of &euro;25,000 are included within the overall grant cap.  The Housing Agency will play a key role under the enhanced scheme by taking on the financial cost of testing and assessing homes and determining, on behalf of the local authorities, the appropriate remediation option and grant rate for each dwelling.  A new damage threshold will help to ensure the worst affected homes are prioritised.</p> <p>The enhanced scheme is extended beyond the current scope of principal private residences only and will now also cover rented dwellings registered with the Residential Tenancies Board on or before 1 November 2021.  Clare and Limerick will be included in the enhanced scheme upon commencement and a pathway will be provided for other local authority areas to access the scheme, if required, through independent research and recommendations to the Minister by the Housing Agency.  There will be a review of the operation of the Act three years after commencement and within three months of any revised IS 465 standard.  Exempt development status under planning legislation will be granted to remediation works carried out under the defective concrete blocks grant scheme on a like-for-like basis.  A parallel scheme of grant assistance will be introduced for local authority and approved housing body-owned social houses which are impacted.</p> <p>I thank the chair and members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for facilitating a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny, for facilitating such a long and detailed engagement with key stakeholders on 23 June and for the comprehensive feedback since received.  I will now briefly address that feedback.  The damage threshold is provided for in the Bill but will be prescribed in regulations.  Its only purpose is to ensure that damage has occurred to dwellings before they enter the grant scheme and that the worst damaged homes are prioritised for approval under the scheme.  I assure homeowners that the threshold set will not work to prevent entry to the scheme for those who need access.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The SCSI cost report was prepared in February 2022 and submitted to my Department in March, only four months ago.  The grant rates are being set by reference to those rates, which provide for like-for-like works.  The rates will be prescribed and kept under review to ensure they remain appropriate.</p><p>The appeals panel will comprise ten persons selected independently of my Department through a recruitment process to be run by the Public Appointments Service.  All the key decisions under the scheme can be appealed by homeowners.  I assure Senators that the appeals panel will operate independently.</p><p>Section 29 provides for subrogation.  If a homeowner chooses to pursue a right of action in respect of the damage to a home then he or she is free to do so.  However, the Bill must be framed so as to ensure that the grant does not operate as a form of double compensation.  It is important that section 29 is retained, as it is so that the State can step in on behalf of the taxpayer to ensure that litigation is appropriately managed for the benefit of the public.  Section 29 provides for that.  If the litigation is successful, then any damages awarded above the level of the grant would go to the homeowner.</p><p>There has been a lot of discussion about downsizing in recent weeks, and I want to make clear that for the small number of homeowners who have so far expressed an interest in it, downsizing is allowed under the scheme.  The grant awarded to an applicant will be appropriate to the size of home he or she intends to build, and the grant rates set will be adequate to ensure 100% of costs can be recovered for all but the very largest of homes on a like-for-like basis.  The Government and I have an obligation to the Exchequer and participants in the scheme to ensure that the grants approved are appropriate to the size of home being rebuilt and that homeowners rebuilding a home of the same size are grant-aided appropriately.  Setting up a two-tier grant system with different grants for the same home size would be fraught with problems.  The scheme does not financially reward downsizing, but it is incorrect to state that it penalises homeowners who do so.  It does not.</p><p>The Government decision of 30 November 2021 called for a number of reviews to be completed to ensure issues of concern were properly interrogated.  They include: the review of the IS 465:2018 protocol, including consideration of the impact of other potentially deleterious material such as pyrrhotite; the review of the Irish standard for concrete blocks, including aggregates; the review of the adequacy or otherwise of the existing foundations in homes impacted by defective concrete blocks; and the review of the potential impact, if any, of full cavity-wall insulation on homes susceptible to damage or damaged by defective concrete blocks.  The Bill does allow for the Minister to adjust the scheme through regulations to provide for any issues that arise from the scientific investigations, and that includes foundations.  If it is found that there is an issue with foundations, I will include them in the scheme through regulations.</p><p>The enhanced grant scheme makes provision for retrospective payment of the benefits to early movers under the current scheme.  Making provision for homeowners who completed remediation works prior to the IS 465 standard and the grant scheme having been in place is a lot more complex and would need further time for consideration of the issues involved.</p><p>I am conscious of time, so I will conclude.  Every Senator is keenly aware of the scale of the crisis that confronts us.  This scheme is the State stepping up to the mark, as we have a moral obligation to put in place practical solutions for impacted homeowners.  I assure Senators that we will continue to work with all Members of the Oireachtas, and listen carefully to their views as we put in place regulations and guidance to ensure the enhanced scheme can open for applications as soon as possible.  We have waited more than two years since the announcement of the previous scheme.  We must move ahead with a new scheme that will put people's lives and homes back on track.  That is why the urgency of this legislation is such that it must be passed before the summer recess, so that we can have a new scheme open in the autumn and new regulations published.  I look forward to engaging with Senators here today.  I will make some concluding remarks at the end of the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#H00200"><p>The Minister is very welcome.  I also welcome John O'Connor from the Housing Agency.  At the outset, I acknowledge the work of Caroline Timmons, a very able person in the Department, who has aided, assisted and supported the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to deal with the complexities of this issue, and all of the Department's staff.</p> <p>I also welcome the homeowners affected by this issue in Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Limerick and other counties, whom I have no doubt are tuned in to this debate.  In preparation for today, I took a look at the Official Report of the D&aacute;il proceedings, in particular the debate from Wednesday, 6 July.  To say the least, the debate was characterised by bitter recrimination and, as we now know, led to the resignation of the Fine Gael Deputy from Donegal, and former Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh.  I thank Deputy McHugh for his work on this difficult issue, which has crossed political boundaries and divided so many families.  That is a terrible shame.  It has happened on other occasions in our history, but we must move on.  We want to get people back into homes that are appropriate for them in terms of size, and that are safe and sustainable.  A number of amendments were ruled out of order because of extra costs to the Exchequer.  I do not know the ins and outs of that, but I want to put a marker down that if it happens on this Bill in the Seanad I would challenge it.  I am not sure how many amendments will be allowed.  Senators will be focused in their amendments.  I do not believe we will have many amendments, but we will have ones that are substantive and that will have to be teased out.  I acknowledge the work of Deputy McNamara, an Independent colleague of mine who is a Deputy for Clare, who I know was involved.  The reality is that the Bill was passed.  We will move on.</p> <p>We are now in the Seanad.  Let us be clear: we hope this Bill will not be guillotined and that we will have sufficient time to tease it out.  The guillotine is not a matter for the Minister, it is a matter for this House.  If we decide, and a decision is supported to guillotine the Bill, then we are to blame, nobody else - not the Clerk, not the Administration, not the Minister, but we in this House.  That is where the blame lies.</p> <p>I want to touch on a few issues.  The Mica Action Group said the Bill before the D&aacute;il was not fit for purpose.  It did not give homeowners 100% redress.  The Minister addressed some issues, and I am enlightened by what he has had to say, but there are particular concerns.  The group says it does not make sense to rebuild on suspect foundations and that the Government in this Bill is ignoring the science on the possible presence of other minerals.  It has also argued that people should be allowed to downsize.  The Minister reassured me here today that people will be allowed to downsize.  The issue is that people thought they could downsize from 2,000 sq. ft to 1,500 sq. ft and keep the difference.  There are issues in that regard.  This is public money at the end of the day.  I am mindful of the fact that this is a redress scheme.  It is not really an insurance scheme.  It is the State stepping up to the plate, acknowledging that there was wrong and that there were shortcomings on behalf of the State and the monitoring authorities.  That is another day's work.  We are going to have to pursue the people involved here, because that has sometimes got lost in all the debate.</p> <p>I say to the Minister that is important that we work together.  We have an opportunity in the Seanad to refine and improve the redress scheme.  I also acknowledge the Minister's heavy emphasis on the regulations.  That is something he has the scope for, and I believe he is sensitive enough to the issues.  Politically, practically and realistically, they are issues that we must address.  We work in an economy, but we also work in a society and in the context of politics too.  There must be proper and democratic engagement in politics.  Nobody wants to be the subject of bully-boy tactics by anybody in politics or to be cajoled into a situation and respond in an irresponsible way or in a way that is unreasonable and unfair and draws on the funds, finances and expertise of this State.  The State is standing up and acknowledging there were shortcomings.  Let us move on now and get people homes.  I acknowledge the work in that regard.</p> <p>This is a very controversial issue and culpability and liability are something on which we need to put a great emphasis.  I will not stand up here and name suspect quarries, providers of building materials or builders.  We all know that there are issues in that regard.  I urge the Minister to commit to pursuing through the courts those that made and sold defective concrete blocks and other products.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is difficult and there are issues involved.  I understand the concerns of the action groups around the damage threshold to eligibility for the grants, the shortfall of the mediation costs and the lack of a full financial downsizing option to rebuild a smaller home.  The Minister has explained and touched on that.  It is important we are with the public and are not tone deaf to the impact of this scandal.  The members of the public who have been affected by this are no fools.  They know where the blame lies.  They know the political games that are being played out by some.  At the end of the day, they will decipher the detail of all the promises and ultimately make their own call and act accordingly.  That is an important point.</p><p>I will touch on a few other points in the time I have remaining.  These are areas that have not been touched on comprehensively.  Ms Caroline Timmons and the Minister's staff circulated a circular I find helpful.  The circular listed a number of items.  The Minister has touched on the pathway for other counties and he may touch on it again.  The independent appeals process will be fully independent.  That is important and we need that reassurance.  When is it going to happen?  I know there are timelines involved and a process to be followed.</p><p>There is an issue over the properties that have been excluded.  We must get one principal home for everyone dealt with, but that is an issue of concern.  The wrongdoing, public accountability and the public inquiry are issues the members of the public affected by this scandal want to know something about.</p><p>There is also the issue of supporting the vulnerable householders.  There are people who have been mentally, physically and financially broken and we must support them.  We must put in place packages of support.  Those people are devastated.  People have suggested there are a few scammers out there but I do not buy into that.  The majority of the people affected are decent and hard working.  Many of them are in their 60s. They are without an income and do not expect to have an income.  They want to replace and rebuild their homes.  That is important.</p><p>There are two further issues I wish to mention.  The first relates to ongoing resources for our local authorities.  A number of local authorities are going to be burdened for a long time with the responsibility of acting as agents on behalf of the State and the scheme.  I would like the Minister to assure us that, particularly in Donegal and the other counties we know are affected, there will be sufficient expertise and professional resources.  We do not require them to be allocated permanently.  They should be drafted in to complement the local authorities.  The Housing Agency has a role in all of this.  It is important we have funding in place.</p><p>We are going to have to make decisions this week about this Bill.  On the whole, my gut feeling is that it is worthy of support.  It is a difficult one.  There are political considerations in all of our decisions.  We are politicians.  We must take actions in the common good of the State and consider how best we can address the issues.  We must put in a fair and reasonable redress scheme, support the Government and get on with the job.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.49" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#J00200"><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House this morning.  I thank not only him but also his Department, everyone who has worked on the defective concrete blocks working group and all of the homeowners who have so patiently engaged with the Minister, Department officials and the local authorities concerned.</p> <p>This legislation is very important.  This is about families' homes.  This saga has been going on for more than a decade.  I commend the Minister from a Fianna F&aacute;il perspective.  We were the only political party in the most recent general election to call out this issue in our manifesto.  We have committed to the pursuit of a solution for the homes of the families who have been affected.  The Minister has been true to his word since taking office when this Government was formed.  He made it a priority and persisted with it as a priority when others would have sought to deflect, delay and divide.  The Minister has stayed the course and is to be commended on that.  It is easy to understand why he did so.  The majority of us in this House believe access to a secure home is a basic human right.  The families whose homes have been affected have been denied that basic comfort and right.  The scheme that was in place when this Government took office failed those homeowners.  It failed to provide them with sufficient support and redress.  It was essential and necessary for the scheme to be reviewed and improved.  I and my party believe this is a significantly improved scheme.  We believe it will deliver for homeowners and give them the opportunity to restore their homes and to reclaim their lives.  The defective concrete blocks Bill underpins the new, enhanced scheme.  We share the Minister's sense of urgency and his desire to see this Bill passed as soon as possible so that the scheme can be implemented and, most importantly, made available to those families who desperately want to reclaim their lives.</p> <p>A multibillion euro State intervention such as this is unprecedented but it is an exceptional situation.  It is absolutely right for the State to intervene in these exceptional circumstances.  We saw how the State intervened during the national emergency that was the pandemic.  This emergency has affected the north west of our country and it is essential the homeowners and families are supported and that this unprecedented multibillion euro State intervention is made.</p> <p>We want to see the scheme up and operating as soon as possible.  We welcome the fact the grant has moved from 90% to 100% redress.  That is absolutely appropriate.  It is also welcome the overall maximum grant cap has been increased from &euro;247,5000 to &euro;420,000.  That will cover 99% of the homes affected.  It will not cover all of the built structures but will cover the family homes and the principal private residences, which is important.</p> <p>We also welcome the fact the improved scheme has a guaranteed second grant option for the non-rebuild remediation, if that is required, and the second grant option will remain with the home and will be in place for 40 years.  The Government has agreed to extend the scheme to additional counties, as required, and that is welcome.  I would like the Minister, in his reply, to outline the timing and the process by which that will happen.</p> <p>The other changes include the expansion of the eligibility from owner-occupied private principal residences to include properties registered with the Residential Tenancy Board.  That is welcome.  It will potentially bring another 7,500 family homes into the scheme.  That is also welcome.</p> <p>We note the omission of holiday properties and vacant properties.  We agree the option that exists with the repair and lease scheme is a good route for those property owners to enter the scheme.  It will also allow us to increase stock, which we need to do.</p> <p>In his reply, will the Minister outline to the House the timeline for the establishment of an independent appeals mechanism?  What is the process by which that will be achieved?  The Government is also establishing a new building standards regulator and a builders register.  It has tasked the National Standards Authority of Ireland to review the concrete block standards to ensure the highest standards are complied with in future.  That is important.</p> <p>Everyone in Fianna F&aacute;il supports the legislation and the scheme, and the allocation of unprecedented public funds to the scheme to help homeowners.  We also want to see some accountability.  We all know the pressure families are under because of the cost of living.  Fianna F&aacute;il is constantly pushing the Minister and the Government for increased funding for affordable homes and affordable childcare.  This &euro;2 billion or more - who knows how much it will be? - is appropriate and needed for these families so their homes can be restored.  It is also important for the State there is accountability on this issue so we know there is some deterrent in place, going forward.</p> <p>The Minister will obviously have the support of the Fianna F&aacute;il group in passing this legislation.  I appeal to members of all parties and none to use our time here productively and constructively.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Thousands of families are desperately waiting for this scheme.

While the passage of this legislation has encountered some opposition in the Lower House over the allocated time given to debate it, it is important to note and to acknowledge the extensive work that was carried out by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which carried out three extensive engagements over eight hours last Friday week with industry experts including the SCSI, Engineers Ireland, Department officials, the Housing Agency and the chair of the expert working group.  Most importantly, we heard from representatives of the families affected by defective blocks.  We heard from the Mica Action Group in Donegal, the Clare Pyrite Action Group and the Mayo Pyrite Action Group.  I acknowledge the work of those groups and many more individuals who have campaigned tirelessly on this issue to ensure that a scheme is put in place which will allow them the opportunity to get their lives back on track.</p> <p>Following that engagement, the Oireachtas joint committee sent a cross-party letter to the Minister asking that a number of items be considered.  Many of them can be addressed by regulation.  It is important that that flexibility is built into the Bill, and I believe it is.  The defective concrete blocks Bill before us underpins a new enhanced scheme to help homeowners with crumbling homes to rebuild and to move on with their lives.  It is an unprecedented multimillion euro State intervention that certainly marks an improvement on the old scheme.  While some may be of the view that there is no rush in getting this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess, I do not subscribe to that viewpoint because without the legislation, we are essentially operating under the old system, which does not include the counties of Limerick and Clare and offers a maximum grant of &euro;247,500 rather than the amount of &euro;420,000 specified in this Bill.</p> <p>The Bill contains many welcome changes to the original scheme and even to the initial draft of this scheme.  It is important to acknowledge that those changes were made in response to feedback from affected homeowners and that the changes were recommended by the expert working group.  Those changes include the likes of retrospective inclusion, an appeals process, a legal footing for certification of remediation and the Housing Agency taking on the cost of testing.  Gone is the sliding scale, and foundations and other materials are being reviewed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.  The scheme can be changed by regulation if required.</p> <p>The Bill has at its core an ambition to provide a fair and equitable solution to homeowners affected by defective concrete blocks.  I acknowledge the work that has been carried out to date by following: the working group between June and September of last year; the expert group between January and April of this year; John O'Connor, who has acted as homeowner liaison, since February to the present day; the Minister's Department officials; everyone who has engaged with the forum; and my Fine Gael colleagues from the affected counties, who have worked with the Minister in a proactive way in order to improve this legislation.</p> <p>While the issue of pyrite and mica has not yet visited my county of Waterford, at least to my knowledge, I am acutely conscious of the devastating impact it has had on affected counties.  To feel secure and comfortable in one's home is something most people take for granted, but the affected families' dreams, hopes and aspirations have effectively been crumbling around them.  The mental stress and strain that have been inflicted on them is immeasurable.  I believe that those families have waited long enough and I want to ensure that this legislation is passed as soon as possible.</p> <p>The Government is also establishing a new building standards regulator and a builders' register and has tasked the NSAI with reviewing concrete block standards to ensure that the highest standards are complied with into the future.  I cannot stress enough the importance of that measure.  We heard some very concerning testimony at the Oireachtas joint committee that defective materials are still being put into circulation from a quarry in the south east.  That is simply intolerable at a time when the State is rightly putting a scheme in place which will cost the taxpayers of this country in excess of &euro;2.8 billion.  We cannot allow similar scenarios to arise in the future.  I urge the Minister to ensure that routine spot-checking is carried out on all quarries across the country in order to ensure we do not face this scenario again in ten or 20 years' time, particularly given we are putting this scheme in place.</p> <p>As for the fair and equitable package for homeowners that we are discussing, we need to take account of inflation.  The funding model for this scheme is based on the comprehensive body of work that was carried out by the SCSI.  I acknowledge and thank its volunteers, who put in many hours of work into coming up with its formula and costings.  There is no denying the fact, however, that things have moved on from February to where we are now and that there has been significant cost inflation in the construction sector, even in that short period.  It is critical that we ensure that the payments in this scheme are adequate, fair and equitable and that families can have access to the amount of money they need to build safe homes and the homes they deserve.  If that is in place, then the issue of downsizing is addressed because it will ensure that 100% redress is in place to allow for those people to build properties to the sizes of their choosing.</p> <p>I appeal to the Minister and to the officials in the Department and in the Housing Agency to ensure that this scheme is made as easy to access as possible for homeowners.  We all know as politicians that officials can put overly complicated systems in place that make it far more difficult than is necessary for people to access them.  I ask, therefore, that things are put in simple and plain English in order that people in the affected counties can access what they need to get their lives back on track.  That is what we are seeking today to do as a Government.  We are seeking to ensure that people can move on with their lives and can access the necessary supports to do so.</p></speech>

I welcome the people tuning in from all the counties affected: Limerick, Clare, Mayo, Donegal, Sligo and others.  I think we can all agree that they have run an immense campaign for quite some time.  I know that people in Limerick were pleased that the Minister has included them in the scheme, but people I spoke to last week were completely unimpressed and deeply distressed by the lack of engagement on amendments to the Bill last week.  The people at the heart of this campaign have their homes literally crumbling down around them, and the Minister knows that.  Everybody knows the awful situations in which families in homes with defective blocks are living.  They fear their houses will fall down around them as their children sleep at night.  The Minister said of the campaigners in his opening remarks on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il:</p> <blockquote> 	...  they took their message directly to the Government through all routes available.  We have listened and heard it loud and clear. </blockquote> <p>If the Minister has truly listened to the families at the heart of this crisis, why were so many of them in tears on Wednesday night as they left the D&aacute;il Chamber?  I will quote directly from an email we were sent this morning from one of the people in the Gallery of the D&aacute;il during the debate.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	I sat distraught in the gallery of the Dail when the so called enhanced defective block bill was voted on, on Wednesday evening as my future was decided...I watched grown men and campaigners crying on their knees after hearing the result, an image I will never forget as they realised they will not be able to keep their families safe.  It felt like a death had already taken place and we were grieving. </blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The voice we have not heard so far in this debate is the voice of the homeowners.</p></speech>

I am quoting directly from them; these are their voices.  They say:</p> <blockquote> 	It is imperative that the voice of the Homeowners, the victims of Defective materials, is heard and ... [in particular] the Government ... [politicians] ... listen before it is too late.  Listen, because to date, you have not listened. We are angry, frustrated and the endless torture will not be tolerated to go on a minute further. </blockquote> <p>I have a second quote:</p> <blockquote> 	Last week we were due to see ... A workable scheme that would enable the thousands of homeowners across 13 counties to move forward with their lives. Instead, what was delivered over 60 pages was contempt for us homeowners, in the same week the Housing Committee heard quarries are still producing defective materials. How can we [be expected to] trust a system which is not fit for purpose failing in its responsibility to protect victims, citizens, and taxpayers?  Threats of fines and imprisonment for innocent homeowners.  Minister nowhere mentioned were the equivalent fines or threats of imprisonment for the true perpetrators in this.  The producers of these defective blocks, including giants of the Irish ... [construction] Industry. </blockquote> <p>Again, let met stress those are not my words but those of the homeowners who were, unfortunately, ignored last week.  I have a further quote:</p> <blockquote> 	To date this government has broken all parliamentary process when trying to rush this scheme through the statutory legislative stages.  You have given us no time to review the bill, no time to debate the bill, no time to even communicate and discuss the consequences of the long-term aspects of the bill to the thousands of homeowners whose lives will be destroyed by not only defective blocks, but your failure to provide true redress for the problem. </blockquote> <p>The statement concludes:</p> <blockquote> 	Minister let us be [very] clear, so our words are not misunderstood. If this bill is not amended, we the homeowners will not support it.  We will continue our campaign and protests until it is amended, until it is fit for purpose.  Fit for the citizens of this country who need to avail of it to fix their homes.  It is not just our houses that this is destroying, but our daily lives, our working lives, our family lives, our physical and mental wellbeing, the very fabric of our communities. </blockquote> <p>That is the judgment that was passed on the Minister's response to the Bill last Wednesday, specifically, his refusal to take amendments.  Even the Government's own Deputy from Donegal, Deputy McHugh, voted against the Bill because he knows it is not right.</p><p>During Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il the Government refused to accept amendments that would make a real difference to the scheme and make it workable, for example those on the earlier SCSI updating of costings that Senator Cummins has mentioned.  He has called out the fact we have inflation.  The Senator is right.  The good news is he has an amendment to vote on in that regard.  However, there is a problem, and one we have seen far too often in this political field.  I went through with care the contributions on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and saw Government Deputies talking about all the things that needed to be done to improve the Bill.  Despite this, when it came to voting and having acknowledged the Bill was not where it needed to be, each and every one of them, with the exception of Deputy McHugh, went into the voting lobby to support the Bill.  Is it any wonder people were disgusted, crying and deeply upset?  A colleague of mine from County Clare was there with colleagues from the county who are not of our party.  One of them swore and said, &quot;I know this man won't let me down&quot; - but he did.  He did not even give eye contact up to the Gallery and he voted in the lobby to reject amendments he promised he would support.  That is the reality.</p><p>Some of these amendments were very simple.  Take the idea foundations are excluded.  Let us be clear about that.  It means when this Bill is launched, if an engineer comes to a house he will not be able to check the foundations, or not until such time as foundations are included in the scheme.  We know that is months, or perhaps a year away.  That is the reality at the moment.  These were sensible amendments that could have and should have been listened to but were not.  Let me stress again the words I quoted are not mine but those of the homeowners, many of whom said to me over the weekend they could not face coming back down here again this morning, having been let down so badly by their own local politicians.</p><p>To speak again on Limerick, we do not even the true number there.  We think it might be around 750 houses.  It is hugely significant.  It is good we are included in the scheme but it is entirely unacceptable we still have key issues like penalties for downsizing, the exclusion of foundations and the SCSI costings which, under the Minster's Bill, we will have to wait 12 months to see any change to.</p><p>These are fundamental issues that must be grasped and this is the Minister's last chance; this is the opportunity.  I must be frank and say I do not believe the Minister will accept a single amendment but I hope he will at last listen because what is clear from the statement from homeowners is he has not listened to date.  He has not taken heed of their concerns and people feel betrayed.  That is the truth of the matter.  They feel betrayed and they are watching this debate this morning.  They will be watching Committee Stage.  I again put on record my deep disappointment we do not have enough time to debate these amendments.  I acknowledge the Leader gave us an extra two hours and I welcome it but to rush this Bill though in the way the Government has is, given the complexities of it, hugely disrespectful not just to us on the Opposition benches but to everyone in this Chamber.  The Minister can and must do better.</p></speech>

I first heard of mica about five years ago.  That we are this stage today shows this Bill has been a long time coming.  I pay particular tribute to the campaigners, elected representatives and the thousands of people, including the affected householders, their families and the communities who have campaigned to get the Bill to this point.  As they would say, it does not far enough.  Let us not forget it took two massive protests where 25,000 people attended on each occasion, bringing parts of Dublin a halt, to get the Government to sit up and listen.</p> <p>It is important to say that when I read the detail, there are real improvements on what was originally proposed.  There are improvements on the scale of money that is on offer and on the type of houses that are going to be covered.  I had a particular concern about those living in rental accommodation.  They will spend their lives living in rental accommodation and there was not an incentive for their landlord to address the mica issues in the house.  They will now be included in the scheme.</p> <p>However, it is a real pity that, notwithstanding the improvements, there is almost a good deal on offer here - almost.  It is not a good deal though.  It does not go far enough.  We are within touching distance of that good deal, yet the Minister and the Department are refusing to take amendments.  They are refusing to finish off and get this scheme over the line and into a place where householders will have the confidence and know they can get on with their lives and get on with rebuilding their houses.  There are so many who are now bitterly disappointed about the unnecessary rigidity of the provisions of the Bill before us.</p> <p>There are very serious issues.  Foundations of a house are not appropriately dealt with in this Bill.  There is the issue associated with downsizing.  There is the issue with future-proofing.  We have heard from families that they are now terrified if they help their parents get their house in order by accessing the scheme and the parents come to live with them in future they will be precluded from accessing the scheme if there is mica in both houses.  Then there is the issue of retrospection.  The Minister has been in Donegal and in Mayo and the other counties.  He has seen the houses that are crumbling.  These families have already had to spend thousands to keep a roof over their heads and to keep those houses from collapsing on their children.  How can he look them in the eye and say to them there is nothing for them in this scheme?  This is what they believe at the moment because there is no retrospection for those who have already had to put money into their houses.  We will be putting forward amendments.  We are hopeful the Minister will engage.  The record of the D&aacute;il for last week speaks for itself.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Like Senators Boyhan and Cummins, I believe that after this Bill is passed the key question is what will the Minister and his Department do to go after those who created this mess in the first place.  The State messed up by turning a blind eye to regulating building suppliers and building standards because the State now must pay.  What will be done to those who were negligent and thereby responsible for this mess?  We have not heard very much from the Department in that regard.</p><p>For almost 18 years I have been a visitor to the Inishowen Peninsula in County Donegal and it is where my husband comes from so I know the depth of feeling, desperation and anger felt among that community.  There is a real sense of frustration that the company that sold the faulty blocks that were used in affected houses cannot be held to account because of the ten-year statute of limitations on product liability.  There is an anger and frustration in the community that the company was able to fold and its directors could set up a new company.  For the past few years posters about a company can be seen all over the Inishowen Peninsula, which asks people to boycott the company thus leaving its workers in a very difficult situation.  Nobody should be subjected to intimidation but the key issue is that the company has been allowed to continue trading.  How can we channel frustration into action?</p><p>I wish to emphasise that this issue is not just about mica.  It is about the near 100,000 apartments across Dublin and the rest of the country that have fire defects.  The Department has established a working group but the Minister knows that the State will have to step up to the plate and cover for the fact that the Government in the early 2000s chose to turn a blind eye to regulating builders and building suppliers.  We need to hear what the Government is doing.  To the families and communities who are looking at proceedings here, I must state that there have been improvements but such efforts do not go far enough.  We plead with the Minister to make a number of simple changes to the Bill, which the Labour Partly and I believe would deliver a good deal for the people who have been affected by mica.</p></speech>

I want to say the following to Michael and all of the affected homeowners.  You have done nothing wrong.  You have done all of the right things.</p> <p>Please bear in mind that the Mica Acting Group was established in 2013 yet we are talking about this issue as if it came to our attention two or three years ago.  The Government has let down the people, and the affected homeowners need more than words right now.  I offer my solidarity to the homeowners.  Later this week, I will table very strong amendments in order to fix this bad legislation.  Last week in the D&aacute;il, the Opposition tabled more than 150 amendments and not one of them was supported.  All of the amendments were designed to make sure this legislation listened to and addressed the concerns of homeowners.  A lot of these amendments were bought forward on behalf of campaigners.</p> <p>A fortnight ago, young innovators were in the audiovisual room and explained to us the impact that mica has had on their wellbeing.  I have not heard one person speak about the future of young people in, say, counties Limerick, Donegal and Clare.  People are worried and stressed by this issue, including young people who are studying for their leaving and junior certificate examinations.</p> <p>I will vote against this Bill as it stands.  I encourage the Minister to listen to the people.  This legislation is our last chance.  Obviously Senators have less power than Deputies but on Wednesday we can come together as a House and prove that we are here for the people affected, particularly as this House is meant to be the people's House.  If there are no changes made to this Bill then Senators should vote against it and the Minister also has the power to vote against it.</p> <p>I hope that the Minister can give me a straightforward answer to my question.  Did he speak to the campaigners?  Today, we are discussing a Bill and a lot of the time I would state the ethos "nothing about us without us", which is a phrase that we have heard so many times.  I agree with my colleague, Senator Sherlock, that we only have a certain way to go and this Bill can be made ideal if our amendments are accepted.  I ask the Minister, if he can, to name the campaigners that he worked with to come up with the Bill and ask for that because the people do not feel that they have been listened to.</p> <p>I live in County Donegal where I have heard mothers say that their children's clothes are full of mould, their houses are cold, and that they are afraid that their homes will crumble on top them and their family.  These are real-life scenarios for people.  Last week, a presenter on my local radio station said at the end of the programme that having spoken to mica campaigners he felt that he had to announce a list of helplines that assist people with their mental health.</p> <p>I feel that County Donegal has been forgotten and is the forgotten county.  I also know that there are homes in many different counties that have been affected by mica.  I firmly believe that people should not have to live in fear that their house will collapse on top of them.  I, again, ask the Minister to name the group that he has worked with.</p> <p>Last week, Deputy Pringle tabled very good amendments in the D&aacute;il and I hope to bring some of his amendments forward here.  What is money when people's lives are at risk and people are forced to live in accommodation of a very poor standard?  I urge the Minister to think before Wednesday and include our amendments while viewing them as a collective coming together.  These amendments are not our amendments.  They are not my amendments.  They are the amendments of the campaigners.  Again, nothing about us without us and campaigners need to be included.</p> <p>I wish to say "fair play" to Deputy Joe McHugh.  It is not easy to go against one's party but one must do what is right, live by one's values and principles and listen to one's gut feeling.  I give credit to Deputy Joe McHugh for doing so.  I hope that Senators will decide to make a difference and vote against the Bill, as it stands.</p></speech>

I thank some of the Opposition spokespersons for their thoughtful approach to this legislation.  Both Senators Boyhan and Flynn talked about bringing this legislation back to the people.  They are 100% right that this legislation must be about the applicants and the affected homeowners.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall Blaney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1812"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1812&amp;amp;pid=NiallBlaneyIND&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is about their chances of getting their lives back in order again.  This has been an awful, traumatic time for these people.  A lot of work has gone into this over the past two years.  The Bill did not arise two months ago.  It arose from consultation with the Minister and the Mica Action Group.  Following weeks of going into the Minister's office, I met him and the action group in Donegal when he launched the first scheme.  It was not a scheme of his making but he launched it to get the measures under way and to see at what stage we were.  There has been an enormous evolution of the scheme since August 2020 because of the Minister's flexibility in meeting the action group and homeowners, as well as working with us as politicians.  The Minister and officials from his Department have put in hundreds of hours, as we have, into this.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, has put in hundreds of hours separately meeting with the action group.  Due to the transformation of the scheme, today's scheme is unrecognisable from the original scheme.  The key demand from the first gathering in Dublin was 100% redress and that is addressed in the Bill, as well as many other issues.  We would like for the Bill to include more and I will bring some of these concerns to the floor of the House today.</p><p>I also received phone calls during the weekend.  I was at a meeting in Buncrana last night.  There is so much misinformation and information out there that people do not know if they are coming or going.  People are in real distress and they need to know what the true information is.  The Government could set up a specific website for information purposes to give people proper direction on this.  Engineers are key to this.  Politicians can say one thing on one side of the House and something else on the other side, but the families are caught in between and that anger has to come out.  This scheme must progress.  People need to get on with their lives and in doing that, a website would be helpful.  Engineers involved will play a key role.  The relationship between engineers and applicants is important.  At the end of the day, homeowners should pay less attention to what we as politicians say from here on and should consult their engineer, from whom the real information is obtained.  There is too much misinformation and toing and froing, and we do not always have the facts right.  Engineers have to have the facts right because they have to provide and stand over guarantees.</p><p>I was present during the eight hours of the committee hearing.  It was a tremendous piece of work because we heard first-hand from the homeowners what the issues were.  I heard very clearly what the representatives of Engineers Ireland said about foundations.  The institution is pleading with people to let it know if they have information on foundations or have a house with foundations that are in trouble because at the moment, its clear understanding is there are no foundations in any county where there is bother.  Even the scientist who came before the committee was asked to pass on the information he had of where his samples came from.  That information has not been passed on yet.  If there is information about foundations available, let us have it.  I am glad the Government gave the guarantee this morning that foundations will be included in the provision if and when the National Standards Authority of Ireland reports on it, but there is a great fear among people that foundations will fall apart.  The solid information from Engineers Ireland, which provides the standard by which we go because there is no other standard provider, is that there is no difficulty with any foundations in Ireland at present.  The scientific work is now under way but until that is complete, the foundations cannot be included in the provisions.  That is the way the Government works and if it did not, there would be many other issues.</p><p>I raise the matter of the demolition of houses after remedial works have been granted or requested by an engineer.  When such work is being undertaken, if it is found that the blockwork has deteriorated to an extent that requires demolition, demolition is not included under the Bill and the house may deteriorate further in the medium term.  We need a provision on that.</p><p>There are many other issues I wish to raise, which I will do during the moving of amendments in the next Stages of the Bill.  I want to get this Bill under way, because many people want to get their houses and lives back in order.  While it does not include every provision that I would like, it is as much as we can get at the moment.</p></speech>

I thank him and the Department for their work on the Bill, as well as for the inclusion of Limerick within its provisions.  I recall when I got involved with the people in Limerick who were affected by pyrite in their foundations.  At the time, they met the Pyrite Resolution Board.  Some people who were affected by mica came to the same meeting and it had to be explained to them that while they were similarly affected, this was a different scheme.  We received support from the Pyrite Resolution Board and Mr. Jack Keyes, chairman, at the time.  They were very clear about how we could apply to the scheme.  I made the application on behalf of the residents.  When Limerick was included, many people got excited and thought they could apply because they were affected by mica but they are two different schemes.  I have seen the crumbling bricks and the deprivation in houses and how it affects families.  I understand the stress it is causing to so many family.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for the inclusion of counties Clare and Limerick in the scheme.  It came as a recommendation to him and he decided to add it under the Bill.  I understand the stress families around Ireland have experienced.  The fact that the scheme has been increased up to a maximum of over &euro;200,000 from the original scheme is to be welcomed.  I presume that was done because of the increased costs associated with building and a lack of supplies.  I ask that the Minister keep that figure under review.  I know he is committed to working with the groups.</p> <p>I compliment the groups and all those involved who came together and put their case.  I look forward to supporting the Bill, which has come a long way.  While some people believe it has not fully addressed their concerns, I believe it will address many of the issues affecting families.  What is the timeframe by which homeowners in Limerick will be able to avail of the scheme?  I understand the scheme has to be up and running before they can apply, or maybe I am wrong on that.</p> <p>Other Senators have referred to quarries, and I am aware the Minister has sought an independent investigation into quarries, mainly in Donegal.  I would like that expanded to quarries around the country.  I again refer to the pyrite issues.  Bricks may have been bought from the same quarry that supplied people with bricks who were affected by pyrite.  In speaking to homeowners about where they purchased their building materials, there seems to be a quarry in common.  While I will not name the quarry, it is important that quarries are examined to ensure they are not adding to the cost to the State, in that they are no longer selling defective materials.  While they may not have known about it at the time, it is quite serious due to the number of houses affected in Ireland.  Will the Department consider clawing back some of the costs from these quarries?  If they were knowingly selling defective products, they should have to contribute towards to cost of the scheme.</p> <p>The fact that people are allowed to downsize is very important because clarity was not provided on that for a while and there was a lot of misinformation out there.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I welcome the fact that people are allowed to downsize under the scheme.

I admire the tenacity, the drive and the vision of those involved to put in the time and the energy to keep the pressure up, to come to Dublin month after month and week after week, and to make sure their voices were heard by leaving no other option for the Government.  I thank them, in particular, for showing that it can be done, and that real change at the highest level is brought about by a dogged determination of real people to make it happen.  This campaign was a tireless grassroots movement on an issue that really matters.  There was no astroturfing, no political clout posturing and no slick media campaigns from interest lobbyist NGOs.  There were just Irish families taking a stand and saying that something needed to be done about this and that they were not going anywhere until it happened.  I sincerely hope that we see more of this in the years to come, and that more people in this country realise their power to make a change.</p> <p>There are a few concerns in relation to this Bill.  One of them is a meta concern that is not so much about the Bill itself, but the manner in which it is being put before the House.  It is a point that we have, no doubt, heard many times this week.  There are some Bills which simply should not form part of the Government's annual scramble to pass legislation before the summer recess.  This is one of them.  It was pointed out at the end of last month in the Lower House that it seemed rushed for a Bill with a price tag of up to &euro;3 billion to schedule Committee and Remaining Stages in one day, particularly when we appreciate that it is almost ten years now since the issue first appeared.  The D&aacute;il did not even get halfway through the Committee Stage amendments, with none on Report Stage.  That is no way to do business on a matter as important at this.</p> <p>The nitty-gritty of the proposed redress scheme, when it comes to cost calculation, has left many fearing that they will still be stuck with an unpayable bill, despite the theoretical 100% redress of the scheme.  This must be avoided at all costs.</p> <p>Clarity and peace of mind are owed to all who have been affected by the issue.  Concerns have been raised that options in respect of downsizing, demolition and rebuilding are not adequately provided for in the Bill.  These concerns must also be addressed.</p> <p>We all would have liked to have had this Bill before us sooner, or to have had more time to consider it.  I hope that the homeowners of counties Donegal, Mayo, Sligo, Clare and Limerick and all others who have been affected see that some progress will be made in the House on this terribly important issue.  The Minister has the power to accept amendments that will strengthen the Bill.  I ask him to listen, act and show leadership by accepting amendments that will deliver just redress for the people affected by mica.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister and his officials for the huge amount of effort that they have made to try to come up with a satisfactory resolution to the nightmare for the people affected by mica in County Donegal and other counties.  I would like to pay tribute to those families who have been living through a nightmare for the past ten years or more, and who are desperately looking for something very simple to enable them to get their lives back on track, to rebuild the homes that they took mortgages out on and to get back to the way they were.  We are talking about compensating people for the damage done to their buildings.  Regardless of how much compensation is given to any individual homeowner, it will not come anywhere close to compensating them fully for the nightmare that they are living through.  Everybody in this Chamber knows somebody who is going through it at the moment.  I wish to pay tribute to the families affected for the dignified manner in which they have conducted the campaign.  They travelled to Dublin in their thousands this time last year.  The manner in which they conducted themselves on that day was recognised by everyone.  I pay tribute to them for that.</p> <p>I also want to pay tribute to the Minister's officials and his Department for their effort to try to find a resolution to the issue.  It is the second attempt to try to get a scheme that is acceptable to people.  As my colleague Senator Blaney outlined earlier, this scheme is a vast improvement on the first one.  However, what disappoints me is that despite so much effort going into the scheme, there are many people who still have genuine questions that remain unanswered.  I welcome the fact that we are finally implementing legislation to try to address the issue, but there are still gaps.  People still have many questions that so far have not been answered.  I suppose it is understandable that no piece of legislation can fully encompass everything that is required.  If any of us were going to build a dwelling house or any other building tomorrow morning, we would learn that things are very hard to plan from start to finish.  Things happen and issues arise that no one can foresee or legislate for.  This legislation is no different.  I welcome the fact that we are finally up and running with this.  I was heartened by the comments of the Minister at the start of the debate today, when he said that he will leave nobody behind in this, and that people will not be short-changed.  He said that if people have issues, he will listen to them.  Of all the contributions I have heard today, that is the one that gives me the greatest solace.  I thank the Minister for that.  The people and families affected are not looking to make money out of the scheme.  All they are trying to do is to end up with the home that they have dreamed of from day one - ten years' hence in some cases.  That is all they are looking for - no more and no less.  No person affected should have to put their hand in their own pocket to get back to where they were over ten years ago.  I am heartened by the Minister's comments.</p> <p>It is also important that before we look forward too much, we look back.  As a few speakers have mentioned today, we must ensure those who are responsible for this nightmare are held to account.</p></speech>

Where is the State on that journey as it attempts to make those responsible accountable for their actions?  Another question has been raised with me several times.  If I were to order a lorryload of blocks tomorrow morning, could I be 100% satisfied that those blocks would not be defective and there would be no issues with them?  Would I have any comeback if there were issues?  I would like that question answered today.   I compliment the Minister on the scheme.  I am aware that he and his officials have put a huge amount of effort into producing it.  The families affected have been on this journey for over a decade.  All they want is to get their lives back.  They have been living through a nightmare.  The pressure that it has put on families, marriages and children is incomprehensible.  As I said previously, no matter how much compensation these people get, it will not come close to the heartache and turmoil that they have experienced for the last number of years.</p></speech>

They have fought an incredible battle.  It is important to acknowledge that while they are fighting this campaign, they are also living with the stress of not knowing whether their house will survive the next storm.  That is an enormous amount of pressure to be living with.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Everybody knows that one's home is fundamental to stability in one's life and to one's mental health.  These homeowners have taken time off work, have footed the costs incurred in travelling from across the country to Leinster House and the only thing they are looking for is fairness.  They invested in a home for themselves and for their families and all of this is due to the failures of the State and the light-touch regulation we have had in this State for ever.  This regulation has been repeatedly resisted.  It seems that we always have to have a crisis before there are changes in the regulations to protect people.  All they are looking for is fairness.  It always seems to be the way that there is one law for ordinary citizens and another one for business interests.  </p><p>We will be debating the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022 on the Stardust tragedy later on today.  This is another example of where vested interests trumped families.  </p><p>It is simply astounding that we listened to Senators who are members of Government political parties admit today that defective blocks still are being produced.  </p><p>It is also unbelievable that we have not heard at all of how the State is not putting every resource available into pursuing those who are responsible for the existing houses in order that they foot the bill for the damage they have caused.  Too often we have heard the phrase that lessons will be learned.  It is a phrase that is just thrown out.  What lessons are being learned if defective blocks are still being produced and if those responsible for the existing houses have not been held to account or pursued in the courts?</p><p>Returning to the Bill in front of us, however, the first thing to say is the procedure has been shoddy.  When citizens of this country walk away in despair from the Houses of Parliament, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, after having been traumatised, everybody has to put their hands up to say the legislators have failed them.</p></speech>

There are people who will not have the excess money, because the costs have increased, to rebuild their home to the same size as it was.  There is no money to be made out of this and all they are asking is that they will then reduce the size of the house in order that the money they will get from the State will cover the 100% rebuilding of their house.  That is all that there are asking for.  They are not looking to put any money in their bank and are literally prepared to downsize their own home so that they would not be out of pocket, because they do not have the money.  That is the reality of this; they do not have it.  How will they be able to build the house to the exact footprint if they do not have the money?</p> <p>The other issue around the inflation, the SCSI report, which was brought up this morning, refers to the costings which go back to January and they will not be reviewed, as far as is my understanding, for 12 months.

It is meant to be a safe place where a person can go and rest.</p> <p>Seeing people forced to live in houses that crumble around them is absolutely devastating.  I cannot get the images and videos of the homes built with defective mica blocks out of my head.  In some of the online videos, the blocks come apart like damp sand when touched.  It is an absolute nightmare from which thousands of people across the country have been unable to wake up.  </p> <p>It is an indictment of the cowboy capitalist attitude that has pervaded elements of the construction sector for some time now, where there was a culture of cutting corners to maximum profit for all, while risking the health and lives of the people living in substandard and sometimes hazardous buildings.  It is not just the homes which are riddled with mica and pyrite but it also concerns the defective apartments that were rendered unlivable, like Priory Hall.  It is also the damp rodent-infested local authority housing that violates the dignity and humanity of its residents.</p> <p>People are made to live in dire, dangerous conditions and the State, by its negligent attitude to regulation and enforcement, is complicit in the disasters which unfolded.</p> <p>The mica homeowners deserve 100% redress.</p></speech>

It is a core function of Government to enact and enforce laws and regulations which prevent market actors from engaging in dangerous, deceptive and dishonest conduct.  This Bill does not satisfy the demands of the mica families and campaigners.  Redress is about making a person who has been injured whole.  It needs to be proportionate and adequate and this Bill, unfortunately, is neither.</p> <p>There are many issues with this Bill, as the number of amendments compiled by activists and submitted by Opposition Deputies and Senators indicate.  One particularly unbelievable one which I want to highlight is the potential penalisation of the redress scheme participants who choose to rebuild smaller homes so as not to incur costs.  These homeowners are making a practical concession and a real sacrifice to deal with the flaws in the redress plan and they face further reductions in their entitlement.  This is very shoddy treatment.  The mica families have been failed by the State all over again. </p> <p>The crumbling mica houses are people&rsquo;s homes but they are also crime scenes.  They are evidence of fraud on a gigantic scale which has had a devastating impact on the lives of these homeowners and their families and is about to cost the Exchequer &euro;3 billion.  What a catastrophe this is.  </p> <p>The quarries which sold the defective material that caused this crisis need to be held to account.  However, like most Irish people, I do not feel optimistic that there will be consequences.  The Irish people are continually left holding the bag when the Government is forced to intervene in scandals and in crises.  The banks were bailed out; the church was indemnified against abuse claims; and time and time again, Irish taxpayers have been made to pay for the criminal behaviour of deeply corrupt institutions.</p></speech>

Sometimes, we get so caught up in the intricacies of the legislative process and haggling over the granular details, that we fail to comprehend the immense emotional and psychological impact of the issues we debate.  When we think of the costs of the mica crisis, we can estimate the cost of rebuilding homes and the incidental practical costs such as emergency accommodation in hotels, but we must also consider the mental health fall-out of this disaster, that is, the stress of living in crumbling homes and the anxiety of families over their safety and future.  Their anger at being let down by those in power must be horrendous.  These feelings are difficult to accommodate and, for many, they will leave a lasting impact.  We must ensure there are adequate supports available to help everyone who has been wounded during this saga recover, not just materially, but psychologically and emotionally. </p><p>I commend the people and families impacted by this disaster and the communities that have rallied around them.  They have shown extraordinary resilience, courage and tenacity.  By sharing their stories, demanding political and media attention and protesting in great numbers, they have made themselves impossible to ignore.  I have to say well done to all.</p></speech>

I have visited people in County Clare whose homes are affected by pyrite.  They are decent, honest and hard-working people.  Some of them do not have their homes that long.  Others have had their homes for quite some time and are on the verge of retirement.  They have found themselves in a situation in which their homes are disintegrating around them.  They are not in the middle of this crisis and media storm by choice.  They are ordinary, decent people who just want to get on with their lives.  I know the Minister has visited homes in Clare, so he knows exactly what I am talking about.</p> <p>Yes, the legislation before us will be very expensive and it is a significant improvement on other presentations of legislation in the past.  I understand clearly that it is not what everybody wants, but we in this Chamber and those in the D&aacute;il can alter and amend legislation, if we find that it is clearly not working.  I wish to see the scheme rolled out very efficiently and quickly, with little red tape, and boots on the ground in the counties affected to ensure people can be assessed and dealt with quickly.  The last thing we want is to see a scheme surrounded and pulled down by bureaucracy.  We have seen it time and again with schemes in this country.  We cannot let that happen, because time is of the essence.  This has gone on too long and we cannot delay it any further.</p> <p>However, if unintended situations happen during that initiation period, I ask that the Minister be prepared and open-minded enough to come in with amending legislation to deal with it, because we have the power in this House to legislate, but we also have the power to amend legislation and that is not a bad thing.  It is important that legislation evolves and is reflective of a particular situation, because there are unintended consequences in many areas.  I have no doubt about and would not question for one minute the sincerity of the Minister in this and with the best will in the world, there may be elements of the legislation that do not and cannot work in practice, for whatever reason.  In that situation, we have to have the courage of our convictions to amend.</p></speech>

I have taken a detailed note of all contributions.  I will, during the course of Committee Stage, get an opportunity to respond to many of them.  This legislation, as Senator Blaney rightly said, has not just come about in the past two months.  It follows more than two years of direct engagement with homeowners through the various fora we have set up, my meetings directly with them, my own officials, the Housing Agency and the liaison group chaired by Mr. John O'Connor and others.  I have never seen engagement like it on legislation to improve a scheme.  I welcome the constructive remarks of most here today.  I recognise that every Senator, regardless of the nature of his or her remarks, wants a scheme in place that works for people.  That is what I want, fundamentally.</p> <p>Anyone who looks at the legislation will see there are major, significant changes from the old scheme to now.  It is a significant intervention by the State to the tune of approximately &euro;2.7 billion and potentially more.  By the way, in October 2021, I engaged with all Opposition parties in the Oireachtas and wrote detailed letters to them.  I say this to Senators Gavan and Boylan and others, because it is important for the record.  We need the record of the House to be correct on this.  I asked specifically for the input of the party of Senators Gavan and Boylan in to the scheme.  The party's housing spokesperson said publicly that he would respond, in detail, to all of the questions that I put to genuinely seek its input.  I have still not received that response.  It is important that people know that.</p> <p>We have moved on, with legislation that I will make sure works.  Over the summer months, we will be working on the regulations to underpin the scheme.  The scheme will, of course, evolve.  There is no question of that, but this provides for 100% redress.  It provides for a second grant option and a 40-year guarantee that the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, Deputies McHugh and Calleary, Senator Blaney and all Government Senators and Deputies in the affected counties advocated very strongly for, in a constructive way, to work on behalf of their constituents, neighbours, friends and families, to bring about the changes we need.  These changes are brought forward here in the Bill.</p> <p>I know very clearly, because I have engaged with the homeowners, how badly they have been affected through this.  I wish to address recourse and we will very shortly appoint a senior counsel review.  I want those who caused this problem be brought to account.  I have said that publicly in both Chambers.  Those who have caused this should be paying into the scheme.  I have stated that we would establish a senior counsel review to look at all options, including an industry levy, on which we have been working with the Department of Finance.</p> <p>I will clearly restate the changes.  Entry to the scheme was a considerable issue for homeowners.  The original scheme was costing between &euro;5,000 and &euro;7,000 to enter.  Many people paid that amount.  We have refunded it.  I made sure that those moneys were refunded to them.  We have removed the financial barrier to entry to the scheme.  We will be absorbing the cost of entry to the scheme, and rightly so.  An initial homeowner outlay to enter the new scheme will be between &euro;500 and &euro;700 for the cost of a building condition assessment, which will be refunded to homeowners once they are accepted.</p> <p>This will be a national scheme.  Clare and Limerick are already included in it.  Senator Maria Byrne asked what would happen to Limerick and Clare.  Once the legislation is passed and the regulations are up and running, those counties come in to the scheme.  There is a pathway for other counties to do so, should there be problems in those counties.  Let us be very clear that if one votes against this legislation, as Senator Gallagher and others have said, one is going back to the January 2020 scheme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They would be going back to a &euro;247,500 grant cap, 90% grant options on all the other remediation options, no guarantee - not even a 20-year one - no second grant option and &euro;7,000 to get into the scheme.  We are going back to an imperfect scheme and we would be starting again.</p><p>I would say to Senator Flynn, and I thank her for her remarks, that we accepted a number of Deputy Pringle&rsquo;s amendments in the D&aacute;il .  We accepted seven amendments in the D&aacute;il on Committee and Report Stages, and I will be open to listening to amendments here as well.  What I do not want though is an ongoing debate into next year and the year after about additions that would delay the establishment of the new scheme.</p><p>I said very clearly, particularly in relation to foundations - anybody who wants to be very clear should look at the evidence given - that should an issue be scientifically proven, and if a problem comes up, it will be included in the scheme.  We are doing the tests and a review of IS 465 is under way and we will be testing foundations.  Are Opposition Deputies and Senators who are opposing this honestly saying to me that we should include that without the scientific evidence, or that we should wait to get other homes under way and remediated in the intervening period?</p><p>I am not responsible for the scientific research.  I think everyone would fully understand that for an inclusion of something like this or not and to clear that grey area Senator Blaney mentioned, we need that done independently, which is what is happening.  I have not heard any alternative from Senators who have been putting their point of view, which I respect, as to what else they would want me to do.  Should I just take the advice of one expert against another or do we get it done independently?  I think the appropriate thing to do is to have it done independently and assessed in a scientific way.</p><p>This scheme and its iterations into the future will be in operation for at least ten years.  We need to get started in Donegal, Mayo, Limerick and Clare.  We need the Housing Agency on the ground working with our local authorities.  I know Senators Cummins and Fitzpatrick are on the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage-----</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 71, 72, 81, 94, 106, 111 and 150 were accepted.  Perhaps not all of them were Deputy Pringle's, however, a number of them were and his name was on a number of them.  I welcomed his engagement on it, in fairness.  It is not a criticism.  It just shows that we accepted amendments in the D&aacute;il and I would expect that if there are reasonable amendments that we can work in without delaying the enactment of the legislation, we will absolutely be very open to doing so.</p><p>On the matters raised by the joint Oireachtas committee, officials responded in detail to it last Friday on the matters raised.  That is a matter of public record.  I would expect Senators will make themselves <i>au fait</i>with the contents of that response from my Department to the joint Oireachtas committee.</p><p>We moved a very long way.  Why are we doing this?  We are doing this to help families get their lives back on track.  I visited homes affected and have spoken to homeowners who are affected.  Government does not want to delay on this or is not in any way trying to put hurdles in place to stop people getting their homes done.  If anything, we are doing the very opposite.  We are actually recognising where the deficiencies were with the original scheme and addressing each and every one of them, while absolutely leaving it open.  I said in my opening remarks, and it is a matter of record, that should other issues come to pass, they will be included in the scheme.  There is no question about that.  If some of the Senators opposite want to be honest with themselves, they should have a look at the changes made and at what I said.</p><p>I do not think anyone wants to delay the establishment of the new scheme that needs to be underpinned by primary legislation.  Remember, the last scheme was set up by regulation only.  It was actually on an unsound footing.  On Wednesday if anyone wants to argue, as they are entitled to and I respect that, that we should put off this scheme, I would be very interested to hear what the basis for those arguments are, because opposing it means this scheme will not be put in place.  It means we will go back to January 2020 and put off helping people fix their homes and lives.</p><p>I thank all Senators for their contributions, particularly for the constructive contributions from those in opposition and, specifically, from my colleagues in government.  I look forward to engaging further with Senators on Committee Stage later in the week.</p></speech>

It is part of the cross-Government domestic response to the crisis in Ukraine with legislation covering my Department and measures related to the work of the Department of Justice and the Department of Transport.  The Bill also addresses matters relating to the Stardust inquiry.  I thank Senators for facilitating this time-sensitive legislation.  I will outline the main provisions of the Bill.</p><p>Part 1 deals with standard provisions.  Part 8 deals with the Stardust inquests special jury provisions.  It would be appropriate to address the provisions related to the Stardust inquest initially.  First, I want to convey my sympathy to the families of all the victims of the Stardust tragedy.  I acknowledge the enormous pain and loss of all those affected.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, is proposing these provisions to facilitate the progression of the Stardust inquest.  The holding of fresh inquests into the Stardust fire tragedy represents an exceptional situation, having regard to the history of previous investigations and the large number of fatalities.  The fresh inquests were directed by the then Attorney General in 2019 on the basis that the original inquests were an insufficient inquiry.</p><p>Concerns were raised by the legal representatives of the victims' families and others that the current method of empanelling a jury for the inquests under section 43 of the Coroners Act 1962 is not sufficient to guarantee a representative jury.  This matter was also the subject of a Private Members&rsquo; Bill in this House on 23 February of this year, put down by Senators Boylan, Gavan and Warfield.  Part 8 of the Bill responds to those concerns with new provisions for a bespoke approach to the empanelling and summoning of the jury for the new Stardust inquest.  It provides for the following: the disapplication of certain provisions of the Coroners Act 1962 and the Juries Act 1976; for the Dublin coroner to seek the assistance of the Courts Service and county registrar in empanelling and summoning a jury; and for the process of determining eligibility and selection or disqualification or excusal of potential jurors.  It also requires that employers should continue to pay the wages of persons summoned to serve on the Stardust inquests jury and provides that if the jury at a Stardust inquest fails to agree on a verdict, a majority verdict shall be accepted by the Dublin coroner.  In the event of a jury failing to reach a verdict, this section provides for the holding of a new inquest at the discretion of the coroner.  This replaces a provision which would have required the automatic holding of a new inquest in such circumstances.  Jurors will not be directly remunerated by the State for service at a Stardust inquest or any other inquest.  I emphasise that this will apply only to the new Stardust inquests given the extraordinary circumstances involved.  I also emphasise that the proposals respect the fact that the Stardust inquests, as with all inquests, must be conducted under the independent direction and control of the coroner.</p><p>Moving on to the domestic response to the crisis in Ukraine, Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill relate to my Department.  Offers of accommodation from the general public are greatly appreciated and they greatly assist with the challenge of sourcing suitable accommodation for some 40,000 individuals fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.  Part 2 of the Bill provides for a financial contribution of &euro;400 per property per month for persons who provide accommodation for beneficiaries of temporary protection from Ukraine.  The payment will be retrospective for eligible applicants to 4 March this year and will end on 31 March 2023.  It is available for shared or vacant accommodation, regardless of whether the accommodation has been made available privately or through the Irish Red Cross pledge process.  The payment is exempt for means-testing purposes and is not taxable.  It is not linked to the actual costs incurred by the person providing accommodation but is a recognition of the contribution of those who host beneficiaries of temporary protection.  The scheme will not create a landlord and tenant relationship.  It will be administered by the Department of Social Protection and will involve an online application.  To qualify, an applicant must be aged 18 or over; be providing accommodation to someone who has arrived in Ireland under the temporary protection directive; commit to offering this accommodation for a minimum period of six months; and declare that the accommodation meets the minimum set of standards prescribed by regulations which I will make in consultation with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Information on the scheme will be available on <i>MyWelfare.ie </i>and <i>Gov.ie.</i></p><p>Part 3 provides for an amendment of the Childcare Support Act 2018 to ensure that families who are temporary protection beneficiaries can receive financial support with the cost of early learning and childcare costs under the national childcare scheme.  This allows parents and guardians to undertake work, study or training and enables their children to attend high-quality early learning and care services, which will support them to integrate with their new communities.</p><p>Parts 4 and 5 are under the remit of the Minister for Justice and deal with accessing immigration services.  In light of the significant increase in the number of persons engaging with the immigration system, greater efficiencies for registering and processing across the immigration and social welfare system, and in regional locations, are being facilitated.  Part 4 of the Bill provides for amendment of the Immigration Act 2004 and other enactments relating to the registration of non-nationals.  These amendments will facilitate the operation of the registration function jointly by the immigration service delivery function of the Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and will support online registration processes.  The purpose of Part 5, relating to the processing of certain personal data, is to allow for the establishment of a one-stop shop service to persons fleeing Ukraine who are seeking temporary protection, a PPS number and income support.  It is aimed at making the process more customer-friendly and easier to operate.  To enable this, the Bill will allow relevant justice sector and social protection officials to gather relevant information on each other's behalf.</p><p>Part 6 places the Department of Transport's licensed haulage emergency support scheme on a legislative footing following the Government's decision earlier this year to provide temporary financial support to the licensed haulage sector to help it mitigate against increasing cost pressures, including the sharp, rapid increase in the cost of fuel in March 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In our collective responses to Brexit and Covid-19 over recent years, the critical importance of the haulage sector in supporting our continued economic and societal activity was widely acknowledged.  This is precisely why the Government acted quickly in March 2022 to support the sector.  The scheme was open for applications between 5 April and 6 June 2022.  It has now closed.</p><p>Part 7 will allow the Minister for Transport to respond immediately to sudden movements of people to Ireland under the temporary protection directive.  Section 46 of this Bill introduces a new section 23B into the Road Traffic Act 1961.  This will allow the Minister to issue an order permitting people here under the temporary protection directive to drive without having to exchange their national licences for the period of temporary protection.  The definition of a licence in sections 38 and 40 is also expanded to require evidence of residency permission under the temporary protection directive to accompany the licence.  Section 47 amends sections 60 and 61 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 to clarify that if a garda seizes a licence recognised under section 23B, only the licence is retained and not the permission.</p><p>I thank colleagues for their consideration of this Bill and I look forward to hearing from Senators.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#X00200"><p>The Minister is welcome to the House.  I do not propose to address the sections of the Bill that deal with the Stardust inquest in circumstances where I am involved in those inquests in a legal capacity.  I will leave that issue alone.  Broadly speaking, and on behalf of the Fine Gael group, I welcome the Bill.  There are important provisions throughout the Bill.  I will speak in particular about the provisions relating to Ukraine and Ireland's response to the crisis there.</p><p>I have previously said in this House that I am tremendously proud of how we, as a Government and a society, have responded to the crisis that has been thrust upon the Ukrainian people.  I welcome those who have made their way into societies and communities in Ireland.  That reflects very well on Ireland.  Ukrainian Members of Parliament, including the four who visited this House not very long ago, are astonished at the flexibility of our Government in dealing, for example, with the immigration issue.  From a justice perspective, the ability of a government to react to that crisis and to remove immigration restrictions on Ukrainian citizens coming to Ireland was not just a function of our having a smaller Government than many of our European neighbours; I would like to think it was also a function of the compassion of our Government in its response to crises such as this one.  Those Ukrainian Members of Parliament were extremely impressed by the fact that those restrictions could be removed so quickly and effectively to allow Ukrainians to come here.  I remember having this conversation with the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.  From the very beginning, immigrants merely had to say they were coming from Ukraine.  Driving licences, for example, were sufficient to establish from where they were coming.  That is the way it should be.  It should be that way across Europe but I know it has not been.  I congratulate the Government on that.  I am delighted that kind of measure is now being put on a statutory footing in this Bill.  That is welcome.</p><p>It is also important for us to put in place the other measures about which the Minister has talked, including, for example, in respect of driver's licences, as I mentioned, to ensure people who are staying here longer term are in a position to stay here with the minimum of bureaucratic fuss and obstruction.  That is very important, as are the changes under the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the changes to the transport provisions.</p><p>This is an omnibus Bill insofar as it puts a number of things together.  I understand there are other regulatory responses to the crisis but it is important for us to put on a statutory footing an acknowledgement of the importance of welcoming people into this community and facilitating them, where possible.  One glitch in that system, and notwithstanding the recommendation of the European Commission and the directive generally in relation to people seeking temporary protection, is the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.  It is an issue I have previously raised in this House.  People are coming here with professional qualifications, whether medical, engineering, legal or whatever else.  I know that in many sectors such people are having difficulty obtaining the status of their professional position in this country relative to what might have been the case had they stayed in Ukraine.  It is important that we, as a government, take steps to remind professional bodies that they must accommodate those people coming here.  I am most familiar with the position in respect of lawyers.  I had a meeting a couple of weeks ago with a number of Ukrainian lawyers who are working here but not as lawyers <i>per se</i>.  Some of them are working in law firms but in paralegal roles.  The difficulty is not that they cannot work, because all of these people have transferable skills that any employer in this jurisdiction would welcome, but that they are not recognised at the level they should be and are presumably not being paid at that level.  They cannot bill clients at that level or operate at that level.  There will be other difficulties for them in terms of language, systems and things like that.  However, the European Commission and our own Government have made it clear that we should be recognising these qualifications.  I am using law as an example but the same situation applies to teachers, doctors, nurses and engineers.  People come here with enormous professional expertise and can contribute to this community in the same way they did to theirs before they were forced to leave.  They want to contribute and to be a functioning part of society.  We should be doing everything we can to accommodate those people.  There is also a selfish benefit to us because we need the benefit of professionals.  We know there are shortages of nurses and doctors, for example.  We know there are shortages of skills in those areas.  This is not an issue that is specifically addressed in this legislation.  It is already part of the law.  I ask that we redouble our efforts to make it clear to professional bodies that they should be going out of their way to put in place structures to accommodate Ukrainian professionals who have to come here to ensure they can work here in the same capacity and contribute at the same level here as they were able to do in Ukraine.</p><p>On behalf of the Fine Gael group, let me say there is much good in this Bill.  There are progressive, albeit technical, elements to it.  Those elements have a real, on-the-ground meaning for people who are coming here and that is why it is very welcome.  We must do whatever we can to smooth that path for people as they come and, as we all hope, leave soon and return to their homes, businesses and livelihoods in Ukraine.  We want to make the transition in and out as easy as possible, or allow those Ukrainians to stay if that is what they want.  Speaking to Ukrainian friends, I know they are extremely anxious that they will lose their population to places such as Ireland and that the people who come here will find it easier to stay.  While we would love that, there is obviously an imperative from the point of view of rebuilding Ukraine after the conflict.  I know the Ukrainian polity wants them to be part of that and the Ukrainians themselves may also wish to be a part of it.  I welcome these statutory effects which smooth the transition for anybody who has to come here.</p></speech>

From a Fianna F&aacute;il perspective, we welcome and support this emergency provisions Bill which deals with the domestic response to the Ukrainian crisis and provides for matters relating to the Stardust inquest.  I acknowledge Senator Boylan for her work on the Stardust inquest, as the Minister did in his statement.  This Bill will make provision for the empanelling and summoning of a jury for that inquest.  It is only right and proper that the Stardust inquest is finally dealt with to allow closure that is long overdue.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill which I hope will end that journey.</p> <p>The other part of the Bill relates to our response to the Ukrainian crisis.  I join Senator Ward in saying how proud I am of how the nation has responded in an emergency situation to the crisis that the poor people of Ukraine are going through.  How this Government has reacted shows what can be done in a crisis situation.  The pandemic provided another example of the Government acting in a competent manner.  It is important that we learn from the response to the pandemic and how we have dealt with the Ukrainian nationals who have come to our shores.  I am sure there are learnings to be taken that can be rolled out so that others benefit in a similar manner.</p> <p>I welcome the fact of the &euro;400 monthly payment that will be allocated to persons who provide accommodation for Ukrainian people.  When does the Minister hope that will be up and running?  When can people apply for that?  When can they expect payment?  I know some of them will be doing this without payment but others will be looking for that &euro;400.  It is not an awful lot of money, to be fair.  It is important that we give clear guidelines to those individuals about when they can expect payment to be made in that regard.</p> <p>I welcome the measures around fuel for the haulage industry.  Unfortunately, things have moved on again in respect of inflation and the cost of energy.  Some self-employed people who work in the manufacturing industry have approached me.  They have their own vehicles to transport their goods from their place of manufacture to the marketplace.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Unfortunately, they are not covered by this scheme.  I am sure the Minister is aware of that.  Have there been any developments regarding those people who do not have a road haulage licence but have to get their goods to the marketplace?  They are penalised but if they picked up the phone and rang a haulage company, that company would be entitled to this fund, which is unfair.</p><p>Another part of the Bill relates to our response across a number of Departments in respect of childcare.

I am delighted to be associated with both Bills and look forward their swift passage through the Houses.</p></speech>

We are all familiar with the horrific tragedy of the Stardust.  On Valentines' Day 1981, 48 young people died and another 214 were injured as a result of a fire in the Stardust nightclub.  The families of these victims have waited justice since then, more than 40 years, for justice.  I am glad we are finally beginning that process but it should not have taken so long.  Many were disappointed, to say the least, about the original inquest findings and many regarded them as inadequate.  The new inquests are being held because the families of the deceased requested the Attorney General to direct the Dublin district coroner to hold fresh enquiries.  The findings of the original inquest only concerned the medical cause of death and not the cause or causes of the fire.  There is finally an opportunity to establish the facts and give families the truth about what happened that night.  The Department has developed a website for the inquest, assigned additional staff to the office of the Dublin coroner and facilitated the appointment of legal and expert guidance to support the coroner in this important work.  These changes, as well as the legislative change in this Bill, will allow for the inquest to proceed.  I understand at least 14 pre-hearing meetings have already been held by the Dublin district coroner's court.</p> <p>I commend the Minister for the respectful way he opened discussion of this omnibus Bill by correctly compartmentalising the different parts of the Bill.  The fact we are now having proper inquests can be traced back to the personal power vested in the former Attorney General, S&eacute;amus Woulfe SC, the then leader of the Bar.  That is a big decision.  It is like a quasi-judicial decision.  He or she has a statutory power to make that call.  In England, it rests with the Court of Appeal.  Mr. Woulfe gave his reasons and cited that the Hillsborough inquest was of use and help in him reaching his determination.  I believe it is the correct call.  I would not like to underscore the decision of the former Attorney General and adviser to the Government to make it.  It was a bold decision based on facts and justice.  One of his reasons was that it was in the public interest.  It is fantastic that this is happening.</p> <p>At times, politics can be dismissed as not proper engagement but I appreciate the generosity of the Minister in mentioning Senator Boylan.  Her contribution from the Opposition benches has been picked up and reflected in this.  Senator Boylan has concerns about the jury in those matters and specific exceptional circumstances were given by the Minister at the time, Deputy Humphreys.  That is a right move.</p> <p>It is not for this day but maybe this House should have a separate debate on jurors.  Not so long ago, a well-known juror was called middle-minded, middle class and middle-aged.  Not so long ago in this country, jurors were also just male.  I have seen the empanelling of jurors and people opting out for different reasons.  It could be a much better system.  That matter is not for today.  Perhaps it is for the Minister for Justice or perhaps it is for us to come up with solutions.  Many papers have been written on jurors.  It is something we should look at.  The heartbeat and nerve centre of the justice system is judgment by our fellow peers.  We could do more to support that and make it more representative across communities, ages and all the different diversities.  We would have a stronger juror system, not like the system at the moment.  It has improved since the Courts Service opened the new building in Parkgate Street.  In the past, they were all piled in with no air conditioning, the PA system was appalling and they did not know why they were being rejected or declined.</p> <p>Like Senators Gallagher and Ward, I 100% support this Bill in respect of Ukraine.  I commend the Minister for his ongoing work on this unprecedented challenge.  He has a long-standing commitment in Kildare which he honoured but he kindly turned it on its head to facilitate a meeting, which he made central and most important on that day, in Barretstown, County Kildare.  We met many Ukrainians fleeing the war.  The Ukrainian ambassador also turned up.  I have received massive positive feedback from that day and from the Minister's engagement and the fact he stayed around and talked to so many people after it.  Democracy is working.  These people are so unfortunate.  One can imagine how one would feel if it was one's own family.  They have been ripped away from their home and were made welcome here.  I am proud of Ireland and of the Minister's response to date.  One micro aspect of that was his generosity of time in Kildare a few weeks ago.</p></speech>

T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil seal agam chun pl&eacute; a dheanamh ar an Bhille at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair.</p> <p>The Bill deals with mainly two distinct areas: procedures to allows jurors to be selected for the jury ahead of the Stardust inquest planned for the autumn and measures to help Ukrainians who have settled here under the temporary protection directive.</p> <p>I extend my sympathy and support to the families of those who lost loved ones in the Stardust tragedy in February 1981, when 48 people, mainly teenagers and young people in their 20s, died in horrific circumstances and over 200 people were injured.  I commend the relatives of those who died on their loyalty to their loved ones and the dignified and persistent manner in which they have campaigned for the truth about the circumstances of the tragedy and subsequent events.  I have had the privilege of meeting some of those who have led the campaign for truth when they gathered at Leinster House at the invitation of my colleague, Senator Boylan.  It was a humbling experience.  It is taken the Stardust families 41 years to overcome the many inexcusable obstacles placed in their way and get to the point where a proper inquest will be held into the awful events of 14 February 1981.  It is hard to believe the first inquest into the tragedy limited itself to the medical causes of death and ignored many other factors surrounding the tragedy.  The families' single-mindedness and focus paid off in January 2020 when the Attorney General directed that another inquest take place.</p> <p>I acknowledge, and thank other colleagues for acknowledging, the steadfast work of my colleague, Senator Boylan, in raising the issues around the Stardust campaign and tragedy, particularly the issue of the inquest and the jurors' selection.  I acknowledge the Minister's willingness to engage with the Senator and to listen to the families and their stories and work with them to achieve proper outcomes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like to quote sections of the welcome statement from the Attorney General.  It beggars belief that it took four bewildering decades of grief, disappointment and anger for the families to arrive at this point.  They have one simple but powerful demand, which is a demand for truth.  He wrote, &quot;There was no reference to the surrounding circumstances, in particular the cause or causes of the fire, and it does not appear that questions as to the cause or causes of the fire were canvassed to sufficient degree, if ... at all, at the original Inquests.&quot;  That is unbelievable.  He continued:</p><blockquote>	Drawing on analogies with the Hillsborough case in England, my view is that where there is a disaster of such magnitude as that which occurred at the Stardust in February 1981 there is, in the first place, the entitlement of the families of the victims to the public revelation of the facts, but also a distinct and separate imperative that the community as a whole be satisfied, even if belatedly, that there be sufficient inquiry at any Inquest held to maximise the chances that the truth should emerge. </blockquote><p>I welcome the provisions in this Bill with respect to how jurors will be selected, regarding qualification and liability for service on a jury for the Stardust inquest.  It will be an onerous and possibly a protracted undertaking for jurors and they should receive the maximum support available to ensure their civic duty is fulfilled without hindrance.<br/><br/>The Bill also provides for a welcome improvement in the various immigration services available, especially to Ukrainian refugees.  Cuirim fearadh na f&aacute;ilte roimhe sin, rud at&aacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.  Since the immoral and inhumane invasion by Russia of Ukraine in February, 36,000 Ukrainian refugees have been made welcome in this State.  Like others, I pay tribute to the refugees for the manner in which they have settled in their communities and pay tribute to the host communities for the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte they have extended to our new community.  We all know how difficult it is, in what may be loosely described as normal circumstances, for foreign nationals to find their feet here.  It is not easy to absorb the life and daily circumstances of living in a different country, even if it is a voluntary choice.  How much more difficult must it be for people fleeing a war and finding themselves and their families in a foreign land practically overnight, against their will and choosing?<br/><br/>I welcome the changes to immigration services in this Bill, addressing their availability in different parts of the State, the ability to register anywhere, the online registration service, and the appointment of more registration officers who maintain the register of foreign nationals.  This will help to remove some of the stress and emotional turmoil the Ukrainian refugees are experiencing.  While it is important, I think that we can all agree that it is quite a modest move in the broader scheme of things.  It is exactly what we should be doing to support these people.  We have all been privileged to experience the proactive support of communities, neighbours, families and clubs coming together to rally around our new Ukrainian refugee community.  I am confident that such support, along with these changes, can make a real, tangible difference, until such a time, hopefully sooner than later, when those who wish to return can return to a safe, secure, peaceful and free Ukraine.</p></speech>

I acknowledge, as colleagues have, the Government's continued efforts to deal with the unjustified war in Ukraine and how this country has stood up and stood out in supporting the displaced people of that democratic country who have ended up in this country in their thousands, seeking our support.  As colleagues have said, the Government and communities need to be acknowledged for the tremendous welcome given to the Ukrainian community that has sought shelter on our shores.  This legislation supports this country's efforts to provide shelter, food and, most importantly, dignity to those who have had to leave their homeland and, in many cases, their loved ones behind.  Like many other public representatives, my secretary and I have dealt with and supported many families, in south Kildare in our case.  I am aware of many families who have opened their doors to those from this stricken country.  I am sure the &euro;400 per month that this legislation provides for will be welcomed by those families but it is, of course, not the primary reason for which they open their doors.  Will the Minister note when he expects the &euro;400 to be available to those families?</p> <p>We have come across a number of issues with the families which we continue to deal with in the office.  There seems to be a blockage with rent allowance, particularly for those who have come from Ukraine and who are thankfully now working.  That should be sorted out quickly.  I recently came across two families who are having serious problems with that.  The other issue, which I have raised before in this House, is transport.  It is a significant issue for a number of Ukrainian families, particularly those who are not living in urban areas.  The Minister will be aware that a large number of families recently came to live in Bert House just outside the town of Athy.  My colleague, Councillor Aoife Breslin, has liaised with them through my office.  They are welcome to the town.  One of the biggest issues they are facing is transport and getting in and out of the town.  Bert House is located three miles from the town.  We continue to see Ukrainians walking on the side of the road, which is not ideal for them.  Local Link should be able to provide for them.  I ask the Minister to address that.  Many other issues for families who have come to live there seem to have been taken care of but transport remains a problem.  Will the Minister look into it?</p> <p>I refer to Parts 6 and 7 of the Bill.  Part 6 of the Bill will give licensed haulage emergency support scheme a legislative footing.  As others have asked, can the Minister confirm the number of hauliers who have taken up the offer of &euro;100 that was mentioned?  The Government made a plea in the last two weeks.  Many hauliers had not availed of it at that stage.  As my colleague, Senator Gallagher, also mentioned, a number of hauliers who did not qualify for the scheme have contacted me.  Are we to facilitate those hauliers?  They provide a vital service for the running of the economy.  Unfortunately, the war has not gone away.  Costs are still rising.  Now that this scheme has ended, is another scheme in the pipeline to support this industry, which is vital for the continued running of the economy?</p> <p>I support the Government on Part 7, which will give the Minister for Transport the power to issue an order that will allow people admitted to the State under a temporary protection directive, as per section 60 of the International Protection Act, to drive using their national driving licence.  That does not just apply to Ukrainians.  I have attended a number of meetings with Ukrainians over the last weeks and months since they came to the country.  This is one of the biggest issues to be raised.  It is welcome.  It gives them independence and may address some transport issues that I raised in the last couple of minutes.</p> <p>I will address the dreadful events of St. Valentine's night in Dublin in 1981.  It must have been every parent's worst nightmare to know that loved ones went out that night to enjoy themselves, only for 48 young people never to come home.  It is unthinkable and heart-breaking.  That pain is still real for many families.  It is an unacceptable failure for this State and for every person in it that we still do not know the truth of what happened on that fateful night.  The families are still seeking the truth, answers and justice for their loved ones.  This is important legislation and it seems that the Minister has listened to the continued calls of families, their legal representatives and local representatives.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has welcomed this legislation and has sought continuing interaction with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, the Minister for Justice, and their Departments and other local representatives, in order to include them as we work through this legislation.  I hope the Minister agrees with that.  I welcome such discussions, but, most importantly, we must finally get the answers.  The families deserve and the country needs the truth for every one of those 48 young people who never came home.  I look forward to discussing this Bill further later in the week.</p></speech>

It is beyond belief that we are here all these decades later and that we are only now reaching the truth of what occurred.  Hopefully we will find it in a while.  The devastation for the families and the lack of a sense of justice for their loved ones must be truly awful.  I welcome this legislation and the work of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and Senator Boylan, to bring forward the issues and to get a response.  A whole generation of parents was devastated and lived with the horror and the potential of what could happen.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As a young girl going out, I had to reassure my mother that I would always check the exits wherever I was going.  The trauma for a whole nation at the time was quite considerable.</p><p>I welcome these provisions.  It is a comprehensive Bill, not only now for Ukrainians but also as a template for how we will always address but, hopefully, will never have to re-engage the temporary protection directive.  Hopefully, nothing will escalate to another country.</p><p>Yesterday, we attended the national commemoration event.  As I sat there, I thought about the families I have met and have talked to who heard the sirens, went to their bunkers with whatever possessions they could carry and came back to find nothing there and who are now living in Ireland.  In some instances, those are families with children with additional needs or with disabilities who came without even the requirements to support that child in their homes.  I am proud of our response to them.  I am proud of what we are doing.  It is right that we do so because there are people in Ukraine today fighting on the front line upholding a democracy and the right to autonomy of a country.  We should be respectful and grateful of that.  It is not only them.  There are many other such countries.  There are people in direct provision here who also require a similar response from us.</p><p>I am mindful of making sure that groups I know in Dublin receive the benefit of the back-to-school allowance and have access to it for making sure their children go back in September supported and equipped.  Many of the schools are organising this, but I wish to make sure that every child going through the door feels equal to and as cared for as their fellow classmates.</p><p>I echo Senator Ward's comments regarding the importance of professional recognition.  I also have spoken with women who have childcare competencies and experience and in an environment where we are desperate for people working in childcare, it would be fantastic if we could do a move on that also.</p><p>One concern before the schools broke up was that sometimes families could be relocated at reasonably short notice with children who left a country urgently and settled into a school here finding themselves having to move from that school for what I appreciate is more permanent accommodation.  However, we need to handle the communication of that better.  It is quite possible that the Minister has addressed this.  I am mindful that it is now July.  In fairness, there may be ways of addressing that.  I ask the Minister to consider that experience of the child making sure that when they are going in strangely making friends and feeling some sense of safety, we hold on to that as much as we possibly can.</p><p>Lastly, I commend the work of the Ukrainian community centre in Vicar Street.  They are working well with the Red Cross.  They have been doing extraordinary work there.</p></speech>

It has been an honour to know the families of the Stardust fire.  It is regrettable that since I first met up with the group and embarked on helping them to seek justice, some are no longer with us today.  There is an urgency about us getting this inquest under way.</p> <p>I welcome the provisions within Part 8 of the Bill.  Senator Seery Kearney hit the nail on the head.  It is not only the families who were impacted by the fire that night in 1981.  It sent shock waves across the nation.  It had a legacy.  Although I was young, when I was going out I was told to check the exits, leave my coat behind and never ignore a fire alarm.  It was drilled in to every teenager for years afterwards because no parent wants to send his or her child out to enjoy a night and not to see him or her come home.  I give credit to the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, for listening to the families' concerns around the need for a jury in the first place but also that the jury would be independently selected.  Those were two critical elements that the families wanted to have addressed and Deputy McEntee has listened to those concerns.  Another was that the jurors would have their income protected.  We want juries to be representative of society and given that this will be a lengthy inquest - it will be the largest in the history of the State - it is important that no juror could feel that he or she would not be able to serve because of financial difficulties.</p> <p>I would like to have clarity on two issues relating to the selection process.  The first is around the facility to inspect the jury panel that is selected by the registrar.  It is about the transparency of the process.  The history of how the families have been dealt with by the State has not been a good one.  I am wondering why that has not been included in the provisions when we took the provisions from the Juries Act.</p> <p>The second is around the challenging of jurors, either with or without cause.  In the D&aacute;il Second Stage debate, my colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, asked the Minister, Deputy McEntee, about that issue.  The Minister's reassurance at the time was that section 59(2) and the role of the coroner to allow for that objection was provided for and that the coroner can take a request from either family members or the legal representatives of those family members where a reason is given, but I would like clarity.  Is that after the panel has been selected because what the families are saying to me is they want to know is that protection to challenge a juror provided for within Part 8?</p> <p>Others have already said the first inquest was an "abject failure".  They are not my words, but those of the eminent Professor Phil Scraton.  I note the acknowledgement of the Attorney General who granted a second inquest.  Senator Martin is correct in stating that it was a big step by the Attorney General to do this.  It also needs to be acknowledged that 48,000 members of the public signed postcards requesting that.  That shows, once again, the public interest in getting this inquest right.  I would like clarity on that.  We are almost there.  If we could get this over the line before the summer recess and have all of those concerns or questions addressed, that would be helpful.</p> <p>Finally, this is bespoke to the Stardust inquest, given the size and the scale of the inquest and the significance of it, but we all are conscious that the inquest system in Ireland is not currently fit for purpose.  That review is ongoing.  That is why those concerns, if they could be addressed, are so important.  The Stardust inquest should set the bar.  It should be the gold standard.  This is what happened with the Hillsborough inquest - it was interesting that the Attorney General referred to the Hillsborough inquest in granting the new inquest on the Stardust - but also the Ballymurphy inquest.  Those were two inquests that had lengthy battles by the families but the issue was that they set the bar for how families should be treated in inquests.  I would like to think that we would do the same now with the Stardust, that we get this 100% right and that, when that review of the inquest system is finalised, it would be the bar that we would strive to achieve for all families going through the inquest procedure.</p></speech>

I thank all Senators, in terms of the Stardust tragedy and our efforts, albeit belated, as a State to provide justice to those who died and provide justice to their family members, for their contributions.  Many Members expressed the wider significant impact that the loss of so many young people had on Irish society at the time.  I was not born at the time of this tragedy but I remember every year at St. Valentine's Day when I give my Mam her Valentine's card, she would thank me but always remember the people who died that day as well.  The absolute scale of this tragedy probably had an impact on every family.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We now have the opportunity to begin that process of real justice for the families, recognise the work that Senator Boylan has done on this matter and recognise her recognition of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, in respect of legislation that secures those key elements of independence in terms of the selection of members of a jury but also the protection of their incomes, thereby recognising that this is will be a lengthy and detailed process.</p><p>As Senator Boylan is aware, I am not the lead Minister on this legislation.  On her second question regarding the ability to challenge, my understanding is that a challenge, under section 59(2), can take place at any point during the process.</p><p>On inspection of the jury panel, I will ask the officials in the Department of Justice to clarify the matter.  My understanding is that they are willing to engage with the Senator directly if other elements of clarity are sought.  As she has said, I hope that we can get this legislation done and passed.  The Senator has tabled amendments but I believe there is an opportunity to engage that point.  I agree with her wider point she made about the need to reform the inquest system.</p><p>On the other elements addressed by this legislation and primarily the element concerning Ukraine, I thank Senators for recognising the work that the Government has done but particularly the work that communities have done to welcome Ukrainian women, children and men, and to integrate them into whatever happens in their community, be it sports or cultural organisations, schools, workplaces or local employment services.  I know that in my own area, Empower has done amazing work.  All these efforts have been recognised.  Senator Ward spoke of the recent visit by Ukrainian MPs.  They said to me that they had not seen a better example being given anywhere else in Europe, in terms of the welcome that Ireland has given, which is something of which we can be proud.</p><p>More than 40,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived and since day one, I have recognised that this has put and will continue to put pressure on services and systems, around the country.  We all know that we are in the middle of a housing crisis, so it is difficult and is becoming more difficult to secure the type of accommodation that we would like to offer to our new arrivals as more people arrive.  We have always been clear that we offer shelter and safety but we cannot always offer the choice of accommodation.  Ukraine is a very urban country and many Ukrainians are used to living in urban areas.  Consequently, when they are located in beautiful parts of rural Ireland I know that this can be a big change and we are not always able to offer people a choice in respect of where they live.</p><p>Senator Seery Kearney referred to the very difficult issue arising when we have had to move children out of schools, about which I have a real concern as I am the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  However, I cannot say that such movements will not happen again, particularly as we have a significant number of people living in student accommodation and some of them will have to move out.  We will endeavour to notify people more quickly but I cannot give an absolute guarantee that people will not have to change schools.</p><p>I can confirm for Senator Wall that from the latter half of this month, people will be able to apply for the &euro;400 payment through the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>In terms of the haulage payment, my understanding is that 3,000 out of 3,800 hauliers have applied for the payment.  That is a very significant number and about &euro;15,000 has been paid out so far.</p><p>Rent supplement can be availed of by Ukrainians.  As it is a social welfare payment, they are entitled to apply for it.  I see the Senator is shaking her head.  I confirm that they are entitled to rent supplement as a social protection payment.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, is a separate payment but Ukrainians are entitled to claim rent supplement.</p><p>I accept what has been said about transport issues.  The Department of Transport and the National Transport Authority took the initiative early on to link in areas where there were not good public transport links near an hotel or residence with large numbers of Ukrainians.  It might be worthwhile for the Senator to flag this issue with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the National Transport Authority, and I am happy to do so as well, to see if the scheme can be broadened a little.</p><p>I take the point that was made about recognising qualifications.  I am happy to speak to the relevant Minister, perhaps to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and to the T&aacute;naiste, on what their Departments can do to facilitate that.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Bill is to make certain priority amendments to the current Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011, referred to in this Bill as the principal Act.  To comply with rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the principal Act provides for the general and indiscriminate retention of certain categories of communications data held by communication service providers but not the content of such communications.</p> <p>Senators will be aware there has been a civil challenge to the principal Act arising from a high-profile criminal case.  While it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specifics of any case before the courts, it is necessary to refer to some aspects of that litigation.  A High Court order was made in early 2019, which declared invalid section 6(1)(a) of the principal Act insofar as it relates to mobile telecommunications.  This section provides for disclosure of retained traffic and location data for law enforcement purposes.  Following an appeal of this decision by the State, the Supreme Court referred certain legal questions to the Court of Justice of the EU.  On 5 April this year, the Court of Justice delivered its ruling.  In essence, the court confirmed that general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data is permissible for the purposes of safeguarding national security only.  Such retention is not permitted for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of a serious criminal offence.  The court added that access provisions for traffic and location data must incorporate prior judicial scrutiny other than in certain urgent circumstances, and in such circumstances there should be a post review.</p> <p>Following the Court of Justice ruling, the State's appealed proceedings against the 2019 High Court ruling regarding the principal Act were resumed in the Supreme Court.  Following case management hearings at the end of May, the Supreme Court order for the outcome of the appeal is expected to be handed down in the near future.  While I cannot comment further on these proceedings, the immediate impact of the Court of Justice ruling is that there is now a significant degree of clarity on what is and is not legally permitted in relation to the retention of traffic and location data.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This has significant implications for communications service providers, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant agencies.  Communications service providers have expressed doubt as to the validity of continued general and indiscriminate retention of data currently held under the principal Act.  They have called for legal certainty as to what their data retention obligations now are.  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant agencies require legal certainty as to the scope of their powers to seek disclosure of retained data for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, for national security and other lawful purposes.  As a result, I am proposing a series of urgent amendments to the principal Act, in advance of a more extensive reform of the law in this area.  Apart from this Bill, it is my intention to publish an updated general scheme of a Bill before the end of this year, which will update and consolidate the law in this area.</p><p>In devising this Bill, I am seeking to balance a number of factors.  First, I must adhere to the conditions placed on the operation of data retention by the Court of Justice while seeking to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other related agencies have effective and proportionate legal powers to support their vital role.  Second, I must have due regard to the right to privacy of individuals and to the need for strong oversight of any data retention measures that are imposed.  Third, I must at all times have regard to the needs of victims or potential victims of crime.  There is a right to life and a right to personal safety of persons and, as Minister for Justice, I will always prioritise these rights.</p><p>I will now refer briefly to the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for a number of new definitions in the principal Act.</p><p>The term "user data" refers to general information regarding the user of an electronic communications service such as the mobile telephony number, the equipment identifier of the device used and the Internet protocol address in respect of the user. The Court of Justice rulings view the retention of these sorts of data as having a limited impact on privacy rights.</p><p>The term "Schedule 2 data" is intended to capture traffic and location data and is based on the type of data that is already retained by service providers under Schedule 2 to the principal Act.  The Court of Justice rulings view the retention of this type of data as constituting a significant interference with privacy rights.</p><p>The term "internet source data" is a category of data already that can be used to identify Internet protocol addresses which may have accessed unlawful online content such as child abuse imagery.  The retention of such data for both national security and other purposes is not precluded by the Court of Justice rulings.</p><p>Section 3 provides for an obligation on service providers to retain user data for a default period of 12 months.  In this Bill, it is necessary to segregate the procedures governing retention of and disclosure of user data from the same procedures governing Schedule 2 data.  Provision is made for this period to be varied to less than 12 months or a maximum of two years on stated grounds as the Minister may consider necessary or proportionate.  This option is included as there are pending Court of Justice rulings on the issue of data retention periods for this type of data.</p><p>Section 4 introduces two new sections into the principal Act. The new section 3A provides for amendments to the current rules on general and indiscriminate retention of Schedule 2 data.  Such retention can only be permitted for national security purposes and where there is approval of a High Court judge.  It will no longer be permitted for law enforcement purposes.  This is a change from the current arrangement in the principal Act, which allows for general retention for both of these purposes.  I wish to clarify the background to this measure.  Confining general retention of Schedule 2 data to national security purposes is a requirement of the Court of Justice rulings.  While Ireland and a large number of other EU member states made strong legal arguments against making such a distinction in the relevant legal proceedings before the Court of Justice, the Court did not accept these arguments.  I respectfully disagree with the Court of Justice ruling in this respect.  However, our laws must reflect the legal outcome and that is why this amendment is proposed.  I will, however, continue to advocate at EU level for an EU-wide legal instrument that will support strong general data retention measures that deal with both national security and law enforcement concerns.</p><p>The new section 3B provides for a stand-alone obligation to retain Internet source data for a default period of one year.  Provision is also made here for this period to be varied to less than 12 months or a maximum of two years, due to pending Court of Justice rulings.</p><p>Section 5 amends section 6 of the principal Act to confirm the authority of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, the Revenue Commissioners and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to seek the disclosure of user data for national security, crime and for protecting life or personal safety.  The provision reflects what is permitted by the Court of Justice rulings.</p><p>Section 6 provides for the insertion of new sections 6A to 6F into the principal Act.  Section 6A provides for a disclosure regime for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces to obtain access to retained Schedule 2 data on national security grounds, provided the disclosure has been approved by an authorising judge.</p><p>Section 6B provides for a disclosure regime for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces where there may not be time to seek approval by an authorising judge.  A system of post-approval by an authorising judge within a set period of time is also included.</p><p>Section 6C provides for a regime of disclosure of retained Internet source data to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, the Revenue Commissioners and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on both law enforcement and State security grounds, where approved by an authorising judge.</p><p>Section 6D provides for a disclosure regime for Internet source data in urgent circumstances.</p><p>Section 6E provides for a disclosure regime for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to access cell site location data linked to an electronic device in urgent circumstances, where needed to protect the life or personal safety of a person or determine the whereabouts of a missing person.</p><p>Section 6F provides for a single legal obligation on service providers to comply with the requirements to disclose data.</p><p>Section 7 provides for the insertion of new sections 7A to 7D into the principal Act.  These sections introduce new legal provisions for preservation orders and a protection order to be sought in specific cases by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, the Revenue Commissioners or the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  The orders must be approved by an authorised judge and based on the need to respond to serious offences, national security or the saving of a human life.  The possibility of deploying such measures to ensure the expedited retention of specific data in individual cases has been acknowledged by the Court of Justice in its rulings.</p><p>The new section 7A provides for a preservation order, which will require the preservation of specified Schedule 2 data by a service provider in connection with specific persons, locations or other indicators, for example mobile phone numbers.  A preservation order will not in itself require the granting of access to data.  The new section 7B provides for a production order, which, if approved by an authorised judge, will require the submission of specified data to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies, and may include data which may already be the subject of a preservation order.  The new sections 7C and 7D allow for the approval in urgent cases of temporary preservation and production orders by an appropriate senior official in each organisation, which must be notified to an authorised judge for affirmation within 72 hours.</p><p>Section 8 provides a number of supporting measures to be included in the principal Act, including an offence provision for failure to comply with a requirement to comply with legal requirements to retain, preserve or disclose data, the issue of guidelines to service providers, the making of regulations, the notification of data subjects in appropriate cases where their data have been disclosed, and the appointment of authorised judges.</p><p>Section 9 is a transitional provision that allows for a time-limited period where there can be disclosure, on national security grounds only where approved by an authorised judge, of Schedule 2 data already retained under the existing 2011 Act until the earlier of the expiry of a period of six months or the making of a first order by a designated judge under section 3A permitting the future retention of Schedule 2 data.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the contributions from Senators today.  There will of course be an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss in more detail any aspects of the Bill that Senators wish to explore further.  I acknowledge the speed at which this Bill has come to the House.  This is not the way I like to bring forward legislation.  I stress that this is emergency legislation because of the fact that once we go on D&aacute;il recess there will most likely be a final ruling, which would mean that certain aspects of the Act will fall. This provides a huge amount of uncertainty for the communications platforms and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This is a measure to put into place to ensure that we have certainty for those various authorities.  I also wish to confirm with and assure the Senators that I will be bringing forward the general scheme of a Bill for a more broad discussion later this year.  I look forward to discussing and debating even more with the Senators then.</p></speech>

Is &eacute; cothroma&iacute;ocht at&aacute; i gceist ag an mBille seo idir, ar l&aacute;mh amh&aacute;in, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, an St&aacute;t, agus an Sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir Ionch&uacute;iseamh Poibl&iacute; a gcuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh agus, ar an l&aacute;mh eile, an duine pearsanta agus an pobal.</p> <p>The issues in this Bill have been aired extensively in the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, in public and in private.  I very much welcome the Minister's acknowledgement, at the conclusion of her remarks, the Bill has had a rapid accession through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We all agree that this is undesirable in the circumstances but I acknowledge where this is coming from.  I also believe the explanation given by the Department of Justice in the committee around the reasons why earlier action was not taken on data protection rules.  We were waiting for the law in this area to crystallise so that we were not passing multiple items of legislation to deal with an evolving situation.  I accept that explanation and I believe it makes sense on all of the levels. Unfortunately, it leaves us as legislators in an invidious position because we find ourselves at the last minute trying to go through what is very complex and comprehensive legislation that deals with a whole load of issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why I say this is a balancing act.  This Bill is about balancing, on the one hand, the need to give the powers and equipment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the DPP and the State and its organs to do their job in detecting prosecuting and solving crime, especially the kind we are talking about, that serious element of the criminal spectrum, namely, gangland crime and the very subversive element that can exist within the criminal underworld.  On the other hand, there are individual rights and the rights of people to their privacy and knowledge in regard to their material that the State has nothing to do with.</p><p>We could not at any point tolerate the mass surveillance of the citizenry in the way that exists in other countries, even ones we see as democratic countries.  I look, for example, at the US and the extent to which the US Government and law enforcement agencies are entitled and empowered under its legislation to surveil the population, investigate it and look into the privacy of it in a way we would consider completely unwarranted.  That is very much distinct from the scheme that is being put forward in this Bill.  I am highly conscious of concerns brought forward by groups like the Irish Council for Civil Liberties about mass surveillance or unwarranted invasion of the privacy of individuals.  I am conscious of them and have looked at the Bill with a critical eye in that regard.  I do not know if this Bill is the right answer or if it is the answer that is the right balance between those two aspects that the Department of Justice in particular must always grapple with.  However, I am satisfied there are enough protections in here to deal with the potential issues that have been identified even to this stage in the scrutiny of this Bill.</p><p>I am also conscious many of the measures in this Bill are going to require much ongoing measuring, monitoring and surveillance by the Minister's Department and by the appropriate agencies within the State to ensure none of our law enforcement agencies oversteps the mark in their zealousness to get an answer or to find a particular person or evidence against a particular person or group.  Issues that were raised in the justice committee were in the context of misuse of information An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might have through various data that are retained by it.  I recognise, for example, many provisions are put in place in this Bill and elsewhere to protect information kept on PULSE and information kept by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from being used in a way not warranted or not appropriate in the context of the kind of investigations discussed in this Bill.  I welcome the protections that are there.  I am not qualified enough to say definitively whether they are sufficient but I confess I am satisfied that what is described in this Bill is sufficient, provided that on an ongoing basis it is maintained and all of the safeguards discussed are maintained at a high level to protect individual citizens.  Not even the most zealous of the people I am talking about in law enforcement want a situation where we have mass surveillance of our citizens.  I do not think this Bill provides for that.  I recognise the legitimate concerns of people but there are safeguards built in that should satisfy people that this is something that will empower An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other law enforcement agencies to do the job they need to do but also to protect us all.</p><p>Very often when we talk about the investigation of crime people perceive themselves as potentially the victims of crime instead of potentially the falsely accused person or the person whose privacy is incorrectly or unwarrantedly invaded.  All the provisions we put in place - those aspects of the law that prevent the Garda or whoever it might be from doing that - are protections that are there for us as citizens, for every citizen and every resident of this State, and they are appropriate and necessary.</p><p>I recognise as well that to a large extent An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will feel its hands have been slightly tied by this legislation and that is undoubtedly the case.  The mass availability that might have been there in the past is now gone but that must be seen in the context of a necessary evolution of data protection law in this country arising from the judgments that have been discussed in the Court of Justice of the European Union.  On that basis, I welcome the legislation on behalf of the Fine Gael group.  I accept the bona fides of the Minister and her Department on the protections set into it but I call for a robust, ongoing engagement on those protections to protect all citizens of this country and to ensure there is no unwarranted overstep.  Not only is that illegal and wrong but it massively compromises faith in the organs of the State that do it, so it is important to maintain those protections in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#EE00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Much of the criticism of the Government that followed this decision from the European court was around the issue that the Government seemed to have sat for a very long time on an uncomfortable reality that there had been a decision as far back as 2014 against the country in the context of the Digital Rights Ireland case.  When the decision in the Graham Dwyer case was handed down by the European court those who followed that case and took a strong view of privacy rights more or less said "We told you so", that they saw this coming and that the 2011 law, as it stood, envisaged a measure of data retention that simply was no longer acceptable under European law.  I cannot speak for all the citizens of this country but I think many ordinary people will be concerned at the idea An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not in future be in a position to access all possible information necessary for the investigation of serious crime, including murder.</p> <p>This legislation is being rushed through in a very unsatisfactory way.  We saw what went on at the very truncated pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  I accept what the Minister said in that this is a piece of holding legislation and that she had to act quickly to safeguard such rights as may be capable of being safeguarded in terms of the need to access data but from what I can read the position is data may still be retained, although only for national security purposes.  Data may be obtained for the investigation of crime if it is certain kinds of data but it is not that long ago that people were congratulating the painstaking and forensic Garda investigation work that led to the conviction of Mr. Dwyer.  It seems to me what is going on here is a complete capitulation to a European decision and accepting an unpleasant and unacceptable reality that in the future this kind of access to location data from mobile phones specifically will not be possible in future.</p> <p>I note Mr. Justice Hunt's decision in recent days.  Among the many points he made was the fact that it related to the accessing of mobile phone records in 2019 and that therefore he was not in some sense bound by the recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  However, consider the judge's language in describing the European court's decision and its prioritisation of a particular vision of privacy rights.  He caught the mood of many people when he effectively criticised, as it were, the priorities of the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p> <p>I note what Senator Ward said about the necessary evolution of data protection law but that is effectively the language of capitulation.  How come there has been no national discussion in the media, no questions asked of Government and no statements of intent by Government to go back to our European partners and say it is an unforeseen and undesirable consequence of this decision that cold-blooded murder, should it take place in future, cannot be investigated to the fullest possible extent.  It seems to me people are failing to distinguish between the legitimate protection of data rights and privacy rights.  Legitimate protection should entail that information can only be accessed in certain cases subject to certain safeguards, for example, involving the requirement of going before a judge and so on but the principle should be that such information may be retained and may in the future potentially be accessed for the purposes of investigating and prosecuting serious crime.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Am I on another planet to be the only person I have heard so far to express this concern in the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Is there something I do not understand about the way European negotiations go on - that a government cannot talk to its fellow governments at European level and say, "This is something undesirable"?  We have seen in the past in the context of our own Constitution that where people did not like rulings, they brought forward referenda to change things.  We have seen in the past that where legislation is interpreted in such a way as to entail unforeseen consequences, there is remedial legislation.  The Government's approach here seems to be, "Oh we're just going to put our hands up and salvage as much as we can".  Can we not ask the fundamental question?  Should it not be possible to envisage the retention of such data, including location data, and access it in certain circumstances in the future subject to certain rules about how it can be done in order to prosecute and eventually criminalise murderers?  Could anything be as serious as that?  I have not heard the Government is going to do its utmost to restore us to a situation where good detective work can go on, information can be obtained and data can be accessed for a good purpose - not for the purpose of breaching people's privacy but for the higher purpose of preventing and prosecuting serious crime.</p></speech>

While I am not a barrister like Senators Mullen, Ward and Martin, I have looked at this Bill and have certainly taken on board their comments.  Far be it from me to need to defend the Minister but I note that in her speech, she said that she will continue to advocate at EU level for an EU-wide legal instrument that will support strong general data retention measures to deal with national security and law enforcement concerns.</p> <p>I know we must be very cautious about referring to specific cases and I know there is a balance between data protection, the GDPR and freedom of information but there is a higher purpose, as Senator Mullen alluded to, in terms of allowing our garda&iacute; to get evidence that exists and allowing that evidence to be used to prosecute people and for these people to go in front of a judge and jury and be convicted.  Of course, nobody wants a false conviction but equally people do not want people to get off when the evidence is there that confirms or certainly supports the idea that they are guilty.  I certainly want to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fully equipped with laws and modern technology to fight crime.</p> <p>Our party is certainly supporting this legislation.  I acknowledge that it is not ideal that it comes through at this speed but we all understand why.  We certainly do not want a situation where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is hampered in doing what it does.  We all want to make sure that if the evidence is there, if wrongdoing has been done and it can be proved that wrongdoing has been done, the evidence that supports that can be used.  Nobody wants mass surveillance, to be tracked for everything or to have various agents of the State just looking at people's information for their own interest.  However, it is really important that we make sure we give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other law enforcement agencies access to information that is there in their ongoing inquiries generally.</p> <p>We do not want a situation where somebody who is guilty can use these types of loopholes to end up not being prosecuted and found guilty of crimes he or she has committed.  Again, I am conscious of not referring to a particular case but hypothetically if people are guilty and the evidence is there, I think the general public would want our law enforcement agencies to be able to use all of the tools at their disposal to make sure those guilty of wrongdoing are convicted so I certainly support the Bill.  The Minister made a very comprehensive opening statement.  I do not intend to repeat what is happening in each section as there is no need for that.  My party and I will be supporting this Bill and I thank the Minister for bringing it to the House.</p></speech>

She is a frequent visitor.  It is always great to see her in the House.  I thank her for her opening statement.  It was comprehensive and full of candour but it was very depressing.  In her opening remarks, the Minister said:</p> <blockquote> 	On 5 April this year, the Court of Justice delivered its ruling.  In essence, the court confirmed that general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data is permissible for the purposes of safeguarding national security only.  Such retention is not [I repeat, &quot;is not&quot; and the Minister was very frank with us] permitted for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of a serious criminal offence.   </blockquote> <p>We have clarity from the Minister.  On foot of the judgment, the Minister accepted that we have a significant degree of clarity on what is and is not permitted.  I sympathise with the Minister and anyone in the Government who has to square this.  Looking at what the Minister said, this is clarifying an exceptionally fair, honest and decent approach on the part of the Minister to this dreadful proposed legislation.  The Minister said, &quot;While Ireland and a large number of other EU member states made strong legal arguments against making such a distinction in the relevant legal proceedings before the Court of Justice, the court did not accept these arguments&quot;.  She then said, &quot;I respectfully disagree with the Court of Justice ruling in this respect&quot;. </p><p>I do not think the Minister could be any more honest.  For a serving Minister to say that is a breath of fresh air but it is about the only breath of fresh air on a very dark day for this Bill to be read a Second Time.  I accept the Minister's good faith and I accept what she said when she said our laws must reflect the legal outcome, which is why this amendment is proposed.  I have the utmost respect for the adviser to the Government, Paul Gallagher SC.  He has a different job to me or any legislator.  From recollection, he was probably representing Ireland in some of these cases.</p><p>I commend Ireland for taking such a forthright stance on these cases.  I say this as a proud European and someone who believes in the European process.  I understand that one takes the good with the bad but this is not bad.  If one wants alarm bells to go off, on a scale of one to ten, this gets 11.  Before we can support this legislation and before it goes through the House, I need clear detailed assurances and evidence that everything else was tried first.  Some would say that the court in Luxembourg is out of control while others would ask why people would say it has gone out of control recently and argue that it has been out of control for quite some time.</p><p>Every case falls on its own unique circumstances and facts.  I fear I know the answer because Mr. Gallagher would have tried everything possible in the world of legal and mental gymnastics and he is a very decent, highly intelligent and respected leader of the Bar but one must bring people with one.  There is a disconnect at the moment and I need to be assured that we have tried everything humanly possible to fight a court that has gone out of control.  </p><p>Regarding all the talk about preservation orders, they do not come into play in certain circumstances so that is a palaver in respect of criminals who are not identified at present.  I do not think that people fully appreciate yet that if a serious crime is committed today, if it is not an issue of national security, after 90 days, evidence that could be very supportive and corroborate a prosecution is not just inaccessible, it is destroyed.  After 90 days, one cannot get it for a serious offence like murder or rape.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P. Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=VincentPMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->How can a preservation order possibly be obtained if the person is unidentifiable and we do not know where we are looking for it?  We know, without mentioning any cases, that the tracking and location data can be vital in putting murderers and rapists behind bars after affording them a fair trial.  Is there no way around that?  Can we try harder to perhaps keep the data alive but under strict safeguards in order that if anyone abuses or exploits the data, the penalties are most severe, including custodial sentences?  Could we say that if we want further balances, checks and safeguards, that no one gets to the data, even if there is a criminal investigation?  In other words, we would throw away the key except in one instance, namely, where the Supreme Court can find the key and reopen the matter.</p><p>The legislation destroys evidence of a person unknown.  We all celebrate cold cases.  We may forget about this extremely important evidence gathering because a few years down the road, we cannot benefit from such evidence because it will be gone.  Even in the case of a terrorist, where national security is at stake, the evidence could theoretically be gone after one year.  This is an abomination.  The fact is that it happens to be in compliance with EU law, which I respect.  Ireland is a democracy.  I accept that the Minister finds herself in a difficult position.  I emphasise that this is no criticism of her or her hard-working officials, some of whom kindly addressed us in a private session at the joint committee, and were very frank, forthright and fair.  This is no criticism of the Government, but it is a criticism in the context of what we do next.  I just cannot accept this in its current format until I am absolutely convinced and reassured that there is no alternative.</p><p>Like most, if not all, people in here, I value liberal thinking and liberal treatment, but in spite of my liberal leanings, there can be countervailing rights.  Sometimes I put my liberal leanings in abeyance if I think we can help our country convict and put away murderers and rapists.  That is at a different level of countervailing rights to privacy, for which I have so much respect and for which I would fight.</p><p>I thank the Acting Chairperson for his indulgence.  The bigger right of assisting prosecution teams in convicting rapists and murderers must take precedence in order to protect our country, people and children.</p></speech>

This Bill puts a focus on an issue that has long needed to be addressed by the Government, yet by the sound of things, the Government has failed to effectively deal with it.  A proper approach to law reform in this area requires thoughtful and considered planning.  I accept that there are great complexities in data retention, but with the right approach these difficulties can be resolved and overcome.</p><p>I am yet to be convinced otherwise, but as I understand it the Government is indicating that this Bill is unlikely to provide the solution that is ultimately required.  That message will hardly instil confidence where it is most needed: the justice committee; the justice system; the Garda; and the general population.  Indeed, the Data Protection Commission has concerns arising from data protection audits of these proposals.  The EU law regarding data protection is problematic because of its strict adherence to the idea that only threats to national security merit the retention of data.  This outlook could lead to serious criminals evading justice.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is on record as stating that data retention is a challenge for it and for the police forces in many other European states that are investigating crime.  In its submission to the joint committee, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Under the scheme of the Bill, whilst AGS will be able to utilise Preservation and Production Orders to secure evidence, this process will be forward-looking and not retrospective.  This will cause significant difficulties in criminal investigations, which usually commence post incident.  However, this restriction does not arise in relation to matters relating to National Security matters. </blockquote> <p>There is a balance to be struck between EU and domestic law, between civil liberties and the need for justice.  A stable regime is required to provide certainty to prosecutors, the courts, the Garda and ordinary citizens.  For the front-line agencies, there is little in the Bill that sets out the when, how and where of data retention.  Improvising in these areas is not something these agencies should be asked to do.  The consequences of them getting it wrong are very worrying indeed.</p><p>The rights of ordinary citizens need to be heard right the way through this process.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties outlined a number of its concerns.  It is clear that the Bill will lead to further legal uncertainty and legal challenge.  Those directly affected deserve better than this.  Furthermore, indiscriminate data retention with little legal certainty or process poses a great threat to privacy.  Proper supervision of access arrangements is important but of course the best protection is always to not collate data in the first place - followed by collating it for specified reasons - with a clear legal basis and grounding.  The Bill allows for a one-year retention period, which can be reviewed.  This could see data being retained indefinitely, which is not a desirable outcome.  The functions of the judge who grants access to this data must be expanded.  Nonetheless, despite the Government's inertia, there is a clear need to address the issues that arise from this Bill.</p><p>Like other colleagues, I commit to working as hard as I can to ensure that it is got right.  I do not think I could outline any more eloquently, comprehensively, or with the level of concern that Senator Martin outlined to the House.  Moving forward through the process in this House, I hope we can get to the point where this legislation is as strong and positive as it so clearly needs to be.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  I do not want to rehash any of the key events that have resulted in us dealing with this legislation here today.  I echo the concern at the lack of speed with which pre-legislative scrutiny was carried out in respect of the Bill.  The Data Protection Commissioner only received a finalised version of the general scheme of the Bill less than 24 hours before appearing before the justice committee as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I am uncomfortable with the speed at which that had to be done, although I understand that it was as a result of a reaction.</p> <p>The Minister said it is an emergency measure in response to court rulings, and that there will be fuller reforms soon, following on from the general scheme of an amendment Bill that underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in 2017.  The emergency Bill also does not meet conditions of the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling, so would still be potentially illegal and open to legal challenge.  Recommendations that emerged from the 2017 pre-legislative scrutiny process are not reflected in the Bill.</p> <p>My main purpose in contributing is to put on record the intention behind some amendments we will table between now and Committee Stage.  One relates to a sunset clause on the Bill.  As the Minister has acknowledged, this Bill is an emergency measure, and fuller reform of this area needs to follow quickly.  The idea then that this Bill would be introduced and allowed to operate indefinitely, until such reforms are ready, is unacceptable.  It has been known since 2014 that our 2011 Data Retention Act was no longer in line with EU law, yet here we are in 2022, eight years later, rushing through emergency legislation to respond to a Court of Justice of the European Union ruling.  Where was the urgency in reforming this over the past eight years?  It is essential that a sunset clause is introduced to ensure that the Government maintains a sense of urgency around the fuller reform of our data retention law, and to ensure that flimsy legislation like this does not end up running on for years, as we know it may well do.  A sunset clause is the minimum level of safeguard we need to put in place.</p> <p>In terms of the definition of "national security", in order to satisfy the requirement of proportionality, the legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure and must indicate in what circumstances, and under which conditions a measure providing for the processing of such data may be adopted, thereby ensuring that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary.  These conditions are not met by the current legislation, which means that it is still illegal.  The vague term "national security", which is not accompanied by a definition, cannot possibly provide the necessary reassurance.</p> <p>We also intend to table amendments on the removal of the one-year rolling retention of data, which is still illegal under the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling.  The court ruled that the duration of each data retention measure must be limited in time to what is strictly necessary and that such measures, while they can be renewed, cannot be systematic in nature.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Thus, each case must be individually assessed and the period of data retention should be prescribed specifically for the necessities of each case.  The current mechanism of the Bill, which grants blanket one-year retention to all cases, is, therefore, blatantly illegal.  It is, again, inexplicable that we would rush through emergency legislation to address an illegality and that an emergency Bill would itself be illegal.  It is quite unbelievable that this House is being asked to do this and that we are being asked to waive proper parliamentary procedure to replace one form of illegality with another slightly diluted form of illegality.  Special protections for journalists&rsquo; data is another area in which we intend to submit an amendment.  It is a requirement under the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, that surveillance aimed at identifying journalistic sources should go through a heightened screening process, including prior independent judicial approval.</p><p>I hope we get time this week to have some level of scrutiny when we return to this Bill and also to the amendments that will be tabled in the House.  We are obviously happy to engage between now and then if time permits.</p></speech>

General data protection regulation, GDPR, often gets a bad rep but Europe should be rightly proud of the fact that we place a great emphasis on data protection and data privacy.  I do not think anybody intended when GDPR was being designed that we would have seen a case like the Dwyer case where, essentially, the data privacy protection regimes would be used in the circumstances that happened.  I have no doubt we will face many debates around the issues of data, data retention and how we use our data over the years ahead.</p> <p>What we certainly do not want to see is a move towards a Chinese-type society which is, effectively, a surveillance society or, indeed, a US-type arrangement where the Government can access all of our data for particular reasons.  Questions have to be asked, however.  I would agree with what Senator Mullen said earlier around whether this was the intention of GDPR at a European level.  Questions need to be asked about whether the various EU data privacy regulations need to be reviewed so that in circumstances like this concerning serious crime, national agencies are not inhibited in any way from investigating what happens.</p> <p>I am conscious that this is a temporary piece of emergency legislation.  I have some sympathy with Senator Ruane's view about a sunset clause on this.  I agree with Senator Ward that it is important we have a comprehensive piece of legislation to address these questions to ensure we get the necessary limitations and proportionality in which everyone can have confidence.  As Senator Ward said, it will require an ongoing monitoring of the retention and use of data that is gathered.  There must be some concerns around getting that balance right, however.  I would certainly have concerns around, for instance, the Department of Justice's approach to facial recognition technology and the recent public call that went out.  It does not seem to be in line with the Government's artificial intelligence, AI, strategy, which very much puts human rights and an ethical framework at the basis of AI.  I would, therefore, have certain concerns.</p> <p>We also need to review the office of the Data Protection Commissioner, which the commissioner herself said is necessary.  It is certainly my strong view that we should have three commissioners making some of the key decisions.  I appreciate that these points are not perhaps directly related to the legislation but it speaks to the data protection and data privacy regime in which we need to operate.</p> <p>What citizens need is an assurance that they will not be constantly monitored or subject to surveillance while at the same time have confidence that there will be the necessary investigation where a serious crime is committed.  It is best to say that I am reluctantly supporting this legislation on the basis that emergency legislation is required, but a more comprehensive debate around data protection and data privacy is necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#HH00400"><p>I thank all Senators for their contributions.  I will start with the last point and reassure Senators that this is not about mass surveillance or retaining data for indiscriminate purposes.  From our point of view, what this Bill does is reduce the amount of data that can be retained in comparison with what is currently the case.  It increases the number of safeguards of judicial oversight and other types of discretions in terms of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is the very least we should have, to be honest, and this is the base from which we should be working.</p> <p>I firmly believe, and it seems to be the view of the House, that a person's right to privacy should never overrule a person's right to safety, this country's national security or the right to ensure a person is brought to justice for committing a serious crime or, indeed, as Senator Ward and others said, to ensure that a person can be exonerated and that this type of information can be used to exclude somebody from a particular case.  We all need to work hard, not just here in this Parliament but across the EU, to try to get this right.</p> <p>I cannot stress enough how much I did not want to bring this legislation forward in this timeline.  Many Senators mentioned the timeline and how this came about.  We might look at the sequence of events.  A Bill was drafted back in 2017 and we had the Oireachtas report, which was presented in 2018.  We then had that significant case in 2019.  A decision was taken at that point by the then Minister not to progress with the legislation because of the evolving nature of the various different rulings.  I know that was not the case in some other countries such as France, Belgium and a few others where they changed their laws and must now change them again because they are not compliant with the most recent court ruling.  We had changes to rulings as recently as October 2020 and then finally the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling on 5 April.  It was through a case management hearing that we discovered that it was not likely to change in the upcoming Supreme Court ruling.  I brought a memo to Cabinet the following week.  I moved as quickly as I could, working closely with the Attorney General and engaging with the Data Protection Commission, DPC - just to assure colleagues - and the Joint Committee on Justice, albeit I appreciate not in a way that I nor any of my colleagues would like.  Obviously, we are continuing to engage with the DPC.</p> <p>As well as that, we have been engaging with the various different communications platforms, which wrote to me a number of weeks ago and were very concerned that if this legislation was not clarified and the Supreme Court ruling finalised, and if certain parts of the current Act lapsed, they would have no choice but to potentially get rid of all the data they had.  Obviously, that was quite concerning and something we certainly did not want to happen.</p> <p>Senator Mullen has left the Chamber but I reassure colleagues that there has been a huge amount of discussion at a European level, obviously, from the various court cases where we have strenuously tried to protect and uphold what we have in terms of our legal response but also at an EU level.  At my most recent Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting last month in Luxembourg, we had a different item on the agenda.  I raised directly with Commissioner Reynders the need to not tie the hands of any of our police services behind their backs for the sake of privacy where there seems to be that imbalance and was supported by a number of colleagues.  I was reminded that it is not just about setting law at an EU level but that this is how the European courts are interpreting the human rights charters, not necessarily GDPR legislation.  There is much more work we need to do.  It is something on which I am absolutely committed to engaging further with my colleagues.</p> <p>As I said, I think we are all of the same view that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be able to do its job.  The Court of Justice of the European Union was very clear in what it said, which was that platforms cannot save data to investigate or prosecute serious offences or save certain types of data indiscriminately.  We have gone as far as we possibly could with this Bill following legal advice from the Attorney General and his team.  As I said, without it, I would have huge concerns about what data companies may or may not do because they feel they do not or would not have the clarity.  This Bill provides a certainty and clarity for platforms at the same time.</p> <p>Again, I commit to working with colleagues as we bring forward a general scheme later this year.  We must obviously allow a much greater timescale in terms of engagement, not just with colleagues here and in the D&aacute;il but with all those potentially impacted by this, including the various communications platforms, the DPC, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and many others.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When I had this debate with colleagues in the D&aacute;il, my biggest concern was the sunset clause.  One might say there is a slight chance it will happen, but a sunset clause means everything in this would fall should a new Bill not be enacted within that timeframe.  We all know things happen in politics, intended or not, and I have a concern that should a new Bill not be enacted and the sunset clause lapse, we would find ourselves in the position we are potentially in if we do not do this now, in that these measures would lapse and there would be uncertainty for service providers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>I absolutely commit to the general scheme by the end of this year, progressing new legislation while working with our European colleagues to try to identify how we can deal with some of the implications of this, in particular when it comes to being able to investigate and prosecute serious crime.  </p><p>I thank colleagues.  We all want to get the balance right between protecting people's personal rights and privacy while protecting people's rights to security and safety.  I look forward to working with colleagues to ensure we get that balance.</p></speech>

I thought the session was on at 4 p.m. so was not organised when we went straight into it.</p> <p>This amendment is the same as those we tabled on Committee Stage.  At that time, the Minister said she would get some sort of legal briefing and feedback on that amendment.  We had the Electoral Reform Bill then, so we kicked the same conversation to that Bill.  It seems like no one wants to take responsibility for looking at the issue of political purposes within the legislation.</p> <p>As drafted, there is no reference to, and therefore no definition of, "political purposes".  The Bill makes reference to section 46M and the prohibition on advertising which is directed to a political end but, as I stressed previously, what constitutes a political end is unclear and can capture a huge amount of everyday advocacy and activism if put in legislation without definition.  The term is vague, is an unusual one to be included in legislation and risks preventing a broadcaster or digital service provider from sharing information which is in the public interest through advertisements.  While existing legislation curtails political advertising, the provision as drafted in the Bill could be misinterpreted to such an extent that important political issues would be conflated with the content of political advertisements.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In response to the concerns I have highlighted, amendment No. 79 seeks to delete the term "political end" from the Bill and to substitute it with "political purposes".  Amendments Nos. 1 and 83 separately provide definitions for the term "political purposes" in the legislation in circumstances where amendment No. 79 is accepted by the Minister.  Our conduct with respect to fundraising as politicians is regulated in the context of the Electoral Acts, but a significant flaw exists in the wording of "political purposes" in the Electoral Acts which means that our laws do not fairly distinguish between the regulation of campaigns of politicians and how we treat the normal, everyday advocacy-led and community-led campaigning throughout the country.  We must ensure that this same anomaly is not replicated in this legislative measure and that is why the definition is provided for through amendments Nos. 1 and 83.</p><p>During the course of our engagement with the Minister on this over the past number of months it was noted that a separate legislative measure, the Electoral Reform Bill, might be a more appropriate channel in which to address this concern.  Unfortunately, however, despite our best efforts, amendments to the definition of "political purposes" were not accepted during our engagements with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Noonan, on the Electoral Reform Bill, the rationale being that a wider review of the Electoral Acts is proposed to be undertaken shortly by the soon to be established electoral commission.  In light of this, will the Minister be able to accept this suite of amendments in the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill?  As I have stressed, the provision in the Bill as drafted is too vague and risks important political issues.</p><p>We have spent a great deal of time recently trying to address the unintended consequences of the term "political purposes" in previous legislation only to have this Bill further muddy the water in terms of vague phrases such as "political end".  I urge the Minister to have regard for this concern in this respect and accept the amendments.  I hope she can see that for this Bill to go forward without a real understanding of "political purposes" when it intersects so much with what the rest of the Bill does in terms of regulation of media and advertising, it would be unwise to have a term such as "political end" without a definition in the Bill.</p></speech>

We have debated back and forth and the key point we highlighted is that this already has been identified, recognised and accepted to be a problem.  It was recognised as a problem most recently even by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, in its engagement with the committee on finance and public expenditure on other legislation.  It highlighted this issue as an area of ambiguity and one that needed clarification.</p> <p>There was a problem with seeking to try to deal with this solely through the electoral commission anyway.  The problem is that political purposes is currently constituted much wider than the electoral processes.  Dealing with it in an electoral context was not the issue, the problem is that it is widely interpreted way beyond the electoral space.  However, the Government had argued that it would deal with it as part of the electoral commission legislation, but then it did not deal with it.</p> <p>When something has been highlighted as causing concern and ambiguity and being a problem, it is bad practice that we are putting that very wide definition again into another legislative measure which will have a very wide reach far outside the electoral space.  While the Minister was very specific about not wanting to cut across the area of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage in this regard, that Minister has not shown the same concern because the Electoral Reform Bill includes definitions relating to algorithms, recommender systems and all these other areas which we also wanted to address in this Bill.  We were told it had to wait for the digital services directive, yet the Electoral Reform Bill went ahead and ploughed right into that area and did not wait for or even reference seeking to try and engage with this legislation.</p> <p>The online safety media regulation, which ultimately is not responsible for regulating elections but responsible for regulating online content, is allowing that excessively broad definition to continue to apply and is creating a hostage to fortune.  The interpretation of "political purposes", and it arises in many Acts, including the previous broadcasting legislation, has caused trouble and ambiguity in those areas.  I still remember when I worked with Tr&oacute;caire and when an advertisement saying that girls across the world experience discrimination or additional obstacles was deemed to be too much of a political purpose to be allowed to be broadcast.  It was just a straightforward statement of fact, but arguably it had the political purpose of promoting gender equality.  That is how widely it has been interpreted in the past and that is why it is a problem specifically in the Minister's area in terms of media regulation.</p></speech>

As I set out on Committee Stage, the term &quot;an advertisement towards a political end&quot; has been defined in the 1998 High Court judgment in Colgan <i>v</i>. the Independent Radio and Television Commission, IRTC.  This case involved an appeal against a decision of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to prohibit broadcasters from broadcasting an anti-abortion advertisement prepared by the organisation Youth Defence.  The definition used in Colgan <i>v</i>. IRTC is currently used by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  In fact, the authority has a guidance note on its website which sets out, in accordance with the judgment, the practical meaning of the phrase.</p><p>I note that the proposed definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; stems from the Senators' proposal to amend section 22(2)(aa) of the Electoral Act 1997 as part of this House's consideration of the Electoral Reform Bill.  Given that the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Noonan, did not accept this proposal, I cannot accept it either.  However, I understand that the Minister of State has set out on a number of occasions that the electoral commission, once established, will carry out a comprehensive review of aspects of election legislation in Ireland, including in respect of the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot;.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 37<b></b>ensures that the online safety functions of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n are generally delegated to any designated online safety commissioners.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Amendment No. 44 provides that "One or more of the Commissioners shall be designated in writing by the Minister on the recommendation of the Public Appointments Service as an Online Safety Commissioner".  It is important to recognise that the online safety functions of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n are likely to expand significantly over time and, as such, it is important to provide that more than one commissioner can be designated as an online safety commissioner.  In this regard, it is intended that the Public Appointments Service will commence a public recruitment campaign for the role of online safety commissioner in the coming weeks.  Amendments Nos. 36, 38, 39, 45 to 50, inclusive, and 53 are all consequential amendments to provide for updates to the numbering of subsections subsequent to those inserted by amendments Nos. 37 and 44.  I recognise the intentions of amendments Nos. 40 and 51, proposed by Senators Higgins and Ruane and Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells, respectively, but note the issue they raise is addressed by the Government amendments.</p></speech>

I hope that we will be able to move through Report and Final Stages a lot more quickly than we moved through Committee Stage as we considered many of these issues in detail during those debates.  I put on record our thanks to the Minister and her officials for their engagement not only in this House, but also privately, in seeking to address some of the concerns and suggestions we had.  Many of the specific recommendations have been taken on board and we are particularly happy that the designation of an online safety commissioner is specifically included in the legislation.  As the Minister has mentioned, this was specifically sought by those of us who sit on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.  That is why Senator Cassells and I brought forward our very specific amendment, which we will be happy to withdraw in light of the amendment proposed by the Government.  It is welcome that the recruitment process for the online safety commissioner will start quite soon.  I hope that, all going well, he or she will be in place before the end of the year.  The question is then one of ensuring the office is adequately resourced.  That will be vital.  These will be budgetary considerations but the establishment of this commission, which will be one of the most powerful regulators in the State, and this office in particular, which we and many organisations including the Children's Rights Alliance believe to be critically important, is welcome.  We are very happy that the Minister is bringing forward these amendments.  We support them strongly.</p></speech>

She will be aware that our amendment No. 40 goes a little bit further in that it specifies some of the areas in which the online safety commissioner could potentially have duties or responsibilities.  I know that there will be opportunities to build on this in the D&aacute;il.  I imagine some of the discussion on identifying and naming key areas of action for an online safety commissioner may be elaborated upon there.  The core thing, which we all made clear in the early parts of the debate, is that the Bill is leaving the Seanad with a firm commitment to and requirement for at least one designated online safety commissioner, although there may potentially be more.  I thank the Minister for that.  I will be watching with interest to see if some of the potential functions of the commissioner we have signalled in amendment No. 40 are elaborated upon as the Bill moves forward to the D&aacute;il after the recess.</p> <p>I echo the points made by Senator Malcolm Byrne with regard to resources.  There will be budgetary discussions over the summer.  I lend our voice to those hoping that the Minister will be given the proper resources to fund these functions properly in order that the commission is able to perform its functions to a really high level right from the get-go in 2023.</p></speech>

As was emphasised by the Oireachtas joint committee, it is extremely important that there be an online safety commissioner.  I thank the Minister for taking that on board and bringing a proposal for such a position here today.  I concur with those who have thanked the staff in the Department.  Every phone call any of us made on this matter was replied to and there was full interaction and discussion on any parts of the Bill we asked about.  I will emphasise again what Senator Malcolm Byrne has said, which is that the online safety commissioner must be properly resourced to carry out his or her role.  That is important and will send out a very strong message.</p></speech>

Section 7(2)(b) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by section 7 of the Bill requires that, in performing its functions, an coimisi&uacute;n shall endeavour to ensure that the interests of the public, and the interests of children in particular, are protected.  This amendment will further clarify this provision.  With regard to the matter of child safety raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells, this amendment provides that, in protecting the interests of children, an coimisi&uacute;n will have particular commitment to the safety of children.  As to the matter of promoting the interests of the public and children raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane, I am confident that the inserting the term "commitment" will clarify that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will both guard and promote the interests of children as regards their safety.</p> <p>I note that the issue raised by amendment No. 9 tabled by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells is addressed by the amendment I have brought.  I set out some of my concerns regarding amendment No. 8 on Committee Stage.  I remain of the view that it is not appropriate to highlight the rights of privacy and reputation in relation to the functions of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.  The mechanism to protect and vindicate these rights is set out in other legislative instruments, specifically the Data Protection Act 2018 and the general data protection regulation in relation to privacy and the Defamation Act 2009 in relation to reputation.  A reference to those rights may give rise to the expectation or inference that an coimisi&uacute;n has some specific function in protecting those rights.   Accordingly, I do not intend to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I am very happy with the Minister's amendment and will strongly support it.  As for our concerns about the right to privacy and reputation, I will not reiterate the point that we raised on Committee Stage but the Minister will be aware that it was about the balance between competing rights, that is, the right to freedom of expression, which is clearly set out in the legislation, and the rights I have mentioned.  However, given the overall language of the section and given the Minister's points, her amendment will be accepted and we will withdraw ours.  I again thank her for taking on board our concerns.</p></speech>

We spoke specifically about the sections pertaining to the interests of children.  This was motivated by the discussions with the special rapporteur on child protection when he came before the committee and with students who came from various primary and secondary schools to debate these points with us.  I thank the Minister for taking these points on board.  I note what she has said about the right to privacy already being addressed.  We had a robust debate during our first encounter.

In this regard, these amendments require coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to bear in mind the participation and representation of the people of the island of Ireland in terms of its policies towards broadcasting and on-demand media services.  A distinction is made between participation, which means involvement in the activities of those services, and representation, which means being in programmes made available by those services.</p> <p>Furthermore, by locating this amendment within the matters regarding the people of the island of Ireland that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n must bear in mind in respect of its policies towards broadcasting and on-demand media services, the amendment covers the participation and representation of all groups of people living on this island.  While consideration was given to specifying specific groups or protected characteristics in this amendment, I think it prudent to ensure that the amendment is drafted to cover all the people of our island in all of their diversity in order that there is no implication that any people are omitted by this provision, particularly cultural minorities.</p> <p>On amendment No. 14, amendment No. 12 addresses the concern regarding the right to and importance of cultural participation, which is a right ultimately set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p></speech>

Again, it concerns the key issue of participation, which we have debated back and forth.  I am really glad that this key issue has been taken on board.  Of course, participation is not the same as representation and <i>vice versa</i>.  They perform in different areas.</p><p>The Government amendment is constructive and is in the spirit of the audiovisual directive and <i>l'exception culturelle</i>, which<i></i>recognises culture is not solely a commercial activity that needs to be regulated but a right that has incredibly important cultural and social functions.</p><p>As the Minister mentioned, our amendment No. 14 is very much in the spirit of the UN declaration.  It also reflects the spirit of EU law and EU perspectives in terms of the role of culture and the importance of participation.  However, I believe that these issues have been adequately and constructively addressed in Government amendment No. 12 and its reference to &quot;their levels of participation in those services and their levels of representation&quot;, which will be placed alongside and will complement the &quot;religious, ethical, cultural, and gender diversity&quot; in section 7(2)(c)(iii) and the reference to people with disabilities in section 7(2)(c)(iv).  It is in that context that I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 14.  I thank the Minister for taking all of this on board as by naming participation in this way, a much stronger mandate is being sent to the commission.  This is a reminder that the commission will not simply regulate a commercial service or access to same but in fact will play a role in supporting and considering the level of participation in shaping our shared culture.</p></speech>

As the Minister will be aware, I tabled multiple amendments to embed equality and human rights, given the public duty to equality and human rights, throughout different aspects of this legislation.  I believe that probably one of the best places for equality and human rights to be reflected is at the top level, as that would have a cascading effect on the powers and functions of the commission.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister has engaged a little with these issues elsewhere but I still believe it would be beneficial to have them addressed at the top level.

I am very concerned about environmental considerations in this area.  It is not just about the content because there are some good provisions later in the Bill around things like the European levy and the European work schemes and environmental content.  What I was trying to get at here was environmental considerations.  I am thinking of the considerable energy usage attached to certain forms of online activity and the fact that there are choices there in terms of energy-intensive or non energy-intensive options.  For example, it takes the equivalent of a few transatlantic flights to train an algorithm.  That may have been assigned to one of the commercial communication purposes that are regulated by the Bill.  I understand that at the moment, Amazon Web Services is one of the largest users of electricity in the State because of data processing.  As information emerges in this area, we are going to have to grapple with the intersection between online regulation and environmental regulation.  I had hoped amendment No. 17 would strengthen the hand of the commission in that regard.  That is why I will proceed with that amendment.  I acknowledge that there are good provisions in the Bill around content but this is about placing environmental considerations along with societal and technological ones.  If, for example, we had a period of energy shortages or a real debate around data usage, the commission would have something useful to contribute to that debate.</p></speech>

I agree that these should be important principles in guiding the work of the commission and I believe that these principles are set out in various provisions of the Bill as appropriate.  Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.</p> <p>Regarding amendment No. 17, addressing climate change and environmental degradation are some of the greatest challenges of our time.  This will of course impact not only the media sector but our entire society.  This Government has taken action through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the adoption of carbon budgets and the comprehensive climate action plan.  I agree it is important that an coimisi&uacute;n should take account of these matters.  That is why section 7(4) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, requires the commission to take account of the policies of the Government and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications as regards climate change and environmental sustainability.  Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.</p></speech>

This amendment, and its consequential amendments Nos. 19 to 22, inclusive, 28, 29 and 129, require coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to promote and encourage the use of the Irish language by communications media operating in the State.  In this regard, communications media is defined in the Bill as:</p> <blockquote> 	(a) broadcasting services,<br /><br />(b) audiovisual on-demand media services,<br /><br />(c) designated online services, or<br /><br />(d) newspapers or periodicals consisting substantially of news and comment on current affairs; </blockquote> <p>As such, the amendment places a broad duty on an coimisi&uacute;n to promote the use of the Irish language, both in terms of business use and content, by media in Ireland.  The Bill as initiated had already set out the responsibility of an coimisi&uacute;n to promote and stimulate the development of programmes in the Irish language, so this amendment is effectively further clarifying the important role an coimisi&uacute;n will play as regards the promotion of the Irish language.</p></speech>

We had a good discussion on Committee Stage about what exactly is meant by an educational institution or looking at it from too top-heavy a point of view.  We need more grassroots, on-the-ground community involvement and consultation, recognising that co-operation is needed with community, local and sporting bodies as regards education and training initiatives.  That way, it will not all fall within the education sector, which would have removed the huge number of people involved in education within the community or in their local community colleges.</p></speech>

It stemmed from a thought-provoking congress when Larry McCarthy, the president of the GAA, put it forward that sporting organisations needed to get on board in this regard.  I believe that in the past month, the GAA has engaged with Google.  The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, was recently in Croke Park to work on this issue.  I am delighted that a provision that they would liaise is being put into the legislation.</p> <p>I also ask that consideration be given to the Sport Ireland Act with a view to perhaps putting in something there to make sure that every sporting organisation actually puts it into their code of conduct.  This is the point I was making at the beginning.  Each individual sport has its code of conduct and penalties for people who do not adhere to it.  I ask that this could be looked at as well.  I thank the Minister for including this in the Bill.</p> <p>I compliment the GAA.  I might be a bit biased because I am involved in the association but it has been very thought provoking, has been ahead of the game by getting out ahead of this legislation being put in place and has started to work on implementing it within its organisation.</p></speech>

The Minister will also be aware of our Oireachtas committee report, which dealt with the abuse of officials, sportspersons and referees in particular.  There is particular reference to the online abuse that is also being experienced.</p> <p>The Minister has included media literacy.  There will be a major requirement on the new media commission to place an emphasis on media literacy both among young people and in wider society.  This is not just about making people aware of the functions of the commission itself.  It is also about understanding how our media operates, understanding how online media operates, and understanding how algorithms operate, and so on.

As the Minister has said, there is a need for media literacy, not just among educational bodies and society more broadly, and sporting bodies especially.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, we launched our Oireachtas committee report on bullying within sporting organisations.  A specific piece of work also was done on online bullying.  Representatives from all the major pillar sports were at the launch in Leinster House and it received significant media coverage.  Unfortunately, we cannot legislate for cop-on.  Unfortunately, it is an ever-diminishing return in society.  I wish that we could legislate for it.  That particular report launch came only three days after a very high-profile match that was held, which included an incident involving numerous players in a row that was broadcast live on television and then debated.   Subsequently, one of the members involved, who was not a member of the playing squad, was identified online with his name, his profession and everything about him being blasted online.  Instantly a hate campaign began, with a trial on social media, without following any of the due regard that sporting organisations have for their own players.  Regardless of whether what the young man did was right or wrong - and it was wrong - he equally was entitled to not have his own life decimated in that way.  There is a period of education required for sporting bodies and their members about events that happen within sporting organisations and then seeing it blasted out on social media.  Our report launch came a short space of time after that incident, which was very welcome because it showed the deficiency within our society and within our own organisations in respect of how we treat each other.  Sometimes we treat one another extremely badly online.  We would not like to see it happen on the streets but it suddenly becomes acceptable online.  There is a coarseness to the discourse that happens online.  We cannot legislate for idiots but making insertions regarding educational programmes for all spheres of society is a very welcome step.  I hope that those who lead within those organisations engage proactively with the commission so perhaps we can reduce that coarseness and see a bit more decorum in society.</p></speech>

There are two issues here, namely, the media literacy issue and the question of the wider reach that is being proposed.  When we look at it solely through the educational lens, we are perhaps thinking of the educational skills space but we are leaving aside the fact that this online media permeates every single aspect of society and that everybody needs to be skilled in it at every age, regardless of whether this is an area they are going to work in or be skilled in or whether they are in any kind of formal or informal education system.  Specifying the engagement with community, local and representative bodies is really important in terms of training, but especially the community level engagement.</p> <p>I have emphasised this repeatedly but it is important to note that even the 2019 EU assessment on digital skills pointed out that Ireland has very low levels of digital literacy.  More than 40% of the population lack basic digital skills.  The media literacy point is really important but it is layered on a requirement for a lot more investment in digital literacy and empowerment.  Quite a lot of people who engage actively in the digital space, indirectly and through others, lack those independent skills of engagement.  This is important.  Media literacy is a useful way to do it because it covers the questions of digital literacy and the question of critical thinking and the capacity to critically analyse the kinds of online media that people are being presented with having targeted at them.  I commend that.</p> <p>I am glad that the Minister took on board the sensible amendments from other colleagues in the House on sporting bodies, which can have a very constructive and positive role.  Some of those initiatives were mentioned by Senator Carrigy.  In addition, Bohemians Football Club, for example, has had important and useful initiatives around inclusion and the environment.  There is a wealth of examples we could give from around the country.  It gives the space for sporting organisations to play a positive role.  I welcome these amendments.</p></speech>

This amendment provides for these matters by referring to the relevant Ministers with regard to each matter.  For example, it refers to the Minister for Justice with regard to the regulation of gambling.  It requires coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to have regard to the published policies of that Minister and the Government on that matter.  Lead responsibilities for these matters remains with the relevant Minister and the public bodies under the Minister's aegis.</p> <p>I note the matters raised in amendments Nos. 31 and 32 are addressed by amendment No. 30 and, accordingly, I am not accepting them.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 33 to 35, inclusive, address a matter raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Shane Cassells on Committee Stage and give further effect to the provision in amendment No. 30 stating that the coimisi&uacute;n shall have regard to the policies of the Minister for Justice regarding the regulation of gambling.</p> <p>Amendment No. 35 states that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, "co-operate, in relation to the regulation of gambling, with any public body concerned with that matter."  The reference to public bodies in this regard is designed to account for the current situation where the regulation of gambling in Ireland is the responsibility of multiple public bodies.  The proposed scenario under the gambling regulation Bill foresees a gambling authority having primary responsibility in this regard.</p></speech>

Senator Malcolm Byrne and I sought the insertion of a reference to the regulation of gambling in the Bill.  I accept what the Minister said, which is that the lead Department with responsibility for this is naturally the Department of Justice, which foresees the creation and implementation of that Bill in respect of gambling late this year.  Notwithstanding that, the point that we made is that the sphere in which gambling is now most prevalent is online.  As the Minister rightly said, it permeates many different public bodies too.  The Bill acknowledges and refers to that.  The coimisi&uacute;n will now seek to reflect the policies of the Minister in respect of gambling, which is significant, because if nothing else, it makes sure that the coimisi&uacute;n and Department will work hand-in-hand with another Department to make sure there are no loopholes available to this multi-billion euro industry which will do anything to harm young people, in particular.  It is our responsibility as a State to protect them and all people.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach shares that ethos too.  I thank the Minister for making sure that is reflected on the Bill.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 30 and 35 will do a significant amount to address the concerns we raised on Committee Stage.  While the lead Departments are obviously involved, it will be important for this media commission to address those key issues, including children's safety, which is why we wanted consultation with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Senator Cassells mentioned gambling specifically.  This will strengthen the legislation.  We are grateful to the Minister and her officials for including this.</p></speech>

The Minister might address this in her response.  While the Department of Justice has a role relating to gambling, I think the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has a role too.  I tabled amendments Nos. 80 and 81, which relate to gambling and other speculative financial activities.  We will come to those later.</p> <p>Regulation relating to harm needs to be considered.  There may be activities which are not criminal offences and which do not breach the law, but they may be damaging.  For example, one could consider the way gambling advertisements are targeted, who they are targeted at, and practices which may seek to encourage vulnerable persons to re-enter gambling if they have exited it.  Some of those practices have been discussed at length in this House.  While the Minister for Justice has a role in respect of illegal gambling, many of the gambling activities we are concerned with are quite legal or even encouraged and in some cases subsidised by the State.  The online part of that needs to be carefully examined.  I would be concerned if this amendment had the effect of the Minister for Justice being seen as the only way in which we might come at this issue.</p> <p>I looked at subsection (d) of amendment No. 30, which refers to, "published policies of the Government in respect of any matter referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c)."  That is why I ask if the Minister might be able to give us assurances.  If the Government or Cabinet looked at a related area of policy at the Minister's request, might the commission be able to have regard to that in the regulation of gambling, so that it would not be constrained to solely considering the policies of the Minister for Justice?  The Minister for Justice is related to part of it.  Some matters are health issues, such as addiction and how it might be addressed.  The Department of Health may provide important information and policies on gambling.  Will the Minister clarify that subsection (d) provides a wider scope and that we have not put gambling entirely into the remit of one Minister?  That would be unfortunate.</p></speech>

One related to membership of the commission, a set of measures to ensure there would be a diversity in the membership which represented the diversity in society.  The other concerns were that there would be appropriate skills and an appropriate balance of those skills among those constituting the commission.  We highlighted a third issue of gender equality.  I have not pressed forward because I recognise that it is quite a small commission so ensuring representation of the full diversity of society would be a difficult bar.  Nonetheless, we have put forward an amendment which is less restrictive than our previous amendments which were a requirement that there be a gender equality measure.  It was pointed out that a situation could be created where, for example, there is a temporary gap in the commission or if a recruitment process was under way; that could create issues.  Instead we have used more mild language.  No. 42 states "Where recommending to the Minister persons for appointment as members of the Commission, the Service shall endeavour to ensure that among the membership of the Commission there is an equitable balance between men and women."  No. 42 would make it an endeavour rather than a requirement threshold.  That reflects the discussions we had.</p> <p>No. 43 reflects something I have already highlighted.  In the amendments I have put forward throughout the Bill I have tried to underscore and place reminders of the public duty in terms of equality and human rights and the UNCRPD.  </p> <p>No. 41 is quite important.  It seeks to ensure that in performing their functions "the Public Appointments Service and the Minister shall seek to ensure that the Commission has an appropriate balance of knowledge of, and expertise in..." specified areas, namely, arts and culture; data protection and digital empowerment; online safety and digital regulation; and human rights and public participation.  </p> <p>As the legislation goes to the D&aacute;il in the autumn, I am conscious that the set of skills I have put forward may not be the best match.  However, I want to underscore that point because I know the Bill will undergo further scrutiny and development in the D&aacute;il and it is really important that the right skills and right balance of skills is there in the commission and we do not end up with a narrower set of skills or persons who do not have the specialist information.  This was recognised in the climate Act.  The previous climate change advisory council had had a preponderance of economists and it was recognised that there should be a balance of skills so there ought to be scientists and others represented as well.  </p> <p>I am conscious that the Minister probably will not be able to accept my set of suggested skills but I urge her and her officials to consider what they think would be the appropriate set of skills and make sure that they are copper-fastened into the recruitment process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#SS02800"><p>I thank the Senator for amendments Nos. 41 to 43, inclusive.  The posts of commissioner and executive chair of Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will be vitally important.  They will collectively constitute an coimisi&uacute;n itself and ultimately be responsible for the decisions that it will take.  It is important to note at the outset that the commissioners are not simply equivalent to board members.  They will be fulfilling executive functions and will be considered employees of an coimisi&uacute;n.  As such, the provisions of employment law apply to these appointments.  This is a model adopted from other regulators in the State, such as ComReg and Commission for Regulation of Utilities.</p> <p>I understand that each of the amendments are based broadly on the provisions of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 which relate to the appointment of members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  However, the more appropriate comparator for the commissioner roles in an coimisi&uacute;n would be the director rather than the members of IHREC. </p> <p>On amendment No. 41, as I previously stated on Committee Stage, I do not think it appropriate to set out a non-exhaustive set of knowledge or expertise required for an coimisi&uacute;n.  Matters pertaining to the selection criteria are best addressed within the context of the recruitment process run by the Public Appointments Service.  Accordingly, I am not accepting this amendment. </p> <p>I have previously addressed the point raised in amendment No. 43 during Committee Stage a number of times.  As I noted then, the duty set out in section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 is already binding on public bodies, and I do not see the relevance or merit of singling out any single UN convention unless absolutely appropriate to do.  Accordingly I am not accepting this amendment.</p> <p>On amendment No. 42, I did consider amendments proposed on Committee Stage which aimed to achieve a gender balance among commissioners, which is something I fully support in principle.  The legal advice my Department received was that providing for the membership of a minimum number of women on Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, as envisaged by the proposed amendments, would be contrary to section 8 of the Employment Equality Acts, 1998-2015, as it may lead to discrimination on the grounds of gender.  This Act prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee or prospective employee in relation to access to employment, which includes the recruitment process, and Article 14(1)(a) of directive 2006/54/EC, which provides for the equal treatment of men and women in terms of, among other things, access to employment. </p> <p>The specialist nature of the commissioner posts, for example the online safety commissioner, is such that each post will be recruited individually, rather than as a part of a panel of commissioners.  Accordingly, a requirement in law for a minimum number of women, or indeed men, in commissioner posts would compel the Public Appointments Service, at some point, to advertise a post open only to candidates of a particular gender, depending on the composition of the commission at any one time.  This would be contrary to the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 &ndash; 2015.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 42. </p></speech>

There are a number of ways that could be addressed that would not require the advertisement of a position solely to men or women.  An endeavour might apply in a situation where there might have been a majority of members of the commission who were of one gender that the Public Appointments Service might ensure that there was gender balance in the names put forward for the next position to be filled.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It may be as simple as ensuring there is a gender balance or, perhaps, where two or three candidates are put forward, that one of either gender would be put forward for the Minister's consideration.</p><p>There are imaginative ways to address this and we need to do so because we have a problem not solely within the membership of boards but also within the senior roles in our Civil Service and wider public service in respect of a gender balance at that level.  Proactive measures, which may not need to be exclusionary but rather may be inclusive to ensure there will be that gender balance at the higher levels and positions, are important.  I urge that some further imaginative thought be put into how that might be done.</p><p>On amendment No. 41, while I acknowledge each role is recruited individually, it is important we set the bar.  Sometimes, there is a danger within the Public Appointments Service, PAS, of a generalist approach whereby persons who have simply managed a certain number of people or who have done so at a certain level come in.  I accept the Minister will engage the PAS in regard to what the skills will be, but these are very specific skills.  The model I am looking for is not simply a board one but one that is similar to, for example, the Climate Change Advisory Council, which is certainly not a generic board but rather a series of expert persons.</p><p>I regret the fact the Minister cannot accept amendments Nos. 41 and 42 but I will press them.  I accept her point about the former amendment but, until I see the public duty to equality and human rights bearing fruit in every Department, I will keep trying to insert it into all legislation at every possible point until it takes hold.  It will do so, I hope, in this new body, which will have an opportunity to get things right from the outset.</p></speech>

We will not move any of them, but they speak to a general point about the exclusion of members of a local authority.  From the perspective of the Government, we have raised the point that the continued exclusion of local authority members from a range of roles and boards is not acceptable.  We have made that point in the context of other legislation but we will not press the amendments in this case.</p></speech>

Its purpose is to require coimisi&uacute;n na mean to establish a youth advisory committee as one of its advisory committees.</p> <p>In the drafting of the amendment, it was considered the age group the committee should represent should be those under 25 years of age including children, and that at least half of its members should be not more than 25 years of age.  In this regard, the stated age profile aligns with the categorisation of young people being those persons under 25 years of age under the provisions for content production schemes at section 159F of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by the Bill.</p> <p>The amendment provides that the youth advisory committee shall include representatives nominated, at the invitation of an coimisi&uacute;n, by organisations representing children or young people.  Finally, the amendment specifies that, in particular, the youth advisory committee shall advise an coimisi&uacute;n on online safety matters.  This is a recognition of the importance of the voice of young people in online safety in particular.  They are often at the coalface of new technologies and, unfortunately, of some of the harms that can arise from them.</p> <p>The matter raised by amendment No. 57 has been dealt with by the Government amendment in this grouping.</p></speech>

As those of us who sat on the Oireachtas committee know, some of the most insightful contributions and testimony were provided by the groups of young people who contributed.  Moreover, the experience of the Australian eSafety Commissioner is that her engagement with young people through panels such as this has been very useful.</p> <p>I welcome the fact the Minister's amendment will strengthen what we were proposing.  I hope we will establish the committee as quickly as possible and that there will be open engagement.  It is going to be about young people shaping the codes that impact on them.  As many teachers admitted to us when we engaged with them, they often learn more from their students about issues regarding online safety.</p> <p>I might make one small observation.  We referred to the body as a "youth advisory panel" and I am delighted it is now being described as a "youth advisory committee".  Nevertheless, amendment No. 58 was ruled out of order because we were seeking to set up a standing broadcasting committee.  The only difference between the panel and the broadcasting committee was that one was called a "committee", which I was told would cause a charge on the Exchequer.  While I appreciate that the amendment has been ruled out of order, I point out to the Minister that colleagues in the other House are likely to raise it as an issue.</p> <p>In any event, I very much welcome amendment No. 56, which will be a positive initiative.</p></speech>

It is very important and I thank the Minister for indicating she will accept it.  As Senator Malcolm Byrne said, in our discussions at committee level, we find ourselves more informed through discussing issues with that younger generation.  They are miles ahead of us in regard to technology and what they see every day.  We met the Australian commissioner and hers is the country we need to look to for best practice.  It was highlighted that these are regular discussions in that country.  I am delighted, therefore, to see this committee provided for, which I will support.</p></speech>

While section 27(1)(c) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by the Bill, sets out that the executive chairperson of an coimisi&uacute;n would be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the effectiveness of its operations, I believe this amendment is useful clarification that an coimsi&uacute;n shall have regard to all three components of the value-for-money framework for the public service, namely, efficiency, effectiveness and economy.</p></speech>

The words "effective", "efficient" and "economical" are all doing very different work and bring different considerations to bear.  The word "effective" is probably one of the most important.  I am really happy that it has been inserted.  I thank the Minister for taking that point on board in good faith.  What is being done here will strengthen the Bill.</p></speech>

This will allow the strategy statement to multiple Oireachtas committees where, for example, an coimisi&uacute;n may be fulfilling functions of policy interest to those committees.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 61 and 62 address a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage regarding the co-operation agreements an coimisi&uacute;n may enter into with bodies within and outside the State.  The purpose of these amendments is to require an coimisi&uacute;n to provide the joint committee with a copy of any co-operation agreements it enters into and publish any such co-operation agreements on a website maintained by it subject to the consent of all parties to the agreement any redactions that may be necessary.

It is appropriate in terms of amendment No. 62 that such agreements would go before the joint committee.  I particularly welcome amendment No. 60, which strengthens our proposal in that we had looked to the strategy being laid before a specific committee.  Under the Minister's proposal, it may be laid before such committees.  Again, it may be the case that it involves the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, which has done extraordinary work in its pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation, but it may well be the Joint Committee on Health or another committee that becomes relevant to some of the matters in the Bill.  This is a really constructive development that builds on and strengthens our amendments.</p></speech>

It tries to underscore and specifically reference the necessity and proportionality requirement, which is a key principle of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  The GDPR is referenced elsewhere, but with this amendment I am trying to underscore that in the context of the transfer of data to other bodies.  Again, I have some general concerns regarding the transfer of data between bodies.  The data retention and transfer legislation may not be as robust as it could be.  As a result, this is something I am trying to pick up on.</p> <p>I acknowledge amendment No. 64, which reflects a principle I discussed with the Minister and her officials, namely, the concern that where a person has given personal data to the commission, the commission would make sure that the person was aware of the disclosure.  There are two issues involved here.  One relates to the safeguards of necessity and proportionality in the transfer of a person's data.  The other relates to the fact that a person, having given his or her data to the commission, may not have the expectation that it would be passed to another body so even if his or her consent is not required for that, he or she should at least be informed that this data has been passed to a relevant body.  I appreciate that while my first principle was not taken on board, the second has been taken on board by the Government in amendment No. 64.</p> <p>I welcome amendment No. 68.  I would have liked if there had been a hard requirement for a data protection impact assessment.  I proposed that on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 68 goes halfway in that direction by giving the Minister discretion to consider whether it is necessary to carry out an assessment of the regulations.  Under this proposal, the Minister may carry out a data impact assessment.  I believe that it is necessary and that it would be better if we had it as a standard requirement in the Bill.  However, I acknowledge that at least the issue of an data protection impact assessment has been strengthened somewhat.  However, I still believe that it should be formally set out rather being discretionary to any degree.</p></speech>

Section 33 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by this Bill, sets out the circumstances in which and the bodies to which an coimisi&uacute;n may disclose a person's personal data.  The purpose of these amendments is to require coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to endeavour to notify a person whose personal data under this section.  This duty is qualified by the phrase "in so far as it is practicable to do so" to avoid an coimisi&uacute;n being derelict in this duty by virtue of a person becoming highly difficult or impossible to contact.</p> <p>The intention behind amendment No. 63 is sufficiently captured in subsection 2 of section 33 of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by this Bill.  Throughout subsection 2, it is specified that the commission shall only disclose personal data where it considers that it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes set out in the various paragraphs of subsection 2.  As a result, I am not accepting amendment No. 63.</p> <p>Amendment No. 68 and the amendments consequential to it, namely, amendments Nos. 69 to 71, inclusive, address a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage regarding data protection impact assessments.  The purpose of these amendments is to require the Minister where they are prescribed by statutory instrument either new bodies to which the commission may disclose personal data or new matters regarding which the commission may disclose personal data to consider where necessary carrying out a data protection impact assessment and if so, to carry out that assessment.  It is must be noted that section 84(12) of the Data Protection Act 2018 already requires a Minister proposing a legislative measure relating to the processing of personal data to consult with the Data Protection Commission during the process of preparing the legislative measure in question.</p></speech>

For example, we know that certain online practices, even the use of recommender systems and so forth, may be required to be regulated.  As this is a fast-moving area, there may well be a contract of service where the experts who are hired by the commission to inform it in the regulation of a new practice or a new area of content, may have interests in respect of the designated online providers, or others, who are the subject of that regulation.  It would be very important that that would be known.</p> <p>When looking at this, I am not thinking solely of long-term staff or the general staffing of the commission but of where contracts of service are granted in the specialised areas.  It would be very important that it would be known if there is a potential conflict of interest.  For example, we do not want those who may have been instrumental in creating a problem to end up getting hired on a contract of service to advise the commission on how that problem should be regulated.  That is the kind of scenario I was envisaging.  I know that at the general level, the conflict of interest issue might not apply to staff but because the measures in the Bill allow for a contract of service, or even short-term contracts of employment, that is where I would have that concern.</p></speech>

This amendment would seem to prevent employees from representing their interests to an coimisi&uacute;n, their employer.</p> <p>This provision in the Bill, as currently drafted, was designed to prevent those very such scenarios from occurring.

This is a revised version of a Committee Stage amendment, where I had a threshold of &euro;500,000, which may have been regarded as too low by some, but I believe &euro;1 million is a reasonable threshold.  This is me trying to meet halfway in regard to the threshold set out in the Bill, which is &euro;2 million.  My original proposal was &euro;500,000 but I think &euro;1 million is a reasonable compromise.</p><p>The reason this may be important is that many of the companies which become very large started quite small.  We know that sometimes poor practices can be led by smaller companies.  We know, for example, some companies, which have particular apps, have attached themselves and have led the way in the bad use and processing of data.  If there is a practice that is of concern in an online service provider, the commission is then empowered to act as early as possible before it becomes a widespread practice, so that we do not have a danger where we may have small companies, while they may be independent in terms of their own moneys, providing services to larger companies which are able to lead bad practice.  I want to ensure that the regulatory powers of the commission reaches as far as they can.  Any company which is looking at sales of &euro;1 million is in a situation where it should be able to take on board regulatory measures from the commission, and should be open to this.  Again, this will not require the commission to immediately take steps to regulate these companies but it will empower it to do so.</p></speech>

However, this is an area which I believe requires greater and further consideration.  I am aware that this is a difficult area to address but it needs to be more nuanced than it is currently.  I hope there will be opportunities for that to happen over the course of the Bill's journey into the D&aacute;il and that perhaps some of the concerns we have raised may get addressed at that point.</p><p>Currently, the Bill has quite a worryingly vague use of the word of &quot;offensive&quot;.  We discussed this on Committee Stage where I mentioned that &quot;anything which [might] reasonably be regarded as causing harm or offence,&quot; could perhaps be interpreted as financial harm or a situation where this could be exploited by those in power such as with a politeness clause, and others that might be used and weaponised against more vulnerable parties, or those who critique those with very large amounts of power.</p><p>I say this as someone who has been a proponent of the importance of challenging and regulating hate speech but there is principle involved in addressing hate speech and that protecting the most vulnerable in our society would be done in a very carefully thought through way so that it is not, in fact, exploited or it does not become weaponised against the more vulnerable in society and against marginalised groups.  Members will be aware that some of my previous amendments sought to tie it specifically to those who are protected under our equal status legislation.</p><p>Amendment No. 75 seeks to delete the phrase in regard to broadcasting anything which might be reasonably deemed to cause harm or offence.  I say that again in the context of being quite open to a strengthening of legislation on hate but the phrasing at the moment is too wide.  Amendment No. 76, which would be preferred by me, seeks to replace the phrase with a more concrete threshold which states that it should not broadcast anything which may cause harm to a group of persons, or a member of a group, based on any of the grounds referred to in article 21 of the charter.  We are looking at persons who are experiencing harm based on their identity, on who they are, and not, for example, harm to financial interests or to one's business interests.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We should not have an equivalence between persons who are receiving harm based on who they are and persons who deem that they receive harm based on having an unpopular opinion and so forth.</p><p>Amendment No. 77 addresses a real concern over the phrase "undermining the authority of the State."  I seek to bring clarity by tying it to the Offences against the State Act.  Where the phrase "undermining the authority of the State" appears in the Constitution it has attached those caveats about freedom of expression.  It is not a phrase floating on its own.  Taking that phrase and placing it here in a decontextualised way is ambiguous.  It would be better to tie those measures to things already identified in the Offences against the State Act so that we are tying these constraints to specific statutory concerns, which would be more robust.</p><p>The reference to incitement to violence or hatred in section 46J(1)(d) is important.  Perhaps it might be useful for section 46J(1)(d) to be strengthened and for section 46J(1)(a) to be narrowed.  We will come to something similar at a later point where rights and opinions seem to be given equivalence about which I am also concerned.</p><p>I know this is transferring from other legislation.  However, in recent years, months and weeks even we have seen that some of that earlier legislation might not actually be effective.  The legislation we have at the moment may not be protecting more vulnerable persons but may be used in a way that silences.  It tends to be more strongly enforced for those who have the power or potential resources to threaten legal action than for other vulnerable groups in society.</p></speech>

The Senator made some important points regarding the use of the term "harm or offence".  My officials are consulting the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland regarding the existing practical operation of this provision.  It will be important that any amendment that may be brought forward does not have unintended effects.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept these amendments.</p> <p>Regarding amendment No. 77, the language in the Bill and extant Broadcasting Act reflects Article 40.6 of the Constitution.  Given that the fundamental right to freedom of expression flows from both our Constitution and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and European Convention on Human Rights, there is a high bar for any steps that the State may take to limit freedom of expression.  As I set out on Committee Stage, while Article 40.6 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, it requires that right to be qualified in certain instances.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p> <p>As I set out on Committee Stage, while I understand the intention of amendment No. 78, I do not think that section 46L(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill, needs to be qualified in the manner suggested by the amendment.  The language used in the section reflects similar language in the extant Broadcasting Act which has not to date exercised a chilling effect on broadcast journalism.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

On Committee Stage, I combined the two issues of gambling and the promotion of speculative financial activities such as cryptocurrency.  I believe they are very strongly linked.  In recognition of the strong support across the House to have much stronger constraints on advertising and given that the debate on cryptocurrency is one that is evolving, I have put them as separate amendments.</p> <p>I know the Minister for Justice may introduce provisions in this regard.  We need action on gambling and it should not be left to the Minister for Justice.  I believe the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media can lead on this because massive profits are being made in the online gambling area.  It is also one where we are seeing some of the more dubious practices, which prey on, encourage and nurture gambling addiction.  We need to address that at an early stage.  Simply looking to the Department of Justice is too narrow.  I sit on the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach and it is an issue that has been raised there.  These areas are ones where the online space is incredibly important.  That is why I have pushed the idea of media service codes and online safety codes in these amendments.</p> <p>Senator Wall and others in this House have outlined at great length the damage that gambling can do.  Previously in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill we made specific provisions relating to alcohol and addiction.  A framework dealing with the issue of addiction and exploitation would also be relevant for gambling.</p> <p>Advertisements for cryptocurrency are all-pervasive online.  We have talked in this House about loot boxes that train children from a young age in gambling practices.  The extremely aggressive advertising of stock trading and cryptocurrency across all kinds of social media platforms is a real concern.  This is not an issue that is floating out there.  It is an issue which in particular exploits times when people are under financial pressure.  People lose their entire livelihoods.  They gamble away on cryptocurrencies and very quickly they can lose extraordinary amounts of money.</p> <p>People may have seen articles as recently as in the last couple of weeks.  I do not like the use of terms such as "crypto queen" or other glamorised language.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One of the first and largest cryptocurrency pyramid schemes, OneCoin, is estimated to have caused up to &euro;4 billion worth of financial loss in that scheme.  Extraordinarily, millions of individuals have lost out as a result of that scheme.  One of the first people responsible for OneCoin, having aggressively marketed this Ponzi scheme, having told everybody it was the next Bitcoin, having pulling people into it and having caused them to lose their livelihoods, was last seen in Dublin before disappearing off the grid with a large amount of money taken from the scheme.  Ireland needs to think very carefully about the issue of cryptocurrency, given that we are a major data centre and given that we have seen the damage done by excessive data mining environmentally.  We have also seen the political instability caused in Kyrgyzstan by aggressive cryptocurrency mining.  This is not a small or a minor issue.  It is one of the main kinds of advertisement that I personally see online.  The issue needs to be addressed.  We do not need to wait for the Departments of Finance or Justice to address it and the Minister could take the lead on the issue.  I believe that gambling and cryptocurrency are health issues and massive issues of public interest.  I hope that we can strengthen the Bill in the autumn in the D&aacute;il in respect of both of those issues.  </p></speech>

Senator Malcolm Byrne and I fought to have that reflected in this Bill, by asking that the Minister, her Department and the online safety commissioner reflect Government policy.  Ultimately, there will be two commissioners.  We do not want one crossing over the other.  We want them to work hand in hand.  Please God, the office of the gambling commissioner will be established by the end of this year.  We hope that the online commissioner, using the statutory powers available to him or her, will work hand in hand with the gambling commissioner.

I raised the fact that I have a problem with amendment No. 81 on Committee Stage.  The amendment states "A broadcaster shall not broadcast ... an advertisement which seeks to promote speculative financial activities".  We are all familiar with the advertisements saying that the value of a person's investment may go up or down.  Banks and other financial institutions regularly offer what could be referred to as speculative financial activities.  I do not have a problem with people taking the opportunity to invest in a particular product, which could include stocks or shares, if they so wish, provided that they are aware that the value of their investment may go up or down.  There is a broader question here which comes back to discussions we had earlier on media and digital literacy.  That is why I believe that by banning such advertisements, in many ways we would be driving a lot more of it into the dark web.  I do not want to get into a debate around cryptocurrencies and the underlying technologies.  That is why there is a response on the part of central banks, including the European Central Bank, ECB.  I do not believe that we should be seeking to ban advertising around financial products.  Part of the challenge here is around the questions that we talked about earlier on digital and media literacy.  As I have said previously and as Senator Cassells has outlined, what the Minister did with the earlier amendments, by ensuring that Departments co-ordinate their activity and the relevant agencies, makes a lot of sense.</p></speech>

On the commercial communications for gambling, given that the gambling authority of Ireland to be established by the gambling regulation Bill will issue codes in respect of advertising, including in relation to online gambling, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 80, 93 or 109.  On the issue of speculative financial activities, I note that the Central Bank of Ireland regulates the advertising of financial activities by financial services firms under its remit.  The rules are set out in the consumer protection code published by the Central Bank.  Finally, as regards crypto-assets, I note that the EU markets in crypto-assets regulation is currently under negotiation in Brussels and will set out a regulatory framework for those assets.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 81, 94 or 110.</p></speech>

I will certainly engage with him on that.  However, me experience in this House means I generally seek to put measures on a train that is already moving, as it were, rather than the one that may be coming down the line.  In general, that is why I will always seek to have measures inserted where I think they are relevant.  If that is then superseded by better future legislation or policies, so be it.  That is why I am pressing the issue.  On cryptocurrencies, I am concerned by the use of the phrase "crypto-assets".  They are not assets.  They do not constitute assets.  According to the phrase used about the scheme that I mentioned previously, "they are selling thin air".  It is not thin air; it is hot air, in that it is quite energy intensive.  It is costing the planet.  I am extremely concerned about the matter.  With absolute respect, I am concerned and nervous in respect of the discussions taking place in the EU at the moment.  They are being led by Commissioner McGuinness, who I believe has made a poor decision in relation to the taxonomy on gas and nuclear energy.  That is one of the reasons Ireland really needs to look at the issue.  I am concerned that Ireland will end up being a soft actor in terms of cryptocurrency and part of a legitimisation exercise in respect of something which is both massively socially damaging and extraordinarily environmentally damaging.</p> <p>I want to mark the card right now.  I believe that cryptocurrencies are bad and a problem.  We should ban them.  I will be seeking to ban them at every possible opportunity in every relevant item of legislation.  I know that there may be a separate provision on digital currencies where they are linked to something.  I am concerned about the use of the term "crypto-assets".  The cryptocurrency industry is an extremely aggressive and precarious industry.  Quite frankly, at a point where we are facing ecological collapse, the last thing we can afford to do is to allow a whole brand new form of speculative, made-up risk be created to layer on top of the significant real risks that we are facing environmentally, in terms of food and global conflict.  Why would we add a brand new stupid problem that we do not need to add, right on top of that?  It is absolutely absurd.  It is exploitative.  Just to be clear, in their aggressive advertisement it is not the small players who spend their &euro;5,000 in savings on cryptocurrency who are the main supporters of the industry.  They are the human shields of the industry.  They will be the reason we will be told that we need to bail the industry out when it starts collapsing.  I just really hate cryptocurrencies.  I have to get that on the record.</p></speech>

I note that it makes reference to section 46N, which relates to the rules that apply in these instances.  This is an important area and one in which I have a particular interest.</p><p>We all know we live in a constitutional democracy and there are statutory obligations as well as constitutional obligations.  However, all signposts and roads lead in the one direction, that the broadcaster's overriding obligation is one of fairness, objectivity and impartiality.  That is an imposition and it is not for bargaining.  That is imposed on all broadcasters.</p><p>I believe it is appropriate that individuals and all political parties do not meddle in the editorial coverage of, for example, a general election.  This should rest solely with the broadcaster, once it is done in a fair and seen to be fair way in the relevant applicable media service provider.  It has to be transparent.  However, this does not mean that it is immune from assessment.  We live in a democracy and, at times, we have had tensions between the different separations of powers in the past.  As this monumental legislative measure goes through the Houses, I assume it will also be tested over the years and will be helped in its interpretation by a new set jurisprudence.  Jurisprudence in the past was not afraid to stand up for fairness, much as we are reluctant to do so because in a democracy we must give the broadcaster a wide berth and wide discretion.  However, broadcasters must uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution.  There is no mention of the Constitution in this Bill.  There never is in legislation because there is a presumption of constitutionality.  In the back of everyone's mind are the people who ultimately decide, in the form of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.</p><p>The democratic values enshrined in the Constitution and which are applicable in this and other sections include the right to equal treatment in the political process.  I accept the right to equal treatment is not an absolute right.  It may be restricted, but only restricted once it is done in a fair, impartial and objectively justifiable way.  The McKenna <i>v</i>. An Taoiseach (No. 2) case concerned the extent to which the allocation by the D&aacute;il of &pound;500,000 to the Government was to be used for a publicity campaign to promote a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in a referendum.  That was deemed to represent an unlawful expenditure of public funds to promote one side of the argument.</p><p>The late Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, had regard, and we as legislators should have regard, and it is nice that we can say that we listen to the people across the River Liffey, to the equality which is fundamental in the democratic nature of the State.  However, the Chief Justice had particular regard to the unique role of referenda in the democratic process.  This goes to the heart of what my Labour Party colleagues want in a fair way.  It is covered in the legislation, but one can never go far enough in these matters.  We should not leave it to the Constitution but tie it down as much as possible in statute law.  The Chief Justice said:</p> <blockquote> 	The role of the People in amending the Constitution cannot be overemphasized.  It is solely their prerogative to amend any provision thereof by way of variation, addition or repeal or to refuse to amend.  The decision is theirs and theirs alone.  Having regard to the importance of the Constitution as the fundamental law of the State and the crucial role of the People in the adoption and enactment thereof, any amendment thereof must be in accordance with the constitutional process and no interference with that process can be permitted because, as stated by Walsh J. in <i>Crotty v. An Taoiseach</i>it is the people themselves who are the guardians of the Constitution&quot;. </blockquote> <p>Protected under the rubric of personal rights in the Constitution, and mirrored in this statutory provision we are hoping to enact, is the freedom to hold and communicate political opinion.  That is at the heart of this module in this very substantive legislative measure.  Article 40.6.1&deg; guarantees freedom of expression and association.  There have been a number of cases concerned with fairness of political broadcasting by reason of the inclusion of some political players and not others.  I commend all those in the past on doing that.  It was RT&Eacute; then, but broadcasters and applicable relevant service providers are more widespread now.  People and broadcasters should never be afraid to take interpretations, and I commend the long list of people who were plaintiffs in the past.  Sometimes they were not victorious, for example, the Kivlehan <i>v</i>. RT&Eacute; case in 2016.  Ms Justice Marie Baker in the High Court ruled against the plaintiff, but did not order costs.  She said he engaged at the high-level aspects of the Constitution.  The political players and who are included is very important and I believe that is the motivation behind the Labour Party Senators' concerns.</p><p>The circumstances in each of the cases that have come before the courts have been very different, but the underpinning reason of the court in each of these cases has been the question of whether the court was considering the exercise of broadcasting discretion in a manner which trespassed constitutionally on other people's rights if the discretion went too far and could not be justified.  Thus in the famous Coughlan case, the court was moved to conclude that the constitutional principles of equality and fairness applicable to broadcasting were breached in that instance, when the coverage given preferred one side over the other.  Although in that case the court was concerned with a referendum, it is clear from the reasoning of the court both in Coughlan and the earlier case of McKenna that its conclusions apply equally where there is an unequal approach which prefers one party over another in a general election.  Interestingly, in the Coughlan <i>v</i>. the Broadcasting Complaints Commission case, the late Mr. Justice Paul Carney said that the respondent, as a national broadcasting service, is subject to the Constitution and to statute which require it to uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution and a constitutionally fair procedure.</p><p>I will conclude by referring to an interesting extract that was published in Judge Gerard Hogan's book, <i>The Origins of the Irish Constitution, 1928-1941</i>.  The more things change, the more things remain the same.  He reproduced in his tome, which is a very respected book, a transcript of a radio broadcast by &Eacute;amon de Valera in April 1937.  It is now preserved in the National Archives of Ireland under the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is filed safely there.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P.

That principle runs right through the draft Constitution published today.  By the votes of the people the President of the State will be chosen, by them the House of Representatives will be elected, and on the nomination of that House the responsible Government will be appointed.  By the people only, through the Referendum, can the National Constitution be amended.  The sovereignty resides in the people as their inalienable and indefeasible right.  [De Valera added that] Every elector who casts his [or her] vote in favour of the adoption of this Constitution will in effect be subscribing his name to the proposition that in this country the people and the people alone are the masters. </blockquote><p>I say to all the broadcasters that they are the servants.  The people are the masters.  The public representatives here today are the servants.  We enjoy the operation of the presumption of the constitutionality of the statute law, but if it ever crosses, trespasses or entrenches onto constitutional grounds, we live in a vibrant democracy and people may exercise their right in the future.  In time to come, we might see this in the decades of jurisprudence that will follow this very substantive and highly significant legislation.  I commend the Labour Party Senators on being so forensic in this particular amendment, which goes to the heart of what is fair.  Sometimes, we cannot make it fair in one go, but the Act allows for broadcasters to have a number of broadcasts to make it fair and to level the pitch again.  I will leave it at that for now.  Thank you for your indulgence, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 86 and 87 deal with similar concerns but are possibly more serious in terms of the problems with the language as it is construed.  I refer to the ambiguity around addressing what is or is not offensive.  Amendment No. 87 addresses specific concerns.  The provision at the moment gives undue weighting to the question of a person's convictions.  The reference is &ldquo;with due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience,".  I seek to replace that with the phrase "with due sensitivity to the subject matter and the audience,", although I do not object to the term "feelings of the audience" being included.  If somebody has a religious conviction that somebody else should not exist, that is not something that the authority or media services should have due regard to.  It is suggested that the audience must be protected from anything that is harmful or offensive to anybody's convictions or feelings.  That is very important.  The term "convictions" is quite wide.  Does it include political convictions?  For example, if a political party gets a majority vote in the State, does a broadcaster say that it represents the majority of people's convictions and it will not do anything that challenges that?  If it is a religion, does a broadcaster become religious in that regard?  We know that there are perspectives where people have convictions on entire other genders and how they should be treated.  We have seen attitudes in terms of how women have been treated in the past in the media.</p> <p>There is a whole piece here.  We need to look to the question of sensitivity, but as it is framed at the moment: "with due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience," creates parity between somebody who is personally affected by a matter and somebody who has a view on a matter.  Somebody who has an opinion is given the same weighting, regardless of whether the opinion is rooted in any kind of fact, as somebody who is personally affected and vulnerable.  That is why I have tried to bring in language that does not limit in any way the freedom of the media, but ensures that they can bring a nuanced approach so as to have due sensitivity to the subject matter and whether it is inflammatory or may have consequences, affect or create distress or distressing situations for individuals that may affect their freedom to participate in society.  Sensitivity to the subject matter and sensitivity to the audience is a better frame than the idea of allowing a person's sensitivity to convictions or feelings.  How are those to be measured?  Will there be opinion polls in the case of an audience?  How will the audience of an online provider be measured?.  This is where it becomes very important in terms of media service providers because in the case of radio stations or broadcasters, they tend to be catering to a very wide audience, but we may well have online media providers that are catering to a very particular audience.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They may be able to say that their audience wants many very angry messages that reinforce the audience's convictions.  We know there are media outlets online that specialise in mining a seam of hatred, exploitation or fear and continue to feed it.  Those may well be the convictions of their audience.  It is almost like a mandate for an echo chamber.  It is, therefore, really important that this be addressed.  I know it is an issue at which the Minister is looking and that it will be considered in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister might not be able to take on board the measure I put forward in respect of this but it is an area where, to be honest, simply transposing the old law and old language will not work.  It is not actually working in terms of media generally at the moment and that language will especially not work in terms of online media.  Again, I urge the Minister to look at that.</p><p>Amendment No. 88 is a very practical amendment that seeks to ensure that, for example, provisions related to sexual conduct would not ban the inclusion of educational materials on sexual health and relationships.  It is to ensure that, for example, an online provider that is providing useful information or material for individuals in terms of sexual health, consent, relationships and so forth does not inadvertently fall under this remit or, indeed, that the commission is not bothered with needless complaints that suggest it might fall under that remit.  Again, this is trying to ensure that the commission does not have to deal unnecessarily with measures that are not really a matter of concern.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work she is doing in this area, including the recent publication of a Bill last week.  I will address the first point of the amendment setting out that broadcast programmes should reflect the participation and be responsive to the interests of all groups.  I have sought to address this issue as broadly as possible through amendment No. 11, which requires Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n to bear in mind the participation and representation of the people of the island of Ireland with regard to its policies towards broadcasting and on-demand media services.  I am absolutely committed to supporting diversity, inclusion and the full and effective participation of women across sectors for which my Department is responsible.  I agree with the intention underpinning amendment No. 84 regarding the equal participation of men and women on news and current affairs shows.  If we are to use media service codes as the mechanism to achieve broadly equal participation, however, we may need to provide more detail within the Bill to guide an coimisi&uacute;n in making codes.  Provision may need to be made to specify what happens, for example, when there are an uneven number of guests.  I have asked my officials to explore this matter further over the summer recess.</p> <p>As to the final point of amendment No. 84 relating to airplay quotas for women, artists and composers, I would like to continue to examine the issue further.  I would caution, as I did on Committee Stage, that quotas based on the residence or citizenship of an artist are not permissible under EU law.  Airplay quotas based on gender may be permissible under EU law, but without a residence criterion, simply introducing gender-based quotas may lead to unintended effects.  Again, I have asked my officials to examine this issue further during the summer recess.</p> <p>I want to finish discussing amendment No. 84 by thanking Senator Sherlock for highlighting Why Not Her? for publishing the recent gender disparity data report 2022.  It is evident from the data that while there has been improvement across a number of radio stations, more needs to be done to promote and safeguard women's voices on air.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for the other amendments.  As I stated on Committee Stage, I cannot accept amendment No. 86.  The principles and policies set out in section 46N of the Broadcasting Act, as amended, must reflect the need that audiences are protected from harmful or offensive content being broadcast as this is an important consideration in making media service codes.  I understand the point the Senator is making in looking at the issue more generally in the context of amendments Nos. 75 and 76, which concern a proposal by the Senators to amend similar wording regarding the duties of broadcasters and providers of video-on-demand services.</p> <p>As I stated on Committee Stage, I am advised that the proposed wording of amendment No. 87 seems to broadly achieve the same effect as the wording currently in the Bill.  Therefore, I reject the amendment on that basis.</p> <p>Having further considered the matter, I am advised that the provision in amendment No. 88 could not be interpreted as to preclude the provision of programme material related to sexual conduct for educational purposes, particularly on important topics such as consent, sexual health and relationships.  Accordingly, I am rejecting the amendment.</p></speech>

I commend the quality of the debate on this issue during Committee Stage and assure Senators that I have given this matter due consideration.</p><p>As Senators are aware, the Bill as published conferred broad powers on an coimisi&uacute;n to regulate commercial communications on video-on-demand and broadcasting services through media service codes.  In particular, section 46N(2)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended, by the Bill, as initiated, sets out that an coimisi&uacute;n may make media service codes, which may provide for standards and practices to ensure:</p> <blockquote> 	(d) that commercial communications&mdash;  	(i) protect the interests of the audience, and<br /><br />(ii) in particular, where they relate to matters likely to be of direct or indirect interest to children, protect the interests of children having particular regard to the general public health interests of children.  </blockquote> <p>Subsection (5) of section 46N of the Act further specifies that an coimisi&uacute;n may prohibit commercial communications &quot;relating to foods or beverages considered by the Commission to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children, in particular those foods or beverages which contain fat, trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars.&quot;</p><p>Amendment No. 89 is intended to clarify the language in subsection (5) of section 46N by providing that an coimisi&uacute;n may not only prohibit but may &quot;restrict, in accordance with law&quot; the commercial communications referenced.  Amendment No. 90 amends subsection (5) of section 46N by providing for a specific reference to infant and follow-on formula.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> It should be emphasised that an coimisi&uacute;n would already be provided with this authority through the general powers that will be invested in it to make media service codes in respect of advertising.  The language in section 46N(5) is based on the language used in section 42(4) of the extant Broadcasting Act 2009, which provides for the power of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to make broadcasting codes.  As I set out on Committee Stage, those broadcasting codes will remain in force until amended or replaced by media service codes.</p><p>The current broadcasting code relating to commercial communications, the general commercial communications code states &ldquo;Commercial communications for infant formula for use by infants during the first 6 months of life are prohibited.&rdquo;  This reflects EU law which sets out a number of rules regarding how infant and follow-on formula may or may not be advertised or otherwise marketed, and which is primarily enforced in Ireland by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Accordingly, my amendments primarily clarify already inherent powers of an coimisi&uacute;n as regards infant and follow-on formula.  Following an extensive Committee Stage debate in the Seanad and the very good points raised by Senators, I was convinced of the merits of making this power explicit.</p><p>Finally, the issues raised by amendment No. 91 are addressed by the Government's amendments in this grouping.</p></speech>

People from right across Ireland have raised this issue with me.  Senators Sherlock, Pauline O'Reilly and other Senators also have raised this matter with the Minister.  I am grateful for this amendment as it sets the ground for us to move forward.  The amendment is important given the significant public health implications and the poor practices employed when marketing infant milk, follow-on milk and growing-up or toddler milk.  I also welcome that as this matter has been addressed in a couple of sections, it does not relate solely to the media codes but also to the potential for online harm.</p> <p>The Bill, as it stands, ensures provision may be made for prohibition and amendment No. 89 seeks to insert the provision &ldquo;or restrict, in accordance with law&rdquo;.  As the legislation is in itself law, I seek clarity that an coimisi&uacute;n has been provided here with the direct power to prohibit and that a new law will not be required for it to be able to prohibit and restrict, in accordance with law.  I seek clarity because I do not want us to move away from the direct power of prohibition mentioned here.  I acknowledge the coimisi&uacute;n in any case will seek public health advice and so forth in respect of this issue.  I thank the Minister for taking on board the argument that we made and that she shares our intent to ensure this area is properly addressed.  I would not want us to insert inadvertently an additional obstacle and perhaps such concerns can be teased out in the D&aacute;il.  Again, this law can provide for this and the commission will, as is stated in this section, consider general public health interests and consult the Department of Health in that regard.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, I am very passionate about this issue.  A number of years ago, my Green Party colleagues in Galway and I tried to get the local council's budget to set aside funding for advertisements on local radio to promote breastfeeding because in the media, breastfeeding cannot compete with formula milk as the State does not have the funding to allow it compete with companies that make money.</p> <p>I am glad the Minister has taken on board that this is a public health issue in the same way as is the consumption of salt and sugars.  I know from speaking to the departmental officials that they took that on board as well.  This amendment is an important step today.  Nothing will take away the fact that we need to provide support to encourage breastfeeding and that means more lactation consultants, which has been provided for by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  However, the State must provide more support when it comes to organisations such as the La Leche League of Ireland, with which I have been involved for a long time, Cuidi&uacute; and Friends of Breastfeeding.  In particular, I thank the Baby Feeding Law Group Ireland for the tremendous work that it has done on this issue. </p></speech>

Sometimes a stigma is created when anyone seeks to promote  breastfeeding but it is worth remembering that sadly, breastfeeding in this country is very much the underdog, as fewer than 6% of babies are breastfed, compared with an average of 40% in other jurisdictions.  Choice is fundamental but in most countries it is 50:50 for breastfeeding and using formula milk whereas in Ireland over 90% of babies will be fed formula within six months.  That fact is important to remember because sometimes the framing can suggest otherwise.  I thank all of the advocates who have worked on this issue.  They have worked as underdogs in this area and with far less resources than some major commercial actors in the sector.  I also thank the Minister for listening to those voices.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 92 and 107 concern conversion therapy, which is an issue that was raised on Committee Stage.  We have addressed the issue of conversion therapy in two different parts of this Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We cannot be complacent about it.  We have seen aggressive practices in respect of pressure placed on LGBT individuals.  It is an issue I feel strongly about, which is why I was happy to support and co-sponsor legislation brought forward during the term of the previous Oireachtas by Senator Warfield in this regard.  I recall that when I was growing up, if someone was gay, he or she may well have ended up in electroshock therapy, and that was not a million years ago.  It was something experienced by colleagues and friends I knew.  While conversion therapy is not as physical as that, it can be just as cruel, damaging and deeply harmful and corrosive to a person in terms of his or her identify, sense of self and ability to live a proper and confident life.</p><p>Sadly, at a period when there are very aggressive and well-resourced actors that seek to divide and conquer between LGBT groups and others, this is why the online space is so important.  There are international actors that may be very well resourced in advertising and promoting conversion therapy.  I do not have to look solely across to the United States, where we know the damage conversion therapy has done, but also within Europe, where anti-LGBT zones have been declared in certain EU states.  In that context, it is important we be clear that in Ireland, we do not regard this as an acceptable service to be advertised or as communication fit to be promoted.  I have used the phrase "commercial communications" but I believe the formulation I had on Committee Stage was better because this is not solely about commercial content with a goal of selling.  In some cases, we want to ensure these practices cannot be commercially advertised, even if they are not seeking to make money but rather to use commercial systems to promote themselves.</p><p>Amendment No. 107 seeks to address this issue within the online safety codes because these practices are fundamentally unsafe.  It refers to any content that seeks &ldquo;to promote practices or beliefs which seek to compromise or invalidate a person&rsquo;s sexual orientation or gender identity, including the advertisement or promotion of conversion therapy in respect of a person&rsquo;s sexual orientation or gender identity".  I acknowledge this area was examined in the past but I am frustrated because we brought forward legislation during the previous Oireachtas and were assured Government legislation was coming but it has not arrived.  If we do not continue to move forward in Ireland, we will leave this open to those who would seek to move us backwards.  I hope the Minister will consider these amendments.</p></speech>

As Senators will be aware, my colleague the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is leading this initiative.</p> <p>I understand how distressing it can be for LGBTI+ people to encounter advertisements for conversion therapy.  Following the commitment I gave on Committee Stage to considering the matter, my officials have been engaging with officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to ensure that both the practice and the advertisement of conversion therapy will be prohibited when legislation is brought forward.  It is vital any legislation we bring forward be sufficiently robust to achieve its objective and, in particular, that we arrive at a legal definition of conversion therapy that is sufficient to capture the practice we all agree should be banned.  An incomplete or insufficient definition of conversion therapy carries with it two risks.  First, a definition may not be sufficiently expansive to capture completely all the incidences of what is a harmful practice to many people.  Second, it may be drafted such that it may be construed incorrectly and may inadvertently capture, or be claimed or seen to capture, forms of gender-affirming care.  For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendments.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I commit to ensuring the advertisement of conversion therapy will be prohibited when the practice itself is banned to ensure that any prohibitions and bans brought forward will be fully aligned.  I have asked my officials to continue to engage with officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on this matter.</p></speech>

Even so, and perhaps this will be picked up in the D&aacute;il, it is important there be a clear timeline in that regard.  Having brought forward proposals on this a number of years ago, we need to have a clear timeline for this and I welcome the fact the Minister will engage with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, in that regard.  Perhaps by the time this Bill enters its final Stages in the autumn, we will, I hope, see legislation in respect of conversion therapy on the legislative agenda of the Oireachtas, which would be useful and good.</p> <p>I welcome also the fact the Minister has acknowledged there will be specific provisions in respect of her Department.  While we might ban the practice in this State, it is important, given there may be other parts of the EU in which the practice becomes available and is promoted, that we also ban its advertisement in order that persons will not be forced to travel in respect of conversion therapy and that is where the online space and advertising will be important.  I thank the Minister for indicating she will press for such measures to be included in any such legislation.</p></speech>

I had intended to table another amendment in this group, but it was a narrow one put forward in the context of amendment No. 112 and commercial communications.  I had wanted a general provision in respect of commercial communications and young people, which is one I would have pressed further.</p> <p>In effect, these amendments seek to address the targeting of dangerous content at minors.  I am concerned by the gaps in legislation highlighted by very high-profile cases, for example, in the UK and other jurisdictions, where attacks were linked to the targeting of advertisements for knives and other weapons at teenagers.  I am trying to do two things here.  I am trying to ensure the issue of targeting of advertisements for weapons is addressed, especially when such advertising is targeted at young people.  It is not clear whether that will come under harmful content in the current draft of the Bill.  There is also a wider issue I hope might be addressed during the D&aacute;il debate, which is around age-inappropriate content in general.</p> <p>The measures outlined in amendment No. 98 are not exclusionary.  I gave examples of age-inappropriate online content in the amendment that might be included in the Bill, but I do not limit it to that.  Age-inappropriate online content could include online advertisements or commercial communications advertising those same kinds of factors, such as high-salt or high-fat foods or alcohol.  We have the media service codes and online harm codes but I am trying to address the issue of age-inappropriate online content in particular.  The Bill outlines provisions relating to pornography and the "representations of, or of the effects of, gross or gratuitous violence" but, weirdly, advertisements for weapons may not constitute or may not, in fact, show the effects of "gross or gratuitous violence or acts of cruelty", even though they may facilitate such acts.</p> <p>There is the issue of weapons in general but there are also the later mechanisms where there are provisions within online safety.  I pressed some amendments on Committee Stage relating to the provision whereby there may be prohibition of certain kinds of content, so I was not able to re-table them.  Emergency measures can be taken in respect of material that may constitute online harm.  Similar mechanisms, including some of the mechanisms that will be made available to the commission in respect of material that constitutes online harm, may also be usefully made available to the commission in respect of age-inappropriate content, for example, requiring that such content be removed pending a period of investigation.  Those amendments have not followed through but I will signal that as an area where some of the mechanisms around harmful content could be used in respect of age-inappropriate content.  That is possibly a way we could practically strengthen protection of younger people in the Bill.</p> <p>The Minister will also be aware, because I mentioned it on every Stage, of the frustration we have that, in general, we need to look to a prohibition.  She will be aware a prohibition of targeted online advertisements, or commercial communications that are targeted at persons who are minors, where there is, for example, the profiling of minors, was a key debate in the digital services directive discussions.  The Minister's argument is this is a data protection or data processing issue but where that profiling has been attached, or where we have advertisements that are specifically targeted at persons who are minors, we may need to look to a general prohibition.  That does not mean materials cannot be advertised but it means there would not be targeted advertising that seeks out a particular audience that is younger.</p> <p>Amendment No. 122 addresses this issue in the context of commercial communications that seek to promote weapons or the sale of weapons.  A general provision, such as that we already inserted into the Data Protection Act 2018, should be considered.  Amendments to that Act could also be considered.  It is worth flagging because we have had general political agreement on this issue for more than four years but somehow have not moved forward to actually regulate regarding it.</p> <p>I am sorry these amendments are a little tangled.  It is because there is the general issue of how we tackle age-inappropriate content and the specific issue of weapons as something that should be captured by the current language around violence but might not be.  I ask the Minister to address those two strands, whether she can accept these amendments or not. </p></speech>

I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p> <p>Regarding amendment No. 112, I note once again the Bill as initiated provides broad authority to an coimisi&uacute;n to regulate commercial communications through online safety codes.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

Fears remain about social media companies not taking some of the measures within this legislation seriously.  We have a lot to learn from the Australian e-safety commissioner.  We fully expect legislation around the implementation of the EU's Digital Services Act in due course.  If it comes during the time of this Oireachtas we may be revisiting some of these issues.  The key will be the extent to which there is co-operation between the tech companies and the media commission, and the very welcome online safety commissioner.</p></speech>

I also spoke to it when we spoke on the section in the previous debate.  This amendment seeks to ensure that service providers will introduce robust measures to ensure a minimum age verification of account holders of 15 years of age.  We met with various companies during the pre-legislative scrutiny and so on.  The companies have varying minimum age requirements for accounts but in reality, and we all know the facts, there are children as young as ten and 11 years of age who hold social media accounts.  They have gotten around the verification processes the companies have.  We need to bring in robust measures and set a minimum age across all social media companies and hold companies accountable for the verification method they use in order to make sure we do not have young children on social media in this regard.  A significant part of this Bill is about child safety, and the best way of protecting our younger children is to not have them on some of these platforms.  This is an opportunity to make the companies accountable for putting in the robust measures that are needed to make sure children do not get around their various security measures.</p></speech>

My amendment No. 128 seeks to put greater pressure and an onus on the content provider.  I spoke a little bit to this in the previous section.  I was not sure if I had put it in but I realise that I have.</p> <p>This is a really practical proposal.  One of the powers is around the content limitation notice whereby the commission can request that certain content be limited or removed, or that access be disabled.  This is a very important provision with regard to harmful online content.  I urge that my suggestion might be considered in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>There may be materials that do not reach the threshold of being harmful online content but which do reach a threshold of age-inappropriate content.  I have sought to bring in a definition but the Minister may well bring in a better definition or expand her own definition.  There is a mechanism for content limitation that could be used for harmful online content and we propose that a similar mechanism could be available in the case of age-inappropriate content whereby the commission would be able to issue a notice requiring a provider to restrict access to content by persons who have attained the age of 18.  For example, one may say that the material that is very widely available should not be available for persons under the age of 18 because it is age-inappropriate.  Even though the material does not reach the threshold of being harmful online content, the fact is that it would reach the age-inappropriate threshold but perhaps on a site that is very widely accessed and with no suitable constraints as to screening for age.  In a way it is complementary in that sense.  It is not saying it would apply in the context of access to everything online; it would apply for certain content that is age-inappropriate.  The commission would be able to require a provider to put in place measures that would restrict access to that content to persons who are over the age of 18.  This could be done in the same quite fast and effective way as the content limitation notice.  That might be a very good tool.  It does not prohibit the development of codes or practices, or further work with an online service provider.  If, for example, a website contains content that is technically legal and does not reach the online harmful content threshold, but which is bad for 14-year-olds to be looking at, it would allow us to put a requirement on the online provider to put in place some form of measure to discourage availability and access to those under the age of 18.   Persons may well change.  Young people will still probably access it but it would be a harm limitation measure to put in that requirement.  Perhaps the Minister will consider this.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would be a practical measure.</p></speech>

It is an issue that I am particularly aware of, both as a parent of young children and as the chair of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, which recently released a comprehensive report on children's online safety.  In May, the European Commission launched a new European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids.  This strategy is built upon three pillars focused on child protection in the online environment, digital empowerment and active participation.  Under the child protection pillar, there is a strong focus on providing age-appropriate online experiences, including through age verification and age-appropriate design.  In this regard, the commission commits to facilitating a comprehensive code of conduct on age-appropriate design by 2024 using the provisions of the Digital Services Act, which provides that such codes of conduct may be co-regulatory instruments.  The commission has indicated that the code could provide for age verification for accessing certain online content.</p> <p>In order to facilitate age verification, the commission has committed to work with member states and EU standardisation to strengthen effective age-verification methods.  I will be asking an coimisi&uacute;n to look at this issue as a priority, particularly through engaging on the Better Internet for Kids strategy, to identify potential options and solutions to dealing with this complex issue.</p> <p>As regards amendment No. 128, as I said on Committee Stage, the content limitation notice provisions in the Bill apply  to harmful online content and not age-inappropriate online content so as to limit the potential involvement of the an coimisi&uacute;n in matters regarding individual pieces of content to only that content which is expressly deemed harmful under the Bill.  I cannot accept either of the amendments.</p></speech>

It is a massive and complex piece of legislation, and there have been many amendments submitted by Senators.  They have worked very hard.  I hope they can rest and recuperate over the recess.  I also thank the Minister for her consideration of many of the amendments tabled on Committee Stage and her production of amendments that satisfy people's concerns regarding some of the issues raised.</p> <p>I am very pleased that there are Government amendments that extend the language around the public health interest of children into the section of the legislation dealing with the creation of online safety codes.  I am also delighted that an coimisi&uacute;n will be empowered to prohibit or restrict content or advertising relating to food and beverages harmful to children's health.  This is crucial</p> <p>I tabled this amendment as a means of clarifying whether alcohol is included in the Government amendments to this section.  The briefing document provided by the Department refers to "foods or beverages considered to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interest of children".  It seems obvious that a literal interpretation of this language includes alcohol products, the public health risks relating to which are well known if insufficiently understood.  Out of an abundance of caution, however, I just wanted to confirm that this is the case.  If so, I will happily withdraw my amendment.</p></speech>

It is important to point out that amendment No. 105 is particularly strong on that because it states it is a matter of public concern and a public health matter.  I thank the Minister for that.  It is certainly being very well received by advocacy groups.  I know that amendment No. 103 from the Labour Party group was not being moved.  I know the Labour Party group was coming from the best place but I repeat what I said on Committee Stage, which is that formula is not aimed at children, it is aimed at adults and that is why it is important that the Minister has not included it.</p> <p>All the members of the joint committee, including Senators Malcolm Byrne, Carrigy and Cassells, have put a massive amount of work into this Bill.  Not all of us can put in that amount of work because we are members of so many different committees but it is really commendable and show the level of work that is being carried out.  The fact that the Minister has brought forward so many Government amendments and taken on board all of the suggestions is a credit to her, her officials and those who sit on the committee.</p></speech>

I commend the quality of the debate on this issue on Committee Stage and assure Senators that I have given the matter due consideration.  The amendments I have tabled explicitly provide coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n with the power to prohibit or restrict through online safety codes commercial communications relating to foods or beverages considered by the commission to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children, in particular infant formula, follow-on formula or foods or beverages that contain fat, trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars.</p><p>It is important to note that an coimisi&uacute;n would already be provided with the general power under the Bill as initiated to regulate advertising of such matters through online service codes.  This is contained in section 139K(2)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, which states that online safety codes may make provision with a view to ensuring &quot;that service providers take any measures in relation to commercial communications on their services that are appropriate to protect the interests of users of their services, and in particular the interests of children&quot;.</p><p>I also note the amendment No. 105 is based on the language set out in section 46N, subsection (5) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, which relates to media service codes.  This is to ensure that the language used as regards commercial communications is consistent between media service codes and online safety codes.</p><p><b></b>As regards amendment No. 105, it should be recognised that it does not directly prohibit or restrict commercial communications relating to any type of food or beverage.  That will fundamentally be a decision that an coimisi&uacute;n may take through the making of an online safety code following consultation, particularly with the relevant public health bodies, who will be best placed to advice an coimisi&uacute;n on the relevant public health law and advice.  Amendment No. 105 addresses the points raised via amendments Nos. 101 and 103.</p><p>On amendment 104, I would note once again the Bill as initiated provides broad authority to an coimisi&uacute;n to regulate commercial communications through online safety codes.  On Committee Stage, I also noted that the advertisement of alcohol is primarily being addressed through the Public Health (Alcohol) Act, which contains strong measures to limit the exposure of children to advertising.</p><p>Regarding Senator Black's question, amendment No. 105 provides that &quot;an online safety code may prohibit or restrict, in accordance with law, the inclusion in programmes or user-generated content of commercial communications relating to foods or beverages considered by the Commission to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children&quot;.  Alcohol would probably be considered a matter of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children.</p></speech>

I welcome the decision to mirror the provisions of the media service code in the online safety code section.  I hope we will see action to progress this.  None of us can fully set the commission's agenda but I hope it will embrace the powers given to it under this section and that we will see action on online safety codes and these matters as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I am trying to ensure a policy point which had cross-party agreement will progress.  This is an opportunity to do that.  I will ask others to press this issue in the D&aacute;il.

I refer specifically to private messaging and online cloud storage services, which I do not believe constitute audiovisual content as envisaged in the directive.  Those areas more properly belong to the digital services directive.  There has been much discussion and consideration of the digital services directive, which has only now become an EU directive.  The Minister has indicated her expectation that there will be legislation to transpose and give effect to the EU digital services directive in Irish law.  It is premature to include those measures and provisions in this legislation on the audiovisual sector when they will be addressed in the digital services legislation more properly and in a more nuanced way.  This relates to private messages and individual private cloud storage services, such as the storage of individual private videos and photographs.</p> <p>My amendment does not exclude those areas but states, "Services defined under subsection (5) shall not be deemed to be designated online services until such date as set by the Minister following the transposition into Irish law of the European Digital Services Act."  Even though they are both fruit, apples and oranges are slightly different.  The same tools that are appropriate to apply to online content service providers envisaged in this Act are not necessarily the appropriate tools for private messaging between individuals and families or the private storage of photographs, videos and so on.  The Bill has a restriction, stating that some of the powers shall only be exercised where there is potentially a criminal offence.  The fact that there is only one restriction indicates that all the other provisions set out in the Act may well apply to those two forms of online service, which I think are more properly addressed through the EU Digital Services Act.</p> <p>I know the argument has always been that the architecture for the new media commission is likely to be the architecture used to deal with the provisions of the Digital Services Act.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I urge that it not begin to deal with these two areas until Ireland has properly ratified it.  There is a lot of nuance in the Digital Services Act around what is appropriate with regard to backdoor access to information.  There are a lot of specific measures within that Act that I hope will set out useful guides on how cloud storage and personal messaging services might be appropriately regulated.  I urge the Minister to consider this amendment.  It would be a way of putting a brake on the matter, especially since this Bill is likely to overlap with the European Digital Services Act and its transposition into Irish law.  I do not see the harm in delaying the activation of those two areas.  The commission will have more than enough work to do in the other areas of online service that are appropriate.  This is just a case of trying to get ducks in a row.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-11a.600" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071100002#HHH00200"><p>The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and the Digital Services Act, DSA, are complementary pieces of legislation.  One of the key drivers of the Bill is the implementation of the revised audiovisual media services directive, AMSD, into Irish law.  The implementation of the directive in respect of online services, specifically video-sharing platform services, is provided for under the regulatory framework for online safety in this Bill.  In this regard, the AMSD is explicitly recognised by the DSA as a distinct and complementary law to the proposed regulation.  In relation to the regulation of other online services, the Bill provides for a regulatory framework for online safety that is designed to be adaptable and responsive to changes in Irish and EU law.  It is clear that further legislation, in addition to this Bill, will be necessary to ensure appropriate alignment of our regulatory systems with the proposed regulation, for both coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n and other regulators.</p> <p>I note that the European Parliament held its final vote approving the DSA last Tuesday, 5 July.  This paves the way for formal adoption by the Council in September of this year.  Ireland will have until 1 January 2024 to ensure that provisions of the DSA are provided for and supported by Irish law where necessary.  Of course, the obligations on very large online platforms and very large online search engines, which will be regulated by the European Commission, will apply earlier - four months after they have been designated as such by the Commission.  The Government has already decided that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, which is to be established through this Bill, will act as the primary regulator or digital services co-ordinator, DSC, under the DSA.  The Government made this decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and approaches of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n and the DSC, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise for implementation and enforcement.</p> <p>As I said stated on Committee Stage, in establishing an coimisi&uacute;n and setting out a regulatory framework for online safety and a robust and fair enforcement and investigation mechanism, this Bill is establishing the scaffolding and structures to support future and forthcoming legislation, including the Digital Services Act.  In this regard, the Bill will assist in the implementation of the regulation and not hinder it.  Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.  Having listened to the Senator's contribution, it may be worth pointing out that private messaging services are not covered by the DSA.</p></speech>

At one point it was envisaged that the Digital Services Act would deal with such services.  If it does not, I worry that we will end up leading the way if we are in a position where interpersonal messaging services are regulated under this Act without clear EU guidance.  I would be all the more intent on pressing this amendment in that context.  I appreciate the engagement from the Minister.  There is an intersection between these areas but I am concerned that there is a reach beyond the envisaged provisions of the audiovisual directive.  In that context, I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

The purpose of this amendment is to provide that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n may fund, through a content production scheme made under section 159F of the Broadcasting Act as amended by the Bill, new audiovisual programmes relating to biodiversity.  Following the Seanad debate and the points raised by Senators, I thought there was merit in clarifying that it is intended that programmes related to biodiversity may funded through a scheme.</p> <p>The purpose of No. 131 is to change the reference in this provision from &ldquo;human rights, including equality, diversity and inclusion&rdquo; to &ldquo;human rights, equality, diversity and inclusion&rdquo;.  This is to address the point raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane during Seanad Committee Stage regarding consistency with other legislation which tends to refer to these human rights, equality, diversity and inclusion as distinctive concepts rather than treating them as a subset of human rights.</p> <p>On amendment No. 132, I noted during Committee Stage that I believe the general references to science and education in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 159F of the Broadcasting Act as amended by the Bill would already allow such programmes relating to digital empowerment and data protection awareness to be funded.  I have not changed my position and will not accept the amendment.</p> <p>Amendment No. 133 provides that a content production scheme may be co-managed or delegated to another agency, and specifically references Screen Ireland in this regard.  Given their complementary functions, I expect that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n and Screen Ireland will work closely together, in terms of both policy frameworks such as the audiovisual action plan and in terms of sharing information and knowledge regarding the operation of support schemes.  However, I do not propose to accept this amendment as coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will include a media development commissioner whose remit will include the administration of any content production scheme.</p> <p>I welcome the intention of amendment No. 134, which would provide that an coimisi&uacute;n shall have regard for the need to ensure that people with disabilities can participate in new audiovisual programmes funded by content production scheme.  During Committee Stage I noted that I would be worried about specifying that any one group may imply that it should be prioritised for participation in a manner that implied other groups may not be.  That is why I proposed amendment No. 11, which requires coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to bear in mind the participation and representation of the people of the island of Ireland in relation to its policies towards broadcasting and on-demand media services.  This amendment is intended to include people with disabilities and ensure their further and adequate participation and representation.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 134.</p> <p>On Committee Stage, I indicated that I would give further consideration to amendment No. 135 in the context of Report Stage.  I recognise the intention and would note that the Irish language element of the amendment may be adequately covered by the requirement that 25% of the annual funds of a content production scheme should be allocated to programmes in the Irish language.</p> <p>I recognise the importance of both adequate access rules and participation and representation in programmes for users of the Irish Sign Language.  On access rules, section 46O of the Broadcasting Act as amended provides for an coimisi&uacute;n to make media service rules requiring media service providers to make their services accessible, including provision of a sign language service.</p> <p>I also expect that amendment No. 11 will require an coimisi&uacute;n to consider the participation and representation of users of Irish Sign Language as regards its policies.  Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.</p></speech>

It was thoughtful and constructive.  We have met for many, many hours in addition to the many, many hours of debate in the Chamber.  I believe the Bill has been strengthened by that.  I want to acknowledge the Minister's willingness.  It is something that other Ministers could benefit from and learn from.  You can engage and strengthen legislation.  There were good ideas across the Chamber from Government Senators, who put forward constructive proposals, and from ourselves.  I thank the Minister for approaching the Seanad debate with interest and engagement and in a sincere spirit of dialogue.  That has been really positive so I thank her and her officials.</p> <p>In that spirit, I welcome the reference to biodiversity.  Its inclusion is important.  I hate to say that I think there is a very poor definition of environmental development and sustainability in the Higher Education Authority Bill which moves us backwards but at least this Bill has definitions and measures that will move us forward.</p> <p>While digital empowerment and data protection awareness that I sought is there, the media literacy component which was introduced earlier addresses many of my concerns on that, so I will not press that amendment.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for taking on board my points, which were technical but important, on human rights and equality rather than human rights, including equality.</p> <p>On participation, while I would like to have it included here, I recognise that in the higher level functions of the commission and in the service of all the people of the island that a value has been placed on participation and it has been named in the Bill.  That is important and I hope that it will have a cascade effect throughout.</p> <p>While there are strong measures for the Irish language, Irish Sign Language is still somewhat forgotten.  It would be really positive were the works fund to support innovative and exciting programming to come through.  I am thinking of the kinds of amazing programming that has become possible in the Irish language, which has been dubbed and subtitled around the world, because they are world-class productions.  I would love to see that happen in Irish Sign Language too.  I will probably press that amendment.</p> <p>Finally, there was one area in which we were not able to bring forward amendments.  We have spoken about the works scheme.  We have seen the excitement and good ideas from across the House in terms of the European works scheme.  This is the kind of important, interesting, empowering, exciting and imaginative content that we all hope will emerge from this kind of scheme.  One area where we have been unable to bring amendments, although there will be capacity to do so in the D&aacute;il, is in regard to the levy and ensuring that such a levy is strong.  The works scheme is what happens with the moneys gathered from the levy.  The measure I think is important is creating the power to place a levy on what can be very large companies and using it.  I hope that the commission not only may but shall place a levy and ensure it is routed into the kinds of exciting European works scheme made possible.</p></speech>

It will have a significant impact on various parts of our society and will protect our children.  I speak as a parent of three children under ten years old.  That is all ahead of me.  It is important that we put in stringent regulations.  That is why the whole issue of verification is important.  I thank the Minister for coming to the Seanad, starting this legislation here and giving her time and the time of her officials to this debate.  As Senator Malcolm Byrne said, we have spent 30 hours on the Bill between all of the Stages and the Minister has been here herself for every session bar one.</p></speech>

That does not happen with all legislation.  I thank the Minister for that.</p></speech>

It is very important legislation.  I also thank Deputy Niamh Smyth, chairperson of the committee.  I forget the number of organisations we met within the course of pre-legislative scrutiny.  The committee, with the full support of Deputy Niamh Smyth, felt that every organisation that wanted to meet with it should have the opportunity to do so.  That allowed us to inform our views and the recommendations we put forward.  More than 90% of what we proposed is encompassed in the legislation.  It will do a lot of good.  I thank the Minister again.</p></speech>

This legislation is of such significance that it was worth every moment of the 30 hours we have spent discussing it.  I thank the Oireachtas committee for its extensive pre-legislative scrutiny.  This time last year it was seeking an extension to allow it more time, which I was happy to agree to because the legislation is so significant.  Senator Carrigy has reminded me that I had a family bereavement during this process.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, for stepping in for me that day.  I thank all of the Senators here for what was a very constructive and respectful debate throughout.  I thank them for that engagement.  I also thank my officials, who must be exhausted.  There was a lot of engagement with Senators outside of the Seanad and I thank the officials for doing that on my behalf.  Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leo.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that those in the Bills Office, who have had to deal with a great volume of amendments to many various Bills over the last two weeks, particularly amendments to this Bill, are due a great deal of credit.  They stay up very late some nights to deal with all of the amendments that come through.  I thank everybody for all of that.</p></speech>
