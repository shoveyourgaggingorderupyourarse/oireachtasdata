Senator Craughwell has the floor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-06-29a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016062900002#A00600"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to come to the House to deal with this important matter for a second time.  He will recall that on 27 January we both participated in a Commencement debate concerning a case of a former Permanent Defence Forces officer, a lieutenant colonel with a distinguished service record, and the recommendations of the Defence Forces Ombudsman.  The submission was in the form of an appeal for redress of wrongs made under section 114 of the Defence Act 1954, on foot of the considered findings of the Chief of Staff that the complainant had not been wronged in the view of the Defence Forces.  The complaint, as the Minister of State will know, was referred to the ombudsman and was upheld.  The Minister of State will also recall that in his final report, the ombudsman concluded that the promotion competition process was administered in a procedurally unfair manner as, in his view, there was ambiguity in relation to the provisions regarding length of service marks.  In addition to his findings, the ombudsman made a range of recommendations arising from this case.  Last January, the Minister of State told me the following:</p><blockquote>The recommendations of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces are under active consideration.  I am advised that the matter may require obtaining advices from the Office of the Attorney General before any decision on the matter can be made and the issue of such advice is also under active consideration.</blockquote> <p>As a former member of the PDF myself, I was not going to allow this exemplary officer's case to lie forgotten on some dusty shelf in the Department and as such I have maintained contact with the officer in question.  </p><p>It is my understanding that the former senior Minister issued an instruction to Department officials to implement the ombudsman's recommendations on the matters we are referring to today.  I was delighted to get this information and immediately passed it to the officer concerned.  However, he informed me that he had not been contacted by the Department and feared nothing would happen.  I contacted the Department and spoke to a principal officer.  I asked him why the Minister's instruction had not been carried out and I was shocked by his answer.  I was told that it was felt within the Department that the Minister was wrong and that the case was referred to the Attorney General for advice.  I asked when it had been referred was told it had been referred a week or so earlier.  As this was several months since the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, and I had spoken in this House I decided to submit some freedom of information requests.  Is it the case that officials in the Department are second guessing ministerial instructions? </p><p>I submitted seven FOI requests.  I sought the date of the final report supplied by the ombudsman and was told it was 30 June 2015 so my request was granted.  I asked for the date that the report of the ombudsman was brought to the attention of the Secretary General of the Department.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I was told it was brought to the attention of the Assistant Secretary on 30 June 2015 but they could not tell me when the Secretary General, the most senior civil servant in the Department, received the report.  I asked when the Minister of State and his predecessor received the report and I was told they could not have it because it was a matter under active consideration.  I asked for any internal correspondence and I was told I could not have it because it was a matter of internal consideration.  I asked for correspondence between the Minister of State and the former Minister and I was told I could not have it because it was a matter of ongoing discussion.  I asked when the final decision with respect to referring the case for advice to the Attorney General was made and I was told I could not be told when it was referred because the matter was ongoing.  I asked when the final report of the Defence Forces Ombudsman on redress of wrongs in respect of the officer in question was sent to the Attorney General and, again, I was told I could not be told because the matter was ongoing.</p><p>I then found out that the Department has seconded to it a full-time member of the Attorney General's staff.  The Minister of State is a reasonable man but this looks like the Department is deliberately frustrating a favourable outcome for a complainant through an ombudsman's decision.  I have never heard of such a decision being challenged and I do not know what is going on in the Department.  I have made a number of freedom of information applications regarding cases sent to the ombudsman over the past number of years.  I would like to get to the bottom of what is going on in the Department.  The Minister of State came to the House in good faith last January.  I believe him to be an honest, decent man and he outlined in reply to me what he thought was the clear state of affairs.  It seems to be anything but clear and somebody somewhere is frustrating this.  I am sorry to drag him back to the House this morning but I look forward to his reply.</p></speech>

He is correct that I replied to a similar Commencement matter in January.  This case involves the submission by a former officer of the Permanent Defence Forces to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  The submission was in the form of an appeal from redress of wrongs made under section 114 of the Defence Act 1954 on foot of the considered findings of the Chief of Staff that the complainant had not been wronged in the view of the Defence Forces.  The complainant alleges that he was wronged by an administrative error in a promotion competition held in 2012 and, as a consequence, he was not promoted to the next higher rank with consequential implications relating to retirement on age grounds, gratuity and pension entitlement.</p> <p>In his final report, the ombudsman concluded that the promotion competition process was administered in a procedurally unfair manner as, in his view, there was ambiguity in respect of the provisions regarding length of service marks.  In addition to his findings, the ombudsman made a range of recommendations arising from the case, some of which may have wider implications for the defence organisation.  While, under statute, I am not bound to accept the ombudsman's findings, I am keen to ensure a conclusion to this matter is reached shortly.  Given the complexities involved, it is right and proper that the Department fully deliberates on the potential implications of the findings.</p> <p>As acknowledged to the Senator earlier this year, the Department has sought and has now received legal advice on the matter.  I am aware that the Senator has been in discussions with my officials and has been advised that the matter is under active review.  I am sure he will appreciate that given the complexities of this case, the Department must exercise due diligence in its approach.  However, I acknowledge his concern that this matter be resolved as soon as possible and I will bear this in mind when I receive the Department&rsquo;s report.  In light of this, the House will appreciate it would be not appropriate for me to comment further on this case at this point in time.</p></speech>

At the end of the day, it is outrageous to think the Secretary General of the Department, from what I can gather, has not seen the ombudsman's report.  It is even more outrageous that a junior official would take it upon himself to countermand a decision by a Minister, albeit that it was verbal, to decide to send the case to the Attorney General.  Why send it to the Attorney General's office when one of her staff members is on site?  What is going on?  I acknowledge the Minister of State cannot watch everything that is going on all day, every day but this is an affront to the governance of the Department itself and to the political system that manages the Department.  I feel strongly that I must get an answer to this case within a set timeframe.  If the Minister of State has the legal advice, I am sure his officials can advise him immediately.  I would like him to outline a timeframe in order that I can give this man some peace of mind or are we to wait until he dies before we sort it?</p></speech>

The gentleman in question has written to the Taoiseach who has given me the correspondence.  He also wrote to the other Members of the Oireachtas, in particular two Members of the Lower House, and they have also been in contact with my office.  I understand the gentleman has distinguished service in the Defence Forces and I respect him for that, as I do every member of the Defence Forces.  This case is being dealt with at a senior level within my Department and it will not go unnoticed.  As soon as I have received the full report and the legal advice, I will make a decision on it and I will bring the case to a conclusion as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I congratulate her on her appointment, about which I was delighted.  I wish her the best with it and I look forward to working with her in this House in her new role.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> This question concerns a matter which I know has been the subject of ongoing communications with the Minister's predecessor and with herself.  It is the need for her to inform the House when she proposes to implement the recommendation of the Copyright Review Committee in its report Modernising Copyright, published in October 2013, concerning the extension of the small claims procedure in the District Court to include intellectual property claims up to the value of &euro;15,000 as provided for in the draft statutory instrument prepared by the committee.  This matter concerns the ability to enforce intellectual property rights before the courts in Ireland and, in particular, the ability for companies to represent themselves before the courts in lower value intellectual property claims. </p><p>As stated, this matter has been the subject of correspondence with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Bruton, as well as the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald.  I know colleagues, including Senator Kevin Humphreys, then a Deputy, as well as Deputies Simon Harris and Eoghan Murphy, corresponded with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, last year in respect of the matter.  I have seen a response dated 1 June this year from the Minister's private secretary on the matter.  While she recognises there is a wider issue concerning access to justice which falls within the policy responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality, she states that nonetheless this also impacts on the area of intellectual property for which she has policy responsibility.  I was delighted to see in the correspondence from her private secretary to this particular individual, who has raised the matter with me also, that officials from her Department are actively examining options to improve access to justice.</p><p>This raises a number of different issues and the individual who has brought the matter to my attention as well as the current and former Ministers' attention has a meritorious point.  He points out that the Government encourages the creative industries to produce in Ireland and offers many incentives to boost the number of jobs in the economy but still has not implemented a clear recommendation from the Copyright Review Committee of 2013 concerning the need to improve access to a mechanism for enforcing intellectual property claims.  </p><p>The October 2013 report of the Copyright Review Committee, Modernising Copyright, makes a clear reference to the reforms in England which established the special jurisdiction of patents county courts, now renamed the intellectual property enterprise courts.  In Britain, these procedures have been streamlined to save parties time and money.  The report went on to recommend that the small claims procedure in the District Court be extended to include intellectual property claims up to the value of the standard limit of the District Court jurisdiction.  The committee proposed certain amendments to existing legislation as well as a draft statutory instrument to bring such claims within the remit of the small claims procedure.  The recommendation seems a sensible one which would improve on the current difficulties with access to the courts in respect of this sort of claim.</p><p>In terms of our obligations under EU law, it also appears that the current regime whereby companies must be legally represented must be complemented by some mechanism to improve access to the courts, particularly in respect of small intellectual property claims.  The sort of reform proposed by the Copyright Review Committee offers us a way forward.  It is a solution that would offer easier access and an easier method of resolution to companies and individuals with intellectual property claims.  It would also enable us better to ensure compliance with EU law.  </p><p>I look forward to the Minister's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-06-29a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016062900002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Bacik for her warm welcome.  I am delighted to see her, as an elected Senator, here too.  I am also delighted to see Senator Victor Boyhan, my constituency colleague from D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Senator Bacik has raised an important matter.  An independent Copyright Review Committee was established in May 2011 with the objective of examining copyright in the Irish context.  This included considering the need to review and modernise existing legislation.  The committee held a consultation to help gauge stakeholder opinion and this led to a series of recommendations by the committee.  The committee then held a second consultation on those ideas.  Its report entitled Modernising Copyright was published in October 2013 and contains in excess of 60 recommendations.</p> <p>My Department has conducted extensive analysis of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  This includes an assessment of the complex legal issues involved.  Advice was obtained from the Office of the Attorney General, and relevant Departments were consulted to develop proposals.  One recommendation relates to improved access to justice before the courts, a point raised by the Senator.  This included extending the small claims procedure to intellectual property claims.  The small claims procedure operates in the District Court and currently excludes intellectual property claims.  My officials examined this recommendation with the Department of justice, which has policy responsibility for the Courts Service.  Meanwhile, I have policy responsibility for intellectual property issues.  We looked at enforcement of lower value intellectual property claims and together we examined the potential for improvements in this area.</p> <p>The issue of access to justice is important and I am anxious that rights holders can enforce their intellectual property rights.  We conducted an analysis of the recommendations in the report.  This included any constraints imposed by EU law and involved considering potential impacts on all Irish stakeholders.  It also involved considering costs and benefits for Government.  My Department is currently finalising legislative proposals for Government consideration and I expect to bring these proposals to Government before the summer recess.  Meanwhile, the EU Commission has continued its work on copyright.  A number of consultations have been undertaken by the Commission which are used to gauge stakeholder views on copyright modernisation.</p> <p>Copyright is a priority also in the digital single market strategy.  We have already agreed a proposal on portability of content which allows EU consumers to access subscription services while travelling.  We expect the Commission to make further proposals in September.  Ireland supports greater harmonisation of copyright at EU level.  Proposals creating opportunities for education and research are particularly welcomed.  We support access to copyrighted material for people with disabilities.  Overall, we want to ensure balanced solutions for all stakeholders.  I look forward to the Senator&rsquo;s support for my Bill.</p></speech>

I am particularly grateful to her for stating her own anxiety that rights holders will be able to enforce their intellectual property rights.  As I have indicated, the current legal position amounts to a serious obstacle to the enforcement of intellectual property rights, particularly for small companies and independent individuals.  This is the difficulty the copyright review committee has so clearly addressed in its recommendation.   I am also grateful to the Minister for her statement that the Department is finalising legislative proposals for Government consideration based on the 2013 report and that she expects to bring the proposals to Government before the summer recess.  I will be happy to support those proposals if they address the issue I have raised.</p> <p>By way of follow-up, will the Minister state at this point whether the proposals will include implementation of the recommendation that I have focused on, namely, the reform of the small claims procedure to cover intellectual property claims?  Will the Minister state whether that particular recommendation will be addressed in the proposed legislation?  I welcome the announcement that we will, hopefully, see this legislation, at least in draft form, before the summer recess.  I would be grateful for a response on that specific point.</p></speech>

The Health Service Executive, HSE, started an audit last April and the findings of this audit are now with the senior management of the HSE.</p><p>Console is a well-known national charity founded in 2002.  It helps people who are distressed and have suicidal thoughts.  It has offices throughout the country and its patron is our President, Michael D. Higgins.  This charity recently expanded to the United Kingdom and it has been endorsed by many celebrities in the UK.  It provides a 24-hour help line that anyone can call if they or members of their family are distressed.  It receives approximately 3,400 calls per month.</p><p>People who watched the programme last night were shocked and appalled at the misappropriation of funds.  Console has received at least &euro;2.5 million from the HSE in the past five years alone for providing suicide prevention services.  Its last filed accounts show that Console received grants of &euro;817,000.  The grants included &euro;783,000 from the HSE and &euro;31,000 from Tusla.  It also received a further &euro;3,500 from the national lottery, &euro;521,000 from fundraising and &euro;551,000 from donations.  In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has allocated &euro;130,000 to Console to allow it support Irish immigrants in the UK.</p><p>Console depends on the goodwill of thousands of people who do charity walks, runs and cycles around the country.  I read in <i>The Irish Times</i>that the founder of the suicide prevention charity Console and his wife and son ran up credit card bills of almost &euro;500,000 on items such as groceries, designer clothes and foreign trips over a period of three years, according to the HSE audit.  The audit also established that the family benefited by almost &euro;500,000 in salaries and cars from the period between 2012 to 2014.  Among the items the credit cards were used for were large unvouched withdrawals of cash from ATMs, trips to Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and other destinations, designer clothing from outlets such as Ralph Lauren and Hugo Boss, dining out, Rugby World Cup tickets and dental work.</p><p>&quot;Prime Time&quot; alleged that the Console chief executive officer had received director's payments totalling &euro;215,000 between 2010 and 2012, which allegedly is in breach of company law and Revenue regulations.  These allegations raise serious questions with regard to charities and how State and privately raised funds are used and abused for people's personal gain.</p><p>I ask the Leader to request the Minister to address the House on the role of the Charities Regulator in this matter and any other matters the HSE or the Charities Regulator is investigating.  It is not acceptable that State funds are used in the manner alleged.  It is particularly disturbing in light of the recent U-turn on mental health funding and the rise in mental health issues and suicide in our society.  With so many people on waiting lists for therapies, this wanton waste makes me sick to the core when others are left anxiously waiting for appointment times.</p><p>My heart goes out to the many staff employed by Console who are 100% dedicated to their jobs.  This incident is another blow to the charities sector when the majority of people working in the sector are hard-working, honest individuals living on modest incomes.</p><p>I would like to know the action the Minister is taking to ensure that other charities are being monitored and audited to prevent such abuse of State funding and people's donations being spent on director's payments, luxury cars and luxury travel.  In particular, I would like to know the number of investigations the Charities Regular is involved in currently and whether other charities that have been audited are being investigated.  Can the Minister confirm to the House that the Charities Regulator will use all the powers it has under the Act to take over Console to ensure that the vital services it provides can be continued and extended?</p></speech>

I hear people talking about how they got it wrong.  We are democrats in this House and I ask the Leader, as a democrat, to acknowledge the fact that 72% of the electorate of the UK turned out, and 52% of those voted to leave the European Union.  Whether we like that or not it is wrong that we would in any way condemn the electorate of the UK for deciding to exit the European Union.  I accept it has left many problems and I was delighted to hear on "Morning Ireland" earlier that Sinn F&eacute;in has parked its suggestion that there be some sort of Border vote.  It is not the time to start rattling cages that do not need to be rattled just yet but we do need to look to the UK and to our brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland and respect their decision.</p></speech>

It is essential that if parties are serious about reform, they at least agree to allow time to discuss one of the first motions laid before the current Seanad.</p> <p>I raise the issue of spending by the suicide charity, Console.  I am aware that an administrator has been appointed and it is important to stress that services offered by the charity continue.</p> <p>Following the charities sector wage scandals, arguments were put forward for the 2009 Charities Act to be implemented, with full accountability in terms of the salaries of senior employees.  The Government dragged its feet on this issue to the degree that Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a Private Members' Bill to move on the Act.  Eventually, aided by the huge public demand for full financial accountability, the Charities Regulatory Authority was established in 2014 aiming to regulate charities to ensure their effectiveness, accountability and transparency to their donor and beneficiary communities.</p> <p>Despite the controversies faced by charities in recent times, it is essential that the HSE continues to reassure those who use their services or who may need them that there is no break in support.  I commend all the workers in the many charities who do wonderful work across this country.</p> <p>There were many contributions to the debate on mental health in the House and much stress was placed on the role charities and voluntary organisations play in aiding those worst affected.  It is a hugely important issue for the House and action should be taken immediately on it to ensure we do not see the contagion effect on other charities as well as Console.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I want to raise one other point briefly on the issue of Brexit, which is what we can do in Ireland.

While they may only be small English pensions, the Irish contributory pension that they receive is paid on a <i>pro rata</i>basis, and it is very important that the Department of Social Protection immediately take cognisance of the fluctuations in sterling and increase the payments here in line with the decreases in sterling.

I share the condolences expressed by Senator Conway-Walsh.  I visited Turkey on a number of occasions in recent years, once in an official capacity, and I was really struck by the warmth and hospitality of the Turkish people.  Notwithstanding the fact that I am personally quite disturbed about the moves in Turkey towards a more autocratic style of government, our affection for the people of Turkey should remain.  Our sense of anger at the horrendous attack in Istanbul airport yesterday is shared by everybody.  We should all express our sympathy to the people of Turkey and the Turkish Government on the horrendous loss of life in Atat&uuml;rk airport.</p> <p>With regard to the situation at Console, I believe the comments made in the House by a number of speakers reflect the real public anger at the way in which certain directors of Console appear to have used the organisation as their own personal ATM in recent years.  Over a period of time, lavish spending was clocked up on the charity's multiple credit cards, including on clothes, dental work and cash withdrawals.  What we know now about how Console was run makes it very hard to comprehend where Console starts and where the interests of a number of directors ends.  A charity should not be made or operated in the image of its founder or of any one person.  If anything, it should be held up to an extremely high standard of corporate governance and ethical codes.</p> <p>The scandal is a major test for the relatively newly founded Charities Regulatory Authority.  A number of very important questions must be answered by the charities regulator, by the Government and by other agencies in an effort to restore trust in what is a very important organisation.  In the first instance, there needs to be an unambiguous statement from the charity itself that its founding director is not still in charge, as there appears to ambiguity around that.  The charities regulator must make it very clear how and when it is going to deploy a number of independent trustees to ensure there is robust governance in the organisation and that the organisation restore the public trust, which has been so badly damaged.</p> <p>I also wish to establish whether the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, will investigate the alleged conduct of the directors concerned, which has been revealed in media reports in recent days.  I agree that there has been a huge amount of public investment in Console.  It was not only a matter of public financial resources; people trust the organisation and people trust the staff in Console.  I would argue that there are a considerable number of people in this country who owe their lives to the services delivered to them by the organisation.  In the efforts to establish the facts around this case and our efforts to re-establish trust in the organisation, which must happen, we should not in any sense blame the staff.  Trust has to be restored, and it is the job of Government, the organisation itself and the relevant regulator to do that.</p></speech>

Yesterday was actually a good day for transparency in public life in Ireland because, as a result of the Lobbying Act introduced by the Labour Party in the last Government, the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPOC, published its first report concerning the behaviour of registered lobbyists in the State.  The report found that 2,500 returns were made by 1,000 registered lobbyists.  There is still more to be done around this issue and we would like to see SIPOC given more teeth to investigate breaches of the Act and to ensure there is more compliance than seems to be the case at the moment.  I do not believe that anybody in all seriousness would accept that there should only be 2,500 returns on 1,000 registered lobbyists in the State.

The PSO is a Government levy on all customers, both domestic and industrial.  It has been increased substantially over the years and it is used to subsidise renewable energy generation.  The proposed increase of 36% comes into effect in October.  I have been contacted by a number of companies that would be greatly affected by this increase.  In one case, a company whose bills during 2015 and 2016 were &euro;5,500 per month, or &euro;66,000 per annum, will face bills of &euro;7,500 per month, or &euro;90,000 per annum, if this goes ahead.</p> <p>We all know the importance of small businesses, job security and job creation, but this increase would negatively affect that.  I know some decreases in electricity prices have been implemented by energy companies in recent times, but this would wipe all of that out.  I ask that the Minister with responsibility for this area - the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Naughten - be invited to the House to explain the justification for this increase and the effect it would have on jobs and particularly for small businesses.</p></speech>

It is a worrying development, and I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House to address it.  The last thing we want is a threat from the GRA of industrial action.

Seanad &Eacute;ireann should again send our concerns on this issue to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, who I know is doing everything he can to expedite a resolution of this situation.</p> <p>Like everybody else, I was quite shocked at the contents of the "Prime Time" programme last night with regard to Console.  It is a pity because, as Senator Nash and others have said, Console has done some remarkably good work, but unfortunately the good work is negated by the fact of these scandalous revelations.  Unfortunately, they are not the only scandalous revelations about charities that we have seen in recent times.  There is a simple solution to this.  The Minister for Justice and Equality could commence section 4 of the Charities Act.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Section 4 of the Charities Act, if commenced, would give the regulator considerable powers to send an investigator into this charity and to demand to see all the books and accounts and speak to all the personnel, including the auditors and everybody else, who have had a hand, act or part in this scandalous abuse of not just taxpayer's funds but funds from people who have worked hard to raise money for the charity.  The Minister for Justice and Equality should immediately commence section 4 of the 2009 Charities Act without delay.</p><p>The HSE has a serious role to play in this matter.  Earlier I heard Deputy Sean Fleming speak on radio.  He is correct that the HSE should go to the High Court today to get an order to seize everything to do with the administration of Console.  The HSE should also send in people to run Console.  This is what the public demands and it should happen.  The HSE has an absolute responsibility to deal with this situation today.</p></speech>

Yesterday we discussed the matter on the Order of Business and we had somewhat of a reply.  On that occasion, a number of Senators expressed their concern.</p> <p>Today I raise one simple issue, namely, the European Commission and the Water Framework Directive.  This week the European Commission said that Ireland cannot abolish water charges without breaching the EU Water Framework Directive.  EU Commissioner, Karmenu Vella, has said the flexibility offered to Ireland ended in 2010 when the then Government pledged to introduce water charges.  He also said that derogation from water charges could have been sought in 2010 but it was not.  No one did so and the opportunity has now been missed.  Subsequently, the Government applied water charges.  The Commission said that it does not consider that Ireland can now revert on the water charges.  Commissioner Vella's comments are significant, particularly in the recent days and given the debate on water charges in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government plans to travel to Brussels next week to meet Commissioner Vella.  Will the Leader invite the Minister to the Seanad when he returns to explain what is the correct situation?  Is it correct that Ireland may be subject to fines for breaches of the Water Framework Directive?</p></speech>

Last week we had a very good debate on mental health but I wish to raise the issue of unit 5B in University Hospital Limerick, from which five people were missing for a number of days, and security on the hospital campus.  People were in the hospital for a particular reason and were receiving a lot of valid help.  The fact they were able to walk out of the hospital and remain undetected is frightening.  One lady was missing for an entire weekend.</p> <p>I welcome the fact the number of rheumatology clinics in the hospital has more than halved.  However, pain relief clinics have been cancelled each week for the past number of weeks.  Will the Leader take up the matter with the Minister for Health?</p> <p>A Garda-led programme called Operation Prowl was rolled out on the streets of Limerick over the past three or four years, ensuring that garda&iacute; were visibly seen during the working day while businesses were open, especially on the main streets.  The programme helped to reduce the number of robberies in shops.  Unfortunately, the Garda has announced the programme has ceased.  The business community is very put out by the news because the number of thefts had reduced.</p></speech>

I recall still being in the closet when I marched with Sinn F&eacute;in friends and comrades who, without direct knowledge and alongside all of the participants in Dublin Pride, facilitated my being there and provided a safety net.  We understand acutely what it means not to be in a position to celebrate and protest at Dublin Pride.</p> <p>Yesterday Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen referred to the national broadcaster in this Chamber.

The news from Florida struck the Irish community to its very core and Dublin Pride reflected that sombre mood.  Many beautiful and moving reminders of those no longer with us were visible along the route taken by the parade.  One older couple displayed a rainbow flag that had the words "Keep partying Yvonne.

The UK is our single biggest trading partner and Irish agribusiness will, undoubtedly, be the most exposed.  Ireland exported &euro;5.1 billion in farm produce to Britain in 2015.  A recent Teagasc survey has suggested that it could drop by up to 8% or &euro;800 million per year.  </p> <p>There are major issues in this regard.  The collapse in the value of sterling makes Irish exports expensive and will have an immediate negative impact on agriculture.  Some 41% of all Irish food and drink exports go to the EU.  The impact of the pound falling to an all-time low will see lower prices for Irish farmers in the coming months.</p> <p>I am concerned about the possibility of trade barriers and tariffs.  They are real possibilities for the UK and Northern Ireland.  There is extreme uncertainty.  Quite a number of farmers have contacted me over the past number of days and they have genuine and sincere concerns in this regard.</p> <p>In 2014 the UK's contribution to the Common Agricultural Policy budget was &euro;1.27 billion.  As we know, CAP payments sustain many Irish farm families.  Similarly, we are concerned that EU farm payments, which are so essential for Irish farmers, could be severely hit.</p> <p>The exit will take a number of years to negotiate.  We are very concerned about the terms of the negotiations, particularly the impact an exit will have on Ireland.  I welcome the contribution made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade yesterday in terms of trying to use all of the resources available to meet those challenges.  Will the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine address the Seanad?  Agribusiness is a key sector of the Irish economy.  Therefore, it is important that we understand what short-term and long-term implications there be and what measures will be put in place to help us get through this process.</p></speech>

Much has been said about Console and I do not want to say anything that is unhelpful.  People are quick to point to other people's behaviour.  It is clear that wrong has been done in this instance and that there have been clear governance failures.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->At a macro level, our Oireachtas has to look at how difficult it was for us to get the Charities Act in place and to resource the regulator's office.  We need to think about those things also.  </p><p>I will make one other brief observation on this issue, which is that we use the word "charity," and it is also used in the legislation.  It is in the name of the Act.  However, this is about public and community benefit.  It is important to remember that it is not just charity in the sense of giving away money or something else.  It is about being in concert with the State in the provision of public benefit and services.</p><p>On Brexit, all of us are quick to say how others should have behaved and acted and what decisions they should have made.  However, there is not one of us in this Chamber, in our business life or in our work in the Oireachtas who has not turned around and said, "Perhaps I should have made a different decision; perhaps I should have measured twice before cutting the plank of timber."  That is an important approach to bring to the issue.  From my own work in Europe on disability and social inclusion and the different organisations in which I am involved, my reflection on it is that the European Union is a difficult entity to love sometimes.  It makes it difficult for us all to love it.  However, we should still remember that it is a precious entity in a world that badly needs it.  That should be our instinct.</p><p>I am coming to the end.  The situation in Istanbul hardly needs commenting on.  People have already mentioned it.  However, I wish to make one observation and draw an Irish connection.  This concerns the man who threw himself down to save others.  I am reminded of an incident that took place 100 years ago, perhaps to this day, when a man named Billy McFadzean saved his comrades in the trenches in the Somme.  He was a member of the 36th Ulster Division.  There are great people.  We should always remember that.</p></speech>

It is years old and not fit for purpose.  It militates, in particular, against those on low incomes or whose personal finances are stretched.  People who are renewing their motor tax and wish to pay by instalments, which people who are on a tight budget often wish to do, end up paying more over the course of the year than they would if they paid in one lump sum.  I was speaking to a person who had the option of paying their motor tax on a three-monthly, a six-monthly or a 12-monthly basis.  They pay it on a three-monthly basis and, therefore, end up paying &euro;170 more.  It is obvious that, unless someone is leaving the country or not using the vehicle anymore, in most cases people are paying it in instalments due to the financial pressures they are under.</p> <p>Another motor tax issue that was brought to my attention concerns a vehicle that has been put off the road.  There was a big problem with petrol stretching in my constituency of County Mayo and many vehicles were destroyed.  The owners could not get a refund of motor tax, even if their vehicles were off the road, unless there were at least three months left to run on the motor tax.  This hits people who can ill afford to be hit in this way.  </p> <p>There is a big disparity in the amount of motor tax paid on vehicles registered after July 2008 and those registered before that, even those with the same engine size.  A person might pay &euro;180 to tax a 1.6 litre vehicle while another would pay in or about &euro;500 due to the age of the vehicle.  I understand the rationale behind it, and that it is designed to encourage people to buy vehicles with lower emissions.  The reality, however, is that it requires people to buy newer, if not new, vehicles, and not everyone can afford to do so.  People with older vehicles are shouldering this cost even if they are not using the road as much as someone with a newer vehicle.</p></speech>

No problem.</p> <p>I want to raise the issue of Console, which has already been raised by a number of Senators today.  Unlike some Senators in this Chamber, I am not prepared to wait and see.  This is black and white.  It is quite clear that what has been done is an absolute disgrace.  It is robbing money out of the pockets of people who provided funding and supported the charity over the years.  At this point in time, there is no reason for any course of action other than a full investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I understand the board has put in two people to examine and audit the books, but that alone is not acceptable.  This is in the public arena and it is not being challenged by anyone.  It is quite obvious that ordinary people's money has been stolen.  We need these people to be called to heel.  We also need a quick investigation and a visible result. </p> <p>The last time this happened - it concerned another national entity - we saw a drop-off in support for genuine charities by 20% or 30% within weeks.  Every time this happens, people will be less willing to support genuine charities.  There are genuine charities, but the regulator is not doing its job adequately.  The regulator should be inspecting the books of any registered charity he wishes and auditing them without notice.  That is not happening.  The gangsters in Console were chancing their arm and spending donations for their own gain and entertainment.  I call on the Minister to instruct the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to start a full and open investigation into the matter.</p></speech>

It would be far more practical if we stuck to one item.</p> <p>I wish to mention an issue raised by the retailers' group RGDATA.  This concerns the report from the Data Commissioner on the use of CCTV footage to prevent crime in retail units.  Retailers have now been advised that they cannot share this footage with other retailers.  It is a disgrace that this is allowed to happen.  Someone is clearly identified as a shoplifter, but the retailer in whose premises it occurs cannot share that information with other retailers, including those in the same centre.  That is outrageous, and we need clarification on the matter.  If someone produces a knife in a retail unit, can that footage be used?  If necessary, we should introduce amending legislation to deal with the issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have a situation whereby retailers are required to pay rates, insurance costs, service charges and security charges, and it now appears that they are being asked to pay shoplifters as well.  We need the Minister to come before the House to explain what will be done to ensure that legislation is introduced immediately to allow retailers to share information where crimes are being committed.  This is a serious issue.  Retailers' margins are at an all-time low and it is important that we deal with this issue immediately and do not put it on the long finger.

One cannot always tell.  He was certainly affected by the tragedy in his family.  It seems he is a kind of Walter Mitty character, having turned up in various roles as an Aer Lingus pilot, a doctor and a Roman Catholic priest and so on.  It is also tragic for his family.</p> <p>I agree 100% with Senator Mulherin about motor tax.  It is completely ridiculous.  Lots of people, myself included, have very old cars.  My car is large and I pay as much for it in tax and insurance every year as it cost me to buy it.  The polluter pays principle should be implemented.  I raised this issue when Mr. John Gormley was Minister.  Mr. Gormley agreed with me but said it is a was a matter for the Department of Finance, which would not let him make the relevant change.  I support Senator Mulherin in calling for the position regarding motor tax to be examined.</p></speech>

There is a lot of insecurity and instability at present.  While we, as democrats, accept the decision made by the United Kingdom, I cannot accept that it is now holding the Irish, UK and world economies to ransom by kicking to touch a decision for a minimum of three to four months.  The Leader needs to put pressure on the Taoiseach and the Ministers who will be in attendance in Europe in the coming weeks to move the process forward.  Europe is now saying it will not discuss the exit details until the British invoke Article 50.  Markets react to instability and will always err on the side of caution in their own interests.  As has been said before, the biggest problem facing various businesses, in particular agribusiness, is the sterling exchange rate.  Our exporters are suffering terribly.  While insecurity and instability remain ongoing, the markets will control the sterling exchange rate.  This influences people's pensions and our exports.  We cannot stand on the sidelines and watch Europe and the UK kick the decision down the line.  The UK is looking for three months to sort out its political affairs.  Our biggest loss will take place during that period.  Once the exit details are being negotiated, who knows what will happen.  We are in the EU and can be part of the negotiations.  Things may not be as bad as certain people have painted them.  The one thing that is sure and certain is that while insecurity and instability continues for three or four months we will suffer in terms of our exports, agribusiness and as a community in general terms of the fluctuation of sterling.  The situation will not stabilise while there is insecurity.</p> <p>I accept the decision of the people of the UK.  It was a democratic decision.  I do not and cannot accept that once they made the decision, they cannot enact it and are entitled to postpone it for three months in order to get party political leadership in order.  This is happening at the expense of the Irish, European and world economies.  The Leader must put pressure on our representatives in Europe to try to move the process forward and eliminate the current instability.</p></speech>

It happened during Ramadan, which is a period of prayer, fasting, religious devotion and charity.  It belies the contention that ISIS is an Islamic or Muslim organisation.  It is antithetical to Islam and that should go on the record of the House.  It does not represent Islam or Muslim countries.</p> <p>Brexit has happened and is causing major turmoil around the world, including on the island of Ireland, in the UK and across Europe.  I am angry that people have decided to leave Europe, but they did not think of the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland - which comprise the island of Ireland - Scotland or Europe.  The vote has major implications.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly will meet in Malahide on Sunday.  This is a plenary session that happens every six months and the most recent meeting was held in the UK.  It brings MPs, Deputies, Senators and many others from Scotland and Wales together.  There will be a very interesting discussion at the assembly which meets from Sunday until Tuesday.  I look forward to making contributions.</p> <p>One aspect of the assembly is British-Irish friendship.  We are dealing with a century of Irish independence and the peace settlement in Northern Ireland.  We are forgetting that we now have to consider Scotland and ensure that a deal is done to ensure it remains in the EU.  The people of Scotland are reaching out because they feel left out by the UK.  We must work to ensure that whatever happens will be in the interests of Ireland and countries such as Scotland.</p> <p>David Cameron is gone and the head of the Labour Party is almost gone.  These matters are making fifth page headlines.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, is visiting Northern Ireland today.  I welcome the latter because we need to keep the lines of communication open during what is a very difficult and dangerous time for our country and for Europe.</p></speech>

It highlights issues we have discussed, such as the importance of strengthening equality and human rights in the post-Brexit context, the importance of addressing the scandal that is direct provision, something we will debate today and I hope will take action on, the importance of addressing austerity in terms of economic, social and cultural rights and the importance of moving forward on the rights of people with disabilities, something our group has previously debated in the House.

Average milk prices this year will probably be in the region of 24 cent or 25 cent per litre.  In 2014 dairy farmers got 38 cent per litre.  The income of an average dairy farmer milking roughly 70 cows will be down by up to &euro;50,000 this year.  This crisis is affecting every part of rural Ireland and there is no real solution.  As a nation, we need to examine how we will support family farms.  Retailers and the industry need to move together.  Today, one can buy milk in Aldi, Lidl and other outlets for six times the farm gate price.  One can buy a smaller 250 ml product for the same price as a farmer is paid for 150 litres, which is roughly 25 times what a farmer receives.  The situation cannot continue unless retailers work with industry and farmers.  If this does not happen the dairy industry will not survive. </p> <p>A labelling process should be put in place.  The farm gate price of products should be put on labels.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not believe the general public know that they are paying six times the price of the product, or in other places up to 25 times, depending on where you buy it.  There needs to be a debate on this.  The Minister needs to come to the House and look at what legislation we can pass to put a labelling system in place so the actual price of the farm gate product is put on the product itself.  If we can do that, the general consumer will realise exactly what the farming community is making, or how little it is making.  If we fail, we will have a situation that, unfortunately, our dairy industry and our family farms will not survive.</p></speech>

It is Sarcoma Action Group Ireland.  Sarcoma is a rare cancer of the soft tissue or bone, diagnosed in about 250 new patients each year.  They require ongoing care from multidisciplinary team specialists, surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.  Unfortunately, on Thursday 30 June, Ireland's only specialist oncologist in sarcoma chemotherapy will leave her post at St. Vincent's hospital.  The ongoing care for these 200 to 300 patients a year is at risk.</p> <p>We have utmost respect for the other oncologists, but nobody has the expertise that this oncologist has.  Her name is Dr. Bertuzzi.  She has been contracted as a locum for the last three years.  The previous oncologist has now returned and Dr. Bertuzzi, apparently, is no longer required.  Patients from all over Ireland have been referred to her for chemotherapy for the various types of sarcoma.  The oncologist taking her place does not have expertise in sarcoma cancers, which are quite different.  It is like referring somebody who has brain cancer to a person who specialises in breast cancer.  It just would not happen.  This is a specialist service.  The patients are devastated.  To listen to them would make you cry at how vulnerable and very sick they are.  Dr. Bertuzzi has expertise and brings to it a very thoughtful, caring and researched approach.  She has been able to diagnose not just on research but on her own intuition.  She has even proved popular in Britain, where people are being referred to her, yet she is to go tomorrow, leaving 300 patients with no specialist oncologist.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has passed it over to the HSE.  He has made meaningless statements that he has been struck by the number of phone calls his office has received and that they will look into it.  Unfortunately, this will happen tomorrow.  Perhaps the Leader could ask the Minister, Deputy Harris, to make a meaningful statement.  I ask for the specialist oncologist to be retained while we work out further detail.  If anybody is interest, there is a protest at 1 p.m. outside the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

It is somewhat fitting that I wrote my wee notes with a pen given to me by the Federation of Irish Sport while sitting beside Senator John O'Mahony, one of the most famous bainisteoir&iacute; in Gaelic football history.  It is an absolute travesty for many clubs around the country to know that the preparations that have been ongoing on submissions for sports capital grants will not now be needed, as the grants will not be provided in 2016.  I ask the Leader of the House to ask the Minster, Deputy Ross, to come in and reflect on this.  Sports capital grants are vital for sport, communities and our nation's health, but also for the economy.  They provide direct returns in VAT for works and in PAYE for the workmen carrying out the works, and for the local economies close to clubs in many areas around the country.  One of the most disappointing aspects is that sports capital grants are a little bit of a mystery.  We do not exactly know when we will get them.  We know that we are promised them and that they are good things, but we do not know for sure.  That has a huge impact on clubs and communities.  I have been working with a number of clubs in my area that are getting ready to prepare on foot of expecting a sports capital grant this year.  This is now going into next year.  Money that has been saved and preparations that have been made will have to be delayed.  It would be a far better idea if the Minister, Deputy Ross, brought in a system where a smaller, annual allocation would take place.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; s&eacute; sin iarrtha ag roinnt daoine.</p> <p>I also propose an amendment to the Order of Business: that we take motion No. 7 on the Order Paper today.  I had phone calls from a very irate constituent yesterday who told me that she has been a customer for 23 years with one of the waste disposal companies and has always used the system where she buys the refuse sacks in her local shop to dispose of waste.  She can no longer do that under the new system that has been set up.  This is a change from what we were told last week in a debate in this House - that "under no circumstances would the Government allow a situation whereby households would be mandated to switch over to a new charging system that would result in dramatic increases for many households".  That is exactly what is happening, contrary to what the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, told us here last week during a debate.  This new regime is to come in on 1 July.  I have been contacted by people across the country, so it is quite clear to me that there are still issues with the waste companies across the country on this.  I still believe that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, wittingly or unwittingly misled us in the Seanad last week.  I do not know whether that is because the refuse companies did not tell him the full truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, or whether he was aware that anybody who had been disposing of their refuse to date or who had been using bags or tag systems that they bought through the local shop would now be forced into a situation where they first have to register with the companies and then pay by weight, which is a fundamental change and very different from what we were told in the House last week.</p> <p>I call on Fianna F&aacute;il to support this amendment to the Order of Business because I am not sure whether its members were aware, when they proposed last week that they would give full support to the Minister on this, that they were not being given the full picture and the full information, or whether, under the new arrangement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il was aware of it as well and this was part of the collusion that happened here last week.  This is a very urgent debate.  We need the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to come before us to clarify this very quickly.  We need action to ensure that the new system is not brought in and that people are not penalised, because there is a huge cohort who either dispose of their own waste or use the bag or tag system who will now be forced to register, pay standing charges and pay extra costs.</p></speech>

The Government has not been doing enough on this case.  Some 494 people face a mass trial with Ibrahim Halawa.  Two were released today and three have died in custody.  The questions all of the Government should ask are: why were the two released and how did the three die in custody?  Ibrahim could face the same fate, because according to his legal team he faces the death penalty, yet our Government says that he does not.  The ambassador from Egypt says that he prays that Ibrahim is not facing more serious charges.  If he faces the death penalty and gets convicted on that charge, the presidential decree that our Government is hanging its hat on, saying that we can intervene after the trial, does not apply.  Our Government wants transparency; it says that it needs and likes transparency.  Yet, Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade refused in a vote to have Ibrahim Halawa's legal team come before it.  The committee did not want to hear what they had to say.  I ask the Leader to organise this debate tomorrow.  Ibrahim is an Irish citizen.  He is the only Irish citizen that Amnesty International has declared a prisoner of conscience, yet our Government says that soft diplomacy is what will work.  It has not worked, but what does work and has worked for the Australians is hard diplomacy.  They got their citizen Peter Greste released on a presidential decree while awaiting trial.</p></speech>

Australia's Prime Minister intervened directly with President el-Sisi and secured the release of its citizen awaiting trial.  Yet we will be told that soft diplomacy works.  Our citizen is in jail and has gone through 13 trials, none of which was heard.  Now he faces waiting until October with no guarantee that he will get a hearing that day either.  I ask the Leader as a matter of urgency to ensure that there will be a special debate today or tomorrow on this issue.</p></speech>

I appeal to everyone in the Chamber to read the motion.  There is nothing here that anyone could object to.  We are simply asking that what the Minister told us was the situation would in fact be the situation.  It is very clear that there are several issues connected with bin charges.  I too have heard of companies which are moving the goal posts as we speak, and from 1 July will increase charges.  According to the report in <i>thejournal.ie </i>yesterday, one of the biggest companies, Greyhound, has declared that it will move to new charges unless the customers write in and request it not to.  That is not how the situation was explained to us last week.  This is a major problem that will affect tens of thousands of people across the country.  We have the opportunity and the duty to look into this.  There is nothing in the motion that any of us could object to.</p><p>I commend Senator Daly&rsquo;s comments on Ibrahim Halawa.

There is confusion.  The Minister needs to clarify this for us, especially for the people using Greyhound and other facilities.  I would like the Minister to come to the House to explain the situation.  I believe it will be sorted but we need confirmation of what the situation is.</p> <p>In the last local elections, the name of the Leader programme changed to local community development committee, LCDC, but no payments have been made to any local authorities for more than two years.  I want the Minister to ensure that every local authority is paid.  Carlow County Council should be paid &euro;6.4 million for necessary projects.  All local authorities have 12 or 14 projects waiting to be assessed and get the go-ahead.  I believe that under this new process, they have to reapply.  That is not good enough.  Any project waiting more than two years to be assessed needs to get the go ahead.  That is only fair play.

Eight Senators, including Senators Ardagh, Conway-Walsh, Conway, Boyhan, Dolan, Landy and Norris, raised the issue of Console.  I think all of us in this House will join in condemning the lack of transparency and accountability in regard to the governance and use of public moneys in a charity like Console.  It is equally important to segregate the two parts of this story.  Console, with the Health Service Executive, HSE, is providing a service to people requiring intervention of some type or another and they must have confidence in the service being continued.  In tandem with that, there is very important work to be done by the HSE and the Charities Regulator in holding the board or chief executive of the charity to account for the expenditure of money and the governance of the organisation.  The revelations are appalling and unacceptable.  Those of us involved in the charity and community sector or in sporting organisations expect and demand high standards of probity when dealing with public moneys, in particular money raised by volunteers across the country.  It is also important we understand that the HSE in its auditing of accounts of section 38 or section 39 organisations must do so to the letter of the law.  The Charities Regulator has been appointed but not because of a Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  The Charities Act was passed in this House in 2009 and to give Senator Conway-Walsh a history lesson, it was the only time in that Seanad when the Opposition combined to defeat the Government on a Bill.  I was the Fine Gael spokesperson on the community sector.</p></speech>

Senator Conway referred to Part 4 of the Charities Act.  It is a staffing issue.  There is an obligation on the Government to work with the Charities Regulator and give him a full complement of staff to implement the Charities Act with its full rigour.  We cannot condone any wrongdoing and must condemn it and hold those involved to account.  These were public moneys, charitable money and money we all work hard to accrue and spend.  The accrual of personal largesse is despicable and there is no other word for that kind of behaviour.  I hope the breach of trust arising from this "Prime Time" programme will lead to a better corporate governance structure across the charity sector.  In the last D&aacute;il and Seanad, we saw breaches of trust in section 38 and section 39 organisations.  I hope this is a watershed moment when we can turn the corner and say it will happen no more.</p> <p>Six Senators mentioned Brexit.  I say to Senator Craughwell that we accept the democratic will of the people of the United Kingdom to vote the way they did.  That does not mean it is the right decision.  What is important now for us is that our Government, on behalf of the people, acts in our interests within the European Union.  As a very proud advocate of the European Union and as a republican, I believe it is imperative that we put the green goal forward to protect the North and South of the country, to protect jobs and to highlight the issues raised this morning in regard to agriculture and, in particular, trade.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will come to the House next week.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh mentioned currency fluctuations for those on social welfare.  The Department of Social Protection has said it will monitor the situation and take steps to adjust and rebalance the amounts payable to pensioners, in particular.  It is important to keep a watching brief on that.</p> <p>The relationship between this country and the United Kingdom is important and special.  The repercussions of the vote will have a profound impact on this nation.  There is a need now, within the EU, for a calm reflective debate on how best to further the European project.  If that means changing the democratic institutions and how they operate, let us do that.  For now, we need a period of calm and certainty to allow the UK trigger the mechanism to exit but in so doing, perhaps it will recognise the error of its ways and revisit the vote at a later date before triggering that mechanism.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade for coming to the House yesterday for the debate, which was very good.  I thank all Senators for their participation in it.</p> <p>Several Senators mentioned the awful and tragic killings in Istanbul yesterday.  I hope all of us will join in the condemnation of those senseless and meaningless attacks in the name of whatever.  Violence has no place in our world.  There is no justification for any type of violence in the pursuit of peace or a common cause.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Conway-Walsh also proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  I will not accept the amendment for the reasons I have already outlined.  All of us want the Seanad to move forward in a way that is productive and reflective of the new dynamics in the House, but there is a structure in place.  I have explained the rationale for that.  I hope the legacy the Members of this Seanad leave is a reformed Seanad that will work better for generations of people to come.</p><p>Senator Nash raised the report of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I welcome that report.  Senator O'Mahony raised the PSO levies on electricity charges.  I will be happy to invite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Naughten, to the House to explain this and have a debate on it.  If the Senator wishes, he could table a Commencement matter to get a reply more quickly but I will facilitate the Minister coming to the House as well.</p><p>Senator Gallagher raised the talks between the Garda Representative Association, GRA, and the Department of Justice and Equality on the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts and the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The FEMPI legislation is very important legislation which the last Government began to roll back in terms of the reduction it contained.  Industrial action of any type is regrettable and I appeal to the GRA and, indeed, to the teachers, particularly the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, ASTI, to re-engage and not take their members to the brink.</p><p>I am a public service worker and have been a member of a union all of my working life.  It is important that 200,000 public sector workers signed up to the Landsdowne Road agreement.  Further engagement is needed and is desirable.  There are issues to be addressed, and I understand the frustrations of the two unions involved regarding the pay and conditions of their members.  Those of us who were involved in this debate previously will recognise that there is a road to travel.  However, there is an understanding, which should have been conveyed by the unions, that when one did not sign up to the Lansdowne Road agreement there was a consequence, however regrettable that is.  I hope that there will be compromise and further engagement at this 11th hour.  I have no wish to see any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a teaching union representative losing pay or losing out on receiving money as a result of the FEMPI legislation being rescinded, but I hope there will be further engagement on the matter.</p><p>Senators Conway and Mark Daly raised the Halawa case.  I will do my best to get the Minister to come to the House at the earliest opportunity.  It might not be possible tomorrow, but I will do my best.</p><p>Senator Boyhan raised the important issue of Irish Water.  We heard this morning that the former Senator, Mr. Joe O'Toole, has been appointed to chair the commission.  I am glad Senator Boyhan referred to the fact that it was the Fianna F&aacute;il Government in 2010 which conceded the derogation.  However, it is important that we allow that piece of work to be done and have the debate.  It is part of the programme for Government and the confidence and supply arrangement between Fianna F&aacute;il and the minority Government to have that report commissioned.  I wish Mr. O'Toole every success in his work.</p><p>Senator Maria Byrne raised two important issues relating to security in Limerick.  I will ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to report to her on Operation Prowl.</p><p>Senator Warfield spoke about Dublin Pride.  I was a proud participant last Saturday in Dublin when there were 70,000 people on the streets.  It is regrettable that there was an incident late that night in which somebody was attacked, for whatever motivation.  Contrast the carnival and celebratory atmosphere in Dublin with what happened at the Istanbul pride parade.  It shows the progress this country has made.  I thank the many parents and grandparents of LGBT people who came out on the streets of Dublin on Saturday and celebrated.  It was worth seeing.  There was a Mardi Gras atmosphere.  Is it not fantastic that, as we remember the late Declan Flynn and people such as Chris Robinson, in 2016, as we celebrate the centenary of the Rising, we can walk as free and equal citizens across our capital city?</p><p>Senator Hopkins raised the issue of agriculture, as did Senator Lombard.  The Minister will be in the House next week to discuss agriculture issues.</p><p>Senator Dolan, who as been a strong promoter of the charity and disability sector, made a poignant point about the Battle of the Somme and the role of Irish people in that battle.  The Minister is travelling there to take part in the commemoration events.  We certainly recognise the importance of that event.</p><p>Senators Mulherin and Norris raised the issue of motor tax.  I will be happy to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Finance to the House to discuss that issue.</p><p>Senator Landy and Senator Colm Burke spoke about the Order of Business.  It would be a great help to me if a Member could raise only one item on the Order of Business, but that is a matter for the Cathaoirleach to decide.  Senator Colm Burke also raised the important issue of not being able to share closed circuit television, CCTV, footage.  I am a member of the Cork city joint policing committee on which there is representation from the Garda.  The Garda is absolutely tied in not being able to allow this to happen in the sharing of information.  The Senator is right and I agree with him that the legislation should be amended to reflect the new technological world in which we live whereby we can share information which could prevent crime and theft occurring, at the flick of a switch.  I agree that we should invite the Minister with responsibility for data protection to the House.  I will endeavour to do so at the earliest convenient opportunity.</p><p>Senators Feighan and Paul Daly raised the issue of Brexit and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  As I said, the Minister will come to the House to discuss agriculture.  The Senators are correct that it is important to have an urgent debate on agriculture.</p><p>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins raised the report of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I will be happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the broader issue.</p><p>Senator Lombard raised the role of the family farm and he highlighted the price differential in a startling way.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, will address that when he comes to the House.</p><p>Senator Devine raised the issue of oncology services for the treatment of sarcoma.  This is predominantly an operational matter for the HSE, so I will take it up with the Minister and the HSE.</p><p>Senator Richmond raised the sports capital programme and the non-allocation of sports capital grants this year.  If that is the case, it is a very disappointing announcement by the Minister.  As the Senator rightly said, this is about sport and community.  It is about benefitting sports grounds for communities, clubs and sports organisations.  It is also about the local economy and allowing small builders, in particular, to make an income.  It is disappointing and I will invite the Minister to the House at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of waste.  I will not accept the amendment as we had a debate on the matter last week.  The Senator can table a Commencement matter on it as well if he wishes, but the Minister gave a clear outline to the House last week and the circumstances have not changed.  Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue as well.</p></speech>

It failed long ago.  It fails every time an addict dies from the effects of an unknown substance.  It fails every time a parent has to pay the drug debt of a child.  It fails every time we imprison an addict for possession and it fails every time we introduce legislation to further criminalise the addict.  The addict has become collateral damage in the State's fight to dismantle the drugs trade.  Legislation that criminalises possession reinforces the stigma associated with addiction.  We cannot continue to try to separate the addict from the dealer.  I have had dozens of conversations in recent weeks with people who both sell and use substances.  I refer to two of the contributions which I raise in order to communicate the reality of the amendments and the people they affect.  A 34 year old woman from Tallaght said:</p><blockquote>Even after I was raped, imprisoned, battered, pimped and hospitalised I have been refused treatments for benzo addiction.  Apparently I am not ready, or so some stranger likes to decide.  I sell benzos, not a huge amount, just enough to fund my own use and to do some food shopping.  I often have boxes of benzos in my possession.</blockquote> <p>A young 17 year old male from Crumlin said: </p><blockquote>My brother and I started taking tablets after weekend sessions.  We used to rob my Mam's zimos when we were children and I deliver benzos for my cousin so I can get some for myself.  I would like to join the Army some day but I can't seem to stop messing around, ever since my brother died and my cousin was murdered.  Both of these used zopiclone amongst other tablets.</blockquote> <p>That young boy will never make it to the Army if he is prosecuted for possession and the woman from Tallaght risks being imprisoned again if treatment for benzo addiction does not become the priority instead of treating her like a criminal.</p><p>In Portugal, if the two individuals in the cases outlined were caught in possession they would have a greater chance of access to much-needed services.  A commission for the dissuasion of drug addiction convenes when an individual is found with drugs.  These commissions are made up a social worker, a solicitor and a doctor or a psychiatrist and the outcome is a fine or treatment.  Nearly 16 years on, Portugal has not seen an increase in addiction.  In fact, statistics from the Transform Drug Policy Foundation shows a decline in the population reporting to have used drugs.  Statistics also show that drug use declined in the most at-risk group, namely, 15 to 24 year olds.</p><p>We cannot continue to ignore the positive progression of Portugal's decriminalisation policies.  The British Journal of Criminology in 2010 found that Portugal also shows a decrease in imprisonment for drug-related charges and there has also been a surge in visits to addiction centres.  We will never control the flow of drugs by banning them.  Instead, we should create policy that increases access to drug treatment and addresses inequality and poverty.  Leaving the most vulnerable at risk of arrest reinforces the cycle of criminality.  Addiction begins and ends with pain.  Before Members vote today I urge them to consider the fact that criminalising drug possession, which will affect the addict, just adds to the cycle of pain.  We live in a culture emotionally, psychologically and economically that punishes those already suffering.  The moment we flip those policies on their head and move away from criminalisation, the closer we move to opening up the pathways to recovery and support for our friends, communities and values.  I hope Members will take that into consideration when considering the amendments today.</p></speech>

I was in the position of the Minister of State not that long ago.  In public life, it is very rare to come to the conclusion that everything we are doing is wrong.  We have come to the conclusion that the issue with drugs lies with the substances and that if we just control them, everything will be fine.  Addition, however, is not just about the substance, it is about circumstances, disconnection and marginalisation.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why we still think it is a good idea to effectively criminalise marginalisation and addiction.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What my amendment is trying to achieve - it is very similar to Senator Ruane's amendment - is to stand by what the programme for Government said that drug policy would take a health-centred approach and not a criminal justice one.  It makes absolutely no sense to try to dissuade somebody from a life of addiction by criminalising him or her for his or her drug use.  My amendment clearly states that it should be a defence for anybody caught in possession of an illegal substance to argue that it was for his or her own personal use.  As Senator Ruane has quite correctly said, Ireland could follow the example of Portugal by saying to individuals that we understand they are addicted, they have a medical need and that they need help and compassion and that we are not going to blame the victim.  What happens in this Republic is that we blame the victim and all the resources that could be spent dealing with the pushers and the trade are being spent on the victims of the trade.</p><p>There are silent victims of this industry who nobody ever hears about.  I mentioned in the House a couple of weeks ago that in March of this year two people were found dead on the streets of our capital city from heroin overdoses but that never made it into the newspapers.  One gentleman was found dead in the public toilet of Connolly Station and another gentleman was found dead after two nights in the open air in Foley Street.  The stories did not make it into any newspaper, there was no protest and there was no political comment about it because on some level, in this society, we have decided that these people are to blame for their own addiction.  We blame the victim and criminalise the victim.</p><p>If one speaks to any group from the equality sector, whether the LGBT community, the Traveller community, people with disabilities or migrants, they will all say that there is disproportionate drug usage issue in these communities because of disconnection and marginalisation.  When a person falls into addiction, surely our response should not be a criminal justice one but a health one.  I am not sure if the Minister of State has been to the Drug Treatment Court, which is an initiative to try to keep people away from the criminal justice system, but all one sees there is a bunch of sick people sitting in a court room.  It makes no sense whatsoever.</p><p>Fundamentally, what we are trying to achieve here is to ensure the victim of this trade, the addict or the drug user, is not a criminal because of his or her drug use.  The people who sell, trade in and profit from drugs should be criminalised.  They should be taken out of circulation and we should use the criminal justice system to do that.  However, the victim, the addict or the user, should not be criminalised because of his or her medical need or medical condition.  What we propose is common sense.  It would shift the whole drugs issue away from a moralising pathetic attempt to say Ireland is black and white to actually humanise the individual who is affected by this.</p><p>I refer to our friends in the media.  We, in Ireland, constantly use terminology that dehumanises people who need services and resources, and the media is culpable in this.  We call them names; we call them junk.  When we do that it inevitably results in the public consciousness believing that, in some way, these people are less worthy of resources.  Let us take a course of action that might actually work because what we are doing at the moment is not working.  We should look at what they do in Portugal and we should say to citizens that they have an addiction and they are not criminals but that they are patients with a medical need and we will treat them as such.</p></speech>

It is an ever-increasing problem.  The point made by the two previous speakers on the amendments they have put forward are points that are very well made.  The key here for many people who are addicted is to access treatment for addiction and that is an issue that remains to be addressed.  Coincidentally, when I was with President Michael D. Higgins in Portugal last year, I had the pleasure of speaking with the Minister who brought in this system into Portugal.  The measure is working very well and I believe it is something we should examine and introduce.  The system changes the offence to an administrative offence rather have a criminal one.  I agree with previous speakers who spoke about the implications for a person who is caught, in his or her youth, with a joint or a couple of tablets for his or her own use and is criminalised and has a record for the remainder of his or her life, with all that implies from the point of view of job prospects and further training abroad.  That is clearly wrong and society has moved on.  What we want to do is to protect people from drug abuse and a system such as that introduced by the Portuguese should be brought in here.  It may need to be tweaked from the Irish perspective but I know that the Minister intends to examine that in the future and to bring in a more comprehensive legislation to address that issue.</p> <p>I do not believe it is acceptable to supply others with drugs to maintain one's habit.  That person is a pusher, regardless of what the motivation is.  It is an entirely different matter if one is addicted and one is caught with a small quantum.</p> <p>I could not agree more that, in many instances, it is in areas of deprivation and marginalisation that people turn to drugs.  This benzodiazepine prescribing goes back the time when much of the inner city was moved out to the outer rounds of Dublin which, on the face of it, looked wonderful in that there was a house with a garden.  However, the aunty was not down the road anymore, the brother was not up the street anymore and the infrastructure was not there to support families in the extended family way people had been used to up to then.  When people suffered frustrations, distress and anxiety, tablets became the cure and sadly that became a really big problem.  Now we have more enlightened ways, through counselling, of dealing with issues like this but the bottom line is that we need to control these drugs.  They have become a major problem.  I know from talking to people that very often the source of the tablets is a well-meaning older person who gets them from the doctor but who allows somebody younger to take them off his or her hands.</p> <p>I support the Bill as it is and look forward to the Minister bringing forward more comprehensive legislation in the future to address this area, the issue of the places in which to inject and other supports for addicts.</p></speech>

I also thank the two Senators who tabled the amendments for setting out their stall, or their case.  The bottom line is that drugs are the scourge of all communities.  They know no bounds.  I accept that while there are major problems with drugs in certain deprived areas, there are also drugs in very affluent areas.  Cocaine is to be found on the high streets of Dublin, in the suburbs of Dublin and in the well-to-do places all over Ireland.  There are all forms of drug addiction but I am of the view that it is a health issue and not a criminal one and we must support the people who are the victims of the drug barons and those who have peddled these drugs in our society for years.  </p> <p>I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire where the settled community has constantly resisted the drugs and rehabilitation centre on Patrick Street.  Communities say that people are coming from way beyond the community.  Drug rehabilitation and treatment has to be in each of our communities and each community has to take responsibility.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The sad reality in many cases is that local representatives in councils, Deputies, Senators and politicians of all hue have been an obstacle to allowing the rehabilitation of people in their communities.  People respond to those who complain and speak the loudest.  Politicians respond to people who engage in the voting process.  Many people who are marginalised by drugs do not necessarily play a full and active role in their communities for various reasons; that is not to condemn them, but to acknowledge the fact.  </p><p>I am more interested in hearing about rehabilitation.  I am more interested in having small micro-services in every community on the island of Ireland.  For far too long, politicians have said one thing but do not follow up with the necessary supports.  In my own community, two drug addicts live very close to me.  I remember when they were children.  They were someone's two sons.  Their parents set out with high ideals and ambitions for them.  They sent them to school.  One did well in sport and one got an amazing leaving certificate.  Where are they now?  They are walking around our town and my community alienated, forgotten, condemned and considered hopeless.  What hope have they got?  Is it enough to put them into some detention centre and condemn them, or can they get support?  Another mother called to my home two weeks ago to say her daughter's daughter had been in a hospital in the west for six months after being born.  This is another victim, someone who was detox-born.  These are decent, ordinary people who have aspirations.  Until we bring it home and talk about our brother or our sister, our mother or our father, our child, then it becomes a different story.  We have got to make it more human.  These people are victims and they need support.</p><p>While I accept that what the former Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly, has said is true, many drug users do push drugs to fund their habit.  They are drug pushers and we cannot apologise for that.  That is the dilemma with this problem.  How can we say that a person can be permitted to have a certain amount of drugs when in effect many of these drug pushers have no control over anything they do because they have fallen so low?  These are the dilemmas and the problems, and we all know them.  If we are truly honest, we must know people involved at some level, be it sniffing cocaine, doing drugs, tabs or whatever it is.  It is a human tragedy that is the scourge of our communities.  I want to hear the Minister of State's response to these two amendments.  I am interested in hearing what she is going to do and how she is going to empower our communities, our families and our friends in the form of rehabilitation so that these people can have meaningful lives for themselves but also play a meaningful role for their families, their children and their communities.</p></speech>

It is important that it be enacted at the earliest possible date.  It is important also that we take account of the amendments tabled, but not in the sense of incorporating them in this legislation.  Instead, they might be incorporated into a more comprehensive Bill, which I understand will be introduced in the autumn, on this whole area.  There is the issue of users and the issue of pushers.  Coming from a legal perspective, the problem for the courts is trying to decide on who is not the pusher.  That is the reason we have to be very careful in regard to the legislation.  It is an issue we need to examine very carefully.  I accept that the Senators who tabled these amendments have vast knowledge and expertise in this whole area and have quoted Portugal as an area where some success has been reported.  We should now look at that.  In the past four or five years, and even before that time, there have been cutbacks in support services.  We need to know how we can help restructure these to ensure the funding is adequate and can support the people who genuinely want to move away from the drugs problem.</p> <p>This legislation is necessary.  If we cannot incorporate the amendments tabled today we should consider them in the context of the new legislation in the autumn to ensure the necessary procedures are in place for dealing with those who are not involved in the pushing or sale of drugs but want support from the services.</p></speech>

In his contribution, the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, outlined the reason the Bill is required.  He said drug dealers carry relatively small quantities of drugs on their person and this then makes it difficult for authorities to proceed with sale or supply charges.  Having spoken to representatives of community groups in the areas most affected by these substances, I cannot support the two amendments proposed by Senator Lynn Ruane and Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  These community groups have expressed the view that making these small quantities illegal prevents drug pushers from operating and therefore prevents young people from falling into the cycle of drug addiction.  I accept the contributions from Senators who have outlined that this will not help the addicts.  That is unfortunate.  Perhaps Senator Colm Burke's suggestion that these amendments be incorporated into an overall strategy for addiction services could be taken on board, because it is important that we help addicts.  It was clear from the debate last week that adequate addiction services are not in place for addicts of all substances, but particularly those set out in the Schedule to the Bill.</p> <p>I call on the Minister of State to outline her response to the amendments and to the requests in the House.  While I welcome the Bill, I will not be supporting the amendments.</p></speech>

A previous Senator used the word "alienation".  I think I have used that word previously in discussing the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill.  Swathes of communities and swathes of young people have been alienated because of drug misuse, drug abuse and drug addiction.</p> <p>The global war on drugs, which has continued for more than 50 years, has failed.  We are playing catch-up all the time and running around in circles while the big drug barons seem to be laughing from their lofty heights.  The policies we have tried have failed miserably.  There are too many people incarcerated for behaviours connected to addiction and drug possession.  Unfortunately, this has not reduced the population addicted to drugs; instead, it is increasing.  </p> <p>The funds spent on imprisoning a person or dragging him or her through a policing or court process should be given to rehabilitation and treatment services.  Realistically, these people need support.  This is a waste of time, resources and energy.  We must bring forward public health measures to increase harm reduction processes.  Given that the Government has committed to approaching drugs as a public health issue, I urge it to accept these amendments or bring forward its own amendments.  There are options for the Government.  It could introduce statutory threshold quantities if it wants to amend it so that only appropriate persons are targeted by this legislation; a maximum use quantity threshold could attempt to distinguish between trafficking or sale offences and possession.  We may examine the introduction of an amendment on Report Stage.  Alternatively, the Government could introduce a provision to the effect that a personal possession offence be subject to an appropriate administrative penalty or non-prosecution.</p> <p>Portugal, which appears to be a leading light within Europe, has made huge strides in its approach in recent years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This panel of experts listens to the arrested person to understand his or her situation and tries to halt what would otherwise be the ongoing alienation and criminalisation of the individual.  There is a huge difference between those manufacturing and importing these drugs and an addict who has been legally prescribed them and is selling them on to fund other drugs or an addict who is a problem user of one of the drugs listed in the Schedule to the Bill.  This is also something we could examine. </p><p>Other jurisdictions allow police and prosecutors to decide whether individuals would benefit from a treatment programme rather than deal with them through a court process.  We need to put this approach at the heart of what we try to do.  The difficulty in doing that in Ireland, however, is the appalling level of treatment services available for those with drug problems.  Coming from a medical background, I know that there are only four detox beds in the State for drug addicts who are under 18 years of age.  St. James's Hospital in Dublin South-Central has just one bed and its availability is extremely limited.  This is the biggest hospital in the country and is located slap bang in the middle of areas ravaged by drugs, gangs and barons dealing in drugs and profiting from them.  These areas are seeing an increased incidence of addiction and, unfortunately, a lot of fatalities, including fatalities in recent months.  It is outrageous that there are only four of these beds in the country.  While we may go down the same route as Portugal and applaud what it does, we need to ensure we have the infrastructure and services in place to care for, nurture and provide a new future to those who have been caught up in addiction.  </p><p>Many of those in the throes of addiction are self-medicating following a lifetime of trauma, illness and poverty.  Throwing them into the penal system will not address their issues and will not put a stop to the organised crime that is endemic in Ireland.  I repeat that it is the lack of investment in these areas, groups and communities that have been alienated for years that has caused this result.  We reap what we sow.  In this case, we did not sow so we will not reap any positivity.  The use of the penal system is a lazy and dangerous policy and it does not work.  On that basis, I urge the Government to accept the amendments or to introduce its own.  Sinn F&eacute;in's Better For Health policy outlines in detail the approach we believe should be adopted in regard to the treatment of the misuse of drugs.  It should be treated as a public health issue and not a criminal one.  There should be a holistic, health-based approach to addiction. </p><p>We note the comments of the Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, who has welcomed the debate on decriminalisation and given a commitment to contribute to it further.  We also note the comments of P.J. Stone of the Garda Representative Association.  He has called for a halt to the criminalisation of addicts and for addicts to be dealt with in a way that gives them a better chance.  We request that Garda resources currently used to criminalise addicts be redirected to fighting the major drug barons and criminals who are destroying communities and families throughout the State.  We reaffirm our request that from here on in drug addiction be addressed as a public health issue rather than a criminal one.  This approach should be suitably and effectively resourced.  This would lead addicts onto a new chapter in their lives and would support them live those lives. </p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledges the intent of both amendments and agrees that most drug users are the victims of addiction.  Sinn F&eacute;in policy clearly states that addiction is a public health issue.  It is important that we try to avoid criminalising people for possession of drugs for their own use.  We support both amendments.  I wish also to note that I reserve the right to introduce further amendments to the Bill on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I really feel that we need to consider this issue fully.  Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, when last in office, worked closely with those working in the field of addiction.  We can see that in the fantastic work he has done.  Senator Ruane has worked in the field of addiction and has done fantastic work and I work in the field of addiction also.  I work with families daily.  Mothers, fathers, grannies, brothers, sisters, adult children and people like the Minister of State are devastated when watching their loved ones go down the route of self-destruction and addiction.  The heartbreak I deal with daily is horrendous.  Now we are trying to criminalise these family members.  It is awful.  Are we to criminalise the loved ones of those who come to me pleading and asking about services?  They ask where they can get help for their sons, fathers, daughters or grandchildren.  What we are saying here is that we should just put them in prison.  It is horrendous.</p> <p>I worked with a group of women in the D&oacute;chas prison who were trying to step from addiction into recovery.  None of these women - they all said it to me - would have been in there only for their addiction.  They do not want to be in there.  Children do not say that when they grow up they want to be in prison or suffering from addiction.  No one says that.  This is not something people choose.  </p> <p>Will the Minister of State look at this as a public health issue?  I implore her to consider these amendments.  It is vital that we think of the families.  We have to consider them.  I ask the Minister of State to show compassion.  She is a mother and a grandmother.  I ask her to please listen to what we are saying.  Three of us have worked in the field of addiction.  Will she please listen to us?  We know what it is like.  I second these amendments.</p></speech>

They are valuable and have led to a useful discussion.  I have spoken on this issue in this House for 30 years and I have always favoured decriminalisation.  However, it is becoming much more complex, as is evidenced by the fact that there are four pages of jaw-breaking drugs that people have never heard of listed.  People do not know the effect of these substances on the individual and that is very dangerous.  I agree that we should look to the medical treatment of this situation rather than criminalising it.  Criminalising it does nothing for the addict.</p><p>There is another aspect to this issue, which is the use of cannabinoid drugs for the relief of certain illnesses.  Will the Government examine this closely?<b></b>I have a series of harrowing letters from parents and people with specific illnesses that can only be effectively treated by cannabinoid drugs, but they are not available.  They should be available.  Here is a situation where we have the possibility of prescription by a doctor to get access to drugs that will relieve the symptoms.  I cannot see any argument against that.  </p><p>Virtually everyone has spoken in favour of this approach, which is interesting, except of course for the spokeswoman for Fianna F&aacute;il.  I listened with great interest to what she had to say.  I accept that there is a problem in that we now have a situation where there is a drug dealer and a runner so that they are only in possession of small amounts, but surely that could be dealt with by police evidence in court.  They know who the drug addicts are and who the pushers are.  It should be possible to isolate the pusher on the grounds of this evidence, which would be given in court under oath.  There is also something a little inconsistent in making that point, which is very well made, and then saying we can introduce the amendments later.  If they are wrong now, they will still be wrong later.  I will support the amendments, if it comes to a vote.</p><p>With regard to my earlier intervention when I said I did not hear the bell, I should have pointed out that I was in the outside space.  I would ask the Cathaoirleach to recommend to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that it puts a bell in the outside space because one just does not hear the division bell.  I am not worried about the number of times I vote.  I vote pretty regularly in this House.  In the old days, columnists in the newspapers with nothing else to do would count up the number of times one voted and print it.  Now they do not bother.  It does not take a feather out of me if someone counts the number of times I vote.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will vote if and when I can.

I will be opposing the amendments not because I do not agree with their essence, but because the Minister will bring forward far more comprehensive legislation which will address this issue.  In Portugal, they have a system, allied to the courts system, which deals with this area.  If one is caught with drugs for one's own use, one does not walk away with a smile on one's face.  There are consequences.  People caught in this way are brought to an administrative court setting where they are offered options in the way of treatment or attendance at an outpatient service.  They are monitored and have to go through a certain process before getting clear of the system.  That would require legislation here because no such system is in place at the moment.</p> <p>There is probably nobody in this room more experienced in dealing with communities and drugs than the Minister of State over her long political career.  I include myself in that, a GP who dealt with drug addiction and attended Trinity House to look after young girls addicted to heroin who were being used by unscrupulous individuals, even within their own families, who pimped them on the streets.  This is a very serious issue and I believe the Minister has the knowledge to deal with it and is going about it in the right way.  I commend the two Senators on putting forward the amendments as they have raised the issue and it is something we should pursue.  However, as Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in will know, the legislation has to be complete in order to support amendments like these.  At the moment, it is nowhere near being so. </p></speech>

I made it very clear in this House last week that I do not want to criminalise anybody who takes drugs because of addiction, but decriminalisation is a complex issue which has to be worked out properly before we can say that people should not be criminalised for carrying drugs in their pockets.  This is because, if it is a person's intent to make a profit or simply to pass on an illegal substance, it is wrong.  That person is interfering with somebody's life by giving them a medication they should not take and the consequences for that person can lead to death.</p> <p>In answer to Senators &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Ruane, I know the victims of drugs as I have lived beside them all my life.  I can give the Senators the names of families which have lost not just one child, but three or four.  There is nothing as bad as going to a funeral where a family is being wiped out because of addiction.  It leaves one haunted for the rest of one's life to see what happens to people who have grown up in an area with one's own children and friends.  At the 21st or 30th birthday parties that come around each year, and to which I am invited, I sit and wonder if Mary, Jack or Paul might have been there had things been done differently.  We need to do things differently but this is a very complex issue.  Senator Boyhan hit the matter on the head when he said that in the past, when services were opened, there was huge hostility towards them and people, including myself in my own area, were marching on the streets against them but this was because proper information was not given to communities about what it was that was being opened.  It created a them-and-us situation, and they should never have done that as tomorrow it could be my son, my daughter or my grandchild.</p> <p>I bear this in mind as we look at how we deal with addicts who live on our streets or come from our own homes.  This is how we should deal with addiction now.  Millions of euro are going into local drugs task forces, community projects and addiction services but people are still becoming addicts and dying on a daily basis.  What is going wrong and why are those services not working?  If they are not working, we should find out why as a lot of money goes into them and we have to be accountable for every penny that is spent in communities because it is public money.  If addiction rates remain high in certain communities, we need to look at the reasons.  If funding is going into the wrong places, maybe we need to take it out and try to do something different.  That is what this document, outlining the Portuguese model, is all about.</p> <p>I understand Senators' frustration and appreciate that they are in touch with community groups which they represent.  Senator M&aacute;ire Devine asked about detox beds and I agree with her 100%.  There should not be just four detox beds and only one for people under 18 in St. James's Hospital.  That has to be looked at because it is a significant part of any addict's attempts to come off a drug.  There are huge numbers of people on methadone in this country and who have not moved on.  It is scary that we all know people in our neighbourhoods who go to work every week but survive on methadone and this is a challenge we have to take on.  We cannot continue to imprison people in a drug that does not bring people anywhere and we need to find a solution.  I entirely agree with Senator Norris that it is a medical issue.  Anything that affects our health is a medical issue.</p> <p>Everybody has spoken about the Portuguese model and I read the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on a harm reducing and rehabilitative approach to the possession of small amounts of illegal drugs.  It is an excellent piece of work and should be commended as a model we should follow.  I am sorry, but we cannot just follow it today.  This is a complex issue.  One recommendation of the committee was that a health counselling treatment approach may be more effective and more appropriate for those found in possession of a small amount of illegal drugs for personal use rather than imposing a criminal sanction resulting in a lifelong criminal record.  We need to look at this model and to take it, dissect it and decide what is suitable for the country in which we live.  This is possible and we all have a part to play in it.  This is not a political issue for me as it covers the political divide.  We need to pick out the good bits from this model and modify them for where we are in this country.  This can be done but we need the co-operation of everyone to do it.  I have spoken to people about the Portuguese model more than about any other issue in the past few weeks.  I do not intend to fly out there to have a look at how it operates in practice as I have enough information from people who have told me how good it is.  I suggest all Senators read the report as it makes good sense.  It is common sense not to criminalise people who are mentally and medically sick.  We have to find a mechanism to avoid criminalising these people.</p> <p>I will not be accepting the amendments of Senators Ruane and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and I will explain why.  I understand that the aim behind the amendments proposed by the Senators is exactly the same, namely, to remove the offence of possession of small quantities of controlled drugs for personal use.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> During the Second Stage debate last week it was made clear that the Bill is one part of a whole of government approach to dealing with the serious crime situation in the north inner city of Dublin.  This Bill is not about targeting addicts but about disrupting gangs and giving the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the powers it needs to do so.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to aid the law and enforcement functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling crime associated with the illegal sale of certain substances.</p><p>As Senators know, drug dealers on the street often carry relatively small quantities of drugs on their person, which makes it difficult for the authorities to proceed with sale or supply charges.  I shall back up my comments by relaying a personal story.  My son is a garda and a few months ago he stopped somebody who had a small amount of drugs in his possession.  My son could not arrest the man and had to let him go.  This law will change that situation by giving the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and customs officials an opportunity to deal with these situations on the street.  I have outlined a typical example.  My son is a garda and he is on the streets day and night doing his job.  Heretofore, when he encountered people with small amounts of substances in their possession he could not arrest and charge them.  That is why the legislation is being introduced and it was long in train before I came into this job.  </p><p>Last week here in the Seanad the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and myself addressed the issue of an alternative approach to the current criminal justice approach to the simple possession of small quantities of illegal drugs for personal use.  We intend to address the matter.  That is why we are having a national drugs strategy and it is why we are having public consultation because we intend to listen to the concerns of people.  We want to look at the model used in Portugal and see if the good bits will work here.  I am very much in favour of doing so, with everybody's help in this Chamber and in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>As we stated last week, consideration of the issue is part of the ongoing discussion on the drafting of the national drugs strategy.  This will include a public consultation phase which will provide an opportunity to have a constructive public dialogue on this and other drug-related issues.  I have spoken to a lot of people in the past couple of weeks, particularly because of my ministerial position.  A lot of people have told me that they have no voice and nobody asks for their opinion.  I can confirm that people do have a voice.  We must listen to the opinion of people because they are living in these communities.  We not only have to listen to the people who are involved in the services to combat drugs, we have to listen to the people living on the outside.  We can no longer have a community of people working in drugs who look inward and instead they must look outward.  We must look at the "Mary" and the "Joe" who live down the street perhaps beside the Merchant's Quay project.  They may not like what goes on in there but accept it is providing a service.  The service must also show respect for the people who live in the neighbourhood.  </p><p>I believe it would be completely wrong to move on a complex social and legal issue such as this without first having that debate.  The implementation of such a change in policy would need extremely careful consideration.  Such consideration must be done through the national drugs strategy but it must come from the people on the ground and the public representatives.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 1 or 2.  I hope, over the next couple of months in the run-up to the national drugs strategy and the public consultation, we will look at models such as the one used in Portugal.  We must analyse how we treat people in communities and, in particular, how we deal with people who want to avail of a detox bed yet find themselves trapped because suitable services do not exist.  Services to help addicts recover should form part of the national drugs strategy.</p></speech>

It is really positive that so many people in the Chamber view the system used in Portugal as a possible way forward.</p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned that an "us and them" scenario was created when projects were set up but I assert that it was created not by the setting up of the project but by the people who decided to oppose the scheme.  As a result, people who wanted to attend the projects did not attend and there were marches against the projects.  It was the other way around.  There is a misconception that the project created an us and them. </p> <p>The Minister of State spoke about doing things differently.  She has an opportunity to do things differently by not pressing the Government amendments and holding off until we discuss the legislation and how to implement the Portuguese model, instead of further pushing criminalisation.  We should wait until we have had conversations. </p> <p>The Minister of State shared her personal story and I shall do the same.  As a 13 or 14 year old child I was a benzo user and we used to buy them in packets in Tallaght.  Had I been arrested for doing so my life would not have gone the way that it has.  Instead, I received support and I am now standing here today as someone who has worked in addiction services for 15 years.</p> <p>We spoke about talking to the people on the ground.  I talk to them every day and I am speaking on their behalf.  If Members want me to fill the room and committee rooms with those people in order to facilitate discussions then I will do so.  </p> <p>I ask Senators to consider the following.  If we agree that the Portuguese model is a good one then I suggest that we completely remove the amendments to the Bill until those discussions have taken place.</p></speech>

I was very taken by the Minister of State's very passionate argument.  She has made a cogent case.  I am impressed.  I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment and her track record in her own constituency.  She is someone who comes with a long tradition of consultation and engagement in her community.  I want it to put it on record that I have been amazed by her contribution here.  She has come across with passion and conviction.  It is not the usual old script that is read into the record.  I am impressed by the way she has stood up and her understanding of her community.  I held a different view but having listened to the Minister of State that is somewhat changed.  That is important.  It is the job of any Minister to come to the House and make a strong case for his or her argument and I thank her for doing so.</p> <p>In terms of future plans and timetabling, the Minister of State has stated that she wants to bring forward legislation.  When will that happen?  We need to strike a balance because what Senator Ruane has said is also true.  That is the dichotomy and the dilemma we are faced with but there is a will to do something.  Can the Minister of State reassure us by telling us when the Portuguese model will be rolled out?  What about the four acute detox beds?  What is she going to do about that?  She is the Minister of State.  Can she give me and the Seanad an undertaking that this will be her No. 1 priority next week?  In two weeks' time what if I call the Minister of State back to the House and ask her, "What have you done about the four detox beds?"  She made the valid point that people who wish to be rehabilitated have nowhere to go and there is no further progression for them.  I want to hear about timescales and timeframes.  Has she enough resources and money to provide services?  There is also the issues of the detox beds and rehabilitation.  Two valid arguments have been made here.  I would be inclined to support the Minister of State is she can convince us in terms of the timeframe being within a matter of weeks, rather than months.</p></speech>

I withdraw my amendment on the basis that I shall resubmit it tomorrow on Report Stage.  Therefore, I give the Minister of State 24 hours to consider my amendment.</p> <p>I am a bit taken aback by Fianna F&aacute;il's suggestion that unnamed community groups are jumping up and down because they have been upset by this proposal.  That is not the case for the groups that I have dealt with such as Citywide, the USI and Peter McVerry.  The political parties in both Houses have changed their position all of the time such as the Green Party, People Before Profit and AAA.  Also, the justice committee of these Houses, as indicated by the Minister of State herself, also supports this position.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not convinced that we will have this conversation at a later stage because the legislation was also supposed to include the provision for medically-supervised injection centres and that measure has been separated from the Bill.  I do not accept the suggestion either that the Bill is a response to what is happening in the north inner city because the Bill is before us is a reaction a year later to the High Court case of March 2015.  I do not accept the suggestion that the Bill is motivated by the recent murder spree in the north inner city because it is a response to a legislative need arising, as I indicated, from a High Court ruling.  It is not acceptable to constantly state we can have the conversation some other time.</p><p>I got support from the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues in Cabinet in the previous Government.  The Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, was very supportive of the idea to have injection centres.  The initiative was passed by the Cabinet and was to be included in the Bill before the House but it has been separated and we will have to deal with it another time.  The Minister of State indicated the Bill would be likely to come before us in the autumn.  She said we would deal with decriminalisation at some other stage.  There were 679 drug and alcohol-related deaths in 2013.  Addicts have very limited access in terms of having a voice.  What Senator Ruane, Senator Black and others have said is that it is surely a humane approach - that in the cold light of day in a courtroom situation, it should be a defence for somebody to admit to being an addict and that he or she is in possession of drugs because of the addiction.  I am sure any prosecuting garda, judge or jury would be able to make a determination that the nature of the addiction is a reasonable defence for the individual.</p><p>To reinforce what we have always done because we have always done it does not stand up to scrutiny.  I will press the amendment on Report Stage tomorrow.  I urge the Minister of State to reflect on her position between now and then.  I also ask those Members who have spoken against the amendment to think again about it and perhaps to re-engage with people who know what they are talking about.  I mentioned the CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign, Fr. Peter McVerry, and the report that was done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.  USI has again come out in favour of the decriminalisation of drug use.  We are not resiling from the ideal of a drug-free society.  That is absolutely not the case, but what we want is for it to be realised that somebody with an addiction needs help, support, compassion and medical attention, and does not need to be sitting in a courtroom or have a criminal conviction because of the nature of his or her medical need.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-06-29a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1421" speakername="James Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016062900002#W00200"><p>I listened carefully to the previous speaker and he has removed some of the reason for me to speak, but only temporarily.  I was going to ask the Senators to withdraw the amendments given the fact that the vast majority of people in this Chamber are in agreement that this is a health issue and we do need to decriminalise it, but that in order to achieve that it requires a comprehensive piece of legislation and we cannot just do it as an amendment to the Bill.  As I already outlined, there are all the other parts of it that the Portuguese have put in place that we do not have in place.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the terrible tragedy of the deaths of which Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has spoken and the fact that behind each of those individuals lies a real person and a family bereaved and distressed and a community suffering loss, there must be a real organised approach to the issue.  Accepting the amendment today will not bring any of those people back or prevent any more deaths from occurring unless it is supported by the ancillary issues I have already mentioned in terms of how to deal with people when they are caught in possession and how to help steer them away and keep them out of the criminal system.  Some addicts will become drug pushers, not the big noises, but there is a chain and we must start somewhere within that chain.  I concur with everyone in this Chamber who said this is a health problem and it should be treated as such, that people should be supported to get off drugs and they should not be criminalised for being an addict.  I fully agree with that but we must do it in an organised fashion and in a way that will work and will deliver and will not create more problems for us.</p> <p>The approach of the Minister of State is correct.  I ask the Senators to consider withdrawing the amendments on Report Stage as well, given the fact that the Minister of State has undertaken to come back to us in the autumn for a debate which will result in comprehensive legislation to address the issue and to provide the infrastructure that is required.  I again commend the Minister of State.</p></speech>

The amendments tabled will cause problems in terms of taking action against any pusher if the amendments, as tabled, are adopted.  I am coming purely from a legal perspective.  If accepted, the amendments would cause legal technicalities to arise and that must be taken into account as well.  The Minister of State has given a commitment to come back to the House at the earliest possible date with a more comprehensive package.  We must also ensure we have comprehensive structures put in place to deal with the situation.</p></speech>

Does Senator Devine wish me to tell her now, tomorrow, next week or the week after that there will be four new detox beds in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital?  I cannot do that, but I will give a commitment that I will do everything I can within my role as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy to make sure that we make rehabilitation and detox beds very much part of the national drugs strategy and to increase the number of beds.  There is no point in us bringing people through a process of working in the community with drug addiction, bringing in counsellors and project workers and trying to co-ordinate the area of substance misuse if when people come out the other end there is nowhere for them to go.  It is not adequate to have only a small amount of detox beds and that is something on which I will give my personal commitment.  I do not have a chequebook but I give my personal commitment that I will come back to the House on the issue.</p> <p>The public consultation will be announced near the end of July and people will have an opportunity to feed into the national drugs strategy.  Then it will go back to the commission and when the national drugs strategy is being formulated, people will also have a chance to look at it and to contribute to it.</p> <p>In response to Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, ten years ago when I was spokesperson on the drugs strategy for Fine Gael in opposition, one of the key points I made was about medically-supervised injection centres.  That has not gone off the radar.  It is there.  The Bill is coming in the autumn and we will ensure it will happen.  I will not give the Senator a commitment on a date, for example, that we will open a project on 31 December but I will give a commitment that in 2017 if I am still in this position I will prioritise and push for the establishment of medically-supervised injection centres because they work.  They have been shown to work in various countries around the world.  The issue has not gone off the radar.  Is Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in going to withdraw the amendment?</p></speech>
