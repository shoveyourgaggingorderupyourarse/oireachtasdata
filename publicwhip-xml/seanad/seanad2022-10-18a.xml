    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-18a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022101800002#A00600"><p>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for affording me the opportunity to address the need for a domestic violence register in the country.  I appreciate the Minister's taking the time to come to the Chamber to respond to this important Commencement matter.</p> <p>Saturday, 1 October should have been Jennifer Poole's 26th birthday.  She was a lovely, vivacious young woman with two young children.  Very sadly her life was taken from her in April last year and this certainly should not have happened.  At the recent Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, Jennifer's brother, Jason, joined Deputy O'Callaghan and me to talk about the horrific trauma his family suffered, not just with the loss of Jennifer's life and the way her life was taken in just seven minutes in a brutal and vicious way, but the fact that Jennifer was taken from her family by a former partner who was known for domestic violence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The main reason we had this conversation was to try to ensure a register of domestic abuse offenders could be set up.  Jennifer was a strong woman.  She had a previous relationship where sadly, she was subjected to domestic violence.  She would have been very nervous of knowingly going into another relationship with someone who had a pattern of domestic abuse, but she did not know.  Her former partner said he had been living in Spain for two years.  Sadly, as her family found out later, she was subjected to domestic abuse, but had the strength, power and courage to leave her situation.  This brings up so much for so many women and indeed for many men.  Many choices have to be made and some people ultimately make the choice to stay in a relationship.  Jennifer gathered her courage and wherewithal to ensure this man left her home but in a moment of vulnerability, she allowed him back in because he said he needed access to a warm shower.  In the time after Jennifer's death one of the most difficult aspects of the case came to light - that her murderer had been jailed for more than two years for attacking his former partner with a knife.  If a domestic violence register was in place in the same way as a sexual abuse register, there is no doubt but that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Jennifer would have been aware of his past and she would never have entered a relationship in this situation.  It is clear we need a domestic violence register.  It is absolutely something we need to implement.</p><p>Sadly as we know, violence against women is an epidemic in this country.  In 2021 Women's Aid reported 28,096 disclosures of abuse and 96% of those supported on the freefone helpline were women.  In the aftermath of the brutal death of Ashling Murphy, the women of Ireland came together in solidarity with the Murphy family.  Many of us attended vigils outside Leinster House and around the country.  The hurt, anger and sorrow was palpable and the Minister has put many measures in place since.  She has doubled the number of places in refuges and we need to go further than that.  We need to look at a number of areas but what Jason Poole has highlighted is an important issue.  </p><p>At the time of Ashling Murphy's death, I stood here in this very spot and said, "As a person, I am horrified; as an aunt and friend to young women, I am frightened; as a woman, I am furious, but as a legislator, I am determined to respond."</p><p>That is what this Commencement matter is about.  It is about responding, raising awareness and protecting those who need to be protected, so I ask the Minister what the Department will do to establish a domestic violence register and what the Department is doing to support local garda&iacute; to deal with domestic violence cases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-18a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022101800002#B00200"><p>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin for tabling this issue specifically and more generally raising the issue of domestic violence and the work we are doing collectively to respond to it.  We can all agree it is an issue that has not had the attention or focus it should have had for many years, but that is changing.  While I will respond on a number of different fronts to the Senator's questions, I will say from the outset, having met Jason Poole and discussed the tragic circumstances of his sister's death - she was a beautiful young woman who should not have been killed in the way she was - I have asked this to be examined as a priority and that is ongoing.</p> <p>In response to the Senator's last question about how we are supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and how we are responding to this issue more generally, I published our most ambitious strategy to date on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence at the beginning of June this year.  It is a whole-of-government strategy and is based very clearly on the four key pillars, namely, prevention, protection, prosecution and policy co-ordination.  I assure this House and anyone else listening that our zero tolerance strategy is not the end achievement to our work in this area; it is just the start.</p> <p>We hosted European counterparts last month at the Council of Europe ministerial conference on violence against women, and I explained to some of my colleagues exactly what we mean by "zero tolerance".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It means ensuring that strategies aimed at preventing and combating violence against women also address the specific role of men and boys in preventing violence.  Zero tolerance means greater education and greater awareness to change attitudes and to teach respect from an early age.  It means teaching our children equality, respect and healthy sexuality, again making sure that it is done in an age appropriate way.  It means supporting victims with compassion and with care when they come forward and when they take what is an extremely brave step in coming forward and seeking help.  It means effective training for all relevant professionals, including our medical professions, our legal professions, our doctors, our nurses, our Judiciary and so many others, in particular our garda&iacute;.  It means recognising the importance of long-term and systematic changes that need to happen and that is why there is a huge amount of structural changes happening within Government in terms of where services in the future will be provided and the establishment of a domestic violence agency.</p><p>It also means having robust legislation in place and Senator O'Loughlin mentioned the fact that the individual in question had served time for a previous offence against a partner.  To make sure that we have effective sentencing, what I brought forward the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022 is an increase in the maximum sentence of assault causing harm from five years to ten years, and it passed through the Second Stage last week.  We have seen too many cases where victims have had bones broken and where, as I mentioned before, sugar and boiling water thrown over them and where they have been stabbed, but the sentence has not been high enough because the bar has not been high enough.  We need to make sure those options are there for the Judiciary.  It also means making sure we tackle human trafficking and sexual exploitation.</p><p>The fundamental weapon we have in combating domestic violence is prevention.  It is the core pillar on which our strategy is built but it is prevention that is in mind today when we talk about this topic.  When Jason Poole talks about a register, it is with prevention in mind.  We cannot change what has happened to Jennifer, unfortunately, but we can make sure insofar as we possibly can that this does not happen to another person, to another young woman.  That is obviously what we all want to achieve here.</p><p>As I mentioned, setting up a domestic violence register was something I discussed with Jason Poole when we met earlier this year.  I have spoken to him in the last few days.  We have discussed this with Garda Commissioner Harris.  I have had a number of conversations with the Garda Commissioner and we agreed that it should be included in the third national strategy as a priority for in-depth analysis and consideration.  As Senator O'Loughlin will know, it is a key action in the strategy published in June.  I have continued to engage with the Garda Commissioner on this matter, as recently as last week, and I am awaiting a report on this matter.  It is important that I do not move ahead on something without understanding how it works in other jurisdictions, how it might possibly work here and the views and potential approaches of the people who are due to implement it.  Simply importing a model from another jurisdiction with a different constitutional arrangement to our own, where we have a written Constitution and judicial oversight of the Oireachtas in our work on enacting legislation, runs a risk of potential challenges and also that it might not work in the same way.  While there is a register in some areas of the UK, we have to look at how that would potentially work here.  We do not want something to be challenged.</p><p>We also have other complications around the fact that we have European General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, legislation that we need to comply with.  We need to ensure there is no situation where a person could be falsely identified.  All of these things have to be thought through.  However, I stress there should never be a situation where someone's personal privacy overrides another person's right to be safe.  I have always had that to the forefront of anything I do.</p><p>The Department of Justice is funding the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and the National Women&rsquo;s Council to undertake research to identify and address issues arising from the interface between civil and criminal courts, where there might be a criminal trial happening where a person has attacked a partner and where there might be a civil trial happening where they are then seeking access to a child and maintenance.  I am informed that the question of a register has been raised in that draft report and once I get that report and the report from the garda&iacute;, we will see how the two could potentially work together.  Instead of replicating something that might work in the courts, we will look how we could maybe merge the two together.</p><p>I reassure Senator O'Loughlin that work is ongoing with the Garda Commissioner and his team and with the specific family justice oversight group and on the work that has been commissioned by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and the National Women's Council of Ireland.  I hope once I get the two of those we will be able to pave a pathway forward.</p></speech>

The helpline number is 1800 341 900.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for her response.  It is important and it is clear that this is a priority for the Minister and the Government given that the Minister is actively looking at setting up a register for those who have committed domestic violence.  I accept that it is simply not good enough to adopt legislation from another jurisdiction because we are very blessed in that we have a Constitution and everything has to be constitutionally sound.</p> <p>It is really important we keep the pressure on.  Last Saturday was not the first time I heard Jason speak.  Each time I hear him I hear the trauma, sadness and desperation.  It is really important we deliver on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-18a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022101800002#D00200"><p>While this is obviously a key priority for Jason, I know there are many other issues he has been focused on and I am pleased to work with him and many others to make sure we can make those changes.  We have seen an increase in reports and numbers of people going to the Garda reporting domestic violence and sexual offences over the last year.  We can look at that in two ways.  First, unfortunately with Covid-19, there have been new cases as well as an increase in violence across the board.  Second, I see it as a positive in that more people are coming forward.</p> <p>The whole focus of so much of what we are doing is that we can encourage people to come forward where they are victims, separate from prevention which is absolutely key, and that when people do come forward that as many measures as possible are in place through the criminal justice system and the courts system in support from individuals who come into contact with victims and survivors.  It is just one part of a wider puzzle that would help and hopefully support people to get themselves out of difficult situations or to prevent them from getting into potentially very critical situations.  This is a priority for me and something I will continue to work on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-18a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022101800002#D00400"><p>Go raibh maith agat, Acting Chairperson.  I fully agree with your sentiments in welcoming Finola to the Public Gallery.  Finola is the spokesperson for the Irish Thalidomide Association and it is fitting and appropriate that she should be in the House today to hear the response from the Minister.  Two weeks ago tomorrow in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the Lower House, the Taoiseach responded to a question from Deputy Bacik based on the "Scannal" documentary which had been broadcast the night before.  It laid bare the facts of the effect that the thalidomide drug has had on people in this country.  </p> <p>There are four women who are in their 90s and who have survived.  They took the drug through no fault of their own.  The drug was removed from the market 61 years ago next month.  Even though it had been removed internationally, it was not removed in a timely manner in Ireland.  There are four issues here that need to be responded to.  First, it needs to be acknowledged by the Government that it did not act in a timely manner in terms of removing the drug and the consequences thereafter were as a result of this delay.  Once the knowledge was available, the drug should have been removed instantaneously, as happened in other countries.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That should have been removed instantaneously as was the case in other countries.  The second thing that needs to happen is that there needs to be a State apology delivered by the Taoiseach in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, similar to other apologies that have happened in the context of other victims who were let down by the State.  The third thing that needs to happen is negotiations need to happen immediately with the survivors to put in place an appropriate healthcare package that will deal with their needs going forward.  There are just under 30 people who the State acknowledge have been damaged long term and permanently as a result of their mothers taking this drug.  The fourth thing that needs to happen relates to the approximately 12 people internationally who have had an expert opinion that they have been affected as a result of this drug, and that needs to be acknowledged by the State.  That would bring the number up to 40.</p><p>There are four asks, and they are clear.  The first one is an acknowledgment in the first instance.  The second is an apology, which everybody across the political divide appreciates needs to happen.  The third is the compensation package in terms of healthcare supports and appropriate compensation needs and again, this is accepted across the political divide.  The fourth relates to the remaining women who have not had an acknowledgement from the State that this drug has caused them the problems they have, even though irrefutable international evidence from renowned experts supports their case and indicates that this has happened.  They are very simple asks.  Court cases have been ongoing for the bones of a decade and they should not be ongoing.  Quite frankly, the cost of these ongoing court cases would more than fund the care package that is required and the compensation that is needed.</p><p>The Taoiseach spoke in the D&aacute;il almost two weeks ago.  He gave a commitment that he would be back in touch with Finola Cassidy within two weeks.  That two weeks will be up tomorrow, so this Commencement matter is timely.  In the first instance, it reminds the Taoiseach of his commitment.  I know that he is an honourable person and that he will follow up on it.  It also reminds the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and the Department that this scandal has been ongoing for a decade and that it needs to be resolved.  Next month will be 61 years since this drug was removed from the shelves of Irish pharmacists and yet the consequences are still ongoing.  The people have not been compensated.  The people have not had an acknowledgement or an apology.  I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</p></speech>

I am sure that the Senator will appreciate that because a number of cases concerning thalidomide are before the High Court, it is not possible to comment on matters that are <i>sub judice</i>.  However, the Government recognises that thalidomide survivors face very real challenges in everyday life in the context of their injuries.</p><p>I am glad to inform the House that the Minister met with members of the Irish Thalidomide Association in February.  At that meeting, he listened to their health concerns and assured them of the Government's commitment to provide thalidomide survivors with the necessary health supports to meet their related needs.  The HSE has designated a senior manager to liaise with Irish thalidomide survivors and assist them in accessing health and personal social services.  Following the meeting with the association, the HSE thalidomide liaison commenced a process to develop recommendations for future planning and pathways for survivors&rsquo; healthcare needs now and into the future.</p><p>The recommendations will also inform the work that is already under way in the Department of Health to place the provision of these health and personal social supports on a statutory footing, as committed to by the Government.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Since 1975, the Government has provided financial assistance to each Irish thalidomide survivor, including an <i>ex gratia</i>lump sum and an <i>ex gratia</i>monthly allowance for life.  The annual figure for the Irish monthly payments ranges from &euro;6,175 to &euro;13,313 for each individual.  As the Senator said, there are currently 29 Irish people in receipt of these supports from the Department of Health.  Irish survivors are also eligible for monthly payments and a range of annual special payments from the Contergan Foundation, which is established under German legislation.  Both the German payments and the Irish <i>ex gratia</i>monthly payments made to survivors are exempt from tax, including deposit interest retention tax, and are not assessable as means for the purpose of Department of Social Protection payments.  Each survivor is also eligible for a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means.  In addition, survivors are eligible for aids and appliances, equipment, housing adaptations and access to the full range of primary care and hospital and personal social services.<br/><br/>It is also important to note that the German Contergan Foundation has confirmed that since 2013, it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide-related injury.  It is open to any Irish person to apply to the foundation for assessment of his or her disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that his or her injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government, commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors.  I assure the House that the Irish Government is committed to the continued support of the health and personal social service needs of Irish thalidomide survivors to enable them to live independent lives.<br/><br/>The Senator mentioned four issues, one of which was that the drug was not removed in a timely manner and the Government should have acted at that time.  The Senator has called for a State apology in the D&aacute;il.  He also stressed the need for negotiations with survivors to ensure an appropriate healthcare package to continue.  He also said that 12 further people have received expert opinions that they have also been affected by thalidomide.  He asked for them to be included in the State's response to bring the number of cases that require acknowledgment to 40.  I will bring those details to the Minister and will try to get the Senator a response as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

These people, sadly, do not have an enormous amount of time left.</p> <p>I know what is involved in organising a State apology.  It needs to happen soon.  There needs to be an acknowledgement that the State was wrong and acted in an inappropriate way by not removing the drug.  Those things both need to happen quickly.</p> <p>In respect of compensation, while I accept what the Minister of State has outlined in his reply, an awful lot more needs to be done.  These people's lives have been impacted, and very seriously in some cases.  They have not been adequately compensated at all.

We need to urgently resolve the situation of the 12 people in this country who are suffering and are not being recognised by the State.</p> <p>As time goes on, people's lives move forward.  We are dealing with elderly people.  We are dealing with 40 people who are struggling on a daily basis because of thalidomide.  I ask the Minister of State to make a call to the Taoiseach's office to remind him and his officials of the commitment he made in the D&aacute;il two week ago.  The timeline outlined then expires tomorrow.  I have no doubt but that the Taoiseach will want to honour his commitment.

Right now, the same staff are trying to keep their social housing targets on track while also having to share time to keep their affordable housing projects up to speed.  Clearly, this is neither ideal nor sustainable.  I will set out the context for what we are dealing with in Limerick so the Minister of State will understand the extent of the housing emergency.  Homelessness figures have gone up to 10,805, including 3,220 children, throughout the State.  The number of homeless children in need of emergency accommodation in the mid-west last August saw a 251% increase in the same period last year.</p><p>Rents are rising.  The figure for Limerick is &euro;1,400, which is way above housing assistance payment, HAP, limits.  I took a look at <i>daft.ie</i>today.  Just seven properties are available on <i>daft.ie</i>, three of which are completely out of the price range of any normal family.  The HAP allowance is just &euro;650 for a couple with one child but a two-bedroom apartment will cost them &euro;1,500 per month.  The HAP allowance for a single person is just &euro;420 but a studio apartment in Limerick will cost him or her &euro;1,300 per month, so there is no reality when it comes to the allowances and the soaring cost of rents in Limerick.  We are running out of options for emergency accommodation.  Indeed the homeless action teams have told us this.  We also have the phenomenon of adult children stuck living their adult lives with their parents.</p><p>I think the Minister of State will agree with me that Limerick City and County Council has a huge task on its hands.  Looking at the targets towards which it is working, approved homes are at 42% of the five-year target of 2,138 new homes.  In other words, the council has a deficit of 1,247.  I understand the focus for this year and next year is to acquire more land and gain more approvals to ensure the targets are met, but frankly, the council is nowhere near being able to do that as things stand.  Again, the targets are particularly poor in some areas.  In Castleconnell, where I live, there are 443 applicants and the current plan is for five new social or council houses.  That is an appalling target.</p><p>We need significant additional resources within Limerick City and County Council to deal with this.  An application was submitted to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for funding for a dedicated affordable housing team in March 2022.  It begs the following question.  In the middle of a housing emergency, how long does it take the Department to make an approval?  I heard from my colleague Councillor Sharon Benson today that, coincidentally, the council received a decision today regarding additional new staff.</p><p>Why has it taken seven months to make a simple decision to add resources to Limerick City and County Council?  Furthermore, I understand the council made a request initially for 12 additional staff and then reduced it to ten, but what has been granted by the Government is just staffing of four, of which two are already in place, so after seven months of waiting, the decision of the Government is to add just two additional staff members.  The Minister of State should bear in mind that once that funding is approved, as it apparently was this morning, we are probably looking at a further six months to advertise and interview and for people to give notice and actually fill those positions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It has taken more than a year, during the worst housing emergency we have ever seen, for a decision to be made and for the relative follow-up to happen.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Housing for All plan is not working.  Overall targets for new social and affordable homes are falling short throughout the country, and that is no wonder.  If every other council is waiting on resources just like that in Limerick, the national targets will continue to be missed.</p></speech>

In September 2021, the Government published its Housing for All strategy, which sets out plans to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 homes per annum over the next decade.  Increasing the supply of affordable housing is a central element of Housing for All, with an ambition to deliver more than 55,000 new affordable and cost-rental homes in the period 2022 to 2030, with 28,730 of those homes being delivered over the next five years.</p> <p>Housing for All is supported by a major investment package of more than &euro;4 billion per annum through an overall combination of &euro;12 billion in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5 billion in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5 billion in funding through the Housing Finance Agency.  With the support of the housing delivery co-ordination office in the Local Government Management Agency, the Department undertook a review of the requirements for affordable housing staff resources in 18 local authorities with an identified strong demand for housing from households with an affordability constraint.  Limerick City and County Council was one of those councils. </p> <p>The housing delivery co-ordination office undertook a detailed analysis with each local authority to assess its existing housing delivery capacity and skill set and identified any additional staffing requirements, having regard to the level of affordable housing to be delivered in that local authority.  Key consideration has been given to the type of structure and administrative or professional staff necessary to deliver affordable housing, the scale of the delivery programmes and alignment with the additional support provided for social housing delivery earlier in 2022.  The staffing required and identified for Limerick is divided into both administrative and professional staffing grades and a higher requirement in most areas for administrative support is acknowledged due to the operation of the various schemes in terms of agreements, engagement with eligible applicants and other, longer term requirements. </p> <p>Limerick City and County Council has developed a housing delivery action plan to underpin its delivery of social, affordable-purchase and cost-rental housing in the period to 2026.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage recently approved an application by Limerick City and County Council for funding of &euro;1.8 million for 25 affordable homes in Castletroy, Limerick, under the affordable housing fund, which will be delivered in 2023.  An application is ongoing with Limerick City and County Council for a dedicated homes team, notice of which the Senator received today.  I have no doubt that any additional staff Limerick City and County Council receives will help expedite its efforts to deliver new affordable homes in key locations throughout the city and wider county.</p></speech>

Moreover, why has that decision been taken to appoint just two additional staff given Limerick City and County Council requested a team of ten, given it has been well acknowledged that the council, like so many other councils, is way behind its targets and given it has also been acknowledged that the Government is way behind its targets?  Indeed, its target this year for social and affordable housing was 9,200 homes but at the halfway point it had delivered just 1,966.  Similarly, its target for affordable housing was 2,100 but it had reached fewer than 700 by the halfway point of the year.</p> <p>With the crisis getting worse month by month, how can the Minister of State explain the seven-month delay in appointing essential staff for the council, and where does this leave the people of Limerick, who are already in despair at the housing crisis?  Are we looking at a future of adult children living adult lives in their parents' homes?  Is that the best the Government can offer?</p></speech>

We are almost approaching the figure of 9,000 new social units having been added, which will be the key to resolving so many housing issues for our citizens, and we are on course to build in excess of 25,000 homes this year, which will meet our target.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That will be critical in implementing the Housing for All strategy.

I tabled this matter in order to ask the Government to consider increasing the income threshold for housing assistance supports from the current rate of &euro;30,000 for a family in band 3 - which includes those in my county of Mayo - to &euro;50,000.  I have tabled this matter on foot of a motion that was passed by councillors in Mayo calling for just that.  We have been looking for this for a very long time.  It is quite obvious that the income thresholds that are currently in place are extremely low.  There are three bands, with &euro;30,000 as the upper limit in a county like Mayo.  It goes up above &euro;40,000 in Dublin.  That is still extremely low by any standard.  It essentially precludes low-income working families and households from accessing social housing supports.  We need to change this.  We need to make sure social housing is available for many more people.  We know the demand and the need is there.  I do not think there is any public representative in this country who does not know about the need to expand the threshold and increase the income limits.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.  I know there is a review ongoing in the Department on this issue.  I would welcome an update that I might pass on to my colleagues on Mayo County Council.</p></speech>

I also thank her council colleagues for putting forward such a timely motion, which is very important to ensure that people have access to secure housing.</p> <p>A standard system for assessing applicants for social housing support was introduced in 2011.  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  Housing for All was published in September 2021 and contained a commitment to reviewing income eligibility for social housing.  The review has been completed and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has recently approved implementation of its recommendations.  The review is now available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p> <p>On foot of the review, the Minister has approved proposals to scope and develop options for a revised or new social housing income eligibility model.  The exercise will assess the suitability of the current framework, having regard to the significantly changed landscape since it was introduced, and will make recommendations for an approach and income thresholds for Mayo and all other counties that reflect current and future needs.  This work will commence shortly under the aegis of the Housing Agency, which will be tasked with commissioning it.  It is expected that the work will be completed in the first quarter of 2023.</p> <p>Pending its completion, the Minister has also approved changes to the social housing income eligibility bands for five local authorities, namely, Carlow, Clare, Galway county, Laois and Westmeath.  These counties have been moved from band 3 to band 2 of the income eligibility framework.  Accordingly, the baseline income eligibility threshold for these areas has increased from &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000.  The change reflects the significant movement in rents in these areas in recent years and ensures local authority areas with similar accommodation costs will continue to be grouped together in the respective bands.  The changes came into effect on 1 October last.  The Minister believes it is now appropriate to await completion of the substantive review before deciding on the revised income threshold levels for Mayo and other counties, given the potential impact of any changes that will arise.</p></speech>

In Mayo, for example, the income eligibility threshold being down at &euro;25,000 and &euro;30,000 between a single person and a family is extremely low.  When looking for a three-bedroom property three or four years ago, a person could reasonably expect to get one to rent for in the region of &euro;700 or &euro;800.  Now it is about &euro;1,400.  This has just happened in the past three or four years.  The increase in rent in the last number of years in a county such as Mayo has been absolutely phenomenal.  If one checks <i>daft.ie</i>or other rental websites or local auctioneers on any given day, one will find in the region of 20 properties to rent in total for the entire county.<br/><br/>I completely support the call by councillors and the county councils to increase the income thresholds to a level that includes people who are working but are on lower incomes.  The fact that we have a housing support system in place that effectively precludes anybody who has a job and is working is not good for society, it is not good for mixed tenure development, and it is not good for the way local authorities operate.  We are getting this directly from local elected members who are on the ground and working in this space.  They know the housing need in their areas.  The councillors in Mayo know the housing need in the area and they have made a direct request to the Minister of State, the Minister and the Government to address that deficit.  I ask the Minister of State now that we would have a little bit more detail as to when the review and the recommendations will be implemented.  When will we see a direct correlation between that and the actual supports being available on the ground?</p></speech>

I will raise it with the Minister.  When speaking last night in the debate on RT&Eacute;1, the Minister committed to having the review before the end of the year.  I will communicate this to him and to the Housing Agency, which is under the aegis of the Department, to speed up that review.  I really do appreciate that so many citizens are caught in a trap of not being able to access housing and government supports, which are so vital for them to sustain a tenancy.  This is very important.  We really do need to ensure that this report is expedited insofar as possible.  We will work to do that.  I will talk to the Minister, on foot of what the Senators has said, in order to see if we can get it completed before the end of the year.  I really do appreciate the urgency.  As I travel around the country, this issue is raised by many councillors on a weekly basis.</p></speech>

I agree with the Order of Business, as outlined by the Leader of the House.  There are a number of issues to raise.  I express my concern at the apparent disappearance of Elnaz Rekabi, who then re-appeared on Instagram a number of days later.  She is the Iranian rock climber who was pictured competing in one of the rock climbing events without her hijab or headscarf and later could not be found.  Her passport had apparently been confiscated.  A number of days later, she appeared on Instagram apologising for the unintentional non-wearing of the headscarf.  It is deeply concerning, along with other young women continuing to lose their lives in the Iranian protests.  This happened to a young 33-year-old woman competing for and representing her country at an international competition.  After public outcry, thankfully, she appears to be alive and appears to be well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We do not really know what happened in the intervening period, which is deeply concerning.<br/><br/>I reiterate my call that Ireland, as a member of the UN Security Council, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, who has direct contact with the Iranian ambassador to Ireland and the Iranian foreign minister, continue to call for full and transparent disclosure of all those who have lost their lives, for the Iranian authorities to desist in the use of force against peaceful protestors and, of course, for the full human rights of women in Iran to be enforced and protected as a given and that they not have to dress as per the demands of the dictatorship that is enforcing those rules.<br/><br/>On a more positive topic, I attended the opening of the specialist menopause clinic at the Rotunda Hospital this morning.  It is the fourth such clinic to open in the country in the past year.  By the end of this year, we will have gone from zero menopause clinics to six fully operational specialist clinics.  The country is unrecognisable today in how it treats women's healthcare compared even with five years ago.  We have made huge progress on this.  I commend the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, the health service, the Rotunda Hospital and the healthcare professionals who are providing this much needed service.  It is long overdue and it is fantastic to see it in operation.  Women of my generation have access now to much more information than was the case in the past.<br/><br/>I acknowledge that Ireland launched the first ever national menopause awareness campaign on Friday last.  There is a brand-new Government website, <i>gov.ie/en/campaigns/menopause</i>, on which women can find all the information they need about symptoms and where they can get help and treatment.  That was not there for my mother's generation or the generations who went before.  I understand from speaking to menopause campaigners that we are the first country in the world to have a national menopause awareness campaign.  I have spoken to campaigners in the UK, US, New Zealand and Australia and they are asking how we did this because they want to replicate it.  It is great to see Ireland leading the way on this.</p></speech>

We were told about the possible constitutional challenges and the unseen legal advice and given warnings landlords would exit the sector.  Landlords are already exiting the sector.  The ban is being introduced now simply because there is no emergency accommodation left in this city or, indeed, in other parts of the country.  Why is the ban being delayed until November instead of being implemented now?  I ask that when the legislation is introduced, the ban be applied retrospectively.</p><p>I raise this issue because I am dealing with a family - I am sure all Senators are dealing with similar situations - made up of a mother and her four children aged seven, six and twins aged three.  They were due to be evicted at the end of September but were given an extra month to the end of October.  Their landlord died a number of months ago and the relatives want to sell the property.  This family will not benefit from the eviction that is being introduced in November because they must be gone by the end of this month.</p><p>We have asked Dublin City Council about availing of the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme for the family.  There are all sorts of regulations and red tape associated with it.  Unfortunately, the council is of the view it cannot buy the house in question because it deems it substandard.  This means a mother and four children will, in effect, be homeless at the end of this month, notwithstanding that the eviction ban will start the following day.  My sincere plea is that the ban be brought forward.  It is long overdue and its introduction by the Minister is very welcome.  We need to see it brought into force without delay.</p><p>Some weeks ago, I raised the issue of security workers.  This was supposed to be a good news story, whereby 16,000 of them had negotiated a pay deal with the vast majority of employers in the sector and the Minister had signalled his willingness to sign off on the wage agreement.  However, an injunction was taken out on 24 August.  All these weeks later, the State has failed to enter any defence against that injunction.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We know a separate court matter is being taken in November regarding the constitutionality of the security employment regulation order.  When that goes to court, however, it will be put off for another six months or more.  All the while, we have very low-paid security workers in this country who are only getting a tiny pay increase and who the State is not standing up for.  There is a very serious issue involved.</p><p>We have been told by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and by the relevant Minister that confidential conversations are going on in the background.  For these security workers, nothing is happening.  Like everybody else, they are in a cost-of-living crisis.  For anybody talking about how we need to support low-paid workers, the State is not standing behind the pay deal on which it almost signed off.  We need to see some action from the Minister.</p></speech>

It was a great disappointment that last Friday in Galway, while at a very positive event with Genesys opening its new office at Bonham Quay in the heart of the city, word began to filter through that An Bord Plean&aacute;la had decided not to defend the legal action being taken against the Galway city ring road.  There are questions on a range of issues here, but particularly our planning laws and An Bord Plean&aacute;la itself.</p> <p>As Senators will have read in the newspapers, and this is hard to believe, the board admitted in its letter that it was not aware at its final meeting that a new climate action plan 2021 had been adopted four days previously on 4 November 2021.  How it could not be aware is one thing that is hard to fathom and believe.  The fact that a mistake or oversight, if that is what it was, by An Bord Plean&aacute;la could - but hopefully will not - scupper a project that has been worked on for years in Galway is another matter.</p> <p>This is only the latest incarnation of the road project.  Work commenced on the original project as far back as 1999.  Therefore, we are being left behind other cities like Cork, Limerick and Dublin where both road infrastructure and other infrastructure is powering ahead or has at least seen adequate development.</p> <p>The original bypass project was a road project only.  This incarnation of the Galway city ring road was part of the Galway transportation strategy.  A power of work had been done by the city and county councils combined with the democratic support of the local authorities and council members to progress this project as part of the transportation strategy.</p> <p>Only in the last number of weeks, the cross-city bus link project has gone to planning.  We see work going ahead on the new pedestrian cycle bridge at the salmon weir and other projects that are planned within the city.  We have also seen improvements in other areas and plans for a new greenway for Moycullen that will aid and reduce the pressure on the city.  However, we are still in limbo in terms of the next stages.  Thankfully, the county council on behalf of the city council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland stated that it is confident that the issues arising can be resolved and, as a result, intends to continue to progress the delivery of the Galway city ring road.</p> <p>The people of Galway cannot be treated in this manner.  Whether it was an oversight or a mistake by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I hope it this does not scupper a vital project for Galway city.  I have said before that we need a debate on the whole area of planning.  The Government is looking at its planning laws but we have a situation where we cannot allow planning and decisions to be drawn out year after year and, indeed, for decades when it comes to infrastructure in Galway city.  Galway deserves better, and we need better.</p></speech>

My letter questioned why there were two very similar tenders in the marketplace.  The first detailed tender issued in June and closed on 31 August.  The second tender, which seemed to be for the same job, required less expertise and closed recently.</p> <p>In my letter, I questioned how these tenders would be adjudicated on given that we have no aviation expertise within the Department of Transport despite this being a key recommendation of the air accident investigation unit, AAIU.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

It was provided only to entities who passed Stage 1 of the process ... Your possession of that document is a cause for serious concern. Consequently, officials from this Department, at my request, have consulted the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Office of the Attorney General.<br /><br />In order to protect the integrity of the procurement process I wish to ask you: how did you come into possession of this confidential R[equest] F[or] T[ender]?  I also request that you would not read, print, copy or circulate this document to any other third party.  Please delete from your email system any emails or attachments where the R[equest] F[or] T[ender] can be found electronically and destroy any hard copies if any have been made. </blockquote><p>As public representatives, all Members of this House will, from time to time, receive documents and possibly questions which are of concern to members of the public.  I believe we are obliged to bring the concerns of the public to the relevant Minister or Ministers.  That is exactly what I have done.  I have to say I was rather shocked by the intimidating reply from the Secretary General of the Department.<br/><br/>We are living in stressful times.  Nothing is more certain.  The report of the fatal crash of Rescue 116 provides indisputable evidence of a litany of reckless behaviour and failings on the part of the Department of Transport, the Irish Coast Guard and the operator of this vital service.  Changes were recommended.  Equally, our taxpayers need to be protected from decisions which lead to poor value for money.  The Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard have been shown to be lacking in their capacity to remain an intelligent customer for aviation in general and in search and rescue, SAR, in particular.  Yet, instead of complying with the recommendations of the AAIU, they still have no aviation expertise and instead rely on consultants.  The Department can tender for experts to minimise risk but it cannot tender out responsibility.  I am disturbed that any civil servant would be unaware of the Howlin <i>v.</i>Morris judgment on the private papers of Members and would feel he or she could use his or her position to intimidate a Member or a public representative-----</p></speech>

I ask the Secretary General to comply with Article 83 of EU Directive 2014/24/EU and appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications to deal with the substantive issues surrounding the SAR contract.  No Member of the House should be subjected to any form of intimidation.  I take the Cathaoirleach's point on the word &quot;intimidation&quot;, but this is not the first threatening letter I have received from the same Department.  The Secretary General must surely be aware of the Howlin <i>v.</i>Morris judgment and of the fact he cannot compel me to produce any document or to deliver the names of people who have contacted me.  There is a massive amount of concern, not just from me but from those who are interested in providing services to this country, that they are not being dealt with particularly well.

In May 2021 in the convention centre, I raised the issue of the menopause.  I felt a little bit nervous doing so.  We speak about all sorts of other issues, but we had not really spoken about the menopause.  I received a bit of a backlash following that, because certain members of the medical profession felt that perhaps I was blaming them for the experiences women had when they went to their GPs.  While I am certainly not blaming individuals, I am blaming a medical system that let down women for a long time.  We know that 50% of this population experience the menopause, which is nothing to be ashamed of, and 91% of women say they experience symptoms.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to talk about the menopause, and that includes the medical profession.  I am pleased to see that the first menopause clinic has opened and that the Minister for Health has taken on this issue.  It is welcome to see, under this Government, that we are prioritising women's health.  It is welcome we have menopause awareness week.  We must also look at the education system when it comes to any medical professional who has contact with women because the first port of call is the person that one goes to and explains one's symptoms as one actually does not know what is wrong.  Even today, I read a report where someone said their symptoms made them fear they had early onset Alzheimer's disease.  Therefore, the first person one encounters needs to understand fully what the menopause is, to be able to identify it and then say where one needs to go.  We have come a long way but we have not reached where we need to be when it comes to the menopause.  Lastly, people's careers and professions are deeply impacted by the menopause.</p><p>I welcome the decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to admit that it did not take into consideration the climate action plan.  Five months before the decision was made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it knew that the climate Act had passed and that it was a relevant body for the purposes of that Act.  Therefore, it was disingenuous for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to write in a letter that the climate action plan had only been published four days before when it knew its full obligations.</p><p>We must be honest with people that climate action requires us to take steps that are sometimes a little bit uncomfortable.  Many people do not realise that only 3% of the traffic in Galway city tries to get from one side of the city to the other side.  In particular around Galway city, there is no consensus that a road is the best solution and I believe a road would push people even further out of the city, thus increasing sprawl.  For all kinds of reasons a road is not the best approach.  The politicians have probably not been honest with people in Galway for a long time and that is why we are where we are.  Thankfully, progress is being made with public transport and cycling options, in particular for Galway city.  Let us celebrate that progress and advance these initiatives.</p></speech>

First, I, too, welcome the ban on evictions but, like my party leader said in the D&aacute;il today, we need action to be taken now or as soon as possible.  It is safe to say, and it is definitely safe to say on behalf of my party and, I am sure, on behalf of all of the groups on this side of the Chamber, that we stand ready to assist the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and his Government colleagues to ensure the legislation is put through speedily, efficiently and effectively.  Families have come forward to speak about their experience of living in tents, and that shames us all.  We need to get this legislation through as soon as possible for all of the reasons we know.</p> <p>Second, the D&aacute;il will debate a Sinn F&eacute;in motion that seeks to ban energy disconnections and provide crucial protections for pay-as-you-go customers.  Much like my previous commentary, the Government proposal that such a ban would not come into effect until December simply is not good enough.  I ask colleagues to support tonight's motion in the D&aacute;il to ban energy disconnections, not in December, not in November but now when people need it most and when we know people are facing into an already difficult winter across a range of aspects of the cost-of-living crisis.  We know from last night and last week just how cold the nights are getting.</p> <p>Last, I wish to make it known that Belfast City Council has put out a public tender calling on artists to create two life-size or even larger sized statutes of Mary Ann McCracken and Winifred Carney to be located on the grounds of Belfast City Hall.  Anyone familiar with the grounds will know it is a lovely location at which to spend a sunny afternoon eating one's lunch but there are not many women depicted in the form of statues on the grounds.  There are not too many progressives or Irish republicans depicted on the grounds either.

She was an abolitionist and a humanitarian.  Right up until she was in her 80s, she was down at Belfast docks handing out literature opposing the slave trade.  She is a very well-known figure in her own right.</p><p>Winifred Carney was James Connolly's aide-de-camp in the GPO.  She was known as the typist with the Webley.  She stood for Sinn F&eacute;in in the famous 1918 general election in my part of the world, east Belfast.  I have one very quick story if the Cathaoirleach will indulge me.  I remember listening to a talk on the life of Winifred Carney.  She was ordered to leave the GPO by Connolly when he was injured.  He told her to take off her Sam Browne belt in order that she would not be recognised and identified as having taken part as a member of the Citizen's Army.  Connolly ordered her to take off her belt.  Not only did she refuse to leave the GPO garrison and take off the badge, she actually removed the badge and carved her name, Winifred Carney, into it in order that she would definitely be known as having been in the garrison and involved in the Rising.</p><p>The deadline for submissions is 11 November.

I again thank the Leader for writing in and for supporting it.  Unfortunately, I will need to submit a Commencement matter for next two or three weeks until I can get him in the House.</p> <p>It has come to my attention and to the attention of many other Senators that people in direct provision who are employed, no matter how small their job might be, will be required to pay rent.  The Government can make it sound as nice as it wants, but it is still rent that people will have to pay.  Where did this idea come from?  Who is responsible for deciding that people living in direct provision will have to pay rent?  Would anyone here pay rent to live in a system that does not meet their needs?  From speaking to people living in direct provision, I know it is a cruel system.  Basically, all they have is a safe space.  Earlier I spoke to a woman who told me she has to share a bathroom with four other families.  Will we next ask women placed refuges to pay rent?  It is really getting serious when we are asking people living in direct provision to pay rent.  I know it is for those who have a job.</p> <p>It also came to my attention earlier that officials from the International Protection Accommodation Services are going into refugee centres and if people have their papers, they are being asked to move out.  How can people move out of these centres when they have no homes or anywhere else to go to?  We have a major problem that we need to deal with.  The Minister can hide away from it, but we need to get him to come to the House to ask him these questions.  At the end of the day, this is a humanitarian crisis and we should not be asking these people with little or no money to pay rent.</p></speech>

I refer to the Central Bank (Amendment) Bill 2022, which is colloquially known as the "right to be forgotten" Bill.  The aim of the Bill is to ensure that cancer survivors are not denied access to financial products, such as life insurance, due to their past medical history.  This is particularly pertinent for those who might be diagnosed with childhood cancer or cancer in their teenage years.  Research shows that nearly a quarter of cancer survivors have had difficulty accessing financial products in the past.  I hope this Bill will go some way to help reduce their difficulty and allow them go on to lead normal lives into the future.</p> <p>My colleague Senator Gavan will be seconding the Bill.  I propose an amendment that No. 21 on the Order Paper be taken before No. 1.</p></speech>

They are two linked items that give rise to some discrepancies.  The first is the seizing of a mansion in Saggart by the Criminal Assets Bureau from the Mansfields on account of it effectively being owned by Daniel Kinahan.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Second is the announcement yesterday by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, that &euro;2 million sourced from the proceeds of crime is to be invested into community projects.  The use of cash criminal proceeds in this way is to be lauded indeed.  It was from a motion by independent Louth councillors led by Councillor Paddy McQuillan that this brainchild was born.  It is our communities on the ground that suffer due to the selfish action of criminals and it is the people of those communities who should receive every support we can give them to build stronger and safer communities.  Just as we build up our police force to suppress crime, we must also build up our communities to prevent it.  Community projects which foster interconnectivity are an integral part of this.  As this use of liquid criminal proceeds is of obvious benefit, why are we so slow to liquidate other assets?  This seized mansion, which could fetch anywhere between &euro;1 to &euro;2 million, will instead languish on the books of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, or its approved receiver for years, during which time it will be left vacant serving no one and moneys will have to be spent to maintain it and keep it secure.  During the housing crisis, the proceeds from this property could be used to house multiple families or even directly used itself as housing.  Why the delay in accomplishing this?  It is time to have a look at the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and allow the CAB to expedite the sale of criminal assets in order that those proceeds might speedily benefit our communities as well.  Will the Minister for Justice address the House with her opinions on this matter?</p></speech>

The not-so-good news is the delay in publishing the junior certificate results.  Many students did not go into transition year but went on to start the leaving certificate cycle.  They will have been three to four months into the first year of a two-year cycle before they have the results of the junior certificate.  We have heard the excuses and the reasons but they are still not good enough.  For young people to do an exam in early June and not get the results until towards the end of November is really not acceptable and it should never happen again.  It is happening now and there is not a lot we can do about it but it should never happen again.</p> <p>On the good news, I have been campaigning for some time in this House and have met Ministers and spoken publically about the need for the leaving certificate papers to be accessible to people with print disabilities.  They need the papers to be digitally accessible.  It was announced yesterday that the papers would be digitally accessible to the blind and visually impaired community.  I want clarification as to whether this will be for all people with print disabilities, as it should be.  This country is an outlier when it comes to State examination papers being accessible to people with print disabilities.  For many years, they have been accessible in most other European countries so that people who use laptops, iPads and other forms of technology can access their examination papers and enlarge the print with their fingers or with whatever low-vision aids they need.  It is very positive that in June 2023, this facility will be available to people with vision impairments in this country.  It should have happened a long time ago but it is welcome that it has happened.  I commend the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley and the Minister for State, Deputy Madigan, on making it happen because I certainly annoyed them over the last number of months in particular to make this happen.  I want to commend F&eacute;ach, the organisation that represents parents of young people with vision impairments, on its campaigning on this issue and making it happen as well.</p></speech>

It is quite unfair to those students, particularly for those who may be looking at an apprenticeship or at whatever subjects they might be choosing for senior cycle.  We have to ensure that delay does not happen again.</p> <p>I also call for a debate around the planned national research strategy.  While much of the focus will be around structures, there is a serious question regarding the level of support we are giving to our PhD candidates.  Some significant improvements were made in the budget but it did not go far enough.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we are to believe in investment in research in the long term, it is essential that we support those who are pursuing PhDs.  I would like the Leader to invite the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to the House to discuss the research strategy.</p><p>I also want to raise the question of a global crisis that is in many ways often forgotten, given the focus of the news on other parts of the world, namely, the question of Venezuela.  The UN reported this week that since 2015, 7 million citizens have left Venezuela and after Ukraine, this is the biggest migrant crisis in the world.  Approximately 2.5 million people have ended up in Colombia.  They have been the victims of famine and of the economic collapse in that country.  Democracy has been repressed and we have seen political oppression.  It is important that Ireland at UN level does everything that we can in order to seek the restoration of democracy to Venezuela.  I welcome the fact that Venezuela lost its seat on the UN Human Rights Council in the last few weeks, although unfortunately we still see certain countries that have dodgy human rights records, such as China, Cuba and Qatar, sitting on that body.  However, it is important that we use our role at UN  and EU levels to try to ensure that we see democracy restored to Venezuela and that support is provided to those who are migrants from Venezuela, especially from the oppressive political regime that is in place there.</p></speech>

I wish to commend everyone who is involved in relation to this matter.  I formally second that Bill.</p> <p>I want to raise the issue of my village of Castleconnell, because two serious aspects of life in Castleconnell have been highlighted in the last few days.  First, in a village of 2,500 people, we have 443 applicants on the housing waiting list.  That is 443 families and individuals.  The plan right now is to build five council houses between now and 2026.  It is absolutely shocking and what it means is that people really are bereft of hope.  They are paying exorbitant rents of &euro;1,400 per month for substandard three-bedroom accommodation.  A number of people had received eviction notices before the very welcome but belated announcement today.  They are, therefore, facing losing their homes at Christmas.  The fact is that there is so little planning by Governments and by the local authority - I  blame the Government in particular for the lack of funding here - shows just how overlooked the people of Castleconnell have been over the last number of years.</p> <p>To add further woe, we have been told just this afternoon that our local post office will close as of Friday.  People are being asked to travel 6 km to the next post office in Newport, County Tipperary.  The fact of the matter is that for a whole host of people, such as pensioners, people with disabilities and people who do not have their own transport, they will have no means of collecting their pension after this week.  It is an absolutely shocking indictment.  We hear so much about support for rural Ireland but here is the reality: our post office will close on Friday.  I have spoken to An Post and, in fairness, it is doing its best to try to get somebody else in to try to keep it open and running.  Yet, in the meantime, there is no aspect of life that will not be impacted in the village if the post office closes on Friday.  I want to appeal to all involved to try to keep this post office open until we can get a replacement service in place.  We cannot lose our post office.  It is the heart of our community and it is a shocking indictment that has been let get to this stage.</p> <p>I appeal for a debate on the role of rural life, in particular, and on the importance of post offices because I think we would all acknowledge it and yet we still see them close.  Urgent action should be taken.  Once again, I call for a debate on housing, particularly in terms of the appalling impact where I live in Limerick.</p></speech>

Obviously, every senior citizen in Dublin Central can avail of free travel and young people up to the age of 24 are enjoying a 50% discount on public transport.  That is welcome.  Does the Leader know that feeling when one has been standing at a bus stop and has been waiting and waiting and the next thing three buses all come along at the one time?  It is infuriating, although one is delighted and wonders which bus to take.  What is happening in Dublin Central in terms of public transportation investment is similar to that.  Currently, in Dublin Central, we have a statutory planning application in train for the Blanchardstown bus corridor into town through the Navan Road.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Leader knows the route well.  It runs down Old Cabra Road and through Stoneybatter.  An application has been made for a BusConnects route from Finglas and Ballymun, running down Mobhi Road and Botanic Road, through Phibsborough and Constitution Hill, and into town.  We also have the MetroLink, which is a massive infrastructural project.  The DART+ West upgrade is also progressing.  This is all welcome investment.  We all support more frequent, affordable and reliable public transport.  As the Leader knows, we have campaigned for safer public transport.  However, for residents and businesses in the area, this number of statutory planning applications running at the one time is an enormous burden.  It is a burden for any citizen to engage in a voluntary capacity.  It is a statutory process.  The engineering wizards and experts within the National Transport Authority, NTA, and other statutory bodies should have had the sequencing capacity to know that would put an unreasonable burden on residents.</p><p>I ask the Leader to write to the Minister for Transport on this issue.  I appreciate this falls within the remit of the NTA but the Minister for Transport needs to intervene and give direction that is going to galvanise support and engage people to support these massive infrastructural projects in order that we can have more reliable, efficient and affordable public transport.</p></speech>

I agree with Senator Gavan that it would be no harm to have a discussion on housing in this House.  That would be informative for everyone.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister's decision to introduce a stay on evictions over the winter period.  It is a sincere and well thought-out provision by the Minister and the Government.  However, it will be important to follow on at the back end of that stay.  Landlords who have an enshrined right in this country to be in charge of their own properties and homes are having this law forced on them, for however a short a time.  If we are going to introduce a stay on evictions, we must work with landlords and property owners.  The detail seems to be sparse although I understand there may be further clarification later.  For argument's sake, I will say there are some tenants who are not playing ball at present and others who will not play ball because they know they are going to secure a house until next year.  That leaves landlords with very little or no recourse.  To go to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to try to get a tenant out of a property if there is a problem takes a year at the best of times.  I am curious about what guarantees are available and what back-up we are going to give to landlords.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il previously proposed a tax break for long-term leases.  I do not where that proposal has gone but it made a lot of sense.  I have spoken to my party colleagues about it.  I mentioned more than a year ago the tsunami of sales that were coming.  I mentioned that to my colleagues in the House approximately three months ago.  I can see it happening at first hand.  It is having a knock-on effect and causing a problem.  Each and every day, as the Leader will know from attending clinics, more people are presenting in cases where their houses are being sold and they are going to be left homeless, for want of a better word, or at least without their current home in a short timeframe.  That is something we need longer to consider.  We must engage and deal with landlords.  Putting our heads in the sand and running landlords out of the market is something we can do if we want to but we must have a proper strategy to do it.</p></speech>

Residents have contacted me.  It is not easy to get from Castleconnell to Newport.  Residents are reliant on getting lifts.  Many older people use the local post office for their banking facilities so I encourage the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to come to the House for a debate on the future of post offices.</p> <p>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Health regarding transforming four hospices from section 39 to section 38 organisations.  This is most welcome in Limerick, where Milford Care Centre is located.  It is joined by Marymount Care Centre, St. Francis Hospice and the hospice in Galway.  I compliment the CEOs, staff and the many volunteers who work in these hospices.  My family availed of the services in Milford Care Centre over the past number of years.  Compassionate work is carried out there.  The news today is welcome because it secures funding for the future of hospices in Ireland.  I thank the Minister for listening to us.  I spoke to him and the T&aacute;naiste about this matter and I think it was the right thing to do.</p></speech>

One might ask what a learning gate is.  I learned this morning that it is a place where students can come and study.  Ballinasloe Area Community Development hosts a place for start-ups, enterprise and companies but it also has meeting room space and this is where students will now be able to come and learn, meet with other students or carry out research for the college they are attending.  This is the first of 11 that will be opened by the Technological University of the Shannon.  It is even opening one in Dublin.  It means there will be additional support for students.  I am delighted to see it because it again shows that there is third-level access in the Ballinasloe region and how we are developing these links with our third-level institutions which are driving excellence in the regions.</p> <p>As has been noted, there has been very good news on the education front, particularly further and higher education.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science indicated that the extra SUSI payment for third-level students will be on 16 December.  We also know that &euro;1,000 has been taken off the student contribution fee so this will be a real boost for families and those who have paid in full.  I think they will have to submit their account details by mid-November.  For those who have not paid in full, it will be taken off their second payment.  This is really positive news for students and their families coming up to Christmas.</p></speech>

It will be wonderful to watch them grow and develop from their inception.  It is really exciting for the areas that have them so I thank the Senator for raising that issue and for acknowledging the &euro;1,000 rebate that will be returned to students, or indeed their mammies and daddies who have paid their fees over the past couple of months.  It will be very welcome.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about Castleconnell post office, as did Senator Gavan.  I am not sure if it is of any benefit to either Senator if I contact the CEO of An Post but surely to God there must be somebody we can put in until we find somebody who will take over the post office.  I am assuming, although I do not know for sure, that somebody is retiring and they cannot find anybody else to take over the business.  There must be some interim arrangements that can be put in place for the 2,500 people referred to by Senators Gavan and Maria Byrne.  I will certainly make contact with the CEO and come back to the Senators.  </p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne also spoke about the very welcome announcement of the four hospices being redesignated from section 39 to section 38 organisations, which is very welcome.  Senators Davitt and Gavan both looked for a debate on housing.  While the eviction ban is very welcome for most people, I acknowledge their concerns about landlords.  We need to protect people.  The story on RT&Eacute; last night about the family living in a tent is not acceptable in this day and age.  There have been challenges regarding accommodation and building houses in the past number of years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is certainly not acceptable that two young children with autism and their parents are living in a car and a tent.  Nevertheless, we need to recognise that the more actions we take to discourage landlords from being in the business, the more that will result in people not having anywhere to rent, given that the State is not building the houses it needs to build in order to provide for those people.  It will be a welcome debate.  I will organise it as soon as the Minister is available to us.</p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick asked that I write to the Minister with regard to the three statutory consultations, which probably are a bit of an overload for the residents in the same area, even though we are all trying to improve the services of public transport for them, and I will certainly do that.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne asked for a debate on research grants and the establishment of proper funding for PhD students and research candidates, which I will certainly organise.  He also touched on a global crisis that is not spoken about as much as other crises, namely, that in Venezuela, and spoke about attempting, through the UN and the EU, to restore democracy and look after the 7 million citizens who have been displaced over the past year or so.</p><p>Senator Conway spoke about the delay in getting the junior certificate results.  I have a little lady at home who is waiting, like all the other young ladies and lads in school, and it seems to be an unacceptable delay.  It certainly highlights the fact that there are not enough teachers to correct the papers, so we have to find the root of that problem and fix it.</p><p>Senator Keogan raised the welcome announcement that the fruits of the seizure of criminal assets will be redistributed to communities that have been most blighted by crime.  The announcement of the first &euro;2 million was made this week and Balbriggan was lucky enough to score &euro;150,000.  There was another announcement for Meath and there have been more for various places almost throughout the country.  I was flabbergasted to hear that we have to keep assets for six years before we can dispose of them and realise the cash.  That does not make sense.  I will certainly make inquiries, although it may require a tweak in legislation.  I would have thought that if we saw something and had the authority to seize it, we would not sit around for six years waiting to realise the value of the money, but I will revert to the Senator on that.</p><p>Senator Ardagh proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, which Senator Gavan seconded, and I am pleased to accept it.  I look forward to scheduling her Bill, as soon as I can, for a Thursday afternoon in order to try to get it progressed insofar as we can between now and Christmas.</p><p>Senator Flynn sought a debate on direct provision.  Every time she does so, I do ask about it but I have not yet been given a date.  I will ask again today and remind the Minister with responsibility.  I am concerned about the recent announcement that people in direct provision are being asked to pay for accommodation.  It is not acceptable that just because we have awarded them citizenship or remain to leave but they do not have anywhere else to go, we would then decide to charge them for what is substandard accommodation, so I support the Senator on that.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile welcomed the ban on evictions and raised both his party&rsquo;s motion that is to be taken in the Lower House tonight and the public tender for artists in respect of life-size statues.  I laughed when he spoke about Winifred Carney because not only was she an original Sinn F&eacute;in member but she was also a Fine Gaeler and then a Fianna F&aacute;iler before she got out of politics.  She was definitely a difficult woman who did not let any man push her around, which is very welcome, so I acknowledge that.</p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly the menopause experience, how good it is to talk about it, how often we have been talking about it and how welcome the major changes of the past year have been.</p><p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the SAR tenders, while Senator Kyne spoke about the ring road in Galway and the fact we are now back to the drawing board.</p><p>Senator Sherlock spoke about the injunction on the security industry, an issue she has raised a number of times.</p><p>Senator Chambers spoke not only about the welcome additions to the menopause clinics - we are now on the fourth one - but also about the worrying trend emerging in Iran of the disgusting treatment of women.  We really need to follow up with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to find out where that young woman is and ensure she is safe.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-18a.97" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022101800002#DD00200"><p>I thank Senators for the opportunity to be here to talk about the summer programme.  It has been a particular focus for me as Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion.  I had the pleasure of visiting many of these summer programmes and I have seen first-hand the immeasurable difference this programme makes to children with special educational needs and those experiencing educational disadvantage.</p> <p>The provision of education for children with special educational needs is an ongoing priority for this Government, and my main focus as the first ever Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion.  I am determined to ensure continuous development of special education provision and policy to allow all children achieve the best possible outcomes in their lives.  The summer programme is a very important scheme for pupils with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.  I want to see it supporting families and students with special educational needs during the summer months.</p> <p>Before we talk about what we are going to do for next year, I want to reflect on the significant progress we have made over the last number of years.  As Senators will know, until 2020, the programme was called July provision, and for many years catered for children in special schools and classes with autism.  When the provision was significantly expanded, it then became known as the summer programme.  Senators may recall this was just after the first school closures that occurred in 2020 due to Covid-19.</p> <p>The 2020 programme provided children with an opportunity to continue or re-engage with learning at school or, indeed, at home.  The eligibility criteria widened and significantly increased the number of primary-age children with complex special educational needs who were eligible for this scheme.  All special schools and primary schools with special classes could provide the school-based summer provision at this time.</p> <p>In 2021, the summer programme was expanded further so that mainstream schools could now provide a school-based inclusion programme.  This was introduced as a further Covid-19 measure to support children with complex needs and also those students at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.  For the summer programme in 2022, we matched the funding from last year of &euro;40 million.  This has helped well over 1,000 Ukrainian children integrate into their new learning environments through the inclusion programme.  It built upon the 2021 programme, which introduced the first ever inclusion programme and allowed all schools to offer a summer programme to pupils in primary and post primary, whether they are mainstream or special schools.</p> <p>I understand the importance of this crucial scheme for families and the children who participate in them.  The summer can be a really daunting time for families of children with additional needs and for some children who do not have enough interaction with friends or peers.  It is, therefore, really important that the Department engages and encourages schools to interact with the summer programme.</p> <p>The Department has listened to feedback and is striving to make the scheme as good as it can be, as am I, and that it is available to every eligible student who needs it.  The programme that was provided in 2022 was developed following extensive engagement with stakeholders, parents and disability advocacy groups.</p> <p>The current programme aims to support pupils to maintain their connection with education, build their confidence, promote well-being and increase their motivation.  For those who are at key transition stages, it helps to ensure they continue their education journey in September either in school or in further or higher education or training.</p> <p>The programmes on offer last summer included the inclusions programme in primary schools, which I spoke about earlier, a special classes and special schools programme in primary schools, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, numeracy and literacy camps, or campa&iacute; samhraidh, in DEIS primary schools and inclusive programmes for all post-primary schools.  A home-based summer programme was also available for up to four weeks with ten hours per week for students with complex special educational needs where a place on a school-based programme was not available to them.</p> <p>A key objective of the 2022 scheme was to increase the number of schools offering the summer programme to their students.  Steps were taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible and ease administrative requirements.  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 summer programme allowed principals delegate these functions to other members of staff through the provision of support roles of overseer and preparation hours.  The overseer and preparation roles provided an excellent opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.</p> <p>Again, for the 2022 programme, the Teaching Council and Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, promoted the summer programmes with graduate teachers, professional masters of education, student teachers and undergraduate students registered under route 5 to increase the supply of available teachers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Josepha Madigan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Graduate teachers and student teachers could work on the summer programme where they had commenced their registration process with the Teaching Council and where certain conditions were fulfilled.  It is important to say schools were given the flexibility to engage staff not currently employed by them, including those in the early years or youth sector, to run their summer programme.  Other examples that schools have previously availed of successfully include students from therapy, nursing and other healthcare-related disciplines.  Other enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools, including a centralised application process to reduce the administrative burden on schools, the earlier payment of school staff, an additional capitation to cover the running costs of the scheme, as well as enhanced capitation for special schools and classes.</p><p>In 2022, the Department had productive engagements with the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE.  This led to positive initiatives to assist special schools, such as through the hosting of information webinars and the introduction of a new grant for these special schools.  I expect these engagements will lead to more positive measures for the 2023 programme and beyond.  Participation in the programme has grown over recent years, with 2022 seeing more schools and more students participate than ever before.  Final figures for this year's programme will be known later in the year, but based on the information available to date, it is anticipated that in excess of 45,000 pupils will have participated, with more than 1,000 schools running a programme.  That is an increase of approximately 18% on the 2021 numbers of participating students.</p><p>This year, for the first time, schools were able to submit the details of staff who worked on their programme through an online portal.  The first payments were issued in July and payments continued throughout the summer.  To date, more than 9,000 staff members have been paid for their participation in the school-based programme.  This represents almost all of staff who participated in the programme.  Feedback on the payments system has been generally positive, and the earlier payments for staff have also been welcomed.  Payments have been issued fortnightly for submitted claims since the first tranche of payments was issued in July.</p><p>Members will no doubt have seen the announcement the Minister for Education and I made about the 2023 programme.  I am delighted to confirm that funding has been approved under budget 2023 to continue the expanded summer programme for 2023.  I recognise the delay in announcing the summer programme in previous years meant some schools had insufficient time to prepare adequately and were not able commit to running the programme.  This early announcement for 2023 affords schools every opportunity and gives them several extra months to plan for a summer programme next year.  As Members will also be aware, I have asked my Department to review the programme so that for 2023, we can build further on all we have achieved so far to have the best possible programme available.  I am very conscious parents want this programme to be available in more schools in 2023.</p><p>As part of the planning that has already begun for next year, it is a priority of next year's development that children in special schools have access to a school-based programme.  It must be noted that while it is important to support a summer based programme in our special schools and special classes, it is also essential to ensure the children with complex special educational needs who are in our mainstream settings also have access to this critical support.  As our system has become more inclusive and many of these children with more complex needs now attend mainstream settings, it is recognised that they, too, will be impacted by school holidays and require that additional support to ensure they achieve their potential.</p><p>The Department is committed, and indeed it has already started intensively, through the review process, to engage with the management bodies, schools and the sector as a whole with a view to encouraging schools and supporting them to participate in next year's programme.  We want to support schools fully in terms of organisation, workforce availability, administration, resources and training to make it as successful as possible.  As part of the review, the Department is engaging with stakeholders, including the Special Education Consultative Forum, to ensure voices on the ground are being heard.  The Department has already met with officials from Malta to utilise some of the learnings from their system in terms of the planning and organisation, and it will be engaging directly with the National Parents Council.  The inspectorate in the Department has also visited schools, including special schools, as part of that process, and it is liaising with the staff, parents and children who participated to help ensure the review takes account of the lived experience.  The Department will also look at innovative ways to promote and publicise the programme for next summer to raise awareness of the scheme further and publicise the benefits of running a scheme.</p></speech>
