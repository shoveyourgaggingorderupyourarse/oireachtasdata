We have spent in the region of &euro;80 million on the summer works scheme in the past few years, and work has been done on almost 700 schools.  It has been a very successful scheme.  It is run by the Department and involves small and medium-sized works being done by the school in the summer when the school is closed.  It has been very helpful for schools which need minor or, indeed, major upgrades, whether this is wiring, plumbing or issues regarding moving walls, playgrounds, etc.  I acknowledge the significant work done by the Department and congratulate the Minister on the way he has dealt with priorities, with Nos. 1 to 6 on the list having been completed, while 7 to 10 have not been dealt with.</p> <p>Is the Minister proposing a new summer works scheme for this year?  New applicants could be incorporated within priorities Nos. 1 to 6.  What is the timescale?  We are two months away from schools rising and builders are becoming hard to get as there is a shortage of plumbers, electricians and masons at the moment.  Builders and tradesmen have traditionally looked on the scheme as something they can bank on for the summer months but are now so busy that their availability may become an issue, something school principals also worry about.</p> <p>Is the Minister proposing to move onto priorities Nos. 7 to 10?  Will he take new priorities 1 to 6?  When will this be announced and what is the proposed budget? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#A00600"><p>The summer works scheme is designed to allow schools to carry out small and medium-scale building works that will improve and upgrade existing school buildings.  This has given flexibility to schools and has been very worthwhile.  This scheme is additional to other capital funding schemes that are operated by the Department, such as the additional accommodation scheme and the emergency works scheme for projects of such urgency that they would prevent some or all of the school from opening, and minor works schemes.</p> <p>The summer works scheme is a multi-annual scheme.  The Senator will be aware that over 1,650 schools, nearly 50% of schools, applied for inclusion under the current round of the scheme which reflects a very high demand.  To date, almost &euro;80 million has been approved under the current round of the scheme, in respect of 635 school projects, 464 primary and 171 post-primary schools, for gas, electrical upgrades, mechanical, sanitation and roof improvement works.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Details of the successful school applicants are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The Senator is seeking clarity on the position for 2018.  The position is that over &euro;25 million will be spent on summer works projects in 2018.  This expenditure will enable the remaining approved improvement works for the 178 schools nationwide to be completed.  These works will be carried out by the schools themselves on a devolved basis mainly over the summer months, so the disruption to students, teachers and other school staff will be kept to a minimum.  Furthermore, the Department intends to engage with the relevant education partners on giving schools a better lead-in period for planning and delivering projects under the summer works scheme from 2019 onwards.  While the summer works scheme is hugely successful in enabling small scale refurbishment works to be done on a devolved basis, the Department considers that the operation of the scheme could be improved by providing a better lead-in period for schools rather than in the second quarter as in previous years.  This will also help ensure that works done under the summer works scheme fit better with any wider refurbishment and energy retrofit plans that may be done at schools under the increased funding provided by the national development plan.  The engagement with education partners will commence shortly and will assist in developing a better timeframe for the planning and delivery of summer works for 2019 onwards.</p></speech>

He raised the priorities 7 to 10.  It is my intention that those would be reached in time.  If a scheme is announced for all the categories, I would not start a new scheme until we had given priorities under all the different headings a chance to participate.  We need a better planning approach.  The really positive thing in the national development plan is that we are now setting aside &euro;2.5 billion for deep refurbishment and retrofitting of schools.  This will be a very significant commitment of capital for the longer term to strengthen the fibre of our schools.  Perhaps it has not been remarked upon but it is a very significant part of the ten year plan.</p></speech>

I am seeking clarity and reassurance from the Minister of State for residents of &Aacute;ras Attracta, Swinford, County Mayo, and their families on the future of their residence at the &Aacute;ras Attracta site.  After the terrible revelations in the RT&Eacute; report in 2014, the McCoy report was commissioned.  One of a number of recommendations in the report when it was published in September 2016 was that the residents in the facility would be placed in the community over a five year period.  I understand some residents have moved, but most are still<i>in situ</i>.  Will that recommendation be adhered to to the letter of the law?  To what extent will families be consulted?  In the case of the particular resident whose details I have supplied to the Minister of State, the family have not been consulted and they do not know what is happening, nor does their brother who is a resident in the facility.  Does the Minister of State think it is a fair and proper way to proceed?</p><p>In the survey done leading up to the report, it was found that the majority of residents were very happy in &Aacute;ras Attracta and with the care they were receiving, as were their families.  Most of the residents are over 60 years of age and most have lived in &Aacute;ras Attracta all their lives.  There is a fear and a concern that people will be forced into the community against their wishes.  This also ignores the fact that &Aacute;ras Attracta is the residents' home, that some people have complex medical needs and that the community may not be the place for them.  They are getting older and these conditions are not improving.</p><p>I also note that it is current policy to put people with intellectual disabilities into community settings.  I understand that but we are talking about an older cohort of residents here.  I know that for the most part, no new resident has been admitted since 1992.  This facility opened in 1988.  There is a case for residents and families to be listened to.  In our drive to modernise, the focus should be on making sure that &Aacute;ras Attracta is safe, secure and provides the necessary social and medical care.</p><p>I mention the various recommendations, including more activities for residents and that residents be given an opportunity for education and so on and issues around the physical building, including that two people should not share a room.  All these things can be addressed on site.  A statement needs to be made because there has been an awful lot of speculation about this.  I would like a commitment that no residents will be placed in the community if they and their families are not in agreement with it.  The Minister of State would allay a lot of fears if that commitment was given.  After that, I would expect due consultation and a commitment in respect of the facilities there which need to be upgraded.  There is a swimming pool there and, as I understand it, it is rarely, if ever, used.  There is a lot of potential in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  It is a fine facility and it has given great service to the area, notwithstanding what happened.  What happened, in terms of what gave rise to the report, means that work must be done to address those issues.  I am not convinced that placing people in the community is a meaningful development in their care or a meaningful step towards improving their circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#B00700"><p>I thank Senator Mulherin for raising this important issue.  I begin by emphasising the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to the provision of appropriate residential care to people with disabilities.  Congregated settings are those defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people.  &Aacute;ras Attracta is an old style congregated setting and this Government is committed to working with residents to move them out of these types of settings and into independent community living.  Institutional care is not in keeping with best practice and at its worst it breaches an individual&rsquo;s basic human rights.  International evidence also demonstrates that the outcomes for individuals are always better in the community.  Key to this is personal choice.  Individuals may choose to live on their own in an apartment-type residential setting, others may choose to live with a number of close friends and others with more significant needs may require homes that are purpose built.  There cannot be a one size fits all approach.  The level and configuration of the supports should meet the needs of individuals and support them to live a life of their choice.</p> <p>At the end of December 2017, there were fewer than 2,400 people with a disability living in congregated settings.  The HSE has prioritised the transition of 170 people in 2018 under its service plan.  I understand that &Aacute;ras Attracta has been identified as a priority case.  All residents will move over the next few years to a home in the community and the &Aacute;ras Attracta campus will close as a disability service.  I am informed by the HSE that a number of houses throughout County Mayo have been purchased.  These will be refurbished while there will also be some new properties built to suit residents' needs.  The work on the first of these houses was completed and the first house opened in November 2017.  Since then three more houses have opened with the fourth house expected to open next month.  There are advanced plans to open a further six houses in 2018 with a further four planned next year.</p> <p>The McCoy report published in 2016 highlighted a significant number of shortcomings in regard to residents&rsquo; safety, care and well-being.  The HSE has put a large amount of time and resources into addressing these issues in the intervening years.  In recent inspections of the campus, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has confirmed evidence of definite improvements, noting that the HSE has demonstrated a governance regime that will ensure quality and safety.  Most importantly there is evidence of a transformation leading to an enhanced</p> <p>quality of life for residents.  Notwithstanding these important improvements to the safety and well-being of residents, it is still the case that international evidence demonstrates that the outcomes for individuals are always better in the community.</p> <p>The HSE continues to work with registered housing bodies, Mayo County Council and other stakeholders to identify further accommodation to facilitate the decongregation of &Aacute;ras Attracta.  The HSE is working to ensure that the process of transitioning to appropriate living in the community is underpinned by meaningful engagement with residents, their families and key stakeholders.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This engagement becomes more active when a home is identified for a resident.  I am informed by the HSE that the resident mentioned by Senator Mulherin in her question will not be moving to a home in the community this year.  All residents at &Aacute;ras Attracta will move over the next few years to a new home in the community and the HSE is working with residents and their families throughout this process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#C00200"><p>I am very concerned about the proposals relating to the community setting.  The Minister said that addressing issues at &Aacute;ras Attracta was a priority for the HSE but, just a couple of months ago, HIQA was threatening to close down the facility, despite all the investment there has been.  HIQA withdrew its plan but the facility was clearly not achieving the desired outcome.  What faith can we have that things will be sorted out in a community setting?  I do not believe that people at this stage of their lives should be forced into the community.  The individual to whom I refer has autism and a number of complex needs and living in an unfamiliar environment is a traumatic experience for such a person.</p> <p>I do not see any sense in the plan.  I respect experts but these are people who have been institutionalised for most of their lives.  They are not of the younger generation, who might be better treated in the community.  I worked in a hospital similar to &Aacute;ras Attracta for five months a number of years ago, where I dealt with people with profound intellectual disabilities.  They tried to implement the same policies as we are trying to implement in Ireland and I am not convinced they are for everybody.  If we are to go beyond lip service and give the residents care and privacy, we owe it to them to upgrade &Aacute;ras Attracta and to allow those who want to remain there for the rest of their days to do so.  We should make it a healthy and happy environment for them as that is the humane option, rather than what is being suggested at the moment.</p></speech>

However, we have to be guided by best practice internationally and research shows that people thrive outside congregated settings in communities, where they will still be supported, assisted and helped in communal living accommodation at which they will also have company.  The decision to move away from congregated settings was taken a long time ago and it is not just an issue for Mayo - it is an issue for the entire country.  It is a challenge and change is difficult, particularly for the residents in this case but they will be at the forefront of the minds of people in the HSE as they make their decisions.</p> <p>People sometimes have to transition, such as when they leave their own homes to go to nursing homes, and transition is part of change.  We have to look to the best interests of residents and that sometimes means moving them to new community settings to be supported and assisted.  The change will have to be managed but it has been done very successfully in many other areas and it can and should be done in Mayo.</p></speech>

They are conscious of how busy garda&iacute; are and those in Henry Street cover the area out to Bruff, which is a large area.  One lady wanted to report a bogus caller but, because of the system, it took three days for the community garda to come back to her.  She was concerned for the welfare for some of her neighbours.</p> <p>Castletroy was originally a separate town from the city of Limerick and has a population of over 16,000, with a student population of some 20,000.  With a total of 36,000, it is the largest suburb in Munster and encompasses Annacotty, Lisnagry, Milford and Monaleen, which were also separate areas at one stage.  The University of Limerick is on its doorstep and there are a lot of industries growing at a very fast rate.  Garda&iacute; are doing a very good job and Limerick has been very lucky in recently receiving one of the new pilot cars with a computer inside it and enhanced Wi-Fi, which is like a Garda station in itself.  The residents, however, want a station on their doorstep, even for simple things such as getting a passport signed or to report petty crimes.  There is not a huge crime problem in Castletroy but the residents feel very vulnerable without a visible station and garda&iacute; on the ground</p></speech>

He holds primary responsibility for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations.  As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.  I understand that Garda management keeps under review the overall policing arrangements, including the operation of Garda stations and the assignment of personnel throughout the State, having regard to factors including crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a district, divisional and regional level.  This ensures that the optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p> <p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na building and refurbishment programme 2016-2021 includes a number of projects which reflect the priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Provision of a Garda station in Castletroy, Limerick, is not included in this programme.  I very much understand that people want a visible Garda presence in their own locality.  In this context, the programme for Government commits to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 sworn Garda members, 2,000 reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Further, the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides &euro;46 millìon for investment in the Garda fleet, to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet.  This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015.  In total, almost &euro;44 million has been invested in the fleet in the period from 2013 to end of 2017, with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am informed by the Commissioner that the overall strength of the Limerick division as of 28 February 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, was 559.  In addition, I am informed that as at 22 March 2018, some 80 vehicles were available to the Limerick division.  I am further advised the area referred to by Senator Byrne is policed by the Henry Street Garda district.  The strength in Henry Street was 312 as of 28 February.  Where required and appropriate, the work of local Garda in the Limerick division is further supported by a number of Garda national units such as the armed support unit, the national bureau of criminal investigation, the Garda national economic crime bureau and the Garda national drugs and organised crime bureau.  The Senator will be aware that the closure of the Garda College in 2010 and the moratorium imposed at that time had a negative impact on Garda numbers across all divisions, including in Limerick.  Since the Government reopened the college in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Of these, 36 have been assigned to the Henry Street Garda district.  I understand the point made by Senator Byrne about the Castletroy area.  I have taken careful note of what she said.   </p><p>I expect the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities, enabling the Garda Commissioner to provide additional resources across all divisions in accordance with identified operational need as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.  The 2005 Act provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee, JPC, in each local authority administrative area.  The function of the JPCs is to serve as a forum for consultations, discussions and recommendations.  There are 15 members of the JPC in Limerick.  In addition, there are five Oireachtas Members, two members nominated by the garda&iacute;, two local authority officials and seven community representatives.  </p><p>I encourage Senator Byrne to engage directly with members, including the garda&iacute;, at the local JPC where input can be made on policing plans for the local area.</p><p>It is important to note that the question of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities is under consideration by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  The appropriate structures and management arrangements for the most effective delivery of policing services are under consideration by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I expect both bodies to report to me later this year and I look forward to studying both reports.  In the meantime, consideration should be given by the local joint policing committee to the matter of the station, in conjunction with local garda&iacute;, to see how we can advance the matter, as has been submitted by Senator Byrne.   </p></speech>

Access to the 1901 and 1911 census returns for the entire island of Ireland has been available for public research for around 50 years.  The digitisation of the 1901 and 1911 census returns by the National Archives has provided a wonderful national heritage resource, which is freely available via the Internet.  Its phenomenal success has greatly increased the interest among members of Ireland's diaspora in their ancestral links to Ireland.</p> <p>Cabinet papers are made available after 30 years and they frequently contain sensitive material which can make or break reputations and provide a fuller picture of how Government operated at the time.  Could we accept a situation in which some material in our census is classified and other material is not as happens with some police records where examinations are made of what may or may not be released?  I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say on that point. </p> <p>A period of 100 years is too restrictive.  Back in 1993 this issue was discussed in the Seanad Chamber and I think it was Senator Manning who noted that the most turbulent period in modern Irish history ensued in the years following the censuses of 1901 and 1911.  The outbreak of the First World War, in which around 49,000 Irish men were killed, occurred in 1914.  The Easter Rising was in 1916 and the First D&aacute;il met in 1919.  There is a black hole in our memory.  I have a Bill that would allow for the release of the census.  It would give special heritage status to the 1926 census and bridge the gap in our records covering this very important period from 1911 to 1926.  What is the likelihood of the Department being up for that?  Would representatives from the Department have conversations with us on that likelihood?</p></speech>

T&aacute;im thar a bheith s&aacute;sta a bheith ar ais sa Seanad.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  The census of population 1926 is an historic collection of great value and interest for historians, researchers, the general public and the diaspora.  There has been great interest in previous releases.  While I acknowledge the historical significance of and keen interest in these data, it is not possible to release the records at this time.  </p> <p>The Statistics Act 1993 prevents the release of census forms until 100 years after the date of the relevant census for reasons of confidentiality.  The 1926 census of population was undertaken under the 1926 Statistics Act, which did not permit any access to census records at any time.  However, the Statistics Act 1993 repealed the 1926 and 1946 Acts and provided for the release of census forms from the 1926 census and all later censuses 100 years after the date of the relevant census.  The 100-year period strikes the right balance between facilitating legitimate historical and sociological research while protecting the confidentiality of census data and the integrity of CSO procedures.  The CSO considers that any amendments to the 1993 Statistics Act to allow for the early release of the census data before 100 years have passed could seriously undermine public confidence in the CSO and damage the credibility of the present day confidentiality guarantee.  </p> <p>The confidentiality of all statistical returns from individuals, households and business, including the 1926 census records, is guaranteed by law, and this guarantee is the cornerstone of all CSO surveys, not least of censuses of population.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Independence, objectivity and the guarantee of confidentiality are the core values of official statistics which have helped create a positive image of, and ensure public trust in, official statistics in Ireland.  Any action that could lead to a weakening of that public trust would be detrimental, not just to the census of population but also to the broader activities of the CSO covering areas such as economic, business and social statistics.  Concerns about data protection are increasing all the time and it is vitally important the CSO maintains the trust of all sectors of the community in this regard.</p><p>In addition to the legal and confidentiality issues, practical issues arise.  Extensive preparatory work is required to prepare the 1926 census returns for digitisation as no database-microfilm exists, as was the case for the 1901 and 1911 censuses project.</p><p>The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht established a 1926 census working group, comprising officials from the relevant organisations, that is, that Department, the National Archives and the Central Statistics Office, to consider how best to enable the publication of the 1926 census records.</p><p>The task of preserving and digitising the 100 year old documents would have to be undertaken by the National Archives.  There is a three stage process, as follows: one, conservation of the 100 year old census forms; two, scanning; and three, indexing and digitising the information so that people can quickly identify and find the specific information they seek.</p><p>The project will require significant additional financial, staffing and infrastructural resources in the National Archives.  The archives are working towards building the necessary capacity to undertake and oversee the census, including a warehouse development plan and increasing its cohort of archivists as funding allows.  As the necessary capacity is being acquired, the census project will be a priority for the National Archives once the decade of commemorations projects have been completed.</p><p>For the reasons outlined, while the Government fully understands the importance of the 1926 census, regrettably, it is not possible to facilitate the early release of these records.</p></speech>

Even with regard to the Minister of State's own brief, the 15 year period would have enormous cultural and linguistic significance in that the Gaeltacht areas were much more extensive with Irish speakers existing in counties that today have no Gaeltachta&iacute; within their borders, and yet the Irish language and culture had the backing of the new State.</p> <p>I am concerned about this black hole in our nation's memory as we move through the centenary celebrations.  It is similar to the lack of progress around a digital legal deposit which means future researchers will not have the ability to research current issues, such as the campaigns on the referendum for civil marriage equality and repeal of the eighth referendum, where websites disappear within 100 days.  There are parallels in the lack of progress on these issues.</p> <p>Would it be possible to meet officials in the Department to discuss the issue?  As I mentioned, I have a Bill on the Order Paper which seeks to create a special status around this legislation.  I would be interested in following this up in a meeting with officials in the Department, if that was possible.</p></speech>

My apologies.  When children are placed in foster care they are essentially placed in the care of the State through the mechanism of the HSE.  Those children are the most vulnerable children in the State and are due the best protection and safeguards the State can afford.  The children in Galway were cruelly let down by the State, not 70 years ago, but in the past two decades.  How did we allow that to prevail under our watch?  There must be an independent investigation into how the HSE handled the case from the date of the initial allegation made by this lady, to date.</p> <p>There are serious questions to be answered regarding the placement and safeguarding of children in the State.  We learned recently in a report into foster services in Dublin South-Central that families were not vetted and in some cases no checks had been carried out for a period of three years.  Now we do not need to imagine the damage that can be caused in a three-year period, as the case highlighted on "Prime Time" last night shows exactly the result of such negligence and neglect of children.</p> <p>Can the Minister be sure that adequate resources are given to Tusla to deal with child protection matters?  Do we have enough social workers?  Do the social workers have adequate support to deal with their caseload?  Do foster families, the majority of whom do fantastic work, have adequate support?  Clearly, confidence in the system is diminishing if it is not gone absolutely.  What radical changes are going to be made to ensure this does not happen again?  The Minister needs to come to the House to address this matter.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise relates to tracker mortgages.  I commend the work of the Central Bank today and Members of the Oireachtas, including my own colleagues, Deputy Michael McGrath and Deputy John McGuinness, who have kept the heat on the banks to ensure that those who had their tracker mortgage rates wrongly removed were compensated.  I have learned today that a further 3,400 customers have been identified by the Central Bank, bringing the total number of customers affected to 37,100.  Many of those people have been compensated and some of the compensation packages have been fair while others have not.  I ask the Minister for Finance to ensure the banks implicated compensate fairly and expeditiously those who were wrongly denied their tracker rate.</p> <p>The third issue I wish to raise relates to the increase in fees for certain courses in Kylemore College, which is run by the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.  We have seen increases of 50% for certain courses and those fees cannot be justified where incomes have not been increased on a commensurate level.  No forewarning was given to many of the students who were given one month's notice to come up with the extra fees.  Ultimately, that is not fair.  I call on the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to explain why the increases at Kylemore College have been introduced.</p></speech>

I am deeply concerned at the absence of the BCG vaccination, which was used for TB.  I understand there are virtually no stocks of BCG left in the country.  With the immigration that has taken place over the years, I understand as many as ten people a week are being diagnosed with TB.  In addition, the meningitis B vaccine has been denied to some children while other children are getting it.  I heard a story yesterday that I found difficult to believe but I verified it.  A three year old child is not immunised against meningitis B whereas her four month old sister can be, free of charge.  </p><p>If the mother wants to have the three year old vaccinated, she has pay to &euro;350.  We all know the damage meningitis can do to children.  We need the Minister for Health to come in.  We need answers on the BCG vaccination and TB.  If TB is on the increase we need to see the vaccine made available again.  We also need the meningitis B vaccine for young children to be made freely available to all and not just a select few.  </p><p>On a side issue, as the Leader knows, I have spoken a number of times on the Defence Forces over the last couple of days.  This morning I was told that in the Leader's own bailiwick of Cork, members of the Naval Service are waiting months for duty pay.  Apparently, the same applies in the Air Corps but not so much in the Army.  I ask the Leader to get an answer on that for me.  What is the logjam?  What is holding it up?  When people are depending on something like the family income supplement, it is not good enough that duty pay is not paid in a timely fashion.</p></speech>

He is correct.  Mr. Carroll had a long history with this House.</p> <p>The eastern region is facing many challenges.  Newspapers and the media are talking about the water supply coming from the Shannon to Dublin and tackling the leakage in the city centre.  At the same time we are looking at transport challenges.  I refer to the MetroLink running from the airport to Swords to Sandyford.  Where 40% of the population lives, we are going to see many challenges.  I refer to the necessity for joined-up thinking in dealing with these challenges over the next ten years.</p> <p>On many occasions, Senator McDowell has raised the issue of the metro in the city.  I am anxious about it as well and would like to see the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, come to the House for a debate on this major infrastructural proposal.  It not only affects Dublin city, but will have a huge impact on the development of our nation.  I would be grateful if the Leader, at his earliest convenience, could organisation that debate.  We are talking in the region of &euro;3 billion being spent.  We have to ensure we are getting value for money.  I refer to the Luas green line being closed for a year, and possibly two, and the impact that will have on transport in our city during that period.  Therefore, I would be grateful if the Minister would come in to discuss this important matter relevant to his brief.  Deputy Ross was in the newspapers this morning in regard to the appointment of judges but it is important that he come into this House to discuss the issues for which he has direct responsibility.</p></speech>

Anyone who watched "RT&Eacute; Investigates" last night could not help but be really moved and disturbed by Ms Barry telling her story.  I commend her for her bravery and the other girls too.  We have these isolated cases reported.  We should not have to rely on television or the national broadcaster to bring these stories forward.  We know that when we watch one such story that there are many more people across this country in the same position.  Many of them have never been reported.  Others were reported but were never listened to.  Others went to the Garda but things were never processed.  Like others who survived horrific abuse, their strength and courage is beyond remarkable.</p> <p>What makes this case even more abhorrent is that the continuation of this abuse was openly facilitated by our State.  It was facilitated to continue.  As if that was not enough, the trial they had to endure to bring the perpetrator to account inflicted further torture on these young girls.  Ms Barry described her experience within the court last night.  That has to be changed.  We have a responsibility as legislators to do that.  I know the Domestic Violence Bill is going through the D&aacute;il this week.  However, there is much more we need to do.  She went through all that in the trial just for him to get seven and a half years.  That is not justice.  Surely, no one can argue now against the introduction of sentencing guidelines that should be drafted by a sentencing committee.  This would not encroach on the separation of powers or the autonomy of the Bench.  However, it would ensure that prison sentences are proportionate to the crime committed.  Day after day, we see perpetrators of domestic violence and abuse being let off, being given the most lenient sentences one could imagine and even being given suspended sentences as late as yesterday.</p> <p>Until we do that, women and children will continue to be failed by this State.  An independent inspection must be held as to how and why these children were failed.  Was it the lack of social workers?  For years, and indeed decades, under successive Governments, it has been said that there are not enough social workers and that the social workers that are there have impossible caseloads.  Watching that programme last night, and because we do not have enough social workers or the protection in place, it crossed my mind as to how many children were being raped last night?  How many children were being abused last night?  </p> <p>I commend the wonderful foster families that provide loving, secure homes for children.  I know many of them personally.  The vast majority of foster families really do provide loving, secure homes.  However, we are not just talking about foster homes.  We are talking about sexual abuse and abuse that happens in and outside many homes across the country.  I encourage other families to come forward and to offer their homes to children who can no longer live with their biological parents.</p></speech>

I believe she understands that, judging by the later part of her article.  No one wants to contemplate a collapse and a no-deal situation.  She misrepresents many of the statements from the Oireachtas as being an ultimatum, which is not our intention.  I do not doubt that the negotiators - the British Minister, Mr. Davis, and his team, and Mr. Barnier and his team - are competent and able people.</p> <p>However, I agree with Ms Dodds on one matter.  The trade talks will be the key to removing a no-deal scenario from the table once and for all.  There is no question of a border on the Irish Sea.  That is not in our interests either.  I mean no disrespect, but our east-west trade is worth more than our North-South trade.  That said, of course we want a seamless Border.</p> <p>People will have to learn to be patient while the negotiations are under way.  In any negotiation, there has to be give and take and compromises have to be made.  There must be some form of a comprehensive, overall UK-EU customs partnership - a customs union in another guise, under another name or whatever.  That would not be beyond the wordsmiths, lawyers and everyone else.</p></speech>

It will look after the interests of regional newspapers well and allow them editorial independence and responsibility.</p><p>That the Government did not make a decision on the proposed takeover by Independent News &amp;amp; Media, INM, of Celtic Media was a major error, in that it could have put those local newspapers in jeopardy.  I call on the Minister to be decisive and approve the deal.  He should not allow this to linger.  He should not be scared by the reaction to the non-decision on INM and Celtic Media.  Grasp the nettle, do not let the horse bolt, make a decision and be decisive.  Do not be concerned about criticism from any party.  Get the file.

I support Senator Humphreys regarding MetroLink and its potential effects.  The House needs to understand what the plans are and whether there is a plan B, C or D.  I raise this matter primarily in respect of the Na Fianna GAA club in the Glasnevin-Drumcondra area.  Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael has roughly 1 million members, including 500,000 active playing members.  Na Fianna has approximately 3,000 members, owns one pitch and is in active use of two other pitches.  Removing its pitch will ruin its community and the GAA in the area for at least six years and the schools will be badly affected.  In many cases, the GAA is the backbone of various schools' recreational activities.  There are a number of primary and secondary schools in the area, including Scoil Mobh&iacute;.  The club will appear before the transport committee after lunch today to raise its concerns.</p> <p>I call on the House to support the Na Fianna club in the challenges it faces.  As important as that, will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the House?  I support Senator Humphreys's call in that regard.  Senator O'Mahony, whom I spoke with about the situation this morning, also supports the call.  He is able to speak for himself on the matter.  Will the Leader invite the Minister to tell the House about the options as regards MetroLink?</p> <p>Unlike some people, I am in favour of a proper rail system for Dublin's north city and county.

The proposal to reintroduce bonuses at AIB is disgraceful and I welcome the fact that the Minister will be opposing it.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to debate the issue of tax reliefs.  If we are looking at a situation where banks are seeking to restore a bonus culture against the background, for example, of AIB making &euro;1.9 billion in pre-tax profits, then we need to reconsider the fact that they can write off current profits against past losses.  It is not appropriate that the construction industry, which is also making substantial profits again, and the banks are able to effectively avoid paying tax and avoid contributing to the State and to the citizens who bailed them out.  I would like the Minister to go further than opposing bankers' bonuses and to re-examine the tax reliefs or write offs that are being enjoyed by the banks.</p> <p>I join Senator Humphreys and the Cathaoirleach in noting the passing of former Senator John Carroll who served in this House between 1981 and 1982.  He also made an extraordinary contribution to the trade union movement over almost five decades, with SIPTU and prior to that as vice president and president of the ITGWU.  He made a huge contribution in the areas of wage bargaining and payment systems in this State.</p> <p>As well as his work for the trade union movement, he was also an activist in other areas.  He was one of the people who led the campaigning in respect of Carnsore Point and the question of nuclear power.  This is an issue of great concern today in the context of the proposed Hinckley Point nuclear power station in the UK, on which Senator Grace O'Sullivan has worked extensively.</p> <p>I wanted to add my voice to those commemorating John Carroll and the contribution he made to national life.  As we note the contribution of trade unionists and the trade union movement to the public good in Ireland and in the context of my call for a debate on taxation and tax reliefs, we need to restore the tax relief for trade union membership, given that other professional bodies enjoy that tax relief.</p></speech>

I propose that we take No. 17 on the Order Paper before No. 1.  We know that LGBT people form loving, stable and committed relationships equivalent to heterosexual families and the people's support for the civil marriage equality referendum was recognition of that fact.  There is no scientific evidence to suggest that we can change or eliminate sexual orientation, although there is evidence to say that we can self-label our sexual orientation.  However, the outcomes are temporary and always unpredictable.  I want to thank the 20 Senators from all sides of this House who have co-signed the Prohibition of Conversion Therapies Bill 2018.  This is a Bill that will prohibit conversion therapy as a deceptive and harmful act or practice against a person's sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.</p><p>A couple of month's ago the European Parliament passed a motion that reads as follows: &quot;The European Parliament [...] welcomes initiatives prohibiting LGBTI conversion therapies and banning the pathologisation of trans identities and urges all Member States to adopt similar measures that respect and uphold the right to gender identity and gender expression&quot;.  Malta has legislated to prohibit the practice of conversion therapy, as have nine American states.  The UN Committee Against Torture has expressed its concern over the dangerous and discredited practice.  There are organisations providing this service in Ireland.  However, the Irish Council for Psychotherapy has stated that efforts to change, manipulate or reverse sexual orientation and-or gender identity through psychological therapies are unethical, in accordance with its guidelines.  The State should adopt that position and apply it legislatively.  The Prohibition of Conversion Therapies Bill does so.  </p><p>In terms of LGBT people's experiences of mental health services, a survey by Trinity College and UCD was published in the <i>International Journal of Mental Health Nursing</i>in 2014.  That survey noted many negative experiences of mental health services, with 66% of respondents experiencing an assumption that they were heterosexual.  A full 29% of respondents experienced a negative reaction when they disclosed their LGBT identity, with 21% reporting comments to the effect that their LGBT identity was &quot;just a phase&quot;.  Crucially, 13% were advised that their sexual orientation could be changed to a heterosexual one.  </p><p>Brazil was one of the first countries in the world to prohibit conversion therapy but that decision was overturned recently.  Brazilians, more than any other non-EU nationals, come to study in Ireland in large numbers and their influence has been felt and welcomed among our LGBT community.  Ireland must be a beacon of hope for people everywhere and it is in that context that I am proposing that we amend the Order of Business and take No. 17 before No. 1.</p></speech>

McManus to bring the Ryder Cup to Ireland in 2026.  We have been very lucky in this country to have had people like Dr. Michael Smurfit and J.P. McManus to drive and promote golf in this country.  There are 420 golf courses in Ireland.  Indeed, there are more golf courses per head of population here than in any other country in the world.  Ireland is also the cheapest place in the world to play golf.</p> <p>I am delighted that Mr. McManus has decided to put in a bid to host the Ryder Cup in 2026 but he needs the support of the Government.  I support Senator Byrne's call for the Government, from the Taoiseach down, to get behind Mr. McManus in his bid to bring the Ryder Cup to Adare Manor in the mid-west.  The manor is surrounded by a good road network and there is an airport nearby.  It has all of the facilities needed to host such an event.</p> <p>The last time the Ryder Cup was held here was 2006.  In 1997 and 1998 the then Government rowed in behind Dr. Smurfit's efforts to bring the competition to the K Club.  A lot of work and advance planning has to be done and we are lucky that Mr. McManus is willing to put his money, his property and his facilities forward in a bid to host what is one of the biggest golfing events in the world, which takes place every two years.  There is a great need to disperse tourists when they come here, to encourage them to head west from our eastern seaboard and hosting the Ryder Cup will put us on the world stage.  I fully support Senator Byrne's remarks.</p></speech>

He was a very fine trumpeter and I well remember in the 1970s that he, along with others like Johnny Logan, very courageously took part in a concert I organised in the Olympia Theatre to raise funds for the legal action I was taking at that point.  It was very courageous of him to do so.  We managed to succeed in only losing &pound;4 because we had conflicted with a walk led by the ghastly Jimmy Saville.</p> <p>In those days, I took part in quite a number of protest marches including several organised by the Dublin Housing Action Committee as well as the PAYE marches.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We always had a brass band and it was often led by John Carroll.  It was the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union brass band.  He is a loss to this community.</p><p>I support the call of my colleagues for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to come to the House to discuss the MetroLink project.  I have heard an awful lot of drivel spoken.  Only today, I heard two people.  Senator McDowell was talking about it.  He is concerned and worried, etc.  The Senator stated that for the cost of the MetroLink, one could put in ten Luas lines.  What a vision.  Given that two Luas lines have created havoc and traffic chaos, another ten would be wonderful.  I do not know where these people are dragged up from.</p><p>Then we had that person, Mr. Colm McCarthy, who is actually an interesting economist.  He talked about buses, stating that for the cost of the MetroLink one could flood Dublin with buses.  I do not know where Mr. McCarthy lives.  He must live under a stone somewhere in Sandycove because if one looks at Nassau Street, it is buses end to end already the entire length of the street.  One can hardly squeeze a bicycle between them.  I do not know what on earth these two people are talking about - one of them trying to flood the city with Luas lines which cannot possibly work and the other trying to flood them with buses.</p><p>The real disaster is we should have built a full underground system in the beginning.  The Luas is a catastrophic mistake and we will be paying for it for years.  I say that despite the fact it is highly convenient for me.  I can get onto it in Parnell Street, whizz down to Dawson Street and trickle across here.  On the way home, if I get one marked "Parnell", I can get on in Dawson Street and whizz back up to the northside to within 100 yards of my house.  It is convenient for me but it is a disaster for the city.</p></speech>

This morning, like colleagues here, I attended a presentation in the AV room by the Passport Office.  I compliment and thank the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, for arranging that presentation.  It was worthwhile and, indeed, timely because from now on is the time of year when many think of taking a break or going abroad for a holiday to recharge the batteries.  The key message that came from the staff of the Passport Office, whom I compliment for their good work, was the request to ask people to check before they book.  That is the most important sentence that came out of it.  We all know of cases, and many Members are contacted on a daily basis, where people have booked a holiday two weeks or less before they are due to go, only to discover that one of their passports is out of date.  We all know the anxiety that particular experience causes people.</p> <p>As the House will be aware, we have two passport offices in this country - one in Dublin and one in Cork.  Unfortunately, as with many services, if one draws a line from Dublin to Galway, they are non-existent north of that line.  The Passport Office is yet another example of that.  At a time when we are experiencing a rise in the number of applications from Northern Ireland due to Brexit, it is timely that we would look again at locating a sub-office to cater for the northern half of the country.  A location such as Monaghan or Cavan would be ideal from a geographic perspective because if one lives in north Derry or north Donegal and has to travel to Dublin, it is a four and a half hour journey.  It is timely that we should do that.  I ask the Leader to ask the T&aacute;naiste to come in to the Chamber so that we can discuss this issue.</p> <p>Another simple possible solution to avoid this issue of passports going out of date - the T&aacute;naiste might intervene here - would be if the travel agents and airlines would have a precondition that before accepting a booking they would have to ensure that the passport is in date.  A further simple solution would be that the Passport Office would contact individuals, perhaps six months in advance, to advise them of their passport going out of date.  It could save travellers a great deal of stress and annoyance.  In summary, I ask the Leader to ask the T&aacute;naiste to come to the Chamber to have a discussion on this issue.</p></speech>

First, I formerly second the amendment to the Order of Business that Senator Warfield outlined.</p> <p>I will touch briefly on last night's "RT&Eacute; Investigates".  Without commenting in detail, it is timely and appropriate that we would have the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, come back to the House.  The Minister was here previously and we had a long and protracted debate about Tusla.  It was clear from last night's programme that those three brave women who had to put in the public domain their story did a service to the people of this country to give confidence to others to be able to come forward and report what is horrific abuse.  I pay tribute to "RT&Eacute; Investigates" for the sensitive way in which it dealt with that particular programme.</p> <p>I ask the Leader if he would consider, when appropriate, in the timescale the Minister has available to her, that she could come specifically to talk about progress regarding Tusla and maybe to touch on some of the commitments that the Minister gave us on her last visit here when she talked about the need to increase the number of social workers.  The Minister explained that she was seeking further funding from Government.  In last night's programme, yet again, we heard stories from people regarding the shortage of social workers.  That is not the Minister's fault.  That is not the Government's fault.  We need to be seen.  We need to do everything possible to train, secure, fund and resource social workers to support children who are in care who cannot be fostered for various reasons, but also to monitor and act as an advocate and a link for them within the social services.</p></speech>

McManus's bid to host the Ryder Cup.  It would be phenomenal for the mid-west if that were to happen.  I would also like the Government to see if it can facilitate Lahinch in County Clare hosting the Irish Open next year.  I believe it probably has an excellent chance of succeeding.  Certainly, that would help my region, the west of Ireland and County Clare if it happened.</p> <p>Like Senator Boyhan, my main purpose for speaking today is to commend the bravery of those who appeared on "RT&Eacute; Investigates" last night and to commend Ms Aoife Hegarty and the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" team for the incredible work they are doing in exposing serious wrongs in the State.  It is only a short few weeks ago that there was a public outcry over a bishop saying a mass at a particular priest's funeral, and rightly so.  That outcry was correct and proper, but I have not yet heard of anybody resigning from the HSE over what happened in this particular case.</p> <p>I believe that people should be held accountable.  It is not good enough.  There comes a time when heads need to roll and accountability has to apply and be seen to apply.  It is simply not good enough that those people were put through what they have been put through.  This is not the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s or 1990s.  This is only a few years ago.  It is time our society learned and that heads rolled and people lost their jobs over the decisions they make.  It is appropriate that we should have the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in here to debate the protocols that are in place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is only a few years ago and who is to say it is still not happening?

It was an interesting Seanad and among the 11 Taoiseach's appointees were James Dooge and four Labour Party Senators, including Timmy Conway. the late John Carroll, Pat Magner and Paddy Dunne.  Jim Higgins was also there, as was T. K. Whitaker, a man I had the good fortune to meet and for whom I had great admiration, though he took no Whip.  May Mr. Carroll rest in peace.

He was a giant within the trade union movement and for those of us who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s, he was a familiar face on television, not to mention a voice on radio, advocating for union members, collective bargaining and the rights of workers.  His role in the amalgamation of the IGTWU and the Federated Workers Trade Union, which became SIPTU, brought him much acclaim within the trade union movement.  He was a person of huge intellect and compassion and a man who focused on the rights of workers and the most vulnerable in our society.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I offer the deepest condolences to his family on his sad passing.</p> <p>Senators Ardagh, Conway-Walsh, Boyhan and Conway raised last night's "Prime Time" programme.  I did not see the programme in its entirety as I was on "The Late Debate" with Senator Higgins on the radio but we certainly owe a debt of gratitude to the three women involved for their bravery in allowing their anonymity to be waived in order to shine a light on the harrowing experience they had.  It is far too easy to issue words of condemnation but this should not be happening in our society.  I agree with Senator Conway that somebody must be held to account for what happened.  There is no excuse.  We can blame systems or a lack of social workers.  We can blame a lack of money or we can say there was too much money but there was a failure of accountability which needs to be dealt with.  Three lives have been ruined and, as the Senators said, it is important we learn from this and put in place safeguards to protect the most vulnerable.  In this case, it was young children in foster care, which is meant to be a safe and secure environment and it is unacceptable that an apology was only issued by the HSE on foot of a "Prime Time" programme.  I do not try to be populist and there are very good people working in Tusla who are doing a tremendous job, but this is unacceptable.</p> <p>I would be very happy for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to come to the House to discuss the matter.  When I was Chairman of the health committee, I worked with the first Minister for Children and Youth to sit at Cabinet, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  We dealt with the Children First guidelines and put in place HIQA and we all thought we would see an end to the inept maltreatment of children in care.  It is harrowing to read the reports this morning.  It is not all about money because the budget for Tusla was increased and 300 new staff were recruited.  If there is a deficit of social workers, why is that the case?  We must draw a line under this awfully upsetting era.  It is about people who are vulnerable being treated appallingly.  I agree with Senator Conway-Walsh that they were let down by the State.  There is a duty of care on all of us and a duty to hold people to account.  We, in these Houses, are held to account by the electorate, whether by popular vote in the Lower House or election to the Seanad, and it is about time there was accountability for people who operate and manage services.  I appreciate the good work that is done by many people but we must not allow this to continue.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh asked about tracker mortgages.  I commend the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on their work in this area.  The Taoiseach said the behaviour of banks towards people on tracker mortgages was scandalous.  The banks have been dragging their feet and there is a human cost, as we are beginning to see.  People have lost their homes and investment properties and there are mental health and well-being implications to that.  I hope we can bring resolution to this as these are human beings.  We require banks to work with them and for trust to be re-established.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh also raised an issue regarding Kylemore College.  I am sure it is a matter for the ETB in Dublin but any increase in costs needs to be justified.  I hope we do not preclude people from entering or returning to education.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised the HPV and BCG vaccinations.  Yesterday was World Meningitis Day and one in five of 24 and 25 year olds can die from contacting meningitis so it is important that we have a vaccination programme.  A new social media campaign, #24youhavethepower, was launched to coincide with the day and when he was Minister for Health, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, introduced free meningitis B vaccinations for infants, making us only the second country in Europe to do that.  We also need a strong campaign around vaccination.  The BCG vaccination for TB expired three years ago, in 2015, and an independent immunisation group established that the vaccination was not advisable but I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to debate the issue.  We will have a debate on the Defence Forces next week.  It is disappointing to hear that there are members of the Naval Service, the Army and the Air Corps who are not receiving their pay.  Duty payments should be made promptly and expeditiously.</p> <p>Senators Humphreys, &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and Norris asked about the MetroLink, as Senator Ardagh did on the Order of Business yesterday.  I am happy for the Minister to come to this House on the issue.  There is a consultation process until 11 May in which members of the public can submit their views and opinions and a number of public consultation meetings will take place.  I ask all Members to advise people to go along and make their views known.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As I said yesterday, I fully understand the concerns of Members, the residents and members of Na Fianna about the implications of this for them and, in the case of the sporting club, for the GAA.  It is important that we have a conversation around public transport and connectivity.  I pose the question to Senator Norris: what would an underground Luas have cost?  It is easy to come in here and say we should do it, but what would be the cost of that?  Perhaps that debate needs to be happen and I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Ross, come to the House to debate it as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Senator Paul Coghlan raised the issue of Brexit.  We will have a debate on that in the House next week.<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly concur with Senator Leyden in welcoming the decision by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to allow for the proposed merger of <i>The Irish Times</i>and the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and the ancillary and affiliated companies and radio stations.  It is a merger we need to see happen quickly.  I commend the Crosby family who have been involved with the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, then the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, since 1872.  I thank them for their huge commitment to the people of Cork, and of Ireland, since they commenced their involvement in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>as it is now.  It is fair to say that the <i>Evening Echo</i>and the <i>Irish Examiner</i>are synonymous with Cork.  I certainly hope that the titles can be retained and that we continue to have excellent coverage of current affairs and sport in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, the <i>Evening Echo</i>and the other newspapers the Senator referenced.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Naughten, will approve the merger quickly so that we can have continuity and certainty as well as the retention of jobs.  I commend the Crosby family and all who worked and work in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and the <i>Evening Echo</i>in Cork.<br/><br/>I disagree with the Senator on one issue.  Members of this Government have courage and conviction.  The proof of that is that our economy is recovering.</p></speech>

I congratulate J.P. McManus on Adare Manor and support Senator Byrne's request to have Government support the Ryder Cup bid for 2026.  It would be an incredible event in Limerick and would bring an economic benefit in terms of tourism to our country.  We only have to consider the coverage we would get of it across the world in terms of the imagery, the promotion and the selling of Ireland as a place where one can play golf cheaply, as Senator Burke said, but on world renowned courses.  It would be an extraordinary event to host in Adare Manor.  I commend J.P. McManus for his willingness to become part of many events in Limerick to support charities, whether it is educational bursaries, sporting clubs or to help vulnerable people in society.  We can criticise people but, to be fair to him, he has always been to the fore in supporting causes in the Limerick region.</p> <p>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins raised the issue of tax relief.  I would be happy to have that debate as part of future debates in the House.</p> <p>I am happy to accept Senator Warfield's amendment to the Order of Business.  I commend him for bringing forward the Bill.  We will not have the debate now but his contribution to the Order of Business is one we should support.  As Leader of the House, I was happy to co-sign the Bill and be associated with it because it is an important debate.  It is also about leading change, not just in this country but across the world.  I commend him for his work on that.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of the passport office.  The Senator's second suggestion on the issue of the precondition for booking should be taken up.  I had an experience in early January when I was taking a flight.  I arrived at the gate.  I knew my passport expired in March but I was told I might not be able to travel.  It is about awareness.  The Senator has put forward a very good idea and I support him on that.</p> <p>Equally, the issue of a new passport office is one we need to examine because of a growing population.  We have an office in Dublin and one in Cork, which is an excellent facility.  I thank the people who work in the Cork passport office because they do tremendous work in terms of their dedication, delivery and courtesy.  There is merit in the Senator's suggestion to open the passport office in another venue.  As a way of explaining his request, he might raise it as a Commencement matter.  His second suggestion is one on which we should go to the Minister in unison and say it is a way of alerting people because the number of people who on the day of travel, or the week before, discover their documents are not in order is surprising and alarming.  I suppose it is a sign of a recovering economy that people are travelling again.  The Senator's suggestions are worth mentioning.</p> <p>I referenced Senator Boyhan in terms of the case he raised.  It is important that the Minister, Deputy Zappone, comes to the House.</p> <p>Senator Conway raised the issue of Lahinch and the Irish Open.  I would be happy to lend my support to that suggestion as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#P00300"><p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Members of the Seanad for this opportunity to discuss forestry and to acknowledge the important contribution that forestry makes to our economy, our environment and our society.  While we can see the obvious benefits of forestry such as loads of timber, logs and planks being transported on our roads, the cars of workers outside timber processing plants, firewood and timber products, the contribution of forestry in other ways, for example, to climate change mitigation, biodiversity and water quality, may not always be fully understood or appreciated.  I propose to outline the development of Irish forestry to date, the way in which we are seeking to continue the progress and the benefits we derive from our investment.</p> <p>While the State started from a very low base with forest cover of less than 1.5% of Ireland&rsquo;s land area - or just 125,000 ha of forests - in the early 1900s, this has steadily increased over the 20th century.  The bulk of this increase occurred since the late 1980s, following the introduction of State and, subsequently, EU funding towards the establishment of private forests.  While the findings of the most recent national forestry inventory are due to be published shortly, the second such inventory found that the area of forest cover in Ireland in 2012 was nearly 732,000 ha, or 10.5% of the land area.  Senators will agree that this was a significant increase, one outcome of which is a vibrant export-oriented timber industry with more than 75% of the output of Ireland&rsquo;s saw milling and 80% of wood-based panel production being exported.  It should also be noted that the overall Irish forest industry, comprising growing, harvesting and processing of forest products, contributes &euro;2.3 billion to the national economy, generates annual exports of over &euro;350 million and employs more than 12,000 people.</p> <p>The economic activity of the forest sector is spread through every region of the State and makes an important contribution to regional development and the rural economy.  Forestry also represents a significant income stream for landowners.  My Department issues payments annually in respect of grant-aided forests to more than 15,000 forest owners, the majority of whom are farmers.  In 2017, a total capital expenditure of nearly &euro;100 million was paid under the forestry schemes with grants, premiums and funding for other support measures such as assistance towards building of forest roads to facilitate the management, thinning and harvesting of the timber crop.  The timber crop itself also provides a valuable and increasingly important income stream.</p> <p>The current forestry programme, under which my Department operates forestry schemes such as the afforestation scheme, runs to 2020.  The programme offers an ambitious and attractive set of forestry measures aimed at increasing timber production while at the same time improving the quality of our natural environment.  The achievement of these objectives involves the commitment of &euro;482 million over the period of the programme.  This level of investment will facilitate an increase in forest cover by almost 44,000 ha and the construction of 690 km of forest roads.</p> <p>A recent mid-term review of the forestry programme found, however, that there has been a shortfall in overall planting levels, compared to the targets in the programme, and that the proportion of broadleaf planting is not meeting the annual target.  The measures in the programme were re-examined and have now been enhanced with the aim of increasing planting levels and introducing greater diversity in terms of the species being planted, with a particular emphasis on increasing the percentage of broadleaf cover.  Forests serve a multi-functional role, which I will elaborate on later.  In view of this function, the enhanced measures also aim to support Government policy in other areas.  For example, the introduction of improved grant and premium rates for agroforestry and forestry for fibre, while aimed at encouraging more farmers to see forestry as part of their farming mix, may also contribute to biomass supply in support of the proposed support scheme for renewable heat.</p> <p>Native woodlands established along sensitive watercourses can deliver a range of water-related ecosystem services and can form part of the toolbox of measures the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and others might consider for strategic deployment under the river basin management plan.  I will shortly be launching a woodlands for water measure, the aim of which will be to deliver meaningful ecosystem services that protect and enhance water quality and aquatic ecosystems.  Further incentives such as higher rates and measures to protect broadleaf woodlands against deer damage have been put in place following the midterm review to encourage the planting of native species.  Improvements to the native woodland conservation scheme and the introduction of a continuous cover forestry scheme will also support the objectives of the National Biodiversity Action Plan 2017-2021.</p> <p>Forestry is an integral part of our landscape, a significant contributor to the economy, the environment and society and it also serves as a means to support and assist policy initiatives in other areas, as I have just outlined.  I welcome the announcement by the Government, in the context of the national development plan, of its continued support for afforestation.  Recently I announced a review of the national response to the ash dieback disease.  This includes a review of the reconstitution ash dieback scheme and the all-Ireland chalara control strategy 2013.  The review comes after a high-level stakeholder meeting in Dublin in which we received the most up-to-date scientific information on the prevalence of the disease in ash plantations in Ireland.  I believe it is time for a new approach in Ireland to ash dieback.  It is clear from the latest scientific advice that eradication here is no longer considered feasible.  Given this updated advice, our policy response must also change.</p> <p>The reconstitution ash dieback scheme will be reviewed to ensure its continued relevance and value for money, and to ensure that the forest owner is provided with a broader range of silvicultural and management options.  For farmers this new policy response will mean more options if their forests are affected with the disease and we will continue to inform and support them if they have ash dieback.  I believe that many farmers with ash dieback on larger trees would like the opportunity to grow the forest on and produce a crop of ash timber without fear of their annual premiums being stopped.  As a first step, I recently announced that the Department will no longer be ending premium payments to farmers who wish to continue managing their ash plantations where the prevalence of the disease is low.</p> <p>Among the benefits of forestry is the economic value of forestry for employment, exports and farm income.  In that context, the forest sector is playing an increasingly important role in rural development, not only through the diversification of farm income from the payment of annual forestry premiums and income from timber sales but also through the provision of sustainable rural-based employment.</p> <p>I shall now turn to the environmental benefits of forestry, which are wide ranging.  Well sited forest plantations can provide a filtration buffer preventing sedimentation from reaching sensitive watercourses; they can slow down the flow of rainwater from higher elevations thereby reducing the risk of flooding and they provide important habitats for wildlife.</p> <p>Forests also have an important role to play in climate change mitigation.  Benefits include sequestering carbon, providing an additional long term store of carbon in harvested wood and substituting non-renewable, high emissions materials and fossil fuels.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Andrew Doyle:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Under the provisionally agreed effort sharing regulation, up to 26.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from forests and other land uses can be accounted for in meeting our 2021 to 2030 emissions reduction target.  The majority of this will come from the State&rsquo;s investment in afforestation.  The abatement cost of afforestation is estimated to be &euro;23 per tonne which makes forestry very cost competitive as a climate change mitigation tool, particularly relative to alternative measures in the land sector.  In addition, the ability of wood to substitute for emissions-intensive materials supports other sectors in their decarbonisation efforts.  We hear increasing commentary about the bioeconomy which refers to the economic activity derived from the use of biological resources to produce food, feed materials and energy.  The concept of a bioeconomy has emerged in response to the challenges of food security, energy security, climate change and the depletion of non-renewable resources.  I understand that virtually everything that can be made from fossil resources can also be made from biological resources.  Substituting sustainably produced biomass for fossil resources facilitates decarbonisation and continued economic growth.</p><p>The Irish forestry sector has a major role to play and huge potential in the emerging bioeconomy.  This role and potential is explored in the report, Growing the Irish Forest Bioeconomy, produced by COFORD under the programme of competitive forestry research.  This report gives a comprehensive overview of the subject and the way in which the further development of forestry could contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s national policy on the bioeconomy.  It is vital that the development of the forestry sector is focused on people because forests can deliver important social benefits.  Forests, for example, provide people with opportunities to exercise, to spend time with their families in the outdoors, and to enjoy being close to nature and being surrounded by scenic landscapes.  Time spent away from the hustle and bustle of modern life can contribute to a healthier state of mind and a feeling of well-being.  For example, last year&rsquo;s green ribbon campaign included a series of six forest walks organised by the IFA in association with See Change, Coillte and Mental Health Ireland.  I understand that these "Let&rsquo;s Talk and Walk" events have been a great initiative to help get people talking openly about mental health problems, and forest trails provide a relaxing, peaceful environment for such events.</p><p>Resources within my Department are therefore focused on developing recreational and environmental aspects of woodlands which can be enjoyed by local communities and visitors alike.  This is being achieved through the enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s native woodland resource, thereby delivering landscape and ecological benefits to society and through investment in local amenity areas in the form of so-called neighbourwoods.  Our national strategic goal for forestry is to develop an internationally competitive and sustainable forestry sector that provides a full range of economic, environmental and social benefits to society and which accords with the Forest Europe definition of sustainable forest management.  I have outlined some of those benefits.  My Department and I continue to work towards that goal through the introduction and enhancement of schemes and the roll-out of initiatives, including the development of knowledge transfer groups to assist forest owners to develop their knowledge of forestry and the design of a certification scheme to assist them to achieve forest certification.  The Department also funds forest research projects to inform our policymaking and to assist the sector ranging from nurseries, growers, processors and end users.</p><p>I hope I have given a reasonable insight into the Irish forestry sector and I look forward to hearing the contributors.  We will be taking notes.  There is an official with me from the Department, a senior forestry inspector.  I look forward to hearing the responses.</p></speech>

On behalf of my colleague, Senator Paul Daly, who is unavoidably absent, I thank the Minister of State for his opening comments.  My party, Fianna F&aacute;il, is committed to developing the forestry sector in Ireland which plays a critical role in environmental, economic and social policy.  The forestry industry, which consists of the growing, harvesting and processing of forestry, makes a massive contribution to the economy, estimated at &euro;2.2 billion per annum with around 12,000 jobs dependent on that sector.  Timber production is in the region of 3 million cu. m every year, with around 20% of this amount produced from private landowners.</p> <p>Forests, as the Minister of State has mentioned, cover 10.5% of the country&rsquo;s land area against the EU average of 38%, showing the substantial progress that has yet to be made here.</p> <p>I grew up on the fringes of Killykeen Forest Park in County Cavan, a beautiful 240 ha forest set on the shores of Lough Oughter.  That incorporates 74 acres with 28 log cabins that have recently been sold to a private entity by Coillte and I look forward to that developing in the near future for the benefit of the local community.  In the future I would like to see more investment, in Killykeen Forest Park, in particular because it is a beautiful amenity and it is open to huge development.  There could be major benefit to the local community.  Further down the road in Kingscourt in east County Cavan is the D&uacute;n a R&iacute; Forest Park which forms part of what was formerly the Cabra estate which was owned by the Pratt family.  Legend stretches back to the time of C&uacute; Chulainn, the Gaelic warrior who rested in these woods while fighting the armies of Queen Maeve of Connacht.  There is a great diversity of wildlife in the park and the flora is varied and in many areas spectacular.  Just across the border from south County Cavan, in County Longford there are plans well under way to develop a Center Parcs holiday village in Newcastle Wood.  This will be of huge economic benefit, not only to County Longford but also to the counties surrounding it, and it will bring in visitors primarily from the UK and from mainland Europe.  We welcome that development.</p> <p>It was under a Fianna F&aacute;il Government that ambitious planting targets of 10,000 ha per annum were set out in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 with more than 8,000 ha planted in 2010 alone.  Regrettably, in recent years, annual planting targets have been downgraded to 6000 to 7000 ha, significantly behind the Food Wise 2025 annual afforestation target of 15,000 ha per annum.  The recently published mid-term review of the Government&rsquo;s 2014-2020 forestry programme unfortunately confirmed this pattern, with total afforestation planting figures for the first three years of the programme, 2015 to 2017, inclusive, 7% less than the cumulative target for this period.  Shockingly, the planting targets for agroforestry, native woodlands and forestry for fibre combined were missed by 74%.  Meanwhile, overall planting targets were missed by 22% in 2017 alone.</p> <p>Forestry has a key role to play in the reduction of Irish carbon emissions.  Afforestation is a vital tool in reducing our carbon footprint, with 300,000 ha of new forests planted since 1990 absorbing a massive 18% of Irish agriculture&rsquo;s annual greenhouse gas emissions.  Ireland&rsquo;s forests removed 4.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in 2015 alone.  The inclusion of land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF, within the scope of the new EU 2030 climate change framework is a welcome development and represents a sensible approach which broadens, through carbon removal, the tools available to Ireland in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will enable Ireland to access the removal of 26.8 million tonnes of CO2 over the 2021 to 2030 period.</p><p>I very much welcome the initiatives the Minister of State is bringing forward and continuing.

It is an issue very close to my heart.  I was very involved in forestry in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Coming from a dairying background, which I did in the 1960s and 1970s, I know forestry is an extension of farming.  At that stage, massive incentives were given by the Irish Government in conjunction with the European Union to incentivise people like me to invest in private forestry.  I jumped at the chance because at that stage 75% of the funding was given by Europe to increase the acreage.  One of the things that disappointed me in the report is that the percentage of land used for forestry is one of the lowest in Europe.  We have the highest rate for tree growing in the world in Ireland with all of our rain and the climate we have.</p> <p>In the 1980s I had about 1,000 acres which I planted in the Pettigo area.  The grant that was available afforded me the opportunity to do so.  I bought the land, which was land on which, as we say in the west of Ireland, one would not raise a snipe.  It was no good for broadleaves either.  Broadleaves need good land.  It was mainly spruces and pines, which are fast growing and have huge value.  Coillte has been the backbone of this country for years and was hugely helpful to the private sector.  It was helpful to me in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p> <p>It is necessary to fence off forest because there are a lot of wild deer in the wilds and once the top is taken off the leader, it is gone.  That is why we need protection.  Deer love the leaves of the broadleaves so they have to be kept out.  Many people think it is only a case of planting the trees and forgetting about them, but that is not so.  There is a lot of husbandry involved in the forestry industry.  The land has to be drained, ploughed or mounded, which is the best method for planting, so that the trees have more stability.</p> <p>A number of us who were involved in the private sector at that stage brought a helicopter over from Scotland to fertilise the land.  It was accurate.  That was back in the late 1980s.  It was in its infancy at the time.  I am sure it has come on in leaps and bounds since then.  The scheme under the European Union and Irish Government at that time was free of capital gains tax, which is an incentive.  I got out of it because I was moving all my business to the United States.  I was able to get out and at a good time.  It was a capital gains tax free scheme.  It was a huge incentive.  I do not know what the incentives are now because I have not kept up to date with it.</p> <p>It created employment for local people.  Much forestry is in poorer areas because the land used is poor.  Most people there were on the dole and their incomes were supplemented by planting and fertilising and by the husbandry involved in looking after forests.  It is a residual industry.  It has value apart from the resale value.  There are thinnings and the forest is mature after 30 or 35 years.  The second growth is the best growth because the nutrients are in the ground.  There are massive benefits.</p> <p>I am disappointed to hear today that we still have such low coverage.  It went from 1% to 10% in 2012.  I am sure it has increased again but it is not up as much as it should be.  We have the best growing conditions in Europe for forestry.  It is something we should look at much more closely.  It is a massive natural asset and can create a lot of employment in poorer rural areas which is badly needed when all the jobs are going to big cities and towns.  There are a lot of new rules about areas of scientific interest.  I understand all that.  The area was reduced.  If a person had about 400 acres, it was necessary to split it into four different parts and plan for 100 acres or whatever.  It has to be streamlined.  I am sure it is.  We should keep incentivising and get the private sector involved.  The money is coming back again.  The money is there and there is a lot of land.  I understand why broadleaves are not increasing that much because the land has to be very good to grow broadleaves.  Good land is used for other uses than trees, which is a long-term investment.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State's interest.  Forestry was good to me and I saw what it did for employment in the area.  The recreational use of forestry for forest walks, for example, is becoming bigger.  I had an old forester who guided me and helped me.  He went to the forestry school at 17.  He went out and planted land.  He felled the same land he planted and he bought land.  He had experience right through his whole life.  He lived until he was 80.  He was a fantastic guy.  His name was Joe Hanahoe.  He was an incredible man.  He went through the whole forestry system and lived, talked and breathed forestry.  Many forests in this country surround lakes and are covering them over.  We have loads of trees in this country.  It causes controversy sometimes with the locals because it is too cluttered.  We should have breaks of 50 m in scenic areas where there is forestry.  There should be a lovely view down into the lake.  There are plenty of trees.  We do not have to cover everything.</p> <p>It is a fantastic industry and I miss it.  I thank the Minister of State for his presentation today.</p></speech>

This discussion is important because forestry is an important asset.  Truth be told, more people would talk about the Amazon rainforest than they do about our forest in this country.  Put simply, forests are lungs for human existence.  They take in carbon, which is good, and give out oxygen.  Policies that the Government pursues to increase forestry and planting in appropriate places are welcome.  In the Minister of State's speech, he talked about renewable energy, with biomass being part of the mix.  We see in forests that are well-kept, particularly traditional forests with traditional species native to our own country, that there is biodiversity with thriving wildlife and plants.  In my home town of Ballina, there has been a great collaborative effort between Coillte and the Belleek Forest enhancement committee.  They reintroduce native species and the red squirrel, which had departed.  They are thriving.  They were introduced a number of years ago.  As Senator Lawless said, it is thriving as a recreational asset too.  Many people go into the forest.  Pathways have been paved.  It is part of a greenway out of Ballina.  Everybody is so proud of it.  I welcome the work that has gone on with Coillte.  It is a real asset for visitors and the community.  That should be encouraged.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State's announcement last week of the latest payment rounds of forestry grants of &euro;17 million.  That means that, this year, &euro;56.8 million has been paid out in State grants for forestry.  We need to incentivise the growth of forests.  We know that the realisation of the value of the asset does not happen until the forest is fully matured.  Therefore, people have to be encouraged to plant trees.  If we do not encourage them and make payments, there is no incentive for people to tie up their land with forestry.  We have a great tradition of forestry in my county.  I give great credit to former Minister for Lands, Joseph Blowick.  He was in Clann na Talmhan, back in the 1940s and 1950s, and he laid the foundation stone for State participation in forestry.  In recent times, there has been accelerated investment because we have a better appreciation of climate change and the bio-economy the Minister of State referred to.  Joseph Blowick had a vision at the time about the role forestry could play in local economies.  There was land that lent itself to forest growing and otherwise was not in use.</p> <p>The kernel of what I would have to say here today relates to the issue of land use, and competing interests of forestry and farming and food production.  There are issues, without a doubt, even though having more forests is a desirable objective.  In counties where there is much forestry, for example, Leitrim and Mayo, there are legitimate concerns among communities that there is a forest but the spin-off is not really there for the local communities because all that happens is that the forest grows, the trees are cut and they are shipped out.  It is a pressing issue in Leitrim.  People are quite despondent when they see that what used to be a farm holding is taken over and planted.  They see it as a death knell to a household or farm family that lived there.  People are looking for more than what is on offer at the moment.  What I mean by that is, giving Mayo as a case, Coillte has a substantial holding in Mayo with a forest planted, and it fells trees when they are mature but they are put on a train from Ballina to Waterford.  No value is added to the local community other than premiums that farmers or landowners might receive or that they receive themselves.  We can talk about jobs and about that potential but it is not happening in the way that it should.  I ask the Minister of State to ask Coillte to look at these counties and to seek to deliver more to the local economy.</p> <p>I will give a stark example.  We have planning permission on the Asahi site near Killala in County Mayo.  It is for a combined heat and power plant which would involve the burning of wood and the drying of willow or such to make woodchips.  It has all the licences through the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  When the promoters were looking for the source of the raw material, Coillte would not sell to them.  They may have contracts elsewhere but my point is that we were going to have a very live and real proposition to create local jobs, both within the combined heat and power plant and also to people producing timber, and Coillte did not play ball.  It is shipping its wood elsewhere.  The only alternative for this company was importing biomass.  Talk about going contrary to the theory of reducing the carbon footprint.  I know that it is a State company independent of the Minister of State but it needs to be challenged on issues such as this.  It will show maps where it is doing good work but that is all in the south of the country.  If one is planting in the north of the country and the people see nothing for it, it is not acceptable.  Coillte needs to deliver more to counties Mayo and Leitrim and any other county in a similar situation.  Other than that, we will not achieve the worthwhile targets for the reasons that have been given for why forestry is desirable.  The Minister of State might respond to that.</p> <p>There is an issue with the farm-forest partnerships that Coillte entered into with landowners, over 20 years ago in some cases.  The Minister of State will recall an awful lot of farmers complaining that they signed up to deals with Coillte because it was a State company and they had confidence in it.  They really feel let down that they have not been dealt with in a transparent way.  Some did not have communication from Coillte for decades and did not receive payments.  We had Coillte management before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 27 February and they were to undertake a review of these partnership agreements.  What is the Minister of State's view on this?  What update can he give us on the review?  What communication has Coillte had with him?  Legitimate issues and concerns were raised about how Coillte was dealing with individuals.  I feel that the attitude of Coillte was that it had entered into an agreement, it was all signed up and is legally binding.  It did not involve people who had equal negotiating power.  Coillte has the legal and financial muscle and its behaviour towards the ordinary widow or widower, or whoever in the country has been persuaded to get involved in these partnerships, left a lot to be desired.  Will the Minister of State update us about what is happening?  A number of people are affected.  I look forward to the Minister of State's responses.</p></speech>

The one thing the previous speakers and I all have in common is that we would like to see more forestry in the right places in Ireland, which would require an increase in Government support for forestry.  Forestry is unsurprisingly a topic of great interest to me as an ecologist and to the Green Party.  As our agricultural model changes and adapts to a warming world and a globalised economy, forestry plays an ever-increasing role in supporting the income of farmers and managing our rural landscape.  I emphasise that we, as a party, support the principle of using forestry to enhance our natural habitants, mitigate climate change and provide income to farmers and other landowners in Ireland.  Forestry, when done right, can be an important social support, enhance the natural beauty of our island and provide habitats for species under threat.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a "but" of course.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with the work of the Save Leitrim campaign, as mentioned by my colleague, which opposes the blanketing of that stunning county in non-native coniferous spruce trees.  The campaign has highlighted the social, environmental and economic effects of this campaign over recent years.  Just this week I came across a video the group made comprising aerial shots of the dark monoculture plantations blotting out large areas, damaging soil and leaving devastation in the wake of the clear-cutting that removes every tree at once and leaves behind only debris.  The social effects of these policies are as concerning as the environmental side of the matter.  The people of Leitrim have talked of the feeling of a county emptying out, of people being replaced by dark, foreboding and unwelcoming plantations, of communities separated and of the mental health effects these rapid changes can have on people living there.  The very model that the Government is supporting is one at odds with European norms.  It damages our local communities and fosters such resentment towards forestry as a policy.</p><p>Another way is possible.  The Green Party&rsquo;s forestry policy has been in place for almost two decades, with some updates here and there, but based on the sound scientific principles that forestry should do more good than harm.  We want to see a genuinely popular model closer to that followed in Germany and other European countries, which increases afforested areas but enhances rather than degrades the communities in which the trees exist.  It is a model that prioritises continuous growth, which means that all the trees are not cut down in one massive cull rather harvested selectively, over time, and leaving continuous broadleaf cover in place.  Broadleaf forests made up of natural species would also help restore the natural habitats that existed across Ireland for millennia before the land clearances of the past centuries.  In areas of lower value land and high ecological importance, they can be a home for nature, a haven for species under threat and a way of restoring soils, stabilising water flows and preventing flooding and erosion.</p><p>There is a great disparity in forest cover between the south east, which enjoys considerable coverage, and the north west, which has almost none bar the commercial plantations of places like Leitrim.  This was mentioned by Senator Mulherin.  There are commercial and ecological reasons for this and the State may have a role to play in increasing coverage in areas where it might not be profitable for farmers and landowners to do so.  State supports and the help of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, will be essential in targeting this work, and the Government must do what it can to seek such assistance from the European Union, EU, in the next round of reforms to the CAP.  Commissioner Hogan will be in this Chamber tomorrow and I hope to present those points to him as well.</p><p>The State also has a role to play in the creation of national parks, as Senator Lawless mentioned, areas in which the primary responsibility of planting and management would be the Government's.  Such national parks would be huge natural tourism magnets and a national asset that would benefit Ireland, the global climate and the local communities through employment and leisure areas.  It is my belief that we need to be aiming at planting 20,000 ha of such forestry planted per year, and that we need to be very wary of any strong EU push for biomass for energy, considering the poor delivery of most biomass on climate-related assessment criteria.  Second and third generation biomass and biofuels will have a role to play but simple growing for burning is not without significant costs and negatives in almost all existing schemes.</p><p>I will conclude by saying that we need a new forestry plan that includes national parks, which stores carbon, restores wildlife, provides recreational access and improves water quality and flood management.  We need one that is done in consultation and with the full engagement of local communities, and which takes into account the importance of locals' mental health, sense of community and county pride.  With our partners in Europe and a major pivot from short-term profits to long-term social, environmental and economic gain, we can have a forestry policy and some beautiful forests to be proud of.</p><p>I have just come from a delivery at the front gate of tens of thousands of signatures to the Oireachtas.  It was organised by BirdWatch Ireland, An Taisce and the Irish bee federation.  They are here today because of their concerns about the Heritage Bill.  Speaking about forestry in Ireland, I often wonder if we take into account the amount of linear forestry running through our landscape, providing a huge benefit to wildlife and ecological services in general.  It contributes much economic benefit as well.  This is something that should be considered and when the Heritage Bill is discussed, hedgerows should be considered as part of our overall forestry capacity.</p></speech>

Most of the forests in Ireland are planted on marginal land in areas of the west and north west, where heavier soils and wetter climate limit profitable agricultural options.  Many experts point out that this land is simply not productive farmland and forestry offers the best return to the farmer, mainly due to the grants.  It also solves the country's carbon sequestration obligations.  Some of this is correct but negative realities must be addressed simultaneously.</p><p>The general model of forestry in Ireland is the planting of large expanses of Sitka spruce trees, and the total area of Sitka spruce in my area of Donegal is the second highest of all counties in the State.  The trees are planted very close together in rows, with open drainage shores running between them.  The Department's forestry grants cover the full cost of the planting and fencing of the land, and under the scheme, the landowner receives an annual payment of over &euro;500 per hectare for 15 years.  If a farmer plants his or her own land, he or she will also continue to receive the basic payment or entitlement under the Common Agricultural Policy, which is usually approximately &euro;200 per hectare on top of the forestry payment.</p><p>The reason for very generous Government assistance for forestry is to encourage it as a means of reaching our commitments on climate change, as trees are viewed as the only way to absorb and store carbon.  For a farmer struggling to make a living on wet, poor land in the west, it is an attractive option, as indeed it is for investment and pension funds.  Land can be bought cheaply and planting it brings the security of State funding and the 15 years of guaranteed payments.  As a Government policy, grant-aided monoculture afforestation is successful in getting more land under trees.The permanent change of land use is one of the clear consequences of this policy. <b></b>However, communities living in areas where forestry is replacing farming as a model of land use suffer negative impacts as there is very little labour involved in growing Sitka spruce.  In reality, it closes down the countryside.</p><p>Economic and social activity around traditional farming has significant spin-off in the local area, with services being provided to the farm and products and materials traded with the farm.  Normal farming activity creates opportunity, which in turn creates more activity.  On the other hand, the farm planted with Sitka spruce never needs new gates, fencing or anyone to cut fodder, bale and gather it in, or to plough for reseeding.  There are no animals to feed or care for and no need for a vet to look at an animal.  There is no need for anyone to upkeep habitat or hedges, fix machinery or maintain sheds.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Above all, a farm on which Sitka spruce is grown needs no farmer to go to the mart to meet other farmers or to call on neighbours when in need, because there are no needs.  The planted farm becomes deserted, wild and uninteresting.  The rural community that once survived on the micro-economy delivered in an area by the activity of farming suffers decline and also becomes deserted.  The economic activity created by planting, maintaining, thinning and processing conifers is very low as much of the industry is highly automated.  It is estimated that there is approximately one full-time job per 1,000 ha of forestry.  We, therefore, want a policy that encourages the establishment of local plant nurseries for job creation and to avoid having to import saplings or young trees.  For example, a system of credits for buying locally grown trees could be considered.</p><p>Farm after farm being planted in an area such as County Leitrim has a major environmental and visual impact which has been ignored, while the genuine complaints of local people are drowned out by the chorus from the State agencies about meeting our afforestation targets for climate change reasons.  When marginal land comes up for sale, local farmers who make a living from suckler cows and sheep find it difficult to complete a purchase because they are always outbid by the forestry companies, backed by hedge and pension funds.  Another problem created by our afforestation policy is the transfer of land ownership from local farmers to international corporate interests which engage forestry management companies to thin and maintain the forests.</p><p>Many farmers who plant the land themselves collect the annual grants for 15 years and are then offered a buyout by the forestry management companies on behalf of big corporate funds when the first thinning is carried out.  Such offers are hard to resist for ageing farmers as the next payment from the trees is 15 to 20 years away.  This move to corporate ownership of forestry land is happening apace and is supported by Government grants for carbon sequestration reasons.  Sinn F&eacute;in is calling for a 50 km radius limit for establishment grant and forestry premium payments.  This means that the recipient&rsquo;s main residence must be within 50 km of the forestry site.  For companies, the limit should apply to their main headquarters to ensure that the economic benefits of forestry are retained in the local area.</p><p>The timber industry in Ireland has been built around the Sitka spruce model of forestry.  The harvesting machinery, transport vehicles and the handling equipment in sawmills have all been developed for that type of timber.  However much of this fast-growing timber is of low value, with up to 50% of it going for pulp to make paper or for chipping.  Some of it is used for chipboard and fibreboard products and some is used as biomass and burned, which releases the carbon absorbed straight back into the atmosphere.  Fulfilling our climate change obligations is the reason offered for the high level of grants for forestry but the efficiency and effectiveness of the Sitka spruce forestry model as a carbon sink is in doubt.  I ask the Minister of State what studies have been carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the most beneficial crops for sequestration.  There are real worries that this model of conifer forestry is not delivering in terms of climate change.  Scarce public money is going to support the permanent change of land use to the benefit of an intensive timber industry under the guise of promoting carbon sequestration.  The knock-on effect of the forestry industry is a bad outcome for rural communities, with depopulation, declining numbers involved in farming and major changes to the rural landscape.  Ireland must move away from the Sitka spruce industrial model of forestry.  Where forestry is planted, it should be with a variety of mainly broadleaf species and continual cover such that trees are replanted as they are removed should be ensured.</p><p>There must be a fundamental change in policy direction by the Government.  The Department is involved in an aggressive afforestation strategy engaging the commercial private sector in a potentially dangerous way.  The concentration of forestry in certain geographical areas of mainly marginal land must end.  Different uses and management of land by farmers to absorb carbon more affectively must be developed and supported.  I would be obliged if the Minister of State would address the concerns raised by my party and I as well as the suggested policy solutions put forward by my party.</p></speech>

I warmly welcome the Minister of State.  What could be nicer than to have responsibility for food, forestry and horticulture and also come from the lovely County Wicklow.  I regularly walk in Avondale, which, as all Members know, was the home of Charles Stewart Parnell.  While walking there last Sunday I was struck by the vision and foresight for forestry of Parnell and his great contemporary, Horace Plunkett.  They had a vision of setting up a forestry school, engaging with foresters and taking young people out of school, probably predominantly young men at that time although there are now men and women in this profession.  It is to that approach that we must return.  We must discuss their vision.</p> <p>I acknowledge the work of Coillte, which gets a lot of stick but runs a very slick, professional and commercially viable operation.  It is the custodian of over 440,000 ha, which is an enormous block of land and forestry.  Over the past 30 years it has built on that and focused on maximising the financial business model.  It is now also beginning to address the social model in regard to how we can exploit this amazing national and natural resource.  The sustainability of forests and communities, in particular rural communities, is key.  I acknowledge what the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association has been championing in regard to some of the work in Leitrim because I have been on-site there and have seen the mass blanket of forestry.  I have heard the stories of small farmers with ambition to buy another few fields but who have not been able to do so, predominantly because they had to compete with the private forestry sector which wishes to continue to grow its business.  I have no problem with people growing their business but it must be done in a sustainable manner.</p> <p>I acknowledge that Coillte has a very good graduate training programme but it must expand to accommodate transition year students and allow young secondary school students to access placements because we must engender a love for the business of forestry and horticulture.</p> <p>Greater emphasis should be placed on nursery stock production because we all know that if one does not have good quality healthy seed and nursery stock initially to plant, one will not reap the benefits of that forestry.  That is of particular importance.  I would like greater possibilities and that student internships and internship programmes are maximised.  The Minister of State should consider that.</p> <p>I will not talk too much about carbon credits but I read a paper this morning by Fine Gael MEP, Se&aacute;n Kelly, who has done an extraordinary amount of work in the European Parliament in respect of carbon credits and has been slowly and quietly advocating for them.</p> <p>We should concentrate on training and apprenticeship and consider bringing people to this country to become involved in forestry or allow those who are here trying to be processed and who want to learn a new trade to do so in forestry.  Let us prepare for the future because if we must expand the forestry cover of in this country, we must also expand and develop the work force and knowledge base.</p> <p>Forestry in Ireland must include some broadleaf trees but many Members know that the growing of broadleafs, such as oak is a very long process.  I recently walked through an oak forest in Delgany.  Those trees are over 200 years old and less than half the height of this building.  They are slow to grow and are a very long-term project.  Their growth should be encouraged but there must be a balance between sustainability and viability.</p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn's point in terms of acknowledging the pressures that small rural communities are coming under as a result of blanket forestry is well made.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I say well done to the Minister of State and thank him for his ongoing engagement in this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#V00200"><p>I thank all Senators for their contributions.  In response to Senator Boyhan's comments, most of the people I come across in the Department, within the industry and in the wider forestry sector have a passion about it.  I must declare an interest at this point; my son is in his final year of forestry at University College Dublin.  Last week they were in the Black Forest looking at the whole aspect of continuous cover forestry.</p> <p>In a few weeks I will travel to the Finnish Forest Research Institute, where the main species of trees are birch and the conifers, Norway and Scots pine.  There are a lot of things we need to get into context.  In my opening statement I tried to cover all areas of the economic, social and environmental benefits.  If people take the time to study what has actually transpired from the mid-term review and some of the other work we are doing with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and with others around framework directives, they will see that there is a comprehensive policy.  All plantations, following the mid-term review, have a minimum of 15% broadleaf.  They can be put in a position and located.  Every forest site will have to be managed individually.  They can act as buffers - as aqua zones - when closer to houses, and as scenic areas.  In reality, if the conifer plantation is part of it then it can be incorporated behind all of that.</p> <p>Senator Wilson spoke of a number of places.  In Kingscourt, at the Old Cabra estate in his area, a significant amount of money has been invested with the NeighbourWood scheme.  We will continue to invest in these and others.   I was at one of the NeighbourWood schemes in Balla, County Mayo.  There is another one around the Vartry Reservoir at Roundwood.  A drone has captured footage of what has happened since before it opened.  It is located around the scenic lakes and it incorporates some 20 km of walkways so there is a lot of work being done on that whole area.</p> <p>With regard to the green ribbon campaign and the Let's Talk and Walk events, I have been on a couple of these walks at Avondale House Forest Park.  People have said that we should do more of these but part and parcel of the experience is that it encourages people to get out and about.  It is a primer in many ways.  On one of the occasions that I went out - I am a Wicklow man all right - I knew the former forest manager who was passionate about the history of Avondale.  He conducted a walk and gave us the whole history of the initiatives that took place there in the early part of the 20th century.  He also told us about Samuel Hayes, the original owner, who wrote the definitive book on forestry in Ireland back in the late 18th century.</p> <p>Senator Lawless spoke of those who think one can just plant trees and forget about them.  This was a symptom of the early days - in the late 1980s and early 1990s - of the afforestation programme.  The target then was to get 10,000 ha planted.  At this stage we have 21,000 private landowners.  This is 48% and heading to 50% of the total forest estate that will be in private ownership.  Last year we had a pilot project on knowledge transfer groups where 270 to 280 farmers took part.  There is another pilot scheme on forest certification.  We hope to roll out both of these pilots over the next period and it is part and parcel of the programme in the mid-term review.</p> <p>With regard to tax provisions, premia and revenue received from forestry is free from capital gains for income tax.  Previously it was taxable at &euro;80,000.  I am aware that some people have a problem with the replanting obligation but it is there because the owner has been given those tax incentives to promote it.  Our target is to increase afforestation cover.  It would seem wrong that having been a recipient of all those supports one could walk away and be able to restore the land to non-forestry uses.</p> <p>I have been to Leitrim a number of times.  I say this because it has come up on a number of occasions.  There are some 500 jobs supported by the wood sector and it is one of the biggest employers in the area.  Masonite is located there as are saw millers and hauliers.  Some 380 farmers receive &euro;2 million per year in premium payments.  The north west has Masonite and ECC, which is just across the border from Mayo in Galway.  These facilities have the biggest sawmills and timber processing standalone plants in the State.  I do not have the figures but they are probably the biggest consumers of the wood product.  Senators Grace O'Sullivan and P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn made the point about the production of timber for biomass energy.  It is a secondary product.  It is not the main product in most cases.  Forestry for fibre is a case in point for the likes of the plant that Senator Mulherin mentioned.  The forestry for fibre grants have increased significantly, and they have extended from ten to 15 years, to encourage that use.  With the combination of the renewable heat incentive scheme we hope it encourages a far greater uptake.  I believe it is a way of working with local communities for combined heat and power plants, especially for high demand heat industries and businesses.</p> <p>I will now turn to the issue of Coillte and the landowners' payments.  In fairness, Coillte has put its hands up and said that there was a serious lack of communication.  It has presented to me on 6 February and to the committee some time after that.  Coillte has engaged KPMG and it has said that nobody who was owed money under those contracts is now owed money and that they have communicated directly with everyone involved.  There was an amount of work that had been lax in its management structures, a fact that has been acknowledged by Coillte.</p> <p>Going back to Leitrim, 27% of Leitrim is covered in broadleaf forest.  In 2016 the average holding was 25 ha and the average plantation was 6 ha.  This puts it into context.  I acknowledge that some of the older plantations are blanket cover.  As I have already outlined, if and when those various plantations are clear-felled they will have different setback areas, different species mix and the network of roads within the area will also create open spaces.  Between the time they close in and the first thinning it is true that plantations from year seven to year 18 do look like blanket coverage, but the introduction to every plantation of the 15% broadleaf - as opposed to 10% - and with up to 15% biodiverse areas it will fundamentally change the appearance of it.</p> <p>I come from a county with the highest density of plantations.  I am surrounded by it and I planted some myself on marginal land.  I go back to the point that the real basic aspect is that we want people to consider farming as part of their enterprise; not an either-or situation.  It is really the only way we can get the afforestation numbers up.  I accept that in some parts of the State it may seem attractive.  Non-farmers are defined as sons and daughters or brothers and sisters of farmers, or retired farmers.  In 2016 only 126 ha was planted by what we would define as corporate.  There is an issue around the semi-mature plantations being bought and people selling.  In some ways they are not realising the value of what they have.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Andrew Doyle:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why the knowledge transfer, the forest felling tool and all of those supports, and the encouragement of producer groups, are being supported by the Department to make people aware of it.  The Coillte partnerships were the first departure along the lines of some form of equity release post premia and then a share of the clear-fell revenue.  I think there is space and a real opportunity to make that work so that people do not sell themselves short.  It is not in the State's interest for timber to be clear-felled prematurely, because the amount of investment by the State is based on getting the maximum yield, be that in year 30, 35 or 40, or much longer in the case of broadleaves.  It is in everybody's interests that we would support that and let forest owners know that there are options other than just washing their hands of it in the sense of wanting to get out once they have got the premium.  That is a mistake.  In Scandinavia in particular all farmers have some plantation and they see that as part of their farm enterprise but they have a tradition that we do not have so they have a greater understanding.  That is something we must encourage and support.</p><p>Senator Mac Lochlainn and another speaker made a point about continuous cover forestry.  Under the mid-term review, the woodland improvement scheme and the native woodland conservation scheme incorporate continuous cover forestry for mixed broadleaves in particular.  They are eligible for three woodland improvement scheme payments of &euro;750 for three separate interventions over a period of 12 years, once the work is in line with the approved transformation under the continuous cover for forest plan.  It has been recognised, and to go back to the opening statement, we have introduced the new mid-term review changes to the scheme with the full approval of DG Environment in Europe.  The officials were put to the sword on this one and were very anxious that we would get broadleaf plantations up to 30%.  The mid-term review has addressed a lot of the concerns that existed.</p><p>On the one hand we had people saying it was disappointing that we had not reached 10,000 ha while on the other hand we had people concerned about the location and density more so than the amount.  One of the issues that has been very apparent from the challenges in increasing the numbers is that the fear on broadleaves was of not being able to get them established, so the protections that are there for broadleaves such as deer fencing and tree protection covers are specifically to deal with that.  On the other hand, more particularly with conifer plantations, competing uses have been the biggest challenge.  We have 21,000 landowners who have planted so we are working off a diminishing platform.  We have gone from 1.5% to 10.5%.  We want to get to 18% but it is like trying to knock seconds off a world record.  One gets down to fractions of seconds and then hundreds of seconds, so one is working off a diminishing platform.  That is probably the biggest single reason we have not been able to reach the figures.  It is one of them anyway.  The agritaxation changes have made it very attractive to lease land for 15 years plus, so it is comparable.  In general, there is enough land for everything, appropriately placed.  There is enough land to reach the target of 30% broadleaves with conifers as the driver of the economic part.</p><p>In terms of sequestration, both conifers and broadleaves on maturity store about the same amount of carbon.  In a way, the difference is that conifers reach maturity quicker, then they have a harvest and replant so there is a net impact in that regard.  I gave the figures on carbon storage earlier.  It is in everybody's best interests - economic, social and environmental, that we support this programme - that programmes will follow in 2021 and that we will continue in this vein.</p><p>We have an open mind if there are problems.  I have spoken to representative groups from all quarters - the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, foresters, the promotion people and everybody else.  In the mid-term review we had a consultation period and everybody was entitled to make a submission on it.  We have tried our best to address all of the concerns and at the same time to encourage afforestation.</p><p>I have a list of the promotional events we organised.  We had 21 information days.  We sent mailshots to 4,000 forest owners with a new afforestation leaflet.  We did radio advertising.  I have done a series of interviews, some of which were more challenging than others.  The Department produced a newsletter.  We have Farm TV, and we were responsible for miscellaneous articles in various publications.  We are trying to raise awareness.  It is about going back to the farmer, the landowner, which brings in rural communities.  This is meant to be part of the farm enterprise.  Farmers must profile their own farm and work out if some of it could yield them money, and build an asset which would yield a return to them or their successors and allow them to enhance the remainder of the farm without compromising the productivity of the conventional farming enterprise.  I think it can and I think that is something we should look at.</p><p>I referred to a farm of 25 ha where 6 ha was planted, which is a quarter.  That is probably typical although in some places it might be less and in other places more.  I would encourage people to get behind afforestation and look at the facts and the reality.  The debate does get very passionate in parts of the country.  I appreciate that.  I have done my best not to provoke anybody, but I come from a county that has a higher tree density than anywhere else in the country so I have some authority in being able to speak about the experience.  We have had a culture of afforestation since the 1950s.  We have had sawmills and people working in timber, garden sheds, post and rail mills for structural wood production and people working with what is now Coillte.  It has been part and parcel of what I grew up with, although I accept it may be different for others.  It is something that can be of benefit if it is managed correctly.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#Z00300"><p>I thank the House for this important opportunity to update Members on housing and related matters.   In view of the time available, I will not address every single issue in housing but I look forward to coming back to any questions Members have.</p> <p>The top-line figures for house building are going in the right direction.  Planning permissions for 20,776 homes were granted to the end December 2017, up 27% year on year.  Commencement notices for over 18,500 new homes were submitted, an annual increase of 41% in the year to the end of February 2018.  BER figures show that 2,367 housing units were built during the first three months of the year, an increase of 45% on the same time last year, not including self-builds.  ESB connections in 2017 totalled just under 20,000, an annual increase of more than 30% in the year to the end of February 2018.  Since early 2014, this has increased by 128%.  Finally, registrations have increased to 9,521 units, which is 46% up on the 12 months to February 2017.</p> <p>The growing numbers show that house building and supply are moving in the right direction, rapidly and dramatically on a year-on-year basis.  Growing employment in the construction industry is further evidence of increased confidence and buoyancy in the housing sector.  Employment levels of skilled tradesmen in the construction sector was estimated at 83,000 in the first quarter of 2017, which is up by 14% on the same period in 2016.  The volume of production in the residential construction sector has been growing at an annual average rate of 22% since its low point in the fourth quarter of 2012.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, volume increased by 16.3%.  The Central Bank, in its quarterly bulletin for the first quarter of 2018, forecasts that both housing and non-residential building should continue to recover strongly.  For 2018 and 2019, according to the Central Bank, residential construction investment is expected to increase strongly, with approximately 23,000 and 27,000 new homes being built, respectively.</p> <p>The building of local authority homes is increasing rapidly and the target for the 2018 build is 4,696 homes, which is more than 50% higher than the 2017 target.  This will increase again in 2019 to 6,385 units, a further 30%, and continue to grow to a target of 8,907 in 2021.  The social housing build programme is ramping up, as is evident in the fourth quarter of 2017 construction status report.  At end-2017, 2,512 homes were completed, 3,650 were under construction and 1,912 further homes were about to go on site, with the remainder progressing through the various stages of planning, design and procurement.  Whether it is social housing homes, forecasts from the Central Bank or notices submitted to my Department and local authorities, the statistics show a dramatic increase in the number of homes being built across the country.</p> <p>We also provide ongoing social housing supports in the rental sector and almost 26,000 households had their housing needs met last year, with 100 households having their housing needs met every working day in 2017.  A further 18,000 households are targeted for support under these schemes in 2018.  The figure for last year is made up of rental accommodation scheme, RAS, numbers, housing assistance payments, HAPs, builds, acquisitions, leasing, voids, regeneration and all the different delivery streams we have for house building and social housing in the State.</p> <p>On the whole, there is no doubt that all the evidence points to real progress in terms of housing delivery.  Most important, last week we saw a significant reduction in people sleeping rough of 40%.  Last November there were 184 individuals sleeping rough and now there are 110.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This reduction in people sleeping rough, in many ways our most vulnerable people who are homeless, is welcome.  It follows the dedicated and compassionate work of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, working with our partner organisations to increase the services available in the Dublin region.  There is still more to do because we still have many people sleeping rough on our streets.  Many of those accessing homeless services have complex needs and require other supports, notably health supports, to assist them to exit our homeless services.  Housing First is best international practice for getting people out of homelessness.  That is why earlier this year I appointed a national director for Housing First and increased its funding allocation.  I thank Mr. Bob Jordan for the excellent work he has done so far this year.  He is delivering results, and pilot programmes are now being progressed in other parts of the country, including Cork, Limerick and Galway.  My Department is also leading the homelessness inter-agency group which involves a range of Departments and the NGO sector.  This process is showing a number of inter-agency issues which need to be addressed to tackle homelessness more effectively.  I will bring forward policy proposals upon receipt of the first report of the inter-agency group which I expect later this month from the group&rsquo;s independent chair, Mr John Murphy.</p><p>The continued presentation of families to emergency accommodation is a source of serious ongoing concern for me.  I am pleased that we have been able to exit so many families from hubs and hotels.  The reasons behind the homeless figures are complicated but are linked to the collapse of our house building sector and the severe supply shortage associated with that collapse.  The staff in my Department and across the system, in local authorities and NGOs, are putting in a huge amount of work to help people and families in homelessness.  Last year, more than 4,700 adults exited homelessness.  Of the more than 100 families who presented in Dublin in February, only 20 were accommodated in hotels.  During 2017, more than 2,000 families left hotels for sustainable tenancies and the majority of those families into homes.  I saw this incredible work first-hand during the severe weather events in January and February of this year.  During that time, the people dealing with  homelessness were in work helping to provide emergency shelter.  I pay particular thanks to our partners in the NGO sector who, with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the Department, do so much to help prevent people from entering homelessness, provide supports for those who are in difficulties and help us to exit people into sustainable long-term accommodation.  The emergency response was extraordinary and I have no doubt that lives were saved on our streets as a result.</p><p>While homelessness is often the worst manifestation of the housing challenge, the underlying issues of housing are supply, access and affordability.  That supply shortage cuts across the entire housing system into social housing, starter homes,  affordable rental options and larger family homes for trading up, not to mention smaller apartments for singles and couples that are desperately needed throughout the country.  In terms of understanding where the Irish housing system is currently and the progress being made to get it where it needs to be, it has to be put in some context where we have come from.  What we are seeing today are the symptoms of one the last legacies of the economic collapse.  As we know, that collapse was closely linked to a property bubble and related credit issues within our banking sector.  As a result, those sectors were severely impacted.  The result was that residential construction collapsed by 90%, only a handful of social and affordable homes were being built, virtually no starter home estates were being built, there were unfinished housing developments that had to be knocked down and employment in construction fell by two thirds. The residential construction sector in Ireland was deeply impacted and it was clear that it would take a major concerted effort over time to rebuild it.  Importantly, Rebuilding Ireland, built upon the work carried out by the special Oireachtas committee on housing and which was the subject of very broad stakeholder consultation, is in place and is showing the results, some of which I have alluded to.</p><p>The building of new social housing by local authorities and approved housing bodies is ramping up dramatically, as I have said.  These numbers do not include new builds under Part V, voids, acquisitions or long-term leases, so the actual stock of new social housing coming on stream is larger again.  Roughly 7,000 new homes in all in 2017 were delivered into the social housing stock for local authorities to take people off the housing lists into both local authority homes and housing body homes.  With the additional funding I secured last year, we have increased the overall level of ambition under Rebuilding Ireland in the period to 2021, rebalancing delivery more towards construction projects.  Overall, the Government has committed &euro;6 billion to support the accelerated delivery of 50,000 additional social housing homes by the end of 2021, through building 33,500 new homes, acquiring 6,500 new homes and leasing 10,000 new homes under the various programmes.  In addition, the housing assistance payment and rental accommodation scheme will continue to play an important part in meeting social housing needs.</p><p>In terms of housing supply more generally, the Government has undertaken a co-ordinated set of targeted actions aimed at encouraging arid incentivising house building at scale again.  For example, we have the approved investment of &euro;200 million in key enabling infrastructure to open up strategic public and private sites for early development; updated, streamlined and de-risked the planning and regulatory regime to progress major house and apartment developments; approved arrangements for development finance to be made available to house builders; and put in place a help to buy scheme to help first-time buyers with their deposit.  After a lot of hard work there are really encouraging signs that home building is recovering.  All supply indicators are showing encouraging trends, as I stated at the outset.</p><p>Ireland is a great success story today, having bounced back incredibly well from the downturn.  With growth of 5.6% forecast and unemployment set to reach 5.8%, the demand for housing will also grow.  Therefore, while the increased activity and supply is very encouraging, it is important that we continue to drive the implementation of Rebuilding Ireland and increase housing supply.  It is also crucial that the new housing is increasingly affordable and accessible to those who need it.  When I took over as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government I initiated a review of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  At the time, I made a firm commitment that housing access and affordability would be a central focus of my work.  As supply is increasing, the Government is committed to ensuring that people throughout Ireland can access affordable housing based on their ability to pay.  For households, particularly those renting in our cities and urban areas and trying to save to buy their first home, this can be a real challenge.  Increasingly in our modern society, people want a choice of affordable homes to rent and buy, depending on their stage of life and circumstances.  Our housing system needs to provide attractive options for both.  The new affordable housing measures I signalled in January are specifically targeted at delivering more affordable homes.  The emphasis is on delivering affordable homes from our State landbank in urban areas where affordability issues are greatest.  Initial indications from local authorities in the main target counties highlight the potential for almost 4,000 affordable homes from their land.  The target is for the delivery of at least 10,000 new affordable homes in the medium to long term.</p><p>I will be commencing the necessary legislation for the affordable purchase scheme next week, and I expect to see more local authority sites coming forward thereafter.  To deliver these affordable homes, local authorities will need to maximise the potential yields from their landbank.  To assist them in this, I have secured additional funding of &euro;25 million for infrastructure on their sites to facilitate affordable housing provision.  The call for proposals for this funding will issue to local authorities shortly.  Additionally, as part of the budget for 2018, I announced that an additional &euro;50 million in Exchequer funding will be available for a second local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, call.  This will be subject to matching funding by local authorities, bringing the total available to &euro;66.5 million.  The criteria for the second call are being finalised and I expect to announce phase 2 of LIHAF soon.  Already 30 major public infrastructure projects have received final approval under the first phase of LIHAF.  These projects will activate the delivery of almost 20,000 new homes across public and private sites by 2021.  More than 28%, or some 5,600 of these 20,000 new homes, will be social or affordable homes.  In addition, a further 5,600 of the homes will have a LIHAF related cost reduction and another 8,800 will be sold at market rates, greatly increasing supply and with many in locations offering very good affordability.</p><p>In January 2018, I also launched the new local authority home loan.  Eligible first-time buyers can now access affordable mortgages from local authorities with fixed interest rate options of 2% to 2.25% for terms of up to 30 years.  Recent activity figures show the interest in the mortgage is very high, with more than 90,000 visits to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan website and 1,350 application forms having been downloaded.</p><p>A thriving rental sector is crucial in a modern and growing country such as ours.  As reported recently, I am progressing legislative changes to give effect to a number of new actions.  The changes will provide the regulatory framework to enhance and strengthen the powers and functions of the Residential Tenancies Board.  We also need to ensure that the rental sector, especially in our cities and major urban areas, is accessible and affordable.  To ensure this we need to invest in a different type of rental offering, a so-called cost rental sector, which operates between the social and private market sectors.  Other modern European cities like Vienna, where I used to live, have delivered cost rental homes into the market at scale over many years, making a sustainable long-term impact on housing affordability.  We know from the national planning framework that Ireland will need to provide more than 500,000 new homes to accommodate our growing population and workforce between now and 2040.  We need to ensure there are enough rental options at affordable rents to make our cities attractive as places to live as well as work as we implement these plans.  I am determined to deliver a major cost rental project in Dublin in the short term and then roll it out more broadly.  We are learning from pilot projects which are helping to shape the model for future larger-scale versions.  We are working with the European Investment Bank and other key stakeholders with a view to announcing the first major cost rental project in Dublin city shortly, with a programme of cost rental projects across Dublin and other cities to follow.</p><p>Ireland is recovering positively from the crippling economic downturn, the economy is growing and we are reaching for full employment.  It is crucial that, as we grow, we match the demand for housing with supply that is accessible and affordable.  By any supply measures and given our starting point, real progress is being made under Rebuilding Ireland.  Of course we continue to face very challenging circumstances when it comes to increasing numbers in homeless emergency accommodation.  Some additional measures will be announced shortly on that.  While there are different ways to measure housing output, all indicators of home building activity are trending positively.  Housing is a top priority for me and the Government, and we are determined to repair and reform one of the sectors of our economy and society worst impacted by the downturn.  All efforts are now being concentrated towards increasing output, particularly in terms of affordable homes to rent and to buy.</p></speech>

I know he is a very busy man.  It is good to be busy, and I am busy, but it is not good to be busy if nothing is getting done.  I am not saying the Minister is doing nothing.  Far from it.  I know how hard he is working, but I have concerns.</p> <p>Housing is the key issue facing this Government.  It is not about personalities.  It is about real political priorities on which the Government has failed.  Homelessness has reached unprecedented levels, surging rents are at historic heights, home building numbers are tens of thousands behind where they should be and some 85,000 people are on the social housing waiting list.  All the while, ordinary workers cannot afford a place to own.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il is using the confidence and supply agreement to press for a policy shift to establish an affordable housing scheme, increase social housing spending and strengthen the rental sector.  The Government has to start delivering on housing.  After four separate plans and over a dozen launches, we need to see bricks and mortar in the ground.</p> <p>We have the four pillars in Rebuilding Ireland.  However, the flagging Rebuilding Ireland plan is behind target already.  Supply and affordability is the key issue that must be addressed to get to grips with the crisis in the private, social and rental sector.</p> <p>I welcome the news this morning about the new national regeneration and development agency, NRDA, being given the powers to buy State and semi-State lands for development for housing but I urge that there would not be a repeat of over the odds payment for those sites.  Nobody needs to get rich from that.  We just need housing.</p> <p>When the Minister outlined his expectations last week for the delivery of social housing to local authorities, with targets of almost 5,000 units including 249 in Cork city, 115 in Carlow, 165 in Waterford and 153 in Limerick - those are the few I want to mention - there was no timescale or sense of what might happen if those targets were not met or an indication of when they would be met.  I need clarification on that because it reminded me of Groundhog Day.  Last year, when the Minister was in Carlow, he turned the sod on the sites he announced the other day.  He had already gone to those sites.  What we have is the 115 houses in Carlow, which I welcome-----</p></speech>

We actually turned the sods at that time.  Work has started on some of the houses - I will give credit where credit is due - but they were last year's targets.  I need the Minister to know that.</p> <p>Let us not highlight what many of us believe are targets which fall very far short of our current waiting lists.  It is great to have a plan and a goal but as we all know, having a goal is just not enough.  There must be real incentives.  What incentives or carrot or stick approach is the Minister using to ensure delivery of those units?  I see great plans in my area but nobody is all packed, with keys dangling from their wrists.  There is no delivery of houses.</p> <p>We have a massive problem in Carlow because contrary to popular opinion, we are close enough to Dublin for people to commute.  People are buying houses in our county and renting out the remainder.  There is hardly a house left that we can buy through the local authority or that people are buying, and waiting lists are growing almost daily.  What firm handle is the Minister applying to these planned targets because that is what we need now?</p> <p>I know the Minister is aware that this is a serious issue but we have serious issues to deal with and before we engage in the usual back and forth debate on who is at fault, we need to draw a breath.  We cannot sit here and argue among ourselves, blaming the current political players for the actions of past political players.  We are not playing a history game.  We should rise above that and look at the massive issues at hand.</p></speech>

I am getting there.  Almost 10,000 people are homeless, more than 3,000 of them are  children.  We are a rich country so if money is not a problem, what is the problem?  Homeless numbers are high.  Home building numbers are tens of thousands behind what they should be.  Ordinary workers cannot afford a home and those who have secured a mortgage are struggling.  We are struggling here, Minister.</p> <p>I and my party are calling on the Minister and his party to make changes, make a policy shift to establish an affordable housing scheme, increase social housing spending and strengthen the rental sector.  This Government has to start delivering on housing.  After four separate plans and over a dozen launches, it needs to put bricks and mortar in the ground.  People need that.  They do not need announcements and fancy photo opportunities.  They need houses, and we need to see them getting the keys for their houses.</p> <p>Supply and affordability is the key issue that must be addressed in order to get to grips with the crisis in the private, social and rental sector.  In 2017, and this frightens me, only 60 apprentices registered for bricklaying and stone laying and 34 for plastering.  That is far short of what is required to meet even the Government's target of a limit of 25,000 housing units.  We are falling down in terms of the supply of bricklayers and stone layers.  How can we build if we do not have builders?  We need urgent action on</p> <p>that.  We need incentives to lure our builders back from Canada, Australia and America.  We need to examine why those who have worked abroad and raised money for a deposit for their own homes are not qualifying for a mortgage because our banks will not take rent payments as proof of ability to pay.  That is a major issue, and it is one of the biggest issues the Minister will have to deal with in the future.  We have so much to examine but we need to work together on this issue.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il has been working with the Minister's Government in a confidence and supply agreement on this issue and we will continue to put forward costed, credible ideas to work out all the layers of this complicated crisis.  The vacant housing Bill has the potential to bring 4,000 new units into the system by streamlining planning for above-shop unit spaces.  We have already put forward a new Bill to give the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, investigatory powers to reinforce rent pressure zones, RPZs.  This week, we have approved a new Bill to extend rent pressure zones to purpose built student accommodation.  I would argue that we need to look at the pockets of rent surges throughout the country and at rolling out rent pressure zones outside the commuter belts.</p> <p>On 17 April the Minister announced a tenancy Bill in the Cabinet which states that any landlord in rent pressure zones will commit an offence if they increase the rent above 4%.  I am very disappointed today.  I have raised that issue with the Minister on several occasions.  Our neighbouring counties, Wicklow and Kildare, are in rent pressure zones but Laois, Kilkenny, Wexford and Carlow are not in rent pressure zones.  In terms of what has happened, the Department has put together a plan and neighbouring counties are in rent pressure zones but Carlow, my constituency, Kilkenny, Laois and Wexford are not in those rent pressure zones.  That is unacceptable and I have highlighted that for the Minister on several occasions.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports measures which have legislation to empower the RTB to undertake its own investigations, with the Social Democrats, to strengthen RPZs.  We are also putting forward a new Bill to limit rent increases in student accommodation to 4%, which is the case in all rent pressure zones.  However, those steps will not address the rent crisis.  What is needed is a comprehensive cost rental model in cities across Ireland.  That should use State lands to provide cheap, affordable units to rent for average income earners.</p> <p>This tinkering around the edges will not resolve the crisis.  I have said it twice but I cannot emphasise enough the importance of building houses.  We need to examine why we are always playing catch-up on this crisis.  We are late to every battle on it, and something has to change.  Reactive policy has meant the State is always behind.  We cannot continue as people die on our streets and stress breaks up families, especially those in arrears with their mortgages.</p> <p>The Minister might ask what my party would do differently if we were in his shoes.  I will tell him.  We would increase the capital budget.  It is still 24% below 2008 levels.  A new housing agency would be established that would run efficiently and make clear decisions.  We would use NAMA and bank share proceeds to invest in social housing.  We would look at the possibility of loans from credit unions.  The issue of credit unions and so on must be addressed because there is an issue with mortgages.  The Minister has brought in a new mortgage for first-time buyers.  I do not have time to go through that with him but the people who need to qualify for that are not qualifying.  There are so many restrictions attached to this new mortgage that most people are not qualifying for it.</p></speech>

From time to time, though, there are frustrations about the slowness of the process.  Undoubtedly, even the Minister is frustrated in that regard and is eager to move the situation on.  I acknowledge his commitment to this.</p><p>The Minister is present, so I will repeat something that I said last week because I want him to hear it from me directly.  I am disappointed by the targets that have been set for the 31 local authorities with the agreement of their chief executives and the Minister.  Those targets are not ambitious.  I took the time to read the Department's website and some of the Minister's speeches provided thereon.  It is an excellent website.  The Minister referred to stretching people and being ambitious.  The figures before us are the minimum ones.  For example, 115 units are to be built in Carlow in 2018.  Lest there be ambiguity, these are the figures of the direct social housing build.  There are other forms, of course.  As I have stated time and again in the Chamber and at the committee, I do not have a hang-up about who builds houses, be it local authorities, approved housing bodies, AHBs, co-operatives, private bodies, public ones or public private partnerships.  I do not have a problem with any of those.  We want to build new homes that are affordable to rent and purchase.  The Minister agrees fully with that.</p><p>Consider the figures, though.  Cavan's is 41, Clare's is 29, Cork city's is 249 and Cork county's is 235.  Kilkenny's is 98, Longford's is 44, Mayo's is 69 and Offaly's is 19.  These are the agreed targets for social housing.  Undoubtedly, the Minister will say that there are other aspects.  Wicklow's figure is 156.  All of the areas' figures are listed and have been published in the media and via the Minister's press release.</p><p>The social housing construction projects status report for the fourth quarter of 2017 is interesting.  Today, <i>The Irish Times</i>published a timely article and released figures, which I have checked with the Department.  There were 780 social houses built in 2017.  I am open to correction.</p></speech>

I am not referring to AHB builds but local authority builds.  I take on board the Minister's assertion that this figure is not correct, but he might confirm whether it is correct to say that 1,757 voids were brought back into use.  That would be a good and impressive figure.  As reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>, 543 of that number were in Dublin city, 168 were in Donegal and 121 were in Fingal.  That is an achievement and a positive news story and I would be interested in hearing the Minister's thoughts on it.  Rather than citing the article any further, the Minister might circulate in the next few days the correct figure for the direct social housing build in 2017.</p><p>I acknowledge the positives that are happening.  Cork is in the national media today.  We read that plans for 600 new homes are to be submitted to Cork City Council next month, making it the authority's landmark project to tackle the housing shortage on Leeside.  The 22 acre site will be the single largest housing development in the city.  We must concentrate on positive news, and this is positive news.  In conjunction with the city council, Cork County Council has drafted major plans for new council designs.  This is also positive.  It is important that we use every model to develop housing.</p><p>All of the Members present are close to our 959 or so local councillors throughout the country.  The Minister used to be a council member, so he also has this experience.  He also has significant levels of contact with his group across the 31 councils.  Councillors are frustrated with the slowness of the process.  Some of the chief executives and housing authorities are frustrated.  Everyone wants progress and to be positive, so what is the problem?  Can we increase the level of direct builds?</p><p>I read something else today.  All of this information is coming from the media, so I would like the Minister to correct me if I am wrong.  The Taoiseach commented on the possibility of the Government acquiring more private land.  That is not necessary.  I have taken the time to have an assessment done of some of our local authorities' landbanks.  The Minister knows the details from his own research.  There are substantial landbanks on most of the authorities' books.  As such, we must ask why the Government is not pushing for a greater level of social housing building on council lands.  It is what the public wants and expects.  I do not wish to frustrate the private sector in this regard, but it is important that we embark on an ambitious plan.  I am familiar with a number of social housing schemes in the Dublin and Kildare areas that were built in the 1950s and 1960s.  Some comprised 300 houses.  I am not suggesting that we want schemes with 300 houses now, but their planners were ambitious.  The Minister is ambitious as well, but I am not convinced that we have set the targets for local authorities high enough.  I would be interested in the Minister's response.  What sanctions can he bring to bear on a local authority that does not perform on what are very low targets?</p><p>I do not wish to dwell on this matter any further because I am conscious that the Minister is busy and I have other opportunities through the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government to engage with him.  I thank him for that ongoing engagement.</p><p>How can we work better with elected members of local authorities and council management?  The Minister cannot micromanage the local authorities, but he can incentivise them.  He also has the power to sanction them, even though he might not want to use it.

I constantly go around in circles on this topic trying to figure out solutions.  I hate to hear other parties and the media claiming that Fine Gael does not have a social conscience and that other parties have the monopoly on concern and care for people who are struggling with the housing crisis.  We all know that is not the case.  The Government, the larger part of which is Fine Gael, is working tirelessly to improve the situation.  That includes the Minister and his predecessor, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney.</p> <p>I wish to ask a series of questions instead of pontificating about what the Minister should and should not do.  I hope he can answer them.  If not, perhaps he will send me a letter or email about them later.</p> <p>Why can we not just instruct councils to build where they have land?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If they come back and say that they do not have the staff and that is why they cannot build, why can we as a Government not allow them to recruit?  If money is not an issue, why can local authorities not recruit staff who can build on the local authorities' own land?  If it is more cost-effective for the local authorities to buy in expertise and contractors, why can we not do that?</p><p>Councillors around the country whom I speak to want their local authorities to build houses in their localities.  Local authority staff want to build houses but they say they are held back by red tape.  Why can we not deal with that?</p><p>Some local authorities state that they do not have the resources to build and yet there are local authorities next door to them that have resources.  Why can three or four local authorities not come together, pool their resources and build together?  It may be more cost-effective.</p><p>What is happening to houses that are derelict that have derelict site orders placed on them by councillors?  Why are they not subject to CPOs?  Why is there not funding invested in those?  Some buildings in my area have been the subject of a CPO and they are still sitting there nearly ten years later.  Why are they not being dealt with?  Are the local authorities being held accountable for those lands?</p><p>Recently local authority staff told me that they are inundated with people presenting themselves as homeless at the local authority offices, so much so that they are not at their desks working to house people but are down meeting them coming into the reception area.  When they ask the clerk of works for the local authority to go out and inspect houses for people to move into, he cannot do so because he is the only one in the Athlone municipal area.  Why can local authorities not employ staff?  There is no moratorium on recruiting staff at present.</p><p>The previous Minister had an idea, the repair and lease scheme, that I was keen on and that I had made a submission to him on.  Why was there such poor uptake of that scheme and what can we do to improve it?  These are all questions that have been put to me over the past number of months.  I do not know the answers to them and that is why I want the Minister to answer them for me.</p><p>Earlier in the year, an article I read stated that Permanent TSB was selling the 14,000 non-performing mortgage loans.  Why could the Government not buy these mortgages and keep those people in their homes?  What was to stop us doing that if we have the money?</p><p>Everybody knows the use of hotels is not suitable for families and it has to stop.  Why can that money not be redirected and used to house families?  These are all questions that people ask me every day, and I do not know the answers.  I feel frustrated that I cannot answer them.  They seem sensible, down to earth and simplistic.  They are probably too simplistic for the Minister but I would love if he could answer those questions.</p><p>I would love if the Government could say to the banks that not one more person is to be made homeless because of a bank that we are stakeholders in and that we as a country bailed out.  No bank should ever be allowed to make a person homeless from here on in.  It is just not good enough in this day and age.</p><p>I ask the Minister to give me answers to those questions.  I appreciate all his work.  I am aware of the hours he puts into this.  I am aware of the concern that the Minister has, like the rest of his Fine Gael colleagues, for those who have housing difficulties.  I really appreciate the work the Minister is doing and I thank him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1385" speakername="Grace O'Sullivan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#DD00200"><p>Here we are again making statements on housing.  It is impressive to hear the Minister talk about the numbers of houses being built, etc., but if I talk to people in my constituency in Waterford or meet people here in Dublin, the word on the street is that we still have a housing crisis.  The articles I read in the newspapers are still about those who are suffering because of affordability.  Their salary is not sufficient to enable them to afford to buy a house.  Their salary is not sufficient to enable them to afford renting.  There are students who cannot afford the rent.  When one looks at the situation on the ground and when one hears what the Minister is saying, it just does not seem to match up.</p> <p>I refer to a Goodbody report that I saw on Monday last which found that Ireland's level of housing output is among the lowest in Europe with only 2,367 housing units built during the first three months of 2018.  It is clear that we are not meeting the level of demand.  The numbers are based on building energy regulation applications rather than the number of ESB connections that the Department uses but the building energy regulation, BER, applications are a better indication of whether the houses are actually appearing on the market.  I cannot understand the disparity between the numbers in the Goodbody report and the numbers listed by the Department under Rebuilding Ireland.</p> <p>Apart from the issue of completions, we have problems that come from the developer-led approach to housing and construction.  These include, as I stated, the lack of affordability.  They also include problems with regard to quality and the real menace, that plagues me and leads to misery with regard to housing, of land speculation.  Investors bought almost one fifth of all homes on sale in Ireland in 2017 which inflated prices and rents.  This problem will likely only worsen in the face of Brexit as already we see people start to move out of the London property market.  These may decide to invest their moneys here in Ireland, as the nearest English-speaking country.  In fact, this would worsen the problem here considerably.</p> <p>From the evidence I see and the reports I read, we are still in this housing crisis.  In this crisis we still see private developers hoarding land in derelict and vacant sites.  I commend the Government on finally getting around to the implementation of the vacant site levy next year and the increase, to 7%, in the rate in year 2, as argued so heavily in the Derelict and Vacant Sites Bill I introduced to this House last year.  The local authority in Waterford states that even if that 7% levy is applied, it will be difficult to bring it in.  It is difficult for the local authorities to ensure that 7% will be paid up.  We have thus crossed the line of constricting private property rights regarding housing and construction, and without facing the wrath of the courts.  I welcome the move and I hope that it will yield new development over the coming years.  I hope a system will be put in place whereby the local authorities will be able to draw down the 7%.</p> <p>Ten thousand people were on the streets of Dublin last month marching with the housing and homeless coalition protest and many of my Green Party colleagues from around the country were there to add their voice.  My colleagues were calling for a socially-minded housing policy that helps the homeless and restricts speculators.  The Minister mentioned in his presentation the Government's support for the cost rental model.  This is something the Green Party will be focusing heavily on at a constituency level, identifying public spaces suitable for development in high-pressure areas.  I am glad to hear that on this we can work with the Government to help identify and increase the supply of high-quality and affordable rental property.</p> <p>In the fit of the information the Minister is providing with the message and the reality out on the streets, one might say there is a gap.  There will be an acceleration of activity.  Hopefully, under the Minister's stewardship over the coming months we will see a change from what is perceived as a housing crisis and be in a position to stop using phrases such as "housing crisis" and "homelessness crisis".</p></speech>

I will speak mainly about student housing if that is okay.  I am conscious it is only one part of the subject but if the Minister cannot answer questions I have today, we could revisit them in future statements.  To follow Senator O'Sullivan's point on investors buying a fifth of the available housing, I read somewhere that every time a bomb is dropped in Syria there is a flight of capital to London.  I cannot imagine there are wealthy people who would come to Dublin for a party once a year and leave the house for the rest of the year but I wonder if there are broader parallels that the Department could examine between Dublin and London, particularly in the Brexit context.</p> <p>When most of us consider student housing, we think of times when we were younger and living in accommodation not close to the standards we are used to today.  The expectation in standards of student housing has been particularly low for some time before any accommodation crisis.  It is a sector with rogue landlords who shirk their responsibility to provide adequate standards of living and attempt to manipulate an age cohort that might not be as comfortable or experienced in asserting their tenancy rights.  I spent a short time in Galway but the accommodation I saw had issues like black mould, draughts, damp, a lack of insulation and a number of repair or maintenance issues that a landlord may refuse to deal with.  Many of us may look back with fondness on our times as students but we should not lower our expectations for standards of accommodation based on age or some sort of nostalgic right of passage.  We are in a rental crisis but it is no time for us to absolve ourselves of having adequate standards.  I am sure the Minister agrees with that.</p> <p>It is more important than ever to realise and actively promote tenancy rights as our younger renters are more vulnerable at this time.  The most pressing matter I have seen with young renters is either a portion of or the entire deposit being unfairly retained by a landlord when a young person leaves accommodation in the summer after exams.  The Department has been aware of this practice for some time and has formulated a deposit retention scheme; the Department announced its intention to roll out such a scheme in September 2017.  That has yet to happen and I wonder if the Minister could progress this in time for September 2018, when student renters will move into new properties and pay deposits to new landlords.</p> <p>There is no doubt that student renters are hit by the crisis.  Our students are engaging in personal development and career advancement.  They are faced with higher fees, rising rents, sometimes part-time and precarious work, as well as escalating costs of living.  The student accommodation sector, like the entire rental sector, is rife with those who seek to take advantage of the lack of supply and proposed extortionate rates.  Inevitably, the average rent per room is driven up in the vicinity of our third level institutions.  This is done outside of rent pressure zones and, in many cases, in direct defiance of those zones.  I wish the Department well in its endeavours to clamp down on that.</p> <p>Purpose-built student accommodation is, however, outside rent pressure zones and is beyond the remit of the Residential Tenancies Board.  This issue has come to prominence with the Dublin City University student union holding a protest outside Leinster House as just one part of its action in the "Shanowen shakedown" campaign.  Rents are to be increased by 27% to &euro;9,000 for the next academic year, working out at approximately &euro;1,000 per month per room for student accommodation.  It is completely unsustainable and it is cruel and greedy of the landlords involved.  Over 50% of DCU students receive a maintenance grant and therefore their families simply cannot afford &euro;250 per week on accommodation along with all the other costs of living in a city and dealing with education.</p> <p>Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin is currently drafting legislation that would bring purpose-built student accommodation into the rent pressure zone process in order to give students some certainty about their rent.  Will the Minister give an indication of his plans to deal effectively with this as the current position is untenable?  Every year in which the loophole is not close we leave the most vulnerable people locked out of the rental market.</p></speech>

The Minister is welcome to the House and I thank him for being here.  It is an important debate.  Like Senator McFadden I dispel the idea that the Fine Gael Party is not concerned with housing and does not build social housing or support the construction of such housing.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English.  In Cork city the Minister has opened a number of housing developments and we have just signed a contract in Deanrock estate with the Department to construct more than 60 social houses.  Go over Tramore road to Sheridan Park and one will find people living in new houses provided under Rebuilding Ireland.  If we were to listen to some people in this housing debate we would swear nothing at all is happening and the Minister is uncaring, as he was unfairly portrayed by Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  Of course he cares.  I know Deputy Murphy to be a person of sincerity and intellect who is committed to this in his Department, as is the Minister of State, Deputy English.  I always speak on housing as I believe in both the Minister and the Minister of State.</p> <p>I am impatient to see change and to have it more quickly like everybody else.  The alleviation of the housing crisis is a Government priority.  Rebuilding Ireland is ahead of its targets but we all accept there is a road to travel.  We must be honest in recognising there is no quick single fix for this.  The targeted Government initiatives are working, although perhaps we need to tweak some of them.  Perhaps we must be creative and think outside the box as well.  I know Senator Murnane O'Connor spoke of historical but it is important to recognise that the construction sector was decimated and there are now fewer people employed in the housing and construction sector.  We can compare the number of builders of houses in Cork now with 15 or 16 years ago and it is a fraction.  I appreciate that under the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, there is a new apprenticeship recruitment process but we can consider the age profile in the construction sector.  Many builders have now retired or gone abroad so we must think about how we can incentivise people to come back to the sector.</p> <p>Fundamental in the debate is that demand is outpacing supply.  Notwithstanding the Minister's speech and his actions, we must take additional measures to stimulate supply.  One of the problems is the price of development land and the way in which the price of land affects developers.  At one stage in my political life I was of the view that developers were the bogey men but they are not.  We need to have developers as part of the process, even if it is not developer-led.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have tremendous faith in someone like Mr. Michael O'Flynn in Cork.  I think he is a visionary and has an idea of where the construction sector should go.  Equally, I know from looking at people like Mr. John Cleary in Cork, who has taken risks to build, construct and change the public landscape of Cork, that we need people like him.  They are people of courage.  In saying that, I refer the whole issue of how we have zoned land.  Some of us were members of local authorities.  Where we put land in the past and zoned it made no sense whatsoever.  The Minister in his speech spoke about the vacant site levy and incremental increases in it.  We all need land to build.  However, are we at the point now, and I am speaking with no vested interest whatsoever in this, where we are putting a huge impediment on developers or on State agencies building because of the price of land?<br/><br/>I welcome the affordable housing initiative that the Minister has taken.  We need to see people getting on the property ladder and able to have the dream of owning their own property fulfilled.  It has come to my attention in my clinics that a number of people have been refused under the affordable housing scheme by Cork City Council.  I am mystified as to why they have been refused.  I am trying to get that rectified.  I welcome any help we can get for these people.  We need to have people buying and owning their own property.  The Minister's speech is one that we need to see published further.  The fundamental and key issue we must all face is that the amount of land available to build on must be increased.  The economic viability for developers to build and sell needs to be examined, as does the ability of local authorities to deliver social housing units.<br/><br/>The price of affordable housing to the purchaser must be at the forefront of what we do.  The 2017 <i>daft.ie</i>report referred to a change of policy to increase supply and quantity.  I am confident that in a number of years the Minister will deliver.  I hope he will continue to be bold, to be creative, to engage and to think outside the box.  Some of the old ways have not worked.  I hope the Minister will move beyond some of the thinking from those who have been in the Custom House for a long time.  I commend the Minister on his work.  I salute him because he is trying, as is the Minister of State, Deputy English.  I believe we will see an increase in output in the coming year.</p></speech>

As everybody has described, this is a serious issue that has to be addressed.  Unfortunately, much of the commentary and debate, in particular in political circles and in these Houses, has been below the belt.  I join with Senator Buttimer in condemning the comments of Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  I refer to his personal attack on the Minister.  I will pick up on the word "elite".  It is not to do with where one is from.  Elite is to do with a mindset.  It was the mindset of the Galway tent, as Senator McFadden said.  It is a mindset that says jobs for the boys.  That has put our country the way it is today.  Let us think about language.  When we talk about housing, are we advancing the debate or are we just finger-pointing for headlines?</p> <p>Other groups that get trotted out and abused as if they are pariahs in society are landlords and builders.  Truth be told, they are key to delivering solutions and they are part of giving those solutions.  That is no way to deal with anybody when we are looking for their bona fides and their co-operation.  There needs to be more maturity in the debate around housing.  I have limited time but I have a couple of points.  Some will echo previous comments.  I have no doubt that the Minister is serious about ramping up our social housing programme.  This year alone the capital budget to local authorities for building social housing has gone from &euro;307 million to &euro;638 million.  That is a massive sum of money.</p> <p>Why are the houses not being built? I know the Minister met the chief executive of each of the local authorities and they have been told about this money.  When it is broken down, are they acquiring expertise and in-house knowledge?  We know they were depleted because social housing building had stopped and the local authorities lost staff etc.  Are they acquiring this expertise? Are they acquiring land?</p> <p>If any politician on a local authority wants to make a constructive input into the housing crisis, he or she would want to start by asking the chief executive of his or her local authority what that chief executive is doing with this money.  How is the local authority delivering on targets?  The Minister is not going to build the houses himself, notwithstanding all the commentary, nor is the Government.  The local authorities are housing authorities and it is their statutory obligation and responsibility to be building social houses.  If we can get to grips with the social housing deficit, we will go some way towards addressing issues of shortage of supply in private rental accommodation for people who are not social housing candidates.  It all has a knock-on affect.  The arm of the State that the Minister has the most input into is the local authorities.  They are abysmal to tell the truth, notwithstanding targets and what they are about.  Why are they not seizing this opportunity and knuckling down to do what is required?</p> <p>It is apt that this programme is called Rebuilding Ireland.

There is an issue in Mayo where local authority tenants are paying rent.  They are good rent payers.  They may be in receipt of a social welfare payment.  They could get a loan only the local authority will rule them out because they are in receipt of a social welfare payment.  They could be investing and buying a house.  They are blocked from doing so, however, because of the nature of the income they are receiving, notwithstanding that on that same income they are managing to pay rent which is the equivalent of what they would be paying on a loan.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What is the National Asset Management Agency doing?

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#GG00200"><p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I regard this debate as extremely important.  I want to address a few areas in the time I have.  I will look at it under the three main headings of social, affordable and private housing.  It is about Rebuilding Ireland.  The biggest issue across all areas in Ireland is supply.  All have different issues.  On social housing, I can speak for Limerick city.  Quite a number of social houses have been built.  It is not enough but construction is under way across a range of areas.  The Minister was down there only recently.  He opened 83 units on Lord Edward Street and he saw the units on Hyde Road where there are new apartments.  They are good.  Houses are already being built in Churchfield, in Southill and across the city.</p> <p>I have a comment coming from local authorities.  If one is building social housing, it must be sustainable.  What is required here goes back to the land banks that local authorities may have.  I would sometimes question the due diligence that is done on the sites local authorities submit to the Department for building to make certain that what has been put forward is sustainable.  In some cases, one is going into areas that are very old and may not work.  It is a feature of some of the sites that have been put forward and approved by the Department.  On the face of it, they look like good sites because, in some cases, they will be turnkey developments.  If due diligence is done in depth by local authorities before it goes to the Department, which is a bottleneck, it would speed up the building of social housing.</p> <p>Affordable housing is a huge issue which needs to be addressed.  I know that work is being done on it and that the Minister is speaking about it.  I expect the Minister will say further policies will announced regarding it.  The biggest concern for parents and younger people is being able to afford their homes.  It is private housing but we had an affordable housing scheme that was in place a number of years ago.  That scheme was defunct because affordable houses cost more than it cost to buy the house on the open market because of the form of the structure being used.  That is a key element.  We have a culture where people like to own their own homes and I feel strongly about it.</p> <p>On private housing, the Minister mentioned many planning permissions being issued and, in Limerick, there is much construction underway in the private sector.  There are issues with some of the smaller builders' access to credit.  They find it difficult to get access.  We need to look at that area again.  Speaking of the number of people employed in this sector, it is a problem that we lost a decade of people with skills, including tradesmen.  Many emigrated and many are older now.  No one was training in that area in the last decade from 2008.  We are now playing catch-up.  We need to look at ways to fast-track this to have tradesmen in place.  I welcome that there is another round of local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding.  I welcome that the Minister is looking to do an integrated model.  The key issue here is supply.</p> <p>On social housing, the Minister should make certain the sites that councils are putting forward are suitable.  For any of us dealing with the issue daily, local authorities are key because they are in control of the building of houses, whether through approved housing bodies or otherwise.  They put the applications up to the Department and they determine where social housing is going in.  It is probably necessary to bring the local authorities in to say where their land banks are and where there will not be difficulties in building.  In many cases there are major difficulties with location across a myriad of areas.  In some cases, where one is looking for a balance, if there is an overconcentration of social houses in an area, that is not fair to existing tenants.  That is why we went for 10% social and 10% affordable in estates.  The key is that the due diligence being done by local authorities before they submit to the Department needs to be looked at in great depth.  We need to have fast-tracking to train apprentices, which we are doing.  I look forward to the future.  The affordable element is key.</p> <p>I refer to the issue raised made by my colleague, Senator Mulherin, which is increasingly happening under the tenant purchase scheme.  One of the criteria is that there must be someone in employment in the house.  We are finding that older couples who have retired are now at the stage where they would like to own their own homes.  They go in and could afford to pay the mortgage but they are not working.  We try to get around that by getting a member of the family to come to live in the house and become a tenant.  It is very cumbersome and the issue is coming up increasingly lately.  Perhaps we should see if something can be done where there are retired couples and whether they can afford to purchase the house if they have been lifelong tenants.  Senator Mulherin referred to it being something that is coming up increasingly.  It is now a regular feature.  It was not perhaps a year ago.  The tenant purchase scheme has come back in a slightly revised form.  It is perhaps something that the Minister will take under advisement.</p></speech>

I want to focus on housing for people with disabilities.  A motion was unanimously passed in this House in July 2016 which focused on housing for people with disabilities.  The House agreed to the motion which stated:</p><blockquote>- confirm that the Government's action plan for housing includes specific commitments on the delivery of housing in sufficient numbers and type to also meet the housing needs of persons with disabilities;<br /><br />- ensure the provision of an annual update from local authorities of the number of social housing units allocated to people with disabilities on the housing waiting list;<br /><br />- ensure that any housing project supported by public funding, including Part V housing, provide a percentage of pre-planned and reserved housing units to meet local needs for persons with disabilities;<br /><br />- ensure that the social housing 2020 strategy is routinely disability proofed;<br /><br />- provide funding in 2017 to increase housing supply and to make necessary and timely adaptations to current housing stock;<br /><br />and<br /><br />- requests that the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government draft a work programme which will routinely consider and review Government progress towards delivering adequate and sustainable housing for persons with disabilities.</blockquote> <p>Almost two years later, that has not been honoured.  That was a decision of this House in July 2016.  We now have the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which has been ratified by not only the Government but by the D&aacute;il.  It has been ratified and agreed by Ireland.  We have given our international word, our bond, that we would implement that.  I will mention one article that relates to people with disabilities and housing, namely, Article 19.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Article 19 of the convention, entitled "Living independently and being included in the community", relates to people with disabilities and housing.  Section (a) states that we must ensure that "Persons with disabilities have the opportunity to choose their place of residence and where and with whom they live on an equal basis with others and are not obliged to live in a particular living arrangement".  We know there is a programme to ensure that people with intellectual disabilities can be moved out of congregated settings.  We also know that 1,200 people under 65 have been routinely moved into nursing homes where, as I have often said, the doors only turn one way.  There was a housing crisis for people with disabilities before there was a more widespread housing crisis but that is not seeping into the ongoing thinking and work in this area.  The Minister, his officials and others who are dealing with a very nasty situation on housing in Ireland do not wake up in the morning and consider the legacy housing problem that existed before this crisis and which will get worse.  I must be clear that I do not have easy solutions but the problem will not be solved by putting on carpet slippers and tiptoeing around it or by pretending it is not there.  We are trying to keep people living in the community.  They need to live somewhere.</p><p>I wish to mention Rebuilding Ireland 2016, which was published on 19 July, a week after the motion to which I referred.  It did not reference the figures on social housing waiting lists which the Department already had.  According to a survey conducted in 2013, there were approximately 3,900 persons with disabilities on the social housing waiting list at that time.  That figure was not included in that strategy and has since increased to approximately 4,560.  There is a blindspot in that regard or people consider that they do not need to include those figures as they have enough to be getting on with, which is unacceptable.</p><p>As regards the housing adaptation grant, the maximum grant available is &euro;30,000 but that decreases for households with incomes exceeding &euro;30,000 per annum.  Households with annual incomes of &euro;35,000, &euro;40,000 or more may end up getting buttons and having to fund so much of the work themselves that it is not feasible to carry it out.  The houses of many families in this country with babies or children with significant physical and other needs, or family members who have become disabled, are unsuitable for the person with a disability.  This is to a large extent the first generation of families to try to rear such children in their own homes.  The parents may be trying to hold down a job and earn the average wage, which is in excess of &euro;30,000 per annum.  However the maximum grant available under the scheme is &euro;30,000 and that can only be claimed by households whose annual income is under 30,000.  What is the cost of such works?  If we seriously wish to help people who have a child with a disability and other children to rear or who care for a family member who becomes disabled midway through life, they must have real help with the cost of bricks and mortar.  It is a once-off payment.  There is no recurring expense.  Surely, we can find a way to upscale that scheme.  Although the State contributes funding to the scheme, local authorities must find matching funds for it.  We should be able to do something serious and substantial in the short term in this area which would help to alleviate the burden of a particular group of people.  We must help these families who are trying to get up early in the morning - I do not mean to poke fun at anyone by saying that - get children out to school, get things moving, get to work themselves and so on but who must cope with the extra and incidental costs of having a child or other person in the house with a disability and all the things we never think about until we find ourselves facing them.  The State must act to change this very harsh and Victorian style of means testing.  It does not work, it does not help people and it will hinder Ireland meeting its obligations in respect of people with disabilities.</p><p>I ask that the Minister come to the House relatively soon to comprehensively outline where we are in terms of ensuring housing for people with disabilities.  Let us be honest.  If we have problems - and we do - let us put them out there and then see how we will solve them.</p></speech>

He visited Limerick not too long ago and we had a very positive day involving the opening of the new housing development on Lord Edward Street.  He met many people who worked there in the past and some new residents.  Limerick was very lucky to have been in receipt of funding for social housing when other local authorities were not able to build.  However, we would like to receive more funding if possible.  I understand that the Minister must share the budget between local authorities based on applications.</p> <p>I am concerned that some of the many applications submitted by local authorities propose construction on very small green spaces.  These very small sites may be the only green space in the area.  Although it is lovely to think that extra houses would be provided there, such development would remove a green area of which existing residents have the use.  I know of an application to build a house on a plot of approximately 10 ft. by 12 ft. in between three houses and a tree.  I have said to the local authority that I am unsure whether it should target such sites.  There are plenty of vacant land banks which are very suitable for development.  I fully support the building of social housing as quickly as possible.</p> <p>I have represented Hyde Road for 17 years.  There are quite a few privately owned derelict houses on the road but the local authority has stated it has little power to do anything with them.  Houses with rubbish dumped in them may be next door to lovely houses but nothing can be done because they are privately owned.  We must find a way to get around that and be able to access such derelict houses.  If such houses have been derelict for a long period there should be a way to bring them back into the ownership of the local authority and renovate them for families to move into because families previously lived in these areas.  Such issues must be addressed.  The local authority stated its hands are tied because the houses are privately owned.  However, it should be possible to empower the local authority to step in if the house has been derelict for a long period.  Perhaps it has such power but is unaware of it or unwilling to use it.  I acknowledge that a change of legislation may be required in that regard.</p> <p>Although I welcome the Rebuilding Ireland programme and the new housing loan scheme, the rates involved should be reconsidered.  I know a young single mother who went back to college and then got a job at a starting salary of approximately &euro;25,000.  She would only qualify for a loan of &euro;101,000.  One would not get a house in Limerick nor many other places for &euro;101,000.  Perhaps the rates could be reconsidered in that context.  That young girl is determined to get a local authority house and have the option of buying it in the future or to try to buy under the affordable housing scheme.  The Minister indicated that the affordable housing scheme will be reopening very shortly and that he will soon make an announcement in that regard.  I welcome that because it was successful but not enough houses were available under the scheme.  I understand that there were restrictions to do with funding but those schemes worked very effectively in certain areas and that should be considered.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will leave the Minister with one last point.  I use Limerick just as an example, but on our main streets the majority of businesses do not have anybody living overhead.  Could incentives be brought in?  I am aware a trial was done to incentivise businesses to renovate the premises above their shops to turn the spaces into rental units and these could be rented or even lived in by the owners.  People, however, found the schemes too restrictive.  By the time the premises was renovated and let, it was just not worthwhile.  I believe it is a common complaint in all large urban areas that there are very few people living within the city centre.  In European cities, one will find people living over business premises.  They have their business downstairs and upstairs is rented.  We need to look seriously at this area to see how we can encourage businesses to develop living above the shop.</p><p>Overall, I compliment the Minister and the Department on the number of people who have been taken out of rough sleeping and hostel-type accommodation.  I have seen first-hand, and in my own experience, the number of people who were recently in receipt of local authority housing and have been accommodated.  This is very welcome.  I also pay tribute to the staff who work in the accommodation and in the emergency centres.  During winter, near to where I live, I was aware of a hostel for families at one end and emergency accommodation at the other.  While there are issues sometimes, people were able to go in and get a bed for the night.  It was very welcome that people were not rough sleeping.</p><p>A group in Limerick will be building modular and wooden-framed houses under a regeneration scheme.  I invite the Minister to come down and look at what they are proposing.  The idea came from the United States of America.  The group has come back here and will team up with the regeneration agency in Limerick with regard to the fast supply of houses.  It would be well worth the Minister's while to visit the next time he is in Limerick.</p></speech>

I would like to respond to everyone if I may in the time available.  I thank all the Senators for their contributions.  We will be back here talking about housing because it will continue to be an issue until we have actually managed to stabilise the housing sector, bring along the supply we have provided for with regard to taxpayers' money and deal with the different supports we have put in place to help ramp up the private supply.</p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of builders and the people who might do the work.  As I said in my opening statement, the number of people working in construction has increased.  The number of construction projects has increased so more builders are required.  We are also seeing new technologies being availed of, especially in residential developments.  This is in modular, pre-cast and pre-fabricated homes that happen off site.</p></speech>

We can take advantage of new technologies.  Of course we still need people and a scheme in my area has been quite successful in training people and in taking them from long-term unemployment, and even some people who had been homeless, into working jobs.  They did this in a matter of weeks and trained them in the basic skills.  I went to visit them for their graduation ceremony.  It is a small enough throughput of maybe ten to 14 people in each class, but it does work and it produces results.  Every additional body is definitely necessary.  A new group is being put in place in the context of Project Ireland 2040 to monitor the needs around skills and everything else as investment ramps up massively across the economy, not just in house building.  We will be keeping a very close eye on that and the Construction Industry Federation will sit on that new group.</p> <p>With regard to some of the ideas that Senator Murnane O'Connor has put forward, she describes it as a policy shift coming from Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is not actually a policy shift rather it is measures that the Government is already taking with regard to affordability.  I announced schemes earlier this year relating to new protections in the rental sector such as rent pressure zones, greater security of tenure, rent transparency and rent fairness.  These are things we are in the process of doing.  More money has been made available for social housing with an additional &euro;100 million being put into the budget in the last quarter of last year to provide for regeneration and more house building in certain parts of the State where we could avail of it.  We knew that this additional funding in that fourth quarter would get people into those homes by the end of the year.  It also provided for some family hubs.  On top of that, I secured an additional &euro;500 million from the Minister for Finance for Rebuilding Ireland.  The capital finance available for the five-year programme is now above &euro;6 billion.  A ring-fenced capital fund over a multi-annual programme has never happened before.  It gives me great flexibility if I need, in a given year, to do more of certain things.  I can do that and I can provide the funding.  It is very useful in that regard.</p> <p>Reference was made to credit unions financing social housing or house building.  This is a Central Bank issue ultimately, but a huge amount of private finance is now interested in building social housing homes and private homes.  The enhanced leasing scheme and the new mortgage to rent scheme have shown significant increase in interest from the private side to bring the money to provide solutions for home building, which is very welcome.  There will be more announcements about that in the near future.</p> <p>Turning to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, nobody should be advocating imprudent lending in this regard.  There are certain criteria to make sure that the loans given are affordable and that people can meet their repayment targets.  I had a meeting on this yesterday with the relevant people.  There are a couple of things we will do and I recognise that some tweaks might be made.  but whether they will be made in this first tranche of &euro;200 million or in the second tranche is being looked at currently.</p> <p>We spoke a little about history lessons.  I believe that it is incorrect to hark back to 2008 when we talk about the numbers at the time because there were too many homes being built, and also because of the amount of money being spent on housing.  They were not built on sustainable finances.  As we talk about these issues, we need to be aware of the mistakes that were made in the past so we do not repeat them.  We need to look to the future and where we all want to go as a State and as a society in building more homes that are private, social and affordable.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan asked about the targets for local authorities in the context of social housing.  The direct build target for this year for local authorities and housing bodies is 3,800.  There are some outliers and some local authorities are not moving as quickly as others, but we have doubled the local authority build for this year.  It is a very ambitious target and we have put in new resources to help them with it.</p> <p>On the output that has been achieved, the numbers published by the Department are the accurate numbers.  They are not claims; they are accurate.  They have to be verified every year with the Committee of Public Accounts and the public spending codes.  There are statisticians within the Department who check and double check.  They might move the provisional figures and then give the final figures.  It is part of a very robust process in the Department.  I recognise, however, that it is sometimes difficult to communicate the numbers because with social housing we have six different delivery streams.  It is not like it was back in the day when it was just the local authority that built social housing.  Now there are housing bodies building social housing, there is the Part V stream and we also have acquisitions because in some parts of the State, acquisitions offer better value for money.  Long-term leasing is a new type of delivery stream, involving 25 or 30 year leases.  There is also the void conversion programme.  These are empty social housing homes that are not in use and the programme brings them back on line.  As a result of the different delivery streams, it is very easy for certain parties, if they want, to unpick the numbers to give the impression of very low build rates when it is not actually the case.  Last year, 2,200 new homes were built across local authorities, housing bodies and the Part V delivery scheme.  This is three times the number in 2016.  This year, we will double that number again.  We are coming from nothing because of mistakes that were made in the past.  We are, however, ramping up very quickly.</p> <p>I clarify for Senator Boyhan that I gave the 2017 figures in January.  They are the accurate figures and they are broken down by build, voids, acquisitions and leasing.  It is very clear.  People can look at the table in the document on the 2017 results that was published in January this year.  The Senator asked about increasing direct build.  We are doing that and all the numbers are up for social housing on the private side.  It is up 30%, 37% and 41%, and building energy rating numbers are up 45%.  These are huge increases.  We are seeing increases we have never seen before, even in the good years, in investment in the residential area.  Much of that is foreign investment, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  In the boom years, part of the reason that it was so destructive to our economy is that we were selling property to each other at inflated prices.  If mature, residential investors want to come into the market to provide new solutions around apartment building or mature build-to-rent, and if these investors are looking for a steady rate of return - not supernormal profits but a 3% or 4% uptake year on year for pension fund investors, pension funds such as the teachers' unions in the United States of America that have very large resources - then there is no problem with that funding coming into the economy.  It means there are more solutions being driven every year.</p> <p>On affordability, a new agency is being developed currently.  We are doing detailed work on it.  It is about using public lands and semi-State land as leverage to drive affordable house building.  If we need to compulsorily purchase certain land because it makes sense for site assembly in particular strategic areas, then we will do that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A huge amount of working is happening at the moment so that when we come to announce what we are doing, everyone is quite clear on our objectives.

We have told the local authorities that if they want to hire more staff, they can bill them directly to the Department.  We have also set up a new housing delivery unit headed up by the Minister of State, Deputy English, with new resources.  We have made design and procurement expertise available to the local authorities.  The target for this year is 3,800 units for local authority and housing body direct builds.  That does not include the units provided by way of Part IV.  We have published those numbers for local authorities to have accountability and transparency, so that we can see exactly what is meant to be delivered.  Those are good, robust numbers in that we have consulted with each local authority.  That target number of units can be delivered as long as our delivery unit continues to drive things at local authority level.  Of course, the local authority councillors have a role to play in this as well.  Every time I make a housing intervention that takes any kind of power away from the local authorities or local councillors, they complain so I have to try to find a balance between national interventions and powers, and what the local authorities can and should be doing themselves.</p> <p>In the context of Senator McFadden's questions, we have spoken about the history of this problem.  Reference was made to the 90% fall in levels of construction, the hundreds of thousands of people who plummeted into negative equity and the more than 3,000 ghost estates, many of which were still being bulldozed up to quite recently.  It is not just a seven-year problem with which we are dealing.  In the first few years of the recession, we had to deal with the problem of having houses in places where no one wanted to live.  We had to stand down the affordability scheme because there was a 50% drop in house prices.  We no longer needed an affordability scheme and many people were in massive negative equity.  The first few years of Fine Gael-led government were actually about fixing the economy and trying to turn those things around.  We actually turned them around more quickly than many believed we could, in terms of creating jobs and so forth.  We have an increase in pressure on housing now because of a natural shortage of supply coupled with more people being back at work and more than 100,000 of our sons and daughters returning from abroad.  They all need somewhere to live and that has placed extra pressure on the housing sector.</p> <p>Local authorities can recruit staff and bill the Department directly, as I have already said.  We have identified lands on which the local authorities can build.  Local authorities can partner with construction companies in order to deliver more homes more quickly.  They can do all of those things.  We have to be careful about making broad statements that local authorities are not building or that there is no social housing being built.  The truth is that they are building social housing but just need to do more and we know that.  Rebuilding Ireland is working.  Across almost every metric that we have, it is exceeding its targets.  I made an announcement around that at the beginning of the year.  </p> <p>The repair and lease scheme has been reformed.  There were some problems with the ten-year condition but that has now been reduced to five years.  We have increased the amount of money that can be spent if a former bedsit is being put back into use.  We have also allowed the costs to be spread over a number of units so that, for example, one unit might cost more than &euro;30,000 to refurbish while another might cost less than &euro;5,000, so it can be balanced out.  We have made the scheme more attractive and there are hundreds of applications in the system at the moment for repair and leasing.  </p> <p>We are in discussions with the banks about their properties but I cannot say any more than that at the moment.  Senator Grace O'Sullivan is right to point out that we are here again, talking about housing and that we will be doing so for some time to come.  Rebuilding Ireland is a five-year programme.  That does not mean that it is going to take us five years to solve all of our problems.  It just means that we have put in place a five-year programme to try to do every piece of it, including building a mature rental sector and building more social housing units.  There will be a 50,000 increase in the social housing stock over that programme but it is going to take some more time before the new homes commencing on site each month actually get built and tenanted.  It will not take too long but more time is needed.</p> <p>It will take the remainder of this year before people start to feel what is happening in our housing sector.  That said, over the course of last year, 26,000 new social housing tenancies were created between the private rental market and our own builds.  We will do something similar again this year, if not more.  It is not that people have to wait too long.  We have the supports in place through HAP and through our own build programme to help them in the meantime.  The Senator is right to focus on affordability.  We are still 20% off the house prices peak of the boom years when it comes to buying a house.  However, when it comes to renting, we are well above the boom time peak because of the shortage of supply.  Affordability is a key issue that we must address.</p> <p>The Goodbody report is very interesting.  It looks at the number of BER certificates issued but that does include self-builds.  If one looks at Goodbody's figures for the first three months of this year, they show a 45% increase, excluding self-builds.  The report says that we are one third off what is needed.  Given what actually happened in our housing and construction sectors and in our economy, to be back at one third off is not so bad.  Our own statistics, based on data from the Central Bank, on ESB connections, commencement notices and planning permissions all point to us being one third away from where we need to be in order to be in a steady state.</p> <p>The ESB figure is no longer being used for completions because that figure is for newly-built homes or any homes that have been vacant for more than two years.  It is interesting that if the figure is 18,000 to 20,000 based on ESB connections, people say that is not accurate because it includes vacancies but at the same time, they say we are not doing anything about vacancy rates.  If the ESB connection figure is 18,000, then that could be 10,000 new builds and 8,000 units taken out of vacancy, which is fantastic because it signifies better management of our housing stock.  It could also mean 18,000 new builds and no vacancies.  We cannot be criticised on both.  What it means for people moving into those houses is a new home that was not previously there, either because it was newly built or was vacant for more than two years and that must be welcomed.  </p> <p>I absolutely agree that the State needs to intervene to prevent land speculation.  A vacant site levy of 3% is in place at the moment and that will more than double to 7% next year.  That means that if landowners have not built on their land by the end of 2019, they will pay a 10% levy on their land but we will do more than that.  Senator Buttimer raised this issue too and we are going to intervene directly in the land market by building on public and semi-State lands.  We expect that to have a dramatic impact on the price of land in this country.  </p> <p>Reference was made to 10,000 people marching on the streets recently in a homelessness protest.  I get accused of inflating my figures sometimes but the figure we have for that protest is around 4,000.  That said, nobody should have to march.  I welcome people expressing their democratic right to protest and getting angry and frustrated about the issue.  The Government is also getting angry and frustrated, which is why we are doing so much about it.  We need to be careful about the numbers of people that were actually at that protest.  We also need to understand some peoples' motivations because there are some people who do not want to hear the good news.  They do not want to acknowledge that social housing is increasing so they point to other metrics and say that the levels are falling or that Rebuilding Ireland is failing because there is an increase in homelessness.</p> <p>There is an increase in homelessness but a big part of that is the fact that not enough homes are being built.  However, as we build more homes, we will be able to help those people.  Crucially, 4,700 people left homelessness last year, while more than 2,000 families left hotels and the majority of them went into homes.  Now we have a record decrease in the number of people sleeping rough.  Among the most vulnerable homeless, there has been a 40% decrease - about 110 in Dublin - but of course we need to do more.  That is why we have Housing First under Bob Jordan, the new national director.  A full 50 Housing First tenancies were secured in the first quarter of this year.  That kind of rate of increase has never been done before.  He has the mandate and the money and is working with local authorities to roll out the Housing First model across the country.  That is going to work.  It has worked well in other countries and it will work for us too.  </p> <p>I assure Senator Grace O'Sullivan that I have spoken to the Green Party leader about the cost rental model and I know her party's position on it.  Indeed, her party tabled a motion in the D&aacute;il on it recently which I would have supported, had it not mentioned specific sites.  We have to be careful about identifying sites but cost rental has to be a part of our rental market as we look to the future.  </p> <p>Senator Warfield spoke about student accommodation.  I think I have already addressed the issue around foreign investment and why I believe it is welcome.  It is not Irish people selling property to each other at ever-inflating prices and sometimes foreign capital is not looking for super normal profit.  In fact, a lot of the investors that I have met just want a steady return on their pensions.  The current low interest rate market internationally means that people cannot get a return on their money.  Significant pension funds, some of which are worth billions of euro, need safe havens and property can be a safe haven.  Those pension funds will not have a problem with things like rent pressure zones or the capping of rent inflation because they see that as what is called a "steady Eddie".  They know that they can invest for 20, 25 or 30 years in the rental market here and if the standards are good by international comparison, they will get a return on their money and we will get more housing into the market.  Furthermore, we will not be exposed to some risks that may have existed in the past when the majority of investors were people in this country selling property to themselves.  </p></speech>

In terms of student accommodation, rent pressure zones and the difficulties being faced, we are looking at that at the moment.  I will be introducing a Bill relating to the rental sector and am working with the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, on it.  That work is ongoing and if it is possible or necessary to amend that legislation, we will do so.  It is tough enough being a student in terms of trying to find the money, particularly when costs are going up and we do not want rent to be another significant pressure for them.  We obviously want more rental accommodation to be available and there will be an additional 9,000 very modern student bed places in the system by 2019.  It is great accommodation and represents a whole new way of living for students that has not been seen here before but as we bring that on stream, it must be affordable for them.</p><p>I am very sorry that I did not get to the points made by Senators Buttimer, Mulherin, Kieran O'Donnell, Dolan or Byrne.  Senator Dolan talked about disability which is very important.  All of the schemes that I have visited have included some homes with disabled access, including the scheme in Lord Edward Street in Limerick which I visited last Monday.  I  received a copy of <i>A Stitch in Time</i>, a book by the people who used to work in Limerick's clothing factory which has now been re-purposed.  The new accommodation units include lower worktops in the kitchens with space for wheelchairs underneath and wider doorways.  I know that we need to do more but every social housing scheme that I have visited has had homes for people with disabilities.  </p></speech>

There has been a lot of discussion on the amendment.  The essence of this amendment is to give the elected members a zero rating in that they would pay no charge for making an observation or submission on planning applications.  Not all submissions are negative, but sometimes people associate them with objections.  I have written in favour of applications and set out clearly the benefits.  Councillors are at the coalface in communities and all of them want to see inward investment in their area.  That is important.  As part of the Mahon tribunal deliberations it was clearly said that we need an open and transparent planning process.  We do not want a situation where councillors find they have to be in back rooms talking to officials.  That is not appropriate or right.  I do not suggest it happens now but it happened in the past.  We want an open and transparent system where councillors can go on the record in their council chambers and discuss planning applications.  It is an absurdity to think that elected members of councils have to pay a fee to make a submission.</p> <p>I speak from personal experience.  I constantly had to dip my hand in my pocket and pay.  That is not on.  I know councillors from other parties do it.  It is not because I came under any pressure to do so, but I felt it was important to make a submission.  I made one only last week in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and I paid my &euro;20.  I put at the very end of it that I was doing this because I had to have some sort of standing in the event that I would wish to appeal the decision would then have to go to the board.  I do not think it is right and proper that councillors should have to pay the fee.  I would like to hear the considered view of the Minister of State.  I know he is very sympathetic and supportive of it.</p> <p>It had been my view that the measure should be embedded in the primary legislation.  I did not want it to be done by regulation because I did not want the situation changing or being watered down due to a change in personnel.  At the time, I emphasised that I thought it was important to specify the inclusion of local electoral areas, LEAs, as there was a direct link.  I accept that some people do not necessarily agree with that but I saw a direct link between the right to be able to make a submission on a planning application and a councillor who had a clear mandate from the community to represent it.  It might be more helpful for me to hear what the Minister of State has to say because I know he has reflected on it since we were last in the Chamber.  He has had discussions with his officials to which I am not privy, as is right and proper, so I would like to hear what he will come up with before we proceed.</p></speech>

The word "submission" is important.  It is not an objection.  The person could be in support of the planning application or he or she could think it needs to be amended or, in some cases, that there should be a dramatic change to the planning permission.  That core function is very important for public representatives, whether one is a Deputy, Senator or councillor, and it is something we need to promote.  Councillors feel under pressure in some regards to make a submission.  That is one thing of which we should be aware.  The other important point is that the financial implications of making submissions are quite onerous on a member of a local authority in particular if one is charged &euro;20 every time one makes an observation on a planning application.  That is one issue we must examine.</p> <p>I raised the issue with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, and there is scope for something to be done for councillors and public representatives so that, when they want to use their democratic mandate, they will have the opportunity to do so without it impinging on them financially.  It is one of those issues we need to examine, but there are two aspects to it.  I do not want a situation to arise where councillors feel obligated to make a submission because the fee is gone.  The other side of the coin is those who want to make a submission.  I have made many submissions in my day that such people should not be penalised financially for so doing.  This is one of the issues we must examine.  I am broadly in support of the amendment because, on average, most councillors want to use that power but it does not make sense for them financially to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1385" speakername="Grace O'Sullivan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#NN00600"><p>I was approached by Senator Boyhan to countersign amendment No. 43.  Based on his experience as a councillor and the argument he put to me, it would be a shame if there were to be a barrier preventing councillors from having an opportunity to lodge a submission on behalf of their constituents.</p> <p>I speak to amendment No. 43, which is similar to amendment No. 42 that was tabled by my Labour Party colleagues.  It aims to correct the Government's attempt to impose a cost on every single representative observation made by councillors in their core work of representing their constituents.  The cost proposed would make representations by councillors on behalf of the people they are elected to represent prohibitively expensive.</p> <p>The organisation of such representations through councillors is of benefit to all involved.  It means that elected representatives hear the views of their constituents, provide some coherence to the submissions made, and organise the submissions for those receiving them in the local authority.  It could serve to increase the awareness of councillors on local issues and improve their ability to represent their areas.</p> <p>What comes to mind is the very active councillor who has great expertise in the area.  In my area of Waterford, which has 32 council representatives, some of them have been there for years and they have developed great expertise.  I would hate to think that because one councillor had that expertise and experience, he or she would be at a financial loss due to supporting their constituents and their active participation in the process.  This modest amendment covers only representations made in regard to a councillor's local electoral area, not the entire area of the local authority.  We were conscious of tabling an amendment that would not add to the already serious amount of work councillors have to do.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am a little surprised that such an amendment is necessary.  The Government has said that it will take care of this by ministerial order.  I believe there is no need because we are about to take care of it quickly and easily, and certainly with a vote on this amendment.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say but this is an area about which we feel very strongly.  Hopefully my co-signer Senator Victor Boyhan and I will receive satisfaction from the Minister of State.  If this is not the case we will probably move it to a vote.  I will, however, let Senator Boyhan have the honour of calling that.</p></speech>

It is very important.  There is certainly no doubt that the zero rating is important.  I do not believe it should be done by regulation; it should be done by primary legislation because Ministers, and viewpoints, can change.</p> <p>As a councillor I was involved in many development plans.  Councillors need to show leadership in this regard and not follow.  I drove the issues of height and density in the Dublin city development plan, from Clarehall to Ballyfermot to Ballymun.  As a councillor, I felt ownership of the development plan.  This is where I disagree with amendment No. 43.  Its context is of a local electoral area but councillors see themselves as councillors for their county and city.  This is how they view it and they want to act in a sense of leadership.  When they sit down to work out the strategic development plan for a city councillors want to uphold the plan itself.  It is not just about how it will affect me in Ringsend or Sandymount, but also about how the plan affects the development of Ballymun, Cabra or Ballyfermot.</p> <p>When there were controversial planning permissions, there was many a Sunday I came across councillors out walking the relevant ground.  They were not representatives in the area but they went out and walked the ground because a vote was coming up in the council chamber on the development plan and they wanted to clearly understand the proposal.  I have seen many councillors defending the decisions they made in their strategic responsibilities in the context of the development plan by making submissions to Dublin City Council to protect the very development plan they worked on, as a reserve function, hand in glove with the officials.  It is important that councillors should have the power without an additional cost to defend the decisions they have made in relation to the development plan.  This is a key necessity in a democracy.</p> <p>If I make a decision as a councillor, I have the right to defend the decision in an observation or a submission at the planning application level and at An Bord Plean&aacute;la level; if I am not to be counted for at the planning application stage, then I cannot take it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An oral hearing was held at An Bord Plean&aacute;la two weeks ago on the strategic development zone, SDZ, in Poolbeg west. I saw many local councillors, and not so local councillors, queuing up to pay the &euro;50 fee so they could make an oral submission.  They felt very aggrieved that on 18 May last year they sat and developed the strategic development zone, which then appears to become undermined at An Bord Plean&aacute;la level.  These councillors want to be proactive and attend the hearing, but they had to pay &euro;50 to make the submission to defend the decision they had made in the council chamber.  This happened because the receiver was appealing the SDZ and was going for higher density and a reduction in social and affordable housing.  The councillors felt very aggrieved.  They spent the money on the fees and I believe An Bord Plean&aacute;la picked up some &euro;250 over two days from councillors and Deputies in this regard.</p> <p>I feel very strongly about this matter.  I disagree with my two colleagues because I do not believe it is just a local issue.  A development plan is in the ownership of the council that passes it, which is every single councillor who is involved.  Senator Boyhan is correct that although councillors can be against a development, there are many times when a councillor makes an observation or a submission in support of a development because they see it as a key element for developing the city or the county.  They must be free to do this without an additional cost.  This applies especially to the circular letter from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government that said live planning permissions cannot be discussed at council or area committee level.  This nearly drives councillors to be behind the door in trying to protect the development plans, in which the councillors have a reserve function in passing at council level.  That circular is a retrograde step in forcing that discussion out of the council chamber.  It had been open and transparent.  Councillors discussed these plans in an open forum with most of these debates broadcast live with webcams onto the Internet.  The debate was on the record and this is now gone from the record.  Councillors do not have that avenue.</p> <p>I believe the Minister of State will say that he will deal with this matter by regulation, but at this stage I will put the amendment that is in my name to a vote because it strengthens local democracy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.269" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1372" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#OO00400"><p>Can the Minister make an order on whether these amendments are necessary and, if this is the case, will the Minister consider making such an order? These are really interesting, creative and positive initiatives.  We hear about all the work carried out by councillors with their grasp of local community issues and their expertise and interest.  I support the intentions of both amendments, but personally I would be more inclined to see such a privilege given to local councillors in their local electoral areas.  While taking into account the recognition of the role of councillors, it is a privilege and therefore I would be more inclined to support amendment No. 43.</p> <p>Aside from this matter, councillors are stretched to the limit in the work they do and financially.  One of the positive knock-on effects of this idea, to which Senator Humphreys referred, is an increase in the number of submissions and observations that are positive about planning applications.  This process is not just about negative responses.  The amendments recognise that submissions and observations are a key part of the work done by councillors, and this should be encouraged.  The transparency of public submissions is also important.  The best planning has a political input that is transparent and will be on the public record.  This is consistent with Sinn F&eacute;in's calls for transparency in this legislation.</p></speech>

I am aware that the Minister of State is supportive, and I know that the officials are supportive.  The Minister of State has indicated that he may do this through regulation.  We are not that far apart.  I have lobbied strongly, as have the Independent Senators and Senators from Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  We have not been idle in the past few days.  I am confident we will succeed in a vote here today.  I do not want to divide the House but I will if it is necessary.  This is the Minister of State's call, not mine.  I am absolutely confident that we will succeed if we call a vote now on amendment No. 43.  I believe it is important.  I would not like to see a group of Fine Gael councillors or Senators left out because I believe that they too are committed.  The Minister of State will know this from his own contacts in local government.</p> <p>I want to see this measure in primary legislation.  I have been advised that there is nothing to prevent the Minister of State from agreeing to allow this to be in primary legislation.  It is important.  I am happy to support the two amendments but I believe that amendment No. 43, which is in my name and Senator Grace O'Sullivan's name, is very reasonable.  It is not what we had initially thought - we were going to go a bit further - but we thought this amendment was reasonable having discussed it with the Minister of State, his officials, county managers and councillors.  It is also in light of the letter sent by the Minister of State's officials to the councils about councillors not discussing planning applications.  I have no difficulty with that but in some councils they never discussed planning applications.  They were passing comment on planning applications but it was done in an open and transparent way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was done on the record of the local authority chambers, the proceedings of many of which are webcast.

It is the proper thing to do.</p><p>I hope the Minister of State will not force us to call a vote, that common sense will prevail and that we will all go out of here as winners, all fulfilling our case, all aiding, assisting and supporting local democracy and supporting those who are elected to represent local communities.</p></speech>

We will try to get this Bill near the end of its passage today, if possible.</p> <p>On this space, Senator Boyhan and I have a lot of common ground and we do not need to force a vote.  I certainly would not want to force the Senator to vote.  It is not in my nature to make anyone vote.  We will try to find a compromise if we can.  As the Senator will be aware, we have been trying to work on that over the past couple of weeks.  There has been much engagement around this as well.  We are on Committee Stage, we have yet to get to Report Stage and I see no reason the Senator would need to go that route.  Of course, that is entirely up to him, but I would never force anybody, certainly not the Senator who is much bigger and stronger than I am, into a vote.</p> <p>I consider amendments Nos. 42 and 43 a little unnecessary.  As we already discussed this year, we have made provision, in section 10(a) of the Bill, for the waiving or reduction of fees to the making of submissions or observations by elected members in planning applications.  It is important that they do that.  We all recognise the right of councillors to make such submissions and that they would not be charged.  We have expressed that already.  The wording in section 10(a) of the Bill will explicitly give effect to one of the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal.  Accordingly, it should not be changed.</p> <p>We still disagree on whether it should be in regulation or in legislation.  We would be strongly of the view that it is better done in regulation.  Senator Boyhan is of the view that it should be in legislation and we have been debating that.  To be clear, in case there is any doubt about this, we all are at one that it is not necessary to have a fee.  I am happy to restate clearly for the record that we agree on the zero rate.  It has been said previously but I wanted to say it again because this Bill has gone on for so long that people are forgetting where we are with the discussion.</p> <p>The section 10 provision is essentially an enabling power for the Minister to make regulations under section 33 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, to provide for the payment by a councillor of a reduced fee or no fee rather than the current &euro;20 fee for making submissions or observations on planning applications.  In this regard, it should be noted that all planning-related fees applied by the planning authorities are provided for in regulations and are not in primary legislation.  That is the space in which we have been doing this.  Senator Boyhan is asking that we would change that, for this particular bit, to primary legislation.  I do not believe it is necessary.  The Senator does.  He made a strong case for it.  We can still tease it out a little further before we get to Report Stage.  There is no need to divide on it today.  I am still not sure why Senator Boyhan thinks it must be in primary legislation but I am happy to engage with him further in that space and we will try to work it out.</p> <p>Furthermore, I indicated in response to remarks by Senator Lombard on Second Stage that my Department is currently reviewing generally the planning fees, which have not been changed since 1998.  Accordingly, it is appropriate that the issue of the rate of fee to be applied in respect of the making of submissions or observations by elected members on planning applications should be considered and provided for in the context of the regulatory review of planning fees which is currently being undertaken.  There is a process to do this and that is what we are trying to do.  We have been clear at different stages of debate here that we intended to do that and to move to the zero rate as well.  However, I am open to the notion of applying a zero fee in respect of written submissions and observations on planning applications by elected members but this might be more appropriately limited to elected members from the municipal district or local area committee representing the area to which the planning application relates, as more or less suggested by Senators Boyhan and Grace O'Sullivan in amendment No. 43.</p> <p>Senator Kevin Humphreys, previously and again today, made a strong case for why it should not be restricted to applications in the municipal area the elected member is from.  The Senator is probably correct in what he states about councillors owning the development plan.  That is the argument and the Senator made a strong argument on that as well.  We can look to see if we can reach some compromise on that.  We felt that having it completely open to a county councillor across the board might be too wide but I buy in to the Senator's argument that it is his development as a councillor and he wants to be able to defend it, respect it and ensure it is judged correctly as well.  We can look at that in the next week or two and try to come to some agreement with the Senator.</p> <p>The perspective of city councils and a county councils is probably quite different.  I ask Senator Humphreys not to nod his head and let me finish first.  Maybe we can find agreement here of how we deal with that.  The geographical area of a county council compared to that of a city council can be massive.  The Senator made a good case and I am prepared to tease it out with him a little further.  The Senator need not force it today.  I would like us to reach agreement on this.  It is better if we all agree when it comes to planning matters.  By all means, it is up to the Senators.  It is agreed we will have Report Stage in a couple weeks when we could tease it out a little further.</p> <p>In amendments Nos. 42 and 43, the Senators want the same as a zero rate.  We agree on that.  It is only a matter of agreeing whether it is in regulation or how far it stretches.  We could continue the debate because even among the Senators, who get on well as colleagues, there is a bit of a disagreement on that as well.</p></speech>

There is a disagreement and I would rather that we could find a way in which we all agree on this.  The issue is whether a councillor would have the right to a zero fee right throughout a local authority area or only in the municipal area.  That is the space we are down to.  There is disagreement on that.  Senator Humphreys made a good case on that and I am willing to look at it a bit more and tease it through further with him.  I want to draw the distinction that maybe it is different between cities or large urban areas and counties.  We can tease out over the next week whether we agree on that as well.  The approach represents a reasonable balance by giving appropriate recognition to the role of elected members in representing the interests of their local area's electorate.</p> <p>I am sure the Senators would agree that the compromise, clarification or concession - call it what one likes - of the zero rate fee is a positive for elected members who want to be able to do their good work but we might have to consider whether we need to attach conditions to this so that any such arrangement is not abused and does not result in members of the public trying to circumvent the normal process of paying his or her &euro;20 fee to make an observation.  I spoke about this previously.  I do not wish to see councillors, who, as Senator Grace O'Sullivan stated, have a busy workload as it is, pushed too far because they will then be used to make submissions, either positive or negative, to planning applications by the public which they would not normally make but because councillors do not charge.  I do not want them feeling, as a councillor stated to me previously, under more pressure to do that if there is no fee.  I accept that is not what the Senators want.  I am merely stating we must ensure that we do not walk into a space we do not want to be in.  We will clarify whether we need conditions around that.  Everyone is in agreement here that the fee would not apply.</p> <p>As I set out earlier, the setting of the planning fees is more legally correctly provided for in regulations and I would therefore propose to address this issue in regulations rather than in primary legislation.  I accept the Senators will not agree on that.  I would ask them to give a little more thought to that because that is the space in which it has been and where it belongs with the overall planning fees.  It is not only the local authorities for which we set fees and that is why that is there.  We still propose to have them in regulations.</p> <p>We have a week or two until Report Stage.  I am happy to engage further with the Senators.  Let us see if we can get agreement on that as well.  At this stage, I would ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment because we agree on the zero rate and it is merely a matter of working out whether it be in regulation or primary legislation.  It is the Senator's choice.  I can only make the case to the Senators.</p></speech>

They have a reserve function in relation to the estimates or the budget and to the sale of land and property.  They also have a reserve function in relation to the development plan.</p> <p>Observations on planning are normally made on the development plan.  I do not think I have ever made an observation on planning unless it was in some way related to the development plan.</p> <p>The Minister of State stated that the councillors would be put under additional work.  The primary role of a councillor, under those three functions, is the development plan and to ensure there is proper planning, whether in the county, city or wherever.  The development plan should be a primary function of councillors.  For starters, I do not think councillors come under pressure.  That relates to old times where there was a few bob for planning permission given.  The standard and quality of councillors shows leadership.  They know exactly what needs to be developed and are quite confident and capable of saying: "No, I believe in the development plan that I voted on and I want to see it developed."</p> <p>I note amendment No. 43 makes reference to the local area, but the local area has a greater impact in the development of a county or city.  If one is running a metro line from Swords to Sandyford, the implications of density all along that line affect the financial viability of that line and it is nonsense to say one would exclude a councillor from the north side of the city from making a submission on density and height.  I do not accept that.</p> <p>Regulation can be changed and that is why I will press the matter of it being put in primary legislation to a vote here today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I accept the Minister of State's credibility and record but he may not be in office next year or in five or ten years' time.

I am happy for us to take out the amendments and the Senator can press them if he wants,  but I would rather we use the time wisely, which we did during the past month, to reach a compromise on this position in the next few weeks.

It is a good case.  Councillors throughout the country are listening to these proceedings.  They are interested, they are watching and they expect this.

I would hate for us to compromise by putting a measure to a vote that the Minister of State has committed to considering by way of regulation.  The Senator has got his result.  It may be possible that he might compromise, in some shape or form, on pushing a measure to a vote that, ultimately will be, and should be, dealt with by way of legislation.  Perhaps there could be a partnership model in place in keeping with the spirit of the new politics, whereby the Senator would allow the Minister of State to give an undertaking to examine the regulation.  I put forward that common-sense approach.</p></speech>

We have not been saying that for weeks.  We established this last week.  We discussed this.  The Senator made a very good case, as did Senator Humphreys and others.  We agreed then that it needed more clarification in this House and that we would go to a zero rate.  I discussed that with the Senator.  Let us be fair about this.</p></speech>

Let us very clear on this.  We agreed before the end of Committee Stage we would clarify that we wanted to go to a zero rate.  We are doing that.  We will have Report Stage.  I suggest, for the final time, that the Senator does not call a vote on this today.  He can call a vote on the same issue on Report Stage, on the same amendment if he wants.  He can do it on whatever Stage he prefers.  All I am saying is that, in my view, it is unnecessary to do that.  If the Senator wants to do it for whatever reasons, he can go ahead and do it, but we have Report Stage next week and we can tease it out then.</p> <p>Another issue to be teased out relates to the areas on which we would agree.  We will all, hopefully, be enacting this planning Bill and I would like us to get agreement on it.  However, by all means, it is up to the Senators to decide on this.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad Chamber and I thank her and her Cabinet colleagues for supporting the proposal to ban smoking anywhere food is served, including outdoors.</p> <p>I begin with the purpose of the motion and the rationale behind it.  The purpose of the motion is to encourage the Minister to bring in legislation, either by way of a statutory instrument or primary legislation, to ban smoking outdoors where food is served.  The rationale behind this is that on the good days we do get, people like to enjoy a meal outdoors and with modern technology in terms of heating, etc., it is more pleasurable to do that in this country.  People like to eat with their families.  A meal is a social event and it is something that as a society we would all agree that families should enjoy together.</p> <p>In the first instance, those of us who do not smoke, do not wish to be subjected to second-hand smoke from people near at hand when we are eating a meal.  While the evidence for the damage that second-hand smoke does in an enclosed space is well known, it is still factually correct to state that second-hand smoke, even outdoors, represents a health hazard.  Therefore, why would people who wish to enjoy a meal in a smoke-free environment, want to have that meal ruined by smoke and by risking their health?</p> <p>The third element of this which I believe is very important is to denormalise smoking.  This is about protecting our children.  We know from surveys that 78% of smokers start smoking under the age of 18.  To those who would accuse us of being a nanny state and argue that we should leave people a choice, I ask them what choice one can exercise when one is already addicted by the age of 18.  The answer to that is extremely limited.  This is about protecting our children from experiencing smoke, from seeing smoking as a normal habit and being exposed to that habit.</p> <p>To recap on all the things that have been done over the years: there was the ban on smoking in the workplace; the banning of sales of one and two cigarettes to packs of five, ten and now 20; the ban on advertising; the ban on point of sale advertising; and the battle we had as a nation being threatened by multinational tobacco companies for bringing in plain packaging.</p> <p>Not one of these things on its own succeeds in reducing smoking to the level we want to reduce it to in this country.  It is a combination and this is yet another step towards that.  If we can create a scenario where children do not know about smoking, do not experience smoking, do not see smoking as being remotely normal and are educated on the harm and damage it does, I believe they will not take it up.  When we were dealing with plain packaging I asked the Irish Cancer Society to do a study, which it did.  We already had an advertisement showing how young children were fascinated by the packets as they were shiny and nice.  They made them want to hold them and have them and then the cancer society showed them the plain packs.  The children recoiled in horror and wondered why anyone would want to smoke, seeing these pictures of rotting lungs, amputated limbs and emaciated bodies of people dying from cancer, secondary to smoking.  That is the rationale behind the motion.</p> <p>There is precedent for this.  Yet again Australia has led the way, but countries like Canada and certain states in the United States have brought in laws to outlaw smoking where food is served outdoors.  In New South Wales there is a no smoking in commercial outdoor dining areas Bill.  I talked about any seated dining area, within 4 m of a seated dining area on a licensed premises or within 10 m of a food fair stall.  We are not doing something completely new here.  It is new in Europe for sure.  We led the way in Europe with plain packaging and we should lead the way with this too.  I have to compliment the Department of Health and the team on all the work they have done on this issue.  The tobacco unit is a small unit but it is highly motivated and very effective.</p> <p>I do not believe any conversation on tobacco can be complete without mentioning that 6,000 Irish men and women die every year as a direct result of this product.  It is the only product that is legal, that we know of, that when used as directed by the manufacturer will kill one in two of its habitual users prematurely.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the European region, 1.6 million deaths related to smoking occur every year and second-hand smoke causes 890,000 premature deaths globally every year.</p><p>All of the statistics I have mentioned might just seem like figures, so I want to impress upon people that 6,000 families in this country have gone through the emotional trauma of losing a loved one.  They might also have lost their households' main income earners, leaving them to face severe financial stress for many years to come and, especially in the case of children, disadvantage.  We must do everything in our power to help smokers quit and to protect our children from ever taking up this killer habit.</p><p>I was warned in the past not to refer to the tobacco industry as "evil".  As I have said many times, however, I struggle to find another term that can adequately describe an industry that produces a product despite knowing its killer effect and addictive nature.  I believe the industry targets our children.  Once someone is addicted, getting off smoking again is a long battle.  The industry then moves on to the next cohort.  If we can protect our children, this habit will die out.</p><p>As Minister for Health, I had the pleasure of launching the separate Tobacco Free Ireland and Healthy Ireland plans.  It was great to attend international meetings and be able to produce a picture of the entire Cabinet, bar one member who could not be present, holding up that document.  It was a cross-Government initiative to create a healthy society and our Tobacco Free Ireland document is an integral part of that.</p><p>I call on people to consider the current situation in the health service.  We know the challenges that we face.  I have seen some comments on social media to the effect that we should be fixing the service instead of annoying smokers and retailers on this issue.  I have the following to say in response.  While we try to have a health service that looks after those who are ill now, we would be derelict in our duty if we were not to consider the causes of those illnesses and take action to prevent them in future.  I ask the House to imagine an Ireland where no one smoked or abused alcohol and everyone achieved a BMI under 30, if not under 25.  What number of beds would we then need in our health service?  The greatest challenge facing the western world today is not infection, as it used to be, but non-communicable diseases, lifestyle issues, diabetes and chronic obstructive airways.</p><p>When we discuss smoking, tobacco's ill effects and the cancers it causes of the lung, throat, oropharynx, mouth and stomach, never mind the other cancers it is associated with, we should also consider the damage it does to people's lungs such that, in their last ten or 20 years, they find themselves disadvantaged, unable to breathe, often limited to living at home, going out with oxygen cylinders and attached to machines at night to help them breathe.  As such, this is also a quality of life issue.  It is not just the years one lives, but the quality of those years as well.  Consider the heart attacks, strokes and impact on the quality of life for people who had a stroke, as my father did.  He was left blind for the last 14 years of his life due to smoking.  My brother, who was 60, died of lung cancer.  Despite being a public health doctor, he was unable to quit the habit.  More recently, my 62 year old brother-in-law, a plumber, is gone due to smoking and lung cancer.</p><p>For me, this is personal.  It is also professional, given all the suffering I have seen as a doctor.  For me as a politician, it must be one of our main political ambitions to create a tobacco-free society by 2025.  By that I mean a prevalence of smoking of less than 5%.  We are winning, given that recent surveys have shown that fewer and fewer people between the ages of 12 and 17 years are smoking and that awareness is greater.  It is up to us to keep that fight going.</p><p>The Department is working on an initiative of which I will be supportive, that being, the licensing of tobacco outlets.  I would love to see large retail outfits like Tesco, SuperValu and Dunnes Stores stop selling cigarettes when they are supposed to be a provider of food, nourishment and nutritional goods.  Someone should take the lead and stop selling.  I want to end the practice of a single licence covering all of a retailer's outlets.  Each outlet should need a licence and transgressions on that licence should be punishable by fines of at least &euro;5,000 and the loss of the outlet's right to sell tobacco for a year.  These would be real sanctions and I hope the Department will be able to progress them soon.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for attending and the Cabinet and my colleagues in Fine Gael for their support.  I hope that this motion passes and I look forward to the Department introducing a law to support it.</p></speech>

A previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, introduced the smoking ban.  When Senator Reilly was Minister for Health, he introduced a suite of measures that transformed societal attitudes in terms of how we tolerated, viewed and used tobacco.  In our country today, we would be aghast if someone in our company was to strike up a match and light a cigarette at a social gathering.  This is not the nanny state interfering.  It is not that we want to make it difficult for proprietors and owners of restaurants and bars.  As Senator Reilly stated, it is about transforming the lives and health of our citizens.</p> <p>We were the first to introduce the workplace smoking ban.  We then tackled plain packaging.  As Members of the Oireachtas in tandem with the Department of Health, and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, and congratulate her on her tenure to date in the Department, we are trying to create a smoke-free Ireland.  That means only 5% of our population smoking by 2025.  To achieve that, we need leadership from politicians.  The Minister of State has demonstrated bravery in her brief over the national drugs strategy and injection centres.  As Minister, Senator Reilly stood up to big tobacco.  To be fair, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin did the same.  I chaired the health committee while the Minister of State, then just a Deputy, was a member of it.  We sat through the pre-legislative scrutiny phase of the plain packaging Bill.</p> <p>This is about protecting people, including children, and denormalising tobacco.  Our policy is working, given that the number of people engaged in smoking has declined.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We still have a significant way to go but the number of people smoking has declined.  Part of our difficulty is that there is a still a sense of awe among some young people and hopefully plain packaging will eliminate some of that.  The elimination of advertising is aimed at reducing the visibility of cigarettes and reducing the harmful effects of smoking.</p><p>It has been demonstrated over time that pricing has had an impact.  The other two issues are visibility and availability.  We must lessen the appeal of smoking.  Cigarettes are a risk to health.  As Senator O'Reilly said, 78% of smokers started smoking before turning 18.  We must decrease the appeal of smoking to young people.  Our public health policy must be about decreasing the appeal, de-normalisation and ensuring a smoke-free environment for all.  </p><p>It is estimated that between 19% and 22% of our population still smokes, which is a considerable number of people.  If we are to get to 5% by 2025, we need to take measures over and above those we have already taken and that is what the motion before us tonight aims to do.  Approximately 5,000 people die every year from tobacco related illnesses and diseases.  So many lives are lost and so many families are bereaved because of smoking.  In terms of economics, the effects of tobacco and smoking cost the State approximately &euro;300 million per year.  </p><p>Some Members have expressed concern about what this motion is trying to achieve.  We are not trying to put people out of business or to stop people enjoying themselves.  We are trying to ensure that our public health policy includes a strong suite of proposals and measures that will tackle the issue for once and for all.  Senator Reilly referenced obesity too but this is not just about economics, bed nights or the cost to the State; it is also about saving lives.  It is about ensuring a societal change in the way we view our relationship with tobacco.  I commend the work of former Senators van Turnhout and Crown who submitted motions and Bills previously to prohibit smoking in cars and in playgrounds.  Why is it that we all now find it abhorrent to have people smoking in our company, in our houses or our cars?  Why is it now the case that people ask others if it is okay for them to smoke and if the answer is "No", they go outside?  It is because we have changed our attitude.  Those of us who are of a certain age will remember the Marlboro man and the advertisements associated with him but it is no longer cool to smoke.  We should make that very clear to the young people who are being targeted by the tobacco companies in a variety of ways.  </p><p>As legislators, we have a duty of care.  We cannot be negligent or passive but must work to bring about a healthier Ireland.  We service our cars, our washing machines and our boilers.  We install radon meters and smoke alarms in our houses.  There is a clarion call for us as a people to recognise that smoking kills.  If one talks to people who have COPD or other respiratory illnesses as a consequence of smoking, they will say that they wish they could turn the clock back.  </p><p>The motion before the House tonight is sensible and will add to the suite of measures that is already in place.  I thank Senator Reilly for his leadership and hope that the House will support the motion.</p></speech>

I congratulate Senator Reilly and his Fine Gael colleagues on tabling this motion, which Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting fully.  That said, it would be important to see the detail of any proposed legislation or regulation which would allow the Minister to take measures to ban smoking in areas where food is consumed, including in outdoor areas, but the general idea behind this motion is one with which we fully agree.</p> <p>An average of 16 people die each day from the effects of smoking, tobacco related cancer or other illnesses.  More than 81,000 hospital bed days are taken up each year treating people with preventable cancer arising specifically from smoking.  The estimated cost to the healthcare system of smoking is more than &euro;500 million per annum, yet there are still organisations under the remit of Government Departments that facilitate tobacco company investments.  I know Senator Reilly agrees that this beggars belief and flies in the face of the aim of achieving a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025, but it is still happening today.  Last October, my party colleague Senator Swanick, who sends his apologies that he could not be here this evening, spoke of his attempts to bring an end to investment in tobacco companies by the Courts Service.  The response he received effectively said that the service would not invest in the tobacco industry if the Oireachtas made it illegal to do so.  Basically, there is no law prohibiting the service from investing in the tobacco industry and therefore, it is fine for it to do so.  Senator Swanick has a Bill before the House which aims to prohibit such investment and I hope that when the time comes he will be supported in his endeavours.  I just wanted to flag that because tobacco control is an issue which everybody in this House and this country takes very seriously.  </p> <p>I am very pleased that Ireland has a very strong tradition in this area.  As Senator Buttimer pointed out, my party leader and the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, introduced a ban on smoking in public areas and many workplaces.  Many countries throughout the world have followed Ireland's course and introduced similar measures.  As the saying goes, imitation is the best form of flattery and that is something of which we can be very proud as a people.  </p> <p>The way to tackle sustained tobacco use is through education, an integrated approach by various Departments and from the bottom up.  When I was going to school in the 1980s, a major emphasis was placed on education around tobacco and the difficulties it caused for peoples' health.  Significant  resources were put into it.  At that time more than half of my classmates smoked but after a very short period, only two out of 35 continued to smoke.  That reduction was a direct result of the education programme that was put in place at the time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I firmly believe that if we place a real emphasis on educational material, we can transmit a message to young people that will help them to understand the harmful effects that can be caused by tobacco and cigarettes.  Unfortunately, significant numbers of young people are beginning to smoke again.  There is a need for an educational programme that focuses on the composition of cigarettes, indicates that cigarettes contain poison and shows young people the relevant images.  I commend Senator Reilly and his colleagues, as I have done on other occasions, on the work they did on plain cigarette packaging.  They faced down the might of the tobacco industry when it threatened to take us on as a nation.  I repeat that if we can avail of every possible occasion to tell young people in schools and on social media about the dangers and effects of smoking, the horrific damage it does to people and the deaths it causes, we can make huge inroads.</p><p>I agree with what Senator Buttimer said about availability, visibility and advertising.  We should be tackling such areas as well.  I appreciate that this proposal might not be popular with some businesses and some people who like to smoke outside restaurants.  I remind the House that we experienced huge difficulty in getting the initial legislation through over a decade ago, but it was seen through because it was backed politically.  It has worked and it has saved lives.  The idea of going into a pub that is filled with cigarette smoke is unthinkable now.  It was lunacy that we did so in the past.  When we travel nowadays to countries that continue to allow smoking in their bars and restaurants, we cannot get out of such places quickly enough because we realise the damage that is done by inhaling smoke in such environments.  I will never know how we lived with it for so long.  I congratulate Senator Reilly.  We will support his motion fully.  I hope the necessary legislation or regulations will be introduced soon so that we can look at exactly what they mean for businesses and set out the appropriate actions they need to take.  I repeat that we will support this proposal fully.</p></speech>

Mar a deirtear i nGaeilge, "is fearr an tsl&aacute;inte n&aacute; na t&aacute;inte".  The equivalent English-language phrase is "your health is your wealth".  I think that is a good guiding ethos as we make our way through this debate and, I hope, as we take action on foot of it.  I commend Senator Reilly on bringing this motion before the House.  I do not doubt his commitment to this issue and his passion for the health and well-being of people across the State.  I will not repeat what he said, other than to agree that there should be a particular focus on the clear and acute damage that is caused by smoking.  As a society, as communities and as families, we are all too aware of the harm caused by smoking and by second-hand smoke.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this motion and will support it today.  It has been acknowledged that this jurisdiction was the first place in the world to ban smoking in enclosed public spaces and in workplaces.  We should be very proud of the lead we took in protecting non-smokers, including children, from second-hand smoke.  As a society, we sent a message that smoking is not something we wish for our citizens to be involved in.  This motion is a timely reminder that we should be still alert to that issue and should advance that ethos.  When my colleague, Michelle O'Neill, served as Minister of Health in the North, she led on a piece of work that involved banning smoking in cars when children are present.</p> <p>My colleague in the European Parliament, Lynn Boylan, is fighting at EU level to ensure the complete separation of the tobacco industry and EU tobacco regulation.  In particular, she has been working hard to close a loophole in the EU tobacco products directive.  While I do not intend to get into the major detail of the loophole, I will say that as it stands, it allows solution providers to the illicit tobacco industry to bypass independence criteria by means of subcontracting.  I do not need to tell the Minister of State that this is very dangerous.  The problem and the solution need to be completely separate.  The tobacco industry should have no influence when an effective tracking and tracing system is being put in place.  I commend Lynn Boylan MEP on her initiative.</p> <p>As the Minister of State can see, Sinn F&eacute;in is serious about this issue.  I acknowledge that all of my colleagues from other parties are serious about it too.  We are happy to support this motion as another step towards a healthier Ireland.  The Government's tobacco-free Ireland policy was launched in October 2013.  It set as a target for Ireland that we would have a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5% by 2025.  The effect of this would be to make the State a tobacco-free society.  Will the Minister of State update the House on the progress being made by the Government in respect of this target?  Does she envisage the proposed extension of the smoking ban will help us to achieve the target?</p> <p>I would like to discuss the detail of this proposal.  It is important to start a discussion now on how this ban will work in reality.  For example, we need to reflect on what are considered to be the boundaries that denote what is considered to be "outdoors".  How do we imagine that places like parks and other outdoor recreational areas will be monitored?  Will they be covered by this measure?  Clearly, we all want this motion to be passed.  The more solid proposals we can bring to the Minister from this House, the quicker and more efficiently this motion can be brought towards legislation.</p> <p>The important issues faced by small business owners in this regard also deserve to be considered.  Will the owner of a small business like a restaurant or a caf&eacute; that has an outdoor area where food is consumed have to separate off an additional smoking area?  How will this be financed?  Will small businesses receive support to make such changes?  While I do not believe the costs possibly associated with this proposal should trump the public health benefits of banning smoking outdoors, I suggest it would be wise to consider supporting small and medium sized enterprises, just as we are doing under the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, so that such enterprises receive clear instructions, guidance and support with regard to the implementation of this change when legislation is ultimately in place, as we hope it will be.  Small business owners do not deserve to be subjected to second-hand smoke in their own businesses.  They cannot expect to carry the burdens of our decisions alone.  I ask the Minister of State to be mindful of that point.  I know she is and she will be as we move forward.</p> <p>I am happy to speak in support of this motion on behalf of my party.  We gladly welcome any steps that help to bring about a healthier, tobacco-free Ireland.  Reducing the harm caused by second-hand smoke is vital in that regard.  Our job here is to work out the details, to be innovative and to propose workable solutions to this and other issues.  As colleagues have said, we have been innovative and creative and we have taken a lead.  This is another opportunity to do that as we move forward.  Along with my party colleagues, I look forward to seeing the legislation, in the form of statutory instruments, that will be introduced by the Minister to give effect to this motion.  We will work proactively with all of our colleagues and with the Government to ensure the finer details of this proposal are worked out for the betterment of all citizens.</p></speech>

I would like to address Senator Reilly as "Dr. Reilly" because he is talking about health today.  I commend him on the introduction of this motion.  I am one of the people about whom he spoke.  I started to smoke at the age of 12.  I walked to school so that I would have 3p to buy two cigarettes at the shop beside the school.  By the time I was 15, I was smoking 20 cigarettes a day because I was working.  By the time I was 50, I was lying in a coronary unit in St. Vincent's Hospital because my coronary artery disease had finally caught up with me.  One is never clear of the disgusting habit of smoking.  To this day, when I am overseas and I walk into a shop and see a nice shiny packet of cigarettes, I frequently think "maybe I should do it just this once".  There is something about cigarettes.  I never liked them, even when I smoked them.  I smoked 100 a day at one point.</p> <p>When Senator Reilly spoke earlier about his father and his brother, he brought home to me memories of some of my relations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not believe there is a Member who does not have a relative who has died as a result of smoking. A great sadness for me, having left education to come into the Seanad, was the number of young people, particularly young girls, who used to stand outside my college smoking during every break.  There is something terribly wrong about that.</p><p>The Minister of State hit the nail on the head when she spoke earlier.  The companies that sell this product know they are selling a product that kills.  They know they are selling a product that does untold damage to the physical system that keeps us running, yet they continue to do it.  There have been class actions against them and so on and still they do it.</p><p>When I am on holiday I often think I will smoke a cigarette but the one thing that stops me are the images on the packages.  When I go into a shop and see the packages I think, "Maybe just this time", but then I look up and see a disgusting image of a rotting lung or whatever and I say, "No, that is not for me; I am walking away".  The important point is that not a day goes by without me thinking that I would like a cigarette.  I last smoked in 2000.  The Minister of State spoke about the addictive nature of it and the difficulty in giving up cigarettes.  I have had to kick the habit three times in my life and I never again want to suffer what it takes to do that.</p><p>I want to add another aspect to the discussion that I would like the Minister of State to consider, that is, this new addiction of vaping, which I find equally repulsive.  That we have not banned vaping is a matter of grave concern for me.  One goes into places now and people are not smoking but they are blowing something in one's face.  That is wrong.</p><p>One of the abiding memories I have of my time in St. Vincent's hospital when I was diagnosed with coronary artery disease was a man lying in the bed beside me who had lost both legs.  He was in his 80s, and every morning he would not lie still until the staff came in, put him in a wheelchair and brought him out to the front of the hospital so he could have a smoke.  That is the habit.  This man knew that smoking was doing terminal damage to him yet he had to have a smoke first thing every morning.  I remember my poor father, God be good to him.  The thumb, index finger and middle finger of both his hands were totally black as a result of smoking.</p><p>I will support anything the Minister of State can do to prevent people smoking, highlight it as the disgusting habit it is and shut down the cabinets in every shop that sells them.  I agree with Senator Reilly that the likes of Tesco, Dunnes and the various other chain supermarkets should not be selling a product that kills.  I commend Senator Reilly, a former Minister for Health, and those who came before him on introducing the smoking ban in this country.  We still have a long way to go.  Unfortunately, cigarettes are being sold to young people today as the new way to keep slim.  Somebody needs to tell them that they may be slim on the outside, and I do not believe that works, but they should think about the damage they are doing on the inside.  </p><p>I have family members in my age group who dropped dead because of coronary artery disease.  For some peculiar reason, we do not show symptoms.  The top of my left descending artery was 98% blocked and I was able to pass every stress test and blood test.  It was found because a doctor said he was not happy and he needed to have a look inside where they found the blockage.  I would have joined a long list of Craughwells who passed on to the next life as a result of smoking because we all smoked from a young age.  I am 100% behind anything the Minister of State can do to support the motion.</p></speech>

We know each other a very long time.  Senator Reilly, the Minister of State and myself served in the Eastern Regional Health Authority.  We were there at the start of it and at the time of its demise, but that is another story.</p> <p>I am very pleased to see this motion brought forward by Senator James Reilly, which has a great deal of support.  There is no doubt that many more names are in support of it.  We cannot say we have ever gone beyond the normalisation of smoking.  Bringing in the smoking ban in 2004 was the first major arresting of the idea that smoking is just something people do.  </p> <p>Introducing measures now will make us consider that this is not just about people smoking indoors but about smoking in areas where people are eating food.  It is significant that we have taken the issue from smoking indoors to smoking outdoors also.  This is a measured initiative to address that problem.  It is an enabling motion which puts the Minister in poll position to move on and take action by way of a statutory instrument or whatever.  That is important.</p> <p>People often talk about their right to this and that, but we need to be clear that in a civilised community rights have to work within the notion of the common good.  It is for the common good that we would extinguish smoking.  Public health has to trump my wishes.  However, I am sure that the great majority of people who smoke wish they had never picked up the first cigarette they smoked and find it horrendously difficulty to give them up.  We just heard Senator Craughwell speak about making effort after effort and yet he still has the daily urge to smoke just one cigarette.  We must continue to come down on the side of the public good.</p> <p>We have to have sympathy for people who smoke.  Equally, we have to continue implementing strong measures to encourage people not to start smoking and others to quit.  It is important that is not seen in any sense as being anti-smokers.  It is anti the dirty habit that kills people.  Someone said long ago that they love the sinner but not the sin.  We must have compassion for and give support to people who smoke.</p> <p>On the normalisation of smoking, my mother smoked when I was a child.  She was a seamstress.  I can still see her sitting at the table with the sowing machine in front of the big window.  Myself and my brother were captivated that she could smoke a cigarette without once taking it out of her mouth.  Jim and I would look at her and try to figure out if the ash would drop.  It did not.  She would finish smoking the cigarette and deftly tip it into the ash tray, pick out another cigarette and light it from the previous one.  That is a memory of my dear departed mother who paid the price for that, but there was no issue.  This was a game for us.  Will the ash fall off the cigarette or will she once again tip it into the ash tray and start smoking another?  That is the demon of the normalisation of something that is very bad.</p> <p>I was in Montenegro last October.  A colleague of mine and I went out for dinner on the first night.  We went into a lovely restaurant and I thought immediately there was something wrong, and when we looked around we saw a table where everyone was smoking.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Twenty years ago in Ireland there would have been nothing wrong and we would never have looked around.  That is part of what we have achieved but we can never say it is achieved.  We have to keep working at it.  This is a practical measure.  It is not a question of getting at people who smoke.  They have a demon within that they dearly wish they did not have.  Therefore we must make sure that the programmes to assist and encourage people go hand in hand with these measures. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-04-25a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1375" speakername="Gabrielle McFadden" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018042500002#AAA00200"><p>I am very pleased to speak on this Bill.  I commend my colleague Senator Reilly.  I acknowledge his absolute passion for this topic and moreover for protecting people.  That comes, I suppose, from being a doctor as his life revolves around looking after and protecting people.  I commend his work.</p> <p>This proposal to ban smoking where food is served will "de-normalise" the use of cancer-causing cigarettes.  Senator Dolan spoke of how normal it was for him and his brother to watch their mother smoke.  My mother smoked when I was a child and asked us as we were growing up to please not smoke.  She said she did not know the terrible effect of smoking when she started and then she became addicted.  Cigarettes are an addictive drug.  It took her many years to give them up.  As teenagers, of course, we knew better and it was cool to smoke so we laughed it off and smoked.  I continued until I was pregnant with my first daughter.  The smoking ban in pubs and restaurants stopped me ever going back to smoking.  When I was pregnant I would say I could not wait for the day I had the baby and looked forward to a lovely cup of coffee and a cigarette.  When she was born I did not do that because I was looking after her but when I went out for the first time without having a child with me I did not want to smoke because I would not go out on the street to smoke.  We know the ban works.</p> <p>As Senator Reilly said, no conversation about tobacco can begin without remembering the 6,000 men and women in this country who die prematurely because of the product.  The situation is improving, however, because of the ban in restaurants and pubs and the plain packaging which Senator Reilly worked so hard to get.  Although they are not supposed to smoke in a car with children I see people doing it and marvel at how a parent with a small child could do that.  </p> <p>The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland's policy group on tobacco "strongly supports" this Bill.  Dr. Des Cox, a paediatric respiratory consultant said this measure is important to reduce smoking: "Any level of exposure to tobacco smoke is unacceptable . . .  . The developing lungs of children are particularly susceptible to damage from second-hand smoke ...".  It is a no-brainer to take the next step and ban smoking in areas where people are eating.  Nobody is forcing business owners to stop providing a smoking area for customers.  It is the right of business people to do that if they so wish.  It is much more important that we protect those people who want to eat out and do not want to inhale second-hand smoke.  It is not just a question of the economic factors at play here in the way of hospital beds and days lost from work but of the emotional cost, the sadness and hardship that a family goes through when one of them gets cancer from smoking.  I commend Senator Reilly on all the work he has done thus far and I am very proud to support his Private Member&rsquo;s Bill. </p></speech>

This issue affects all our lives whether personally or in our families or extended families.  The Bill aims to protect our children.  We can have no greater gift than our children and we should keep that in perspective when we speak about this.</p> <p>Senator Reilly spoke about a small dedicated team from the Department of Health.  It is behind me now and I commend its work.  Since taking over this role I have learned much about what the Department does in general but particularly in respect of tobacco.  The team has done a great deal of work at different stages on this legislation.  </p> <p>Senator Buttimer spoke about having the courage of one's convictions.  If we have that we cannot go wrong with this Bill. </p> <p>In answer to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, we have reached a daily prevalence of 18% of the tobacco-free Ireland target and aim for 5% in 2025.  A total of 8% of children smoke, compared with 22% in 2002.  The message is getting through. </p> <p>People told their personal stories.  Senator Dolan spoke about his mother.  I recall my mam and dad smoking.  It was a time when smoking was normal in the home.  As children we accepted it because we did not know any better.  Now we do know better.  If we had one thing to tell our children and grandchildren it would the statistics for the number of people who die every year from smoking tobacco.  Senator Dolan called it a demon, and it is a demon.  It is very hard for someone addicted to a substance to give it up.  They are human beings and have for one reason or another taken up this addiction and we need to help rather than condemn them.  That is a lesson I have learned particularly from the brief on the national drugs strategy.  </p> <p>I pass a maternity hospital every day on my way into work and I am still astonished at the number of women who are quite pregnant, standing outside, with a drip, smoking.  Do they really understand the harm they are doing themselves and their unborn children?  I know a great deal of work is being done in maternity hospitals across the country to put women in the right frame of mind around drinking and smoking when they are pregnant.</p> <p>Second-hand smoking kills.  We all know that and there are statistics to support that.  I have never smoked but I used to sing with a band in pubs.  There was so much smoke that we could not see the people in the audience.  I wonder after inhaling all that smoke where I will be in a few months' time.  </p> <p>It is difficult to speak about this in connection with people who have a mental illness because sometimes they use smoking as a crutch.  That is very sad but we do not have a ban on smoking in psychiatric hospitals and need to consider sectors of society where we can tolerate it for a certain reason. </p> <p>This seed was planted a long time before I entered this office.  I feel like someone in a relay race taking the baton, as I did with the national drugs strategy and the supervised injecting facilities.  I am part of a team whose goal was to achieve what we have achieved in respect of tobacco and alcohol.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I was very privileged to be part of that team.</p><p>I know Senator Reilly.  I sat at many board meetings with him in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA.  I think he was the first person I sat beside the night of my first meeting in Dr. Steevens' Hospital and I was like a little green cucumber, as it were, sitting there wondering why I was there, but while I was there I learned so much from Senator Reilly and still do.  I thank him for the years of service he has given to the health and well-being of not just our children but all our citizens.</p><p>I thank the Senators for tabling this motion and giving me an opportunity to discuss this matter.  They all know of the devastation that tobacco addiction has caused to people.  More than 6,000 lives have been taken from us each year because of tobacco addiction.  That is 6,000 preventable deaths every year.  Unfortunately, the burden of disease, disability and premature death falls on the most disadvantaged in society.  Aside from the tragic human and social cost of smoking, it is estimated to cost society &euro;10.7 billion annually in healthcare, productivity and other costs.</p><p>It is because of this social and economic burden that the Government is committed to implementing the Tobacco Free Ireland policy.  The policy sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free by 2025.  Tobacco Free Ireland addresses a range of tobacco control issues and interventions.  It contains more than 60 recommendations, and I am pleased to say that we have successfully implemented a number of these.  For example, last year I was delighted to sign the regulation which introduced the standardised or plain packaging in Ireland.  I am happy to say that the standardised packages have started to appear on the market shelves in Ireland.  I was in Bulgaria at the weekend at the World Health Organization speaking about our tobacco legislation and our alcohol legislation which we hope to bring through.  I was astonished when I had an hour to walk around because I have not seen a packet of cigarettes in a shop window for a very long time, which is a good thing.  I was very taken aback by being able to see them so openly displayed.</p><p>Legislation to ban smoking in cars where children are present is in operation.  The Healthy Ireland national survey now collates annual data on smoking prevalence.  The HSE operates a very effective smoking cessation campaign called QUIT and the excise duty on tobacco has increased significantly over the years in line with Tobacco Free Ireland.  It was &euro;3.65 for a packet of 20 smokes when I was away and here it is something like &euro;12, so it shows we are going in the right way.  These and past developments have placed Ireland at the forefront of tobacco control legislation in Europe.  We are ranked second among 34 European countries in tobacco control initiatives.  Ireland&rsquo;s role as a world leader in tobacco control was recognised when the Department of Health was awarded the World Health Organization&rsquo;s prestigious world no tobacco day award in 2017 for its achievements in the field of tobacco control.  I am sure these developments were key to Ireland winning the bid to host the 18th world conference on tobacco and health which will be held in Dublin in 2021.  This is the premier conference on tobacco related issues and attracts an international audience of approximately 2,500 delegates.  The conference has not been held in a European city since 2003.</p><p>To maintain and enhance lreland's tobacco control work, a high-Ievel action plan for the Tobacco Free Ireland policy was developed.  The action plan outlines the responsibilities, actions and timelines for implementation of the policy.  Annual reports on the implementation of the action plan have been published for 2014, 2015 and 2016.  The 2017 annual report is being drafted by the Department of Health.  Both the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I, along with the Department of Health are committed to implementing a number of key recommendations in the plan in the short to medium term.  I will set out for the Senators some of the current and future priority legislative elements in which we are involved.</p><p>One of our priorities relates to our EU obligations.  The Department is continuing the transposition and implementation of the EU tobacco products directive and the secondary legislation arising from it.  The adoption of the directive provided harmonious laws across Europe on tobacco products and electronic cigarettes to facilitate the smooth functioning of the international market while assuring a high level of public health protection.  Articles 15 and 16 of the directive establish an EU-wide tracking, tracing and security feature scheme for all unit packaging of tobacco products.  The aim of this scheme is to fight the illicit trade in tobacco products.  Illicit trade undermines the free circulation of compliant products and the overall protection provided by tobacco control legislation.  The European Commission recently adopted the relevant secondary legislation and these secondary Acts are being transposed into Irish law in the Department.</p><p>The first protocol of the World Health Organization&rsquo;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control has been signed by Ireland.  It deals with the illicit trade of tobacco.  Arrangements are being put in place to ratify the protocol.  The implementation of the EU tracking and tracing legislation is a key step to ensure that Ireland will be in a position to ratify the protocol.  As a strong supporter of the World Health Organization convention, it is important that Ireland proceeds with the ratification of this protocol.</p><p>Government approval has been given for the introduction of a licensing system and other measures relating to the sale of tobacco products and non-medical nicotine delivery systems, including e-cigarettes.  The work involves developing the policy for a licensing scheme for tobacco products and non-medical nicotine delivery schemes to inform the general scheme of the Bill.  The proposed legislation is based on the recommendations from the Tobacco Free Ireland report.  As well as licensing those who sell tobacco and e-cigarettes, it will include provisions to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to those under the age of 18.</p><p>The Senators&rsquo; proposal is to extend the legislative base for the smoking ban to outdoor areas where food is consumed.  I am assuming that the Senators&rsquo; recommendations relate to commercial public places only.  The current legislative framework on tobacco control is the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts 2002 to 2015.  Section 47 of the Acts prohibits smoking in most enclosed work places.  This includes office blocks, public houses or bars, restaurants and company vehicles such as cars and vans.  There are some exemptions from the general prohibition for certain places or premises, including prisons, nursing homes, non-acute long-stay facilities and psychiatric hospitals.  The overall purpose of the ban is to limit the harm of second-hand smoke.  I recognise and support the principles behind the motion.  I acknowledge the Senators&rsquo; proposal to seek to protect people further from the harm of second-hand smoke and to denormalise further the smoking of tobacco in society.</p><p>It is clear from what I have outlined today that the Government is committed to implementing Tobacco Free Ireland.  It has and is being done in a planned and systematic way based on priorities.  These priorities are also influenced by EU and World Health Organization obligations.  Tobacco Free Ireland contains recommendations which set out an obligation to monitor the effectiveness of current smoke free legislation, including the review of existing exemptions and the monitoring of compliance with these provisions.  I am of the view that the Senators&rsquo; proposal could be considered and examined in that context.  This examination can take place after the legislative programme set out above is completed and Ireland has both complied with the international obligations and introduced a comprehensive licensing system for the sale of tobacco products.  I accept the motion and I assure the Senators that the measures will be addressed on completion of the current tobacco control legislative programme.</p><p>I reiterate that we can be proud of what we have achieved here in Ireland.  The effect of our laws is such that we have a generation of young people growing up without knowing what it is like to smoke in a pub and restaurant.  They have grown up without seeing tobacco packs displayed behind shop counters.  Those reaching school age now will grow up without seeing heavily branded tobacco packs because of plain packaging.  I thank the Senators for all their support in the past, for the various tobacco interventions and for their aims at saving lives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask that we continue to support tobacco legislation that will come the way of Senators in future.

I am sure with the guidance of the Department, we will do that.  I do not know if I will be in my current position at that stage but if I must I will pass the baton to somebody else.  I thank the Senators for this opportunity.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for her support and I mention again the tobacco unit in the Department led by Dr. Fenton Howell.  I also remember Ms Dilly O'Brien and Ms Claire Gordon.</p><p>It is great to have such support and I thank all Senators who offered such support from the various parties.  It is much appreciated and it is great when the House can unify on a public health measure like this because it is so important.  I will read a note I made for myself at the end.  I am delighted that Senator McFadden mentioned Dr. Des Cox as I spoke to him and I was going to mention that as a paediatrician, he has alluded to the damage done by second-hand smoke to young lungs and children in general.  The Minister of State is correct.  I do not have the latest figures but I have research published in 2013 indicating the smoking ban resulted in a reduction in ill-health amounting to an immediate 13% decrease in all-cause mortality, a 26% reduction in ischemic heart disease, a 32% reduction in stroke and a 38% reduction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><p>Public support for this is huge and since this has come to the fore I have met many people who have been positive in their support of it.  The website <i>thejournal.ie</i>did a poll of 14,000 people and 9,000 were in favour of this measure.  It is important to reiterate Senator Dolan's comments in that we are not anti-smoker but we are anti-smoking.  We are here to support smokers in giving up the habit because we know the damage that will be done to them.  They do too.  I know of no smoker, even including the executives in tobacco companies, who wishes his or her child to be a smoker.  In itself that speaks volumes.</p><p>The World Health Organization has the MPOWER document.  It covers: monitoring tobacco use and prevention, as done by the Department; protecting people from smoking; offering help to quit, and there have been major advances in that regard with making nicotine replacement therapy and other medication available to help people quit; and warning about dangers.</p><p>Although the debate has done much, if it did nothing else it would educate and inform young people about the dangers of smoking.  The MPOWER document also takes in enforcement of bans, and we have been very successful with that.  There are challenges and people are continuously testing the boundaries with court cases.  I am always very concerned by who is funding those cases.  Forest Ireland on a television show a few years ago denied being funded by the tobacco companies but later admitted to being funded by Forest UK, which is funded by the tobacco companies.  It is an industry that has lied over the years, denying the addictive nature of this habit and the product in Senate hearings.</p><p>I say the following to people with concerns about small businesses.  This measure would not prevent businesses from providing an outdoor area in which people can smoke but it should not be the same area allocated for dining.  It should never be the case of deciding between jobs and health or well-being.  We should not have to decide between livelihoods and lives.  It is what we are talking about.  Damage done early in life can haunt one later, which is terrible.  As the Minister of State has said, very few of us have not been affected by that damage.  Deputy Marc MacSharry has spoken of his uncles and aunts who were afflicted by lung cancer caused by smoking.</p><p>Senator Buttimer's point is also well made.  I have smoked but if we ask any smoker why he or she started - it would make people sick the first time - the reason is because it looked cool.  Our challenge is to make it uncool to smoke.  We must make it look foolish to smoke and we must help young people understand that.  There is much more to do and I know we can do it.  We must get to the point where none of our children smokes and there is a tobacco-free society.  This motion is another step along the road to achieving that goal.  I thank Senators for their support.</p></speech>

I commenced my approach to this issue during the Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il by tabling an amendment to section 34 of the principal Act which would require planning authorities in the assessment and determination of planning applications to have regard to previous developments, which have not been satisfactorily completed and previous convictions against the applicant for non-compliance with the planning Act, the Building Control Act 2007 or the Fire Service Act 1981.  I subsequently brought forward a second amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to elaborate on this and address section 35 of the principal Act relating to the actual refusal of applications for planning permission for past failures to comply.  Specifically, that amendment proposed that where a person has previously operated under a particular company name that has left estates unfinished and has subsequently applied for planning permission for new development under a different company name, that this may be taken into account by the planning authority as the basis for refusing the planning application under the second company name.  That second amendment dealing with the past performance of developers which I tabled on Report Stage was inadvertently noted as withdrawn and consequently I am now retabling it on Committee Stage in the Seanad.</p></speech>

The amendment deletes the provisions of section 35 of the Bill to amend section 28 (2) of the Planning and Development (Housing) Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  Section 35 relates to the further extension of the duration of planning permission for certain developments relating to 20 or more houses, which is provided for in section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended by section 28(2) of the 2016 Act.  This provision is being deleted from the Bill because a provision to the same effect has been provided for in section 1 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2017, which was enacted on 19 July 2017.  As a consequence, it is no longer necessary to include this provision in the Bill.</p> <p>Second, the amendment will make two very significant changes to the provisions in section 28 of the 2016 Act, which in turn amends section 42 of the principal Act of 2000, relating to the extensions of the duration of planning permission.  The first change will permit the extension of the duration of a planning permission only where substantial works are carried out during the initial duration of the planning permission.  This effectively removes a provision introduced in 2010, in the middle of the economic downturn, allowing extensions of the duration of planning permission even where development works have not commenced and where substantial works have not been carried out during the initial duration of the planning permission.  Having regard to the current lack of housing supply, the option to extend the duration of planning permissions, without development having been commenced or alternatively carried out, can no longer be justified because it facilitates the hoarding of at least some planning permissions for housing developments, including in areas, where new housing is most needed and demand is acute. </p> <p>The second change to the legislation underpins the provisions relating to the extension and duration of planning permissions; this provides for a maximum of two extensions of duration applications being allowed, the combined duration of which cannot exceed five years.  This change will empower the planning authority to carry out a proper interrogation of the realistic timescale for completing a development and consider the application of a reduced period in the granting of a first extension duration in the knowledge that if an unforeseen event arises that further delays the completion of the works, the authority may reasonably grant a second extension of duration of the permission on application by the developer.</p> <p>I will now address amendment No. 46 tabled by Senator Grace O'Sullivan.  The Green Party amendment No. 46 proposes to amend section 35(2) of the Bill to give effect to and bring into immediate operation on the enactment of the Bill, amendments of section 42 of the principal Act relating to the extensions of the duration of planning permission that are set out in section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2016.  I should point out that section 28 of the 2016 Act contains two subsections.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As I have outlined, subsection (2) relates to further extensions of the duration of certain planning permissions and it has been amended by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2017, when the Minister, Deputy Murphy signed the commencement order in July 2017, bringing the amendments of section 28(2) of the 2016 Act into operation in August 2017.  Therefore, this part of the Green Party amendment is unnecessary to the extent that it seeks to bring into operation on the passing of this Bill an action that is in operation.  I am conscious that if the Bill is passed out, it is no-one's fault.</p><p>With regard to section 28(1) of the 2016 Act, this has not yet been commenced because section 35 of this Bill proposes to make certain further amendments to section 28.  In this connection, Government amendment No. 45, which I have just outlined, proposes to amend section 35 by substituting a new subsection (1) that makes different amendments to section 28 of the 2016 Act.</p><p>These changes, which are aimed at tightening up the arrangements around extensions of durations of planning permissions, will confine extensions of duration to cases where substantial work is carried out through the initial period of the permission, and it will provide for a maximum of two extensions of duration for the completion of a development.  There will be combined maximum duration of five years allowed for an extension of a planning permission.</p><p>Given the nature and significance of these changes, and I believe Senator Grace O'Sullivan will agree they are positive in helping to expedite and shorten the timeline for completion of certain developments and addressing the hoarding of land that is subject to planning permission, it is important to give notice to planning authorities, developers and other stakeholders of the new arrangements before they are brought in to operation.  I do not, however, foresee a lengthy time lapse between enactment of the Bill and bringing it into operation by way of order commencing the amended section 28(1) of the 2016 Act, which I propose in this Bill.  As I have indicated that some limited time is required to give notice of the introduction of the new arrangements having regard to their significance.  I must, on that basis, oppose the Green Party amendment.  I believe that Senator Grace O'Sullivan will agree with the overall thrust of the changes proposed to tighten up the extension of duration provisions.  We want the same result but we just need a little bit of a time difference, if that is okay and if it is acceptable to the Senator.</p></speech>

We are an island on the edge of Europe and we need to behave as if we want to become connected to Europe and not become just a place to take nice holidays.  A key part of this national planning framework is to develop Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford as points of economic and population growth.  Nobody is saying that all towns need to be capital cities, which is wrong, but each county has a capital that can be connected to.  I believe this aspect is missing from the plan.  We need to focus on infrastructure, transport, job creation and rural Ireland.  I want to bring this issue into the discussion because it is all connected to most of today's amendments.  I am saying this now because I may not speak at the very end of the debate.  It is about quality of life.  I want to explain this for the Minister of State because I believe we are passing a plan here today and yet we are told that we cannot speak at the end of it.  The Minister of State is aware that we had a launch of this plan a few weeks ago.  I believe that we are creating a new politics here now.  A plan can never be launched without all parties taking part in this, so today I ask that anything else to do with the national planning framework would be agreed with all Senators and that it would be launched by every party.  It does not matter which party is in Government, everyone should participate in it.  The reason I bring this issue up is because of an article I read in <i>The Irish Times</i>this week.  I was concerned to see that it was revealed under a freedom of information request that a last minute intervention was made.  I must bring this to the attention of the Minister of State because it applies to the plan.</p><p>The article said:</p><blockquote>In a draft of the plans circulated in late January, a senior official at the Department of the Taoiseach emailed the Department of Public Expenditure to state: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s weak on the South-East<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />&quot;Also, the TU [technological university] for the South-East needs to be singled out as a priority given the south east has no university.<br /><br />&quot;Could suggest it as a possible Irish campus of the new European University being contemplated.&rdquo;<br /><br />The final version of the plan included a stand-alone section on a new &ldquo;technological university for the southeast&rdquo;, to be formed from the merger of Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) and the Institute of Technology Carlow.<br /><br />It also contains a reference to it participating in a network of European universities.</blockquote> <p>While I welcome this intervention because it has a direct impact on my constituency, I might have made the suggestions in this Chamber had I been given the chance.  We were not given the chance because we were told there would be delays.  It is not good enough and that is why this can never happen again here.  I put it to the Minister of State that we are practising new politics and we can never allow that to happen again.  I could not let this go today without highlighting my concerns.  This only happened one week ago and yet Senators were told that we could not address this in the Seanad.</p></speech>

The issues to which Senator Murnane O'Connor refers would have come up very clearly at the committees.  Both committees were given the job of scrutinising the plan on behalf of the Houses of the Oireachtas after a motion in the Houses to do that.  There was talk of strengthening the position around education, and it is plainly important that we do that in relation to planning.  Decisions were then to be made on a regional basis as well.  We are agreeing to put in place, through a planning Act, and this is not the plan itself but a Bill we are discussing-----</p></speech>

It is hoped it will get there some time this year.  We are putting in place a process that guarantees, no matter who is in Government in the future, that there is a protocol that takes account of all the consultation we have had and that reflects the work carried out over the past three years.  This is what we are asking the Senators to do and to vote on.  There is a difference in the Senator saying that the Houses should have the final vote on a plan-----</p></speech>

It would assume a lot of the responsibilities of planners.  That is the job of the planning departments and planners whose profession it is.  We are politicians and legislators who make decisions on documents and so on.  We would not be in a position here to do all that planning detail of a national plan that needs to be passed through the Houses.  That would not be the correct way to achieve a plan for the State.</p> <p>The second point is there would be a danger of massive delays on a plan if it had to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas for final approval.  The Senator can check the record as this is what I said.  For example, if we did that seven years ago with the Action Plan for Jobs we would never have got that plan through.  There would be potential for everybody to feel the need to add to it and change it, change a line or put a word in and so on.  That would not give us good planning.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is what I said and that is what I stand over.

The following list are four amendments that my Department is working on which I propose to table on Report Stage in the Seanad: amend the Derelict Sites Act 1990 to increase the rate of derelict site levy, enabling planning authorities to charge a fee in respect of pre-application consultations with developers in respect of strategic housing developments; make certain revisions to the provisions relating to the seeking of alterations of permissions granted in respect of strategic housing developments; amend the strategic housing development provisions to clarify that such amendments can include the new concept of shared accommodation type units; amend the provisions regarding the strategic development zones to clarify that planning decisions in such areas shall be bound by specific planning policy requirements set out in ministerial planning guidelines; provide for the statutory underpinning of the proposed marine spatial plan; insert some additional provisions related to the disclosure or information and records of the Office of the Planning Regulator, to extend the definition of strategic infrastructural development to include local authority development in respect of which environment impact statements are mandatory required; amend section 50 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 that relates to the special legal costs rules in environmental judicial review cases in order to clarify that the not prohibitively expensive rules relate solely to challenges against decisions taken in implementing the three directives specified in that section - the Environmental Impact Assessment, EIA, Strategic Environment Assessment, SEA, and the industrial emissions directives - and not to challenges to decisions taken under any provision of the Act; also extend the special legal cost rules in relation to the environmental judicial review proceedings to include various consents, under the Habitats Directive, and giving enabling power to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to include further consents in this regard; provide for enabling provisions relating to political donations in the planning process; a matter that has been discussed in the Seanad and: amend the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 to provide for a number of recommendations arising from a review of the operation of the current tenant incremental purchase scheme. </p> <p>As Senators can gather, we will have a lengthy list of Government amendments to discuss on Report Stage of this important Bill in the coming weeks.  These are the amendments that I wanted to put on the record here today, along with the ones that we put on the records during the last contribution that was part of the discussion in the Seanad.  We will have a chance to go through all of the amendments on Report Stage.  I appreciate the co-operation of the House for allowing me to put them on the record, as part of our discussion of this Bill.  </p></speech>
