    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-01-22a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1376" speakername="Lorraine Clifford Lee" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019012200002#B00400"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I wish to talk again about St. Joseph's secondary school in Rush.  The Minister will recall that I had a Commencement matter on 6 November last on the urgent need to provide temporary accommodation and he announced that day that the application had been approved.  We spoke then about the need for a permanent new school building for St. Joseph's in Rush.  I wish to remind the Minister that St Joseph's is a school with 1,000 pupils and it is the only secondary school in the town of Rush.  Rush and all the towns in north county Dublin are expanding rapidly.  It is the fastest growing part of the country with the youngest population.  Obviously, there is a very strong demand there for primary and post-primary school places.</p> <p>The capacity issue needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The Minister approved four prefabricated buildings at that time because there was a crisis.  There are 102 students on the waiting list for places in September 2019 who could not be offered places.  Thankfully, that issue has been resolved.  I mentioned at the time that there was no extra capacity to expand in the school.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Enrolments in the primary schools in the town of Rush had indicated a similar demand for places next year and into the future.  At that time, the Minister said he was actively pursuing a site for the school.  St. Joseph's has an excellent reputation in Rush and beyond.  Its principal, Ms Patricia Hayden, and the teaching staff in the school do an excellent job.  It is a DEIS school and it is linked into the Trinity access programme.  There is 100% progression to third level and apprenticeships from the school, which the Minister will agree is exceptional.  This year, the school had six entries in the BT Young Scientist exhibition.  As there was only one other school in the country with a higher number of entries, that is an exceptional record, particularly when one considers that the school does not have sufficient science laboratories.  All credit must go to the principal, the teaching staff and all the other staff in the school and, of course, the commitment of the parents to the school.  </p><p>The young people of Rush want to be educated in this school.  They demand to be educated in it, but capacity makes that very difficult.  It is worth noting that secondary schools in the neighbouring towns of Lusk and Skerries are also experiencing capacity issues and as such they will not be able to accept any overflow of students from Rush.  On 6 November last the Minister said that a site was being acquired.  However, when my colleague, Councillor Brian Dennehy, a Fingal county councillor who lives in Rush and whose children attend St. Joseph's, tabled a motion on the matter to Fingal County Council on 8 November, he was told by a senior official of the council that there was no instruction from the Department of Education and Skills to acquire a site.  As I understand it, this remains the position.  We were all dismayed with the response received to Councillor Dennehy's motion because we had been led to believe that this announcement was imminent.  There has been land zoned in the town for the school for ten years.  Following on from the work of Councillor Brian Dennehy in Rush, upgrading works on the Park Road are due to commence imminently, which will allow for access to that site.  When will the Minister issue a request to Fingal County Council to acquire this site and when will construction on the new school commence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-01-22a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019012200002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it allows me the opportunity to clarify the position in respect of St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school, Rush, County Dublin.  I acknowledge that my colleague, Senator James Reilly, has kept me up to speed on this issue.  The school is currently located at Convent Lane, Rush and consists of a number of buildings, some permanent accommodation and others prefabricated accommodation.  The site is limited for development due to its size and location in the centre of the village in a settled residential area and it was determined that a new site was required to facilitate provision of sufficient permanent accommodation for the school.</p> <p>The school&rsquo;s trustees recently confirmed to my Department that they are not in a position to provide a site to accommodate a new school building.  Following on from this, officials of my Department have requested the assistance of officials in Fingal County Council in procuring a site for the school under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of school sites.  Under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of school sites, local authorities assist my Department with the process of identifying and acquiring sites for the development of school accommodation.  The first step in this process is the identification of suitable sites by the local authorities.  The identified sites are then technically assessed on a joint basis by officials from the local authorities and my Department's professional and technical staff.</p> <p>Senator Clifford-Lee will appreciate the importance of a thorough appraisal of site options at this point to ensure the achievement of value for money and to minimise the potential of any issues arising during the planning and development stages.  The relevant local area plan provides for the location of a post-primary school site in the Kenure area of Rush.  My Department understands that this site was reserved by Fingal County Council on foot of representations made on behalf of St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school.  Access issues have to date inhibited the potential development of this site but Fingal County Council is currently working to deliver a new roadway which would facilitate such development.  Engagement between my officials and council officials in respect of the potential acquisition of this site is currently ongoing.  It is difficult to indicate a timeline for the completion of the acquisition of a site for the school in question as it is dependent on the outcome of current negotiations and also on the complexity of the conveyancing process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Once a site has been acquired the project can progress to architectural planning.  </p><p>I assure the Senator, however, that my Department is cognisant of the school's current accommodation constraints.  The Department received an application for temporary accommodation from the school.  Subsequently, it issued approval, in principle, to the board of management for the rental of two science laboratories - one being a technical graphics or design communication graphics room and one general classroom, as an interim measure, pending delivery of the permanent school building.   The responsibility for the installation of this accommodation has been devolved to the school authority for delivery.</p><p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir faoi choinne an tseans labhairt leis an Seanad inniu ar an t-&aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.</p></speech>

We have been led to believe that acquisition was imminent.  Fingal County Council require a direction from the Minister and his Department to acquire the site.  The site has been zoned for ten years so it has been sitting there.  The access issues have been resolved.  The upgrade of the park road is imminent and should be completed by the end of the second quarter of this year.  There is no reason the Minister cannot issue the instruction to acquire the site.  It is not good enough for him to come in here and say engagement is "ongoing" and claim there are complex conveyancing reasons.  This is completely unacceptable.  We have been led to believe by plenty of local representatives that this project is a done deal, there will be a new school and the devil and all will be done.  It is clear from the Minister's reply that the acquisition is not imminent.  It is an absolute disgrace that children in Rush are on this site without a playing pitch, a library and with inadequate science and woodwork rooms.  There is simply a capacity issue.  Next year there will not be any room.  There is no room for any further prefabs on this site.  There will be great anger in Rush when people realise that the Minister is not even on the verge of issuing the instruction to acquire the site.</p></speech>

I do not issue instructions to buy a preferred site.  There is a memorandum of understanding, which is an engagement between the local authority, not just Fingal County Council but all local authorities, and the Department of Education and Skills.  As part of that process, there is a communication between Department officials and Fingal County Council to ensure that a number of preferred sites are put on the table.  It is up to them to ensure the communication is open and transparent.  The Senator stated that a county councillor said that there is no engagement going on between officials-----</p></speech>

I am sure the Cathaoirleach has had experience of this as well.  I am seeking definite clarification and, if necessary, a circular should be sent to local authorities on the exact intention of this when the Minister put it forward.  When he came before the House previously, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, stated what it should be.  It should not compound the issue for people who are justifiably applying for planning permission and able to get it.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say in clarification.</p></speech>

It is fair to state, however, that rural housing has been a major issue for 20 years, not least in the Senator's area of north Kildare.  I will outline the position from the perspective of the recently announced national planning framework, NPF.  The latter was published in 2018 and it sets out the overarching strategic planning approach underpinning the sustainable development of both urban and rural areas in the period to 2040.  To articulate the broad content of the NPF in clear and understandable terms, the framework contains national planning objectives to guide and inform the planning process.</p> <p>National policy objective 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas.  It seeks to encourage growth and arrest decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or population decline in recent decades, while also highlighting the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns that are under strong urban influence and under pressure from unco-ordinated and ribbon-type development in order to avoid overdevelopment of those areas.  Some of that took place in the past, particularly in areas close to large urban centres.  This is supplemented by national policy objective 19, which points to the need to ensure that in providing that rural communities meet housing requirements a policy distinction should be made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchments of cities, towns and centres of employment, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low, declining or both.</p> <p>In the context of weaker rural areas, objective 19 provides that the determination of planning applications for single houses in the countryside should be based on general siting and design-based criteria for rural housing in statutory guidelines and plans, having regard to the viability of smaller towns and rural settlements.  These criteria include matters such as landscape, vehicular access and wastewater disposal.  On the other hand, where development pressures and the risk of haphazard development in the vicinity of larger urban centres as designated in local authority development plans are evident, objective 19 advises that it is reasonable that the determination of applications for housing in such rural areas should be informed by considerations beyond the siting and design criteria for rural housing contained in statutory guidelines and plans.  In particular, account should be taken of whether there is a demonstrable functional requirement for such housing in social, economic or occupational terms and whether such development, of itself or in combination with existing and permitted development, would lead to detrimental haphazard and unco-ordinated development.</p> <p>These objectives represent a balanced approach, consistent with long-standing Government policies on sustainable development and previous planning guidelines issued in 2005 under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act.  Planning authorities are required to have regard to these guidelines on sustainable rural housing in the framing of planning policies in their development plans and in the assessment of individual planning applications for rural housing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Under the 2005 guidelines, planning authorities are required to adopt a balanced approach to ensure the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing and haphazard development, particularly in the areas we have mentioned.  Accordingly, the objectives of the national planning framework are aligned with the approach that is already expected of planning authorities under the current guidelines.</p><p>Arising from a European Court of Justice ruling in the Flemish decree case, which is of relevance to the local needs criterion, the 2005 guidelines are being reviewed by a working group comprising officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and representatives of planning authorities nominated by the local government sector.  It is likely that many of the planning applications referred to by the Senator fall into the categories of the local needs criterion or the 2005 guidelines.  The Flemish decree, which linked the sale or transfer of property in certain Flemish communes with the condition that there should exist a sufficient connection between the prospective property buyer and the relevant commune, was ultimately and perhaps not surprisingly deemed by the European Court of Justice to be in breach of Article 43 of the treaty on the freedom of movement of citizens.  Following engagement between the Department and the European Commission further to the case, and subject to the completion of the working group's ongoing deliberations, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government expects to be in a position shortly to finalise and issue planning authorities with revisions to the 2005 rural housing guidelines that take account of the judgment in the Flemish decree case.</p><p>From my perspective, I will certainly talk to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  It is not unreasonable for someone who grew up in a rural area and has lived there all for all of his or her life to expect to be able to continue living in that community.  Obviously, that depends on other important factors like the design of the house, the availability of wastewater treatment, access and the extent to which development has already taken place in the area.  I am aware of some of the inconsistencies about which the Senator has spoken.  To answer his question directly, the ultimate objective is that the revised guidelines will be circulated to each local authority as soon as they are finalised to ensure there is a uniform approach to the national planning framework when it comes to individual decisions at local authority level.  In my distinct role in charge of local government, I must emphasise that each local authority is an independent republic.  It is a bit of an oxymoron to be the Minister of State with responsibility for local government, given that local authorities - quite rightly - jealously guard their own independence, such as they have it.  It is not unreasonable to think the new guidelines should be completed as soon as possible and circulated to ensure there is a uniform approach across the country.</p></speech>

In the case of virtually every application for planning permission for a one-off house that has been refused in County Kildare since 1 November last, objective 19 of the national planning framework has been quoted as part of the refusal.  There is no clarity with regard to objective 19, which refers to "economic or social need".  It has been interpreted as meaning "social and economic need".  The Minister of State added another consideration to the list when he referred to "social, economic or occupational terms".  This will confuse things further.  We want clarity so that people can go by their local county development plans.  Something from higher up should not be dictating what should and should not happen.  It is unfortunate that planners, particularly in County Kildare, are taking objective 19 of the national planning framework on board as a greater priority than their own local county development plan, which was put in place by councillors at local level.</p></speech>

If there is an issue with the development plan in County Kildare, it is open to the councillors in the county to amend it.  I understand what the Senator is saying about objective 19.  By the way, I do not see how the use of the word "occupational" complicates things.  It is quite clear that in the case of someone like a farmer who has an obvious reason to be building in the countryside, that is surely a clarification of things, if anything.</p></speech>

The previous Government accepted this recommendation and, in July 2013, Deputy Enda Kenny announced plans to hold this referendum.  By January 2015, those plans were abandoned by that Government.  In September 2017, the current Government revived this commitment when it announced an indicative timetable of referenda to be held, which included lowering the voting age to 16, to be held in May or June 2019.  As of last month, the Government appeared to have abandoned those plans to facilitate this referendum by stating that it is not within its plans to hold the referendum in 2019.  One has to presume that unless Fine Gael's coalition with Fianna F&aacute;il is formalised, the confidence and supply agreement will end soon after 2019 and, therefore, we will not see this referendum in this Government's term.</p> <p>If I am honest, I have become cynical about Fine Gael's willingness to re-examine the voting age.  We brought forward legislation in this House that would have lowered the voting age in local and European elections and the Government froze it on Second Stage for six months, stating that more time was needed to examine that proposal.  We sought to engage with Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il constructively, but we were stonewalled in those efforts.  When the legislation returned nine months later, Fine Gael chose to oppose it section by section, stating that a referendum on the matter would be held and that it would, therefore, be premature to extend voting rights in certain elections when we did not have the consent of the people to extend voting rights in all elections.  I do not know why it took nine months for the penny to drop.  We are now in a situation where Government has not only failed to facilitate this referendum, but has also opposed others in their efforts to reduce the voting age through legislative change.  It is time to allow young people to have their say in matters that affect their lives.  We will all reap the reward and we will all profit from their inclusion.</p> <p>We are looking for clarity today on whether a referendum can be held within the lifetime of this Government.  Has that potential been explored?  Has the Government considered holding the referendum on the same day as a general election?  If the Minister of State cannot give any further indication as to when this referendum will be scheduled, will he concede that his Government has failed on its commitment to young people and will he give reasons why a referendum that has been sitting on the agenda for six years has failed to come to fruition?</p></speech>

This is at least the second time that we have had this discussion on Commencement Matters.  I acknowledge that the Senator and other Members are strong advocates for a reduction in the voting age to 16, which was recommended by the report of the Constitutional Convention in 2013, as the Senator pointed out.</p> <p>The convention examined this issue extensively and during its deliberations, three ballots took place to inform its proposals in the matter.  In the first ballot, there was a small majority, 52%, in favour of the proposal that the voting age be reduced.  In the second ballot, the members were asked to consider whether to reduce the voting age to either 17 years or to 16 years and the stronger support was for the latter reduction, 48% supported a reduction to 16 while 39% were in favour of a reduction to 17 and 14% expressed no opinion.  A third ballot was also held on whether the voting age should be reduced for some types of elections only, for example, local elections.  The overwhelming view of the convention did not support a reduction in the voting age for specific types of elections only, which is why the Government opposed the Bill to which the Senator referred.  Some 68% of the members of the Constitutional Convention, which was by far the widest margin in a vote on any of these matters, said that there should be no difference between voting ages.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not think it was too controversial a position for the Government to have adopted when that Bill was being considered.</p><p>In line with the majority opinion of its members, the First Report of the Convention on the Constitution contained a recommendation to the effect that a referendum be held in order to amend the Constitution to reduce the voting age to 16 for all elections.  Against this background, on 26 September 2017 the Government announced an indicative timetable for the holding of a number of referendums that came from the work of both the Citizens' Assembly and the convention.  Included in that indicative timetable was the referendum on reducing the voting age to 16, which, subject to the timely passage of a Constitution Amendment Bill by each House of the Oireachtas, was to be held on the date of the local and European elections scheduled to take place in late May 2019.  The forthcoming European Parliament elections must be held in all member states between 23 and 26 May next.  Two further referendums were also to be held on the same date as the local and European elections.</p><p>The Department is responsible for the development of the necessary constitutional (amendment) Bill in respect of reducing the voting age to 16.  On a related matter, it will also be responsible for bringing forward appropriate amending legislation regarding extending the franchise at presidential elections to Irish citizens' resident outside the State.  These referendums, when held, will address two of the recommendations of the Convention on the Constitution.  If passed, these amendments to the Constitution would give rise to the need for supplementary amendments to the Electoral Acts in order to address the practical considerations that would arise.  However, at its meeting on 4 December 2018, the Government reviewed further the progress on the overall programme of Bills to amend the Constitution.  Having regard to other referendums proposed to be progressed in the short term and having particular regard to the heavy legislative programme scheduled for the first half of this year arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the Government agreed that only two referendums will be held in tandem with the local and European elections and that further consideration will have to be given to the timing of a referendum on reducing the voting age to 16.  While the Government remains committed to the holding of a referendum to reduce the voting age to 16 years, it is not proposed that said referendum will be held this year.</p><p>I am sorry that the Senator feels cynical about the Government's position but, as matters stand, people will be obliged to complete two ballot papers for the local and European elections.  With two referendums, there would be two further papers.  There will be several plebiscites at which people will be obliged to complete five ballot papers.  I may be wrong but I do not think that we have ever had an election day when there have been five ballot papers.  The idea that there would be a sixth was actively considered by me and the franchise section and we formed the view that it would be too much.  We also had to be cognisant of the fact that in terms of the preparation of the Bills necessary to hold referendums, there is only certain scope in the Department to continue with them.  Preference was given to the question of those outside the State and whether they would have the right to vote in presidential elections.</p><p>Deputy Adams tabled a Bill in the D&aacute;il which combined voting for citizens overseas and reducing the presidential voting age.  I had a meeting with him in the middle of last year and we discussed several of the issues involved.  He was to revert to me and the Department but never did so.  That is not a sufficient excuse but I would have expected a response within the past eight months to some of the queries that I and the officials raised at our meeting, particularly if he was interested in ensuring that those referendums would be held.  The Government's position is that it wants the referendum to be held but we cannot have a polling day on which people would be given more than five ballot papers.  That is why the decision was made at the end of last year that only two referendums would be held in conjunction with the two elections and the plebiscite.</p></speech>

The Minister of State noted that I and many others in this House are strong advocates for a reduction in the voting age to 16.  Referendums proposed more recently than those recommended by the Convention on the Constitution have somehow leapfrogged this referendum.

The area of Clongriffin and Belmayne is growing in size as is the population.  Renewed plans are frequently put in place for the expansion of that entire community and a population of 50,000 is projected in the coming years.  We are effectively talking about a population on the scale of a large town, if not a small city.  A number of years ago I had a debate in this Chamber with the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, about the need for a new secondary school in that area.  At the time I was told by the Minister that it was not necessary and that the population did not warrant it.  Within 18 months the Department had changed its mind, having looked at the population trends and the projected population, and granted the establishment of a new second level school in that area.  Thankfully, Educate Together is to be awarded patronage and it is to open in September.</p> <p>I make that point purely because we feel a Garda station would benefit policing, security and bring about a sense of community in that community.  There is currently what we might call a Garda clinic which takes place in one of the rooms of the Junction Community Centre in Clongriffin.  On a Saturday, garda&iacute; sign forms, do basic Garda work and are available to assist the community.  An Garda is doing the best it can with the resources it has to serve the community in whatever way it can.  Clearly a Garda presence of that nature is seen to be needed in that area.</p> <p>This area is growing in size.  In the past politicians have been criticised for not engaging in forward planning.  We build residential units but we do not build a community around those residential units to serve them.  I am saying at this early stage that there is a need for a Garda station, just as I said two years ago that there was a need for a new second level school.  The campaigners and I were proven to be correct on that and we managed to be successful in that endeavour.  I know that Government policy has changed over the last number of years, moving away from stationary Garda stations and emphasising the transportation of garda&iacute; in vehicles, on bikes and in cars.  I appreciate that move.  However, given the scale of this community, the size of the population and the number expected to move into that area, at the very least, a positive response from the Minister of State's Department on looking at establishing a Garda station in that area, one that can work with the new communities, give advice to planners on how best to construct new residential entities and with transport links, etc., would be of huge benefit to what I am sure he will accept is a large town, if not effectively a small city, being built on the outskirts of Dublin.</p></speech>

The Minister and I would like to thank the Senator for raising this matter today.  The Senator will be aware that the resources provided by the Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation of &euro;1.76 billion for 2019.  This represents an increase of more than 6% on the initial allocation for 20218.  Very significant capital investment is also being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including investment of more than &euro;242 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021, to enable investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda fleet over the same period, as well as considerable capital investment in addressing the deficiencies in the Garda estate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This investment is in support of the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  However, the Senator will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including responsibility for the formulation of proposals regarding the opening and closing of Garda stations, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  Furthermore, the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.</p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has no direct role in these matters.  He and I are aware that the Senator and some local representatives have suggested that a new Garda station at Clongriffin-Belmayne is required due to population growth and development in the area.  Bearing in mind that it is a matter for the Commissioner to efficiently manage Garda resources, on behalf of the Minister, I can confirm that the Clongriffin-Belmayne area, as referred to by the Senator, is located within the Coolock Garda district.  I also confirm, on behalf of the Minister, that the Garda authorities indicate that the area receives ongoing attention from garda&iacute; assigned to Coolock district.  We further understand that local Garda management in the Dublin metropolitan region north division is aware of issues relating to anti-social behaviour in the locality and, in addition to routine patrols by mobile patrol units, Garda foot patrols and members of community policing units have deployed additional personnel, particularly to specific areas identified as public disorder and anti-social behaviour hotspots, to address this type of criminality.  In addition, the Garda authorities indicate that the community policing unit at Coolock Garda station has ongoing engagement with various residential, commercial and business groups within the community, providing personal security and crime prevention advice at regular meetings throughout the district. </p><p>We understand that Garda management locally has put in place specific initiatives targeting anti-social activities of young drivers, including intelligence-led initiatives, and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with the local authorities to reduce such incidents and opportunities for joyriding, anti-social behaviour and public disorder.  Garda checkpoints to prevent and detect criminality across the districts have resulted in the detection of road traffic offences, the recovery and seizure of firearms, the disruption of the sale and supply of drugs, and the execution of warrants.</p><p>We are informed that monitoring of crime trends and initiating frequent, short-term and varied crime prevention and detection initiatives continue to be strategies employed by local Garda management to target criminal behaviour and spikes in specific types of criminality, including driving-related offences, and other forms of anti-social behaviour. </p><p>As I stated, it is a matter for the Commissioner to manage and direct Garda resources.  This includes responsibility for the formulation of proposals regarding the opening and closing of Garda stations.  The Senator may recall in that regard that A programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment for a review of Garda districts and dispersement of resources.  The resulting report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate entitled, Policing with Local Communities, which was submitted to the Minister by the Policing Authority and published in December 2018, also finds that the responsibility for decisions on boundaries and dispersement of Garda resources, including the number, type and location of Garda stations, should rest with the Garda Commissioner, as is currently the case.  I understand the Garda authorities do not currently propose a new station in the area referred to by the Senator. </p></speech>

It is nonsense to suggest to this House or to me that it is the role of the Garda Commissioner to make these decisions when we all know a member of the Cabinet is well able to trumpet that he apparently was successful in reopening Stepaside Garda station.  He is also willing to tell all his constituents as often as he possibly can that it was his intervention that made that happen.  For the Minister of State to suggest there was no political interference or influence on that decision is a statement of an untruth.  I know it certainly went against the advice of the assistant Garda Commissioner.  As was stated in the Houses of the Oireachtas, he was not in favour of it and did not believe it was a proper use of Garda resources.  It is not good enough for the Minister of State to tell me that this issue has nothing to do with the Government when it has.</p> <p>I advised the Minister of State that the Government stated two years ago that there was not a need for a secondary school in the  Clongriffin-Belmayne area and now it has stated a school is needed.  A Garda station is also needed in the locality because of the projected population.  I am sure that in years to come somebody in the Minister of State's position will inform the House that the Government has changed its mind in that regard.  I ask the Minister of State to stop telling us this is not a political decision when clearly it is a political decision.  Will he review the priorities of the Department to take account of this new population centre and give it the service it clearly needs?</p></speech>

I also understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with the local authorities and local stakeholders, as appropriate.</p></speech>

Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p><p>I condemn in the strongest terms on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group the car bombing at Bishop Street in Derry at the weekend.  It shows how delicate and fragile the situation in the North is at the moment and that we cannot take for granted the Good Friday Agreement and peace on this island.  What we have in the Good Friday Agreement must be nourished continuously and we cannot take our eyes off it at any stage.  It was confirmed today by the Commission that a no-deal Brexit will result in a hard border, which is something we all knew.  Unfortunately, the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the imminent threat of a hard border has added fuel to the fire of some dissident groups and provided them with a <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.  As a result, we are seeing some sort of resurgence.  I acknowledge the work of the Government and civil servants and note that we very much stand by that work in navigating Brexit.  However, we must be cognisant of the fragility of peace on our island and ensure the Good Friday Agreement is sustainable.  As such, I ask the Leader what will happen and what plans the Government has to maintain and sustain the Good Friday Agreement in the wake of a crash-out Brexit?</p><p>I raise also the issue of the lack of green spaces and amenities in our inner cities.  I do not apologise for supporting a campaign on Cork Street, namely the Weaver Square community garden allotments campaign.  This is a small site in the inner city consisting of 27 allotments.  On this small plot, a community garden has been created which has been boxing far above its weight and providing a huge community gain.  Obviously, there is a major housing crisis, which I have raised weekly in the House since elected, but there are many alternative sites in Dublin 8, including the St. Michael's Estate site, St. Theresa's Gardens and the Player Wills factory.  These are huge tracts of land which could, with a bit of imagination and proper planning, provide a great deal of housing and the proper amenities.  The local authority has served an eviction notice on the allotment owners which was to have been executed on Monday in order to facilitate the construction of rapid-build homes.  It is a real shame the community is losing the community garden.  It is a small patch of land but it provided a great deal in community gain.  There are many other large tracts of land which could have been used instead.</p><p>I refer finally to the 500 psychiatric nurses who have gone on strike today on foot of a refusal by the HSE to recognise NASRA, the ambulance branch of the Psychiatric Nurses Association.  Ultimately, it means 500 healthcare workers are not working today.  We cannot afford to lose 500 workers from a system which is already under strain.  The Government must act quickly and cannot allow further strikes to take place in the health sector.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Association has, as we know, scheduled six 24 hour strikes by its 37,000 members to take place on 30 January and 5, 7, 12, 13 and 14 February, respectively, if its members' pay and conditions are not addressed.  While the nurses will provide for emergency responses, the full service these nurses, most of whom are women, carry out will not be provided.  To lose 37,000 members of our health service on any of these days would be shameful and the Government must act to ensure the strikes do not go ahead.</p></speech>

I could not let that go on for much longer and I am delighted to be a part of the group.</p> <p>I want to make three quick points.  The first is to alert Senators to "Showcase Ireland" which is something I think they probably know about.  "Showcase Ireland" is a platform for all that is great in the creative arts in Ireland, in manufacturing, glass, ceramics, wool, fabric, design, silver and gold.  All the products are created and designed in Ireland.  Everybody should, in whatever way they can, platform them in their counties, towns and villages.  To see the artists' stuff in the RDS over the past few days - and the exhibition continues until Wednesday - has been in absolute privilege.  To mention one in particular, Eamonn Terry was a glass-blower in Waterford Glass, and we know what happened there, but he went out on his own.  He now has Criostal na Rinne and makes beautiful stuff.  I would also like to mention Jerpoint Glass, an Irish handmade glass company.  These are people who are still blowing their own glass in Ireland; it is not being imported from any other country.  It is apt that we look at the arts and crafts in Ireland now, especially with what is happening in Brexit, because we need to take our artists, creatives, manufacturers and designers very seriously and make sure they are well resourced.</p> <p>The second thing I want to say is that Garry Hynes, Philip King, Mark Patrick Hederman and Theo Dorgan will be coming to speak to the Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht tomorrow, representing music, literature, theatre and poetry.</p> <p>Could the Leader let me know when the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill will come into the Seanad?  It was delayed before Christmas.  Could he also let me know when the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill will be before the Seanad, something I asked about two months ago?  Many people are in limbo awaiting this Bill.  I also ask when the full commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill will happen.  I was very involved in that in the last Seanad.  Could the Leader give an update on those?</p> <p>I am standing up for the arts and creativity because now, more than ever, they matter.  It is not just economic graft that means something.  Our island is a great creator of arts, crafts and literature and we should look to it as a half saviour.</p></speech>

There is no support or tolerance for that behaviour.  We have a pathway to peace.  We have peace and a pathway to Irish unity - in fact, we have never been closer to Irish unity.  The conversations and discussions now being had in civic society about the possibility of Irish unity mean we can further garner support for Irish unity across the board.  There is no support, tolerance or justification for these actions and I would ask those responsible to just stop that behaviour.</p> <p>My colleague, Deputy Maurice Quinlivan, received information from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that shows that 89 units it owns are currently vacant.  Eight of these units are located in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta sites across County Mayo.  One such unit is in B&eacute;al an Mhuirthead and has been lying empty for 20 years.  It is hard to believe that no use has been found for this site since 1999.  Instead of lying empty, these and similar units should be used to help start-up businesses, community groups or charities.  Even letting these premises for free is better than seeing such a valuable public asset lying idle for such a long period of time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I call on the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to come to this House and tell us how she will facilitate greater co-operation between IDA Ireland, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Enterprise Ireland to ensure that these vacant sites are taken into account and fully utilised for the benefit of communities.  To achieve this, many more site visits to Mayo and the west by IDA Ireland, especially in Gaeltacht areas, are needed.  Last year, up to November 2018, there were only seven such IDA visits to Mayo.  If the Government is serious about creating jobs in County Mayo and other places in the west, all available infrastructure needs to be utilised.  This will not happen if they do not bother coming to see and assess it for themselves.  These units and land in public ownership need to be used as a factor of production and to address many of the problems we have across the State relating to housing and unemployment.  We cannot say that we support indigenous business and enterprise, and that we have situations where there is full employment.  There are pockets of very high unemployment in rural Ireland, many of which are in the Gaeltacht.  We cannot have assets there which are not fully utilised.</p></speech>

It was a magnificent and fitting event.  I was privileged to be part of it as a Member of the Seanad.  I never thought that would happen.  The Seanad was recently saved by a referendum but if it was not for the determination and steel of those people 100 years ago, there might have been neither a D&aacute;il nor a Seanad and that is worth remembering.  It was also a moving and personal occasion for me because I grew up hearing about one Member of the First D&aacute;il, a man named Phil Shanahan, from a small place, Foilmacduff in Hollyford, County Tipperary.  My late mother, Judy, was my teacher and instructor with regard to Phil.  Her family, the Daverns were fast friends of the Shanahans in Hollyford.  I was delighted to meet Phil's great grandniece, Emer Fhatherta, yesterday, who was there to remember Phil.  My mother told me of his lifelong commitment and the sacrifices he made, about his family members, specifically his sister, Sarah, his hunger strike and his generosity.  He went from being a comfortable publican in Dublin to his death in November 1931 in poor circumstances.  He was in Jacob's Factory with MacDonagh.  His pub in the heart of Monto was a home from home and a meeting place for other Republicans.  I spent last Saturday night with his grandnephew, Ramie Shanahan, in the same place where Phil returned to spend his last years before his death.  I saw the treasure trove of documents, papers, memorabilia and talked into the night.</p> <p>It struck me that in the Seanad, we should consider some way that we might be a focal point to remember, honour and promote a better understanding of the lives of these people, their motivations, family circumstances, interests, places of origin, families and comrades.  The downgrading of history was mentioned yesterday in the Mansion House.  Such a focus as this, possibly carried out throughout the year, could reignite the curiosity and interest of the young and not so young in the lives of these ordinary people who did extraordinary things and gave us a legacy that we have a responsibility to live up to.  I would be happy to support any such initiative and ask the Leader if he will consider something along these lines.</p> <p>Phil was a Teachta D&aacute;la for Dublin Harbour.  He beat the unbeatable Alfie Byrne to take that seat but there were four other Tipperary men.  Pierce McCan died from the flu in March that year.  S&eacute;amus Burke went on to be a Minister in Cosgrave's Government.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was also Joseph McDonagh, brother of Thomas, and P.J. Moloney who, like me, was from Tipperary Town.  He had his home burnt out.  They are minor anecdotes of the lives of what I call ordinary people who did extraordinary things.  We might consider some ways throughout the year to give some impetus to it.</p></speech>

I was privileged and honoured to have been present to listen to the very dignified, respectful and appropriate way in which we commemorated the important first sitting of the D&aacute;il 100 years ago.  As a member of the Labour Party, I was pleased and heartened by the emphasis on Tom Johnson's democratic programme and the important values and ideals espoused in it.  It was beautifully portrayed.  The event was organised in a really tasteful and appropriate way.  I commend the communications unit, the Oireachtas staff, the Ceann Comhairle's office and all involved in organising it.  The Labour Party had its own event on Saturday to launch its rewritten democratic programme for the 21st Century.  We will be highlighting it during the year.  Senator Dolan spoke about how to reignite interest.  It is really important that all of us look in all sorts of different ways at commemorating and highlighting the centenary of the First D&aacute;il and ensure that different aspects of it are honoured and commemorated.</p> <p>I thank the Leader for organising the statements on Brexit.  They are timely.  It was in marked contrast to the shambles in Westminster to see the D&aacute;il and Seanad holding the joint sitting in the Mansion House yesterday.  We will have an opportunity to talk about Brexit later.</p> <p>I echo the words of others in condemning the car bombing in Derry and those involved in carrying it out.  It reminds us of the really serious and very real fears that a hard border will follow if Britain crashes out of the EU on 29 March.  The EU Commission confirmed today that a no-deal Brexit will mean the return of a hard border.  That is a really serious worry for everyone.</p> <p>I ask the Leader for a debate on the follow-up to the legislation we passed just before Christmas, which I am glad to see is now in effect.  I refer to the legislation allowing for terminations of pregnancy.  Many of us were concerned last week by reports of one particular case in the Coombe Hospital which was reported as being dealt with in a way that was somewhat troubling.  I hope we will see less of that.  The publicity in respect of the case in question was of concern generally.  Other events in recent weeks have shown us the really urgent need for the legislation to protect women accessing services at GP clinics and hospitals.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, promised that the relevant legislation would emerge in early course this year.  I will be pressing for a debate on it and for bringing the legislation forward.  As far as I know, the Bill in question has not yet been drafted.  We need to know when it will be drafted.  I ask the Leader to make inquiries in the Department of Health about when we will see that legislation because it is essential that those seeking to access services are protected from harassment and intimidation when they do so.</p> <p>I express my satisfaction on seeing the first conviction reported today under the Swedish or Nordic model.  My dear friend and colleague, Senator Norris, will not agree with me.</p></speech>

It was horrific and frightening to see the videos on the news.</p> <p>I compliment all who were involved in organising yesterday's event.  It was very appropriate and went off really well.  I attended another event this morning and I took taxis to and from my destination.  Both drivers had watched yesterday's proceedings on television and were very emotional in expressing their thoughts on them.  Many families and descendants of the Members of the First D&aacute;il were present yesterday.  One of my neighbours is a descendant of Michael Colivet.  It was lovely to meet the Collins family there.  Another event is being held in the Mansion House today, with students from 15 schools engaging in a debate on D&aacute;il 100.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is to be commended.  I was over there this morning because two of my neighbouring schools were successful in having two pupils selected, namely, Megan from Gaelchol&aacute;iste Luimn&iacute; and Katie from Laurel Hill Col&aacute;iste.  It is good that they were both from all-Irish-speaking schools.  It is to be commended that they were selected among the 15 to speak.  I heard some of what they had to say and their speeches were fantastic.  One spoke about the harmful effects of alcohol and the other one questioned where our Irish has gone to.  They were two topical debates.  I congratulate all those involved.  It is good that the youth are continuing the debate today.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we have already had serious issues with ambulance response times in County Monaghan.  In some instances it has taken 70 minutes for the ambulance to reach the patient concerned.  The current dispute in the ambulance service is of particular concern to the people of Monaghan, Cavan and other rural areas.  As the Leader will agree, ambulance workers play a vital role in the provision of health services and those of us in rural areas depend very heavily on those services.  It could be said that people's lives are being put at risk because of this dispute.  I urge the Minister and the HSE to engage as a matter of urgency with the ambulance workers concerned to try to find a resolution to this dispute so that the lives of people in counties Cavan and Monaghan and elsewhere are not put at risk by this dispute.</p></speech>

We heard on "Morning Ireland" this morning that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was due to bring a memorandum to Cabinet this morning seeking a 12-month extension for Judge Yvonne Murphy to carry out her very important work, on which I commend her.  We do not need a lesson here today to explain why things have gone way beyond the original timeframe set.  We know from reports from the commission that the Tuam babies issue came up in 2015 and this was an added piece of work for Judge Murphy to deal with.</p> <p>My concern is with Bethany Home, a Protestant organisation.  For some reason the Government and previous Administrations have failed to take on the importance of this establishment.  It is now known as fact that this was an incarceration house for many women and children.  There is no dispute about it.  These children were in State care or the State should have had a responsibility.</p> <p>The Taoiseach made an excellent presentation at yesterday's commemoration of the centenary of the First D&aacute;il.  He talked about our shameful past.  He talked about institutions, including mother and baby homes.  He said that we would need to do things in different ways and face new challenges.  He is dead right and has my full support.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Zappone, discussed this very important issue with us previously.  If possible we should ask her to come back to the House to debate the matter with particular emphasis on Bethany Home.  Abuse knows no religious bounds.  This wholly Protestant institution has been excluded for reasons I do not know.  In any place where children were in care there was a duty of care on our society, Government, public administration and every arm of the State.  It is important that we give reason.  More important, Bethany Home should be included in a redress scheme.</p> <p>I do not think the suggestion reported in the media today that the commission has to work through the initial 17 institutions is correct.  While I accept its remit was to deal with these 17 institutions and that some people will be disappointed that this will continue for another year, it is important that we send a clear message to people, including Senators and Deputies, who have long campaigned for this particular organisation to be investigated.  It is fair, right and proper.  I ask that the Minister come to the House to share her views, particularly on Bethany Home.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I call on everyone in this House to use their influence on Government to try to push this forward and get this group of people included in the redress scheme.</p></speech>

It is positive that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has given approval for this project, which has long been needed.  It will involve alignment of approximately 15 km of existing roads and a new carriageway of approximately 35 km.  It is important because this is a dangerous stretch of road.  Motorists travel at high speeds through the villages of Frenchpark, Bellanagare and Tulsk, in particular, to and from the west.  Now that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has issued approval, it is critical that this project be progressed to construction as quickly as possible.  It is important that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, gives us an update on the project.  It is included under Project Ireland 2040 but it is critical that construction progresses without delay because there is a high risk involved and there have been far too many accidents on this dangerous stretch of road.  It is nonetheless positive that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has given approval.  Significant work has been completed by the national roads design office in Roscommon, which should be strongly complimented on all its work thus far.  It is to be hoped we will see progression in terms of the project being led to construction very quickly.</p></speech>

It was an enjoyable event and a reminder to us all of the need for us as legislators to progress the democratic programme as set out 100 years go.  I do not wish to put a dampener on it, but members of the deaf community have asked in future for consideration of the interpretation of such events that are broadcast nationwide because they feel they missed out on it.</p> <p>I also wish to bring up the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, strike that commenced at 7 o'clock this morning.  I tabled a Commencement matter on this on 7 November.  In 2010, we march down the street from Parnell Square as part of what was called the 24-7 Alliance.  The years of austerity had seen attacks on our pay.  We marched so pay would not be attacked.  The State was going to retain core pay but let additional payments for night duty, weekends and Christmas go to the wall.  Thus the 24-7 Alliance was born.  Then 500 ambulance personnel made a request to join the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA.  It was a little odd at the time but it has worked out well in the nine years since.  I have questioned him the Minister previously and I put him on notice on 7 November that we do not need to escalate this.  As has been said, the health service in its entirety is escalating the staff's dispute, and it is not just about pay and conditions.  The strike concerns treatment of State and the duty of care that they feel they cannot carry out.  Basically, this dispute is about the right to be heard.  It is about having a fundamental right to join a union and for that union of one's choice to represent one.  Sinn F&eacute;in has no position on the merits or otherwise of pay and conditions claims, only that we believe such disputes are best resolved through dialogue and negotiation.  The Trade Union Representation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2018 has been introduced by Sinn F&eacute;in, and we wish to see it enacted as soon as possible.</p></speech>

This is not a new issue and the group has been advocating back since the days I was working with the National Women's Council of Ireland before I was elected to the Oireachtas.  It is shocking that the former residents are still waiting for recognition and support.  The number of survivors of those homes is reducing and it is important that those who were there should get satisfaction.</p> <p>I join in the commendations of yesterday's event.  Let me articulate my sincere expressions of appreciation for the people of 100 years ago and all those who have followed since in the work of maintaining our democracy.  I was particularly happy with the content, the Declaration of Independence, the Message to the Free Nations of the World and the programme of the first D&aacute;il, which is an extraordinarily important democratic programme, as drafted by Thomas Johnson and reflecting so much of the social movement which had fed into the national movement of that time and of the thinking of Connolly and the ideas of the Proclamation.  Will the Leader create an opportunity to discuss at an appropriate time some of those visionary documents and perhaps see how we could place ourselves in terms of the current vision for the next centenary?  I believe that Senators are inheritors of the democratic challenge in the same way as those in the D&aacute;il and it is very important that we would assign time for reflection and set ourselves the challenge to move forward.  If we look at the extension of the franchise that took place in the 1918 elections, it would be extraordinarily positive if this was the year in which we delivered Seanad reform and extended the franchise and the delivery of greater democracy.  </p> <p>Let me draw the attention of Members and those in the wider world to an extraordinary exhibition - Women in Politics and Public Life, from 1918 to 2018 - which is taking place in Dublin Castle and which closes at the end of January.  I urge everybody to visit it.  It very much tracks the full century of women's political action, the political actions from every decade and the contribution that women have made across all parties.</p> <p>I pay a brief tribute to some politicians, as a key reminder for all of us of the importance of democracy.  We spoke about the tragic murder of the British politician, Jo Cox, a parliamentarian and a person who had championed an inclusive form of politics.  In the past few weeks, another champion of inclusive politics who contributed to an extension of civic participation in the most inclusive sense in this city, the mayor of Gdansk, Pawel Adamowicz, was tragically murdered in the past few weeks.  There was also an incident where a bomb was placed in The Diamond in Derry, the heart of the city.  These are all challenges to democracy and it is important that we never retreat from them but instead redouble our commitment to democratic debate and to representation of the people as sovereign.</p></speech>

Sometimes we take it for granted.   </p> <p>I wish to raise an issue in regard to St. Finian's community college in Swords.  In March 2010, the board of management expressed concern regarding the school's general condition.  There were leaks in the ceilings, a lack of heating and health risks to both students and staff.  A design team started work in February 2013 and produced a report in June 2013.  The final design was produced in August, with planning permission granted in December 2015.  There was not a single objection from any of the local residents.  In April 2017, all issues were resolved and the project was expected to go to tender immediately afterwards, with work was expected to begin in the summer of 2017.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In September 2018, staff were told the school was at pre-qualification stage for the appointment of contractors.  This had been completed by the ETB and sent to the Department but was returned to the ETB without an explanation by the Department.  However, the ETB was told to resubmit.  Here we are in January 2019.  Last week, I visited the school and saw for myself rooms that had no natural light and a home economics room that contained cookers but had only one entrance or exit.  That is a fire risk, as far as I am concerned.  I also saw a disgraceful dilapidation of the building in terms of ceilings coming down.  One can see from the picture I am holding in my hand, although it may be difficult to see it, a roof collapsing with vegetation growing in the room.  Yet students in 2019 are supposed to learn and study in these conditions, and staff are supposed to teach in them.  It is just not good enough.</p><p>Having made a video with Luke Corkery, who is on the student council in the school, I am delighted that 7,000 people saw the video and that some action has resulted.  The ETB has been in touch and, in turn, the Department of Education and Skills has emailed the board advising it to have the design team commence plans for the inclusion of a new zero energy building.  My only concern is that if that means a whole new design and new planning application, then we will be back to square one, which is simply not good enough.  The population of Swords is over 40,000 and 10,452 people under the age of 18 await education or attend educational facilities.  These young people need a proper place for their education.  They have suffered.</p><p>Please do not ask the staff of this DEIS school, the students and their parents who support them to continue to have to exist in these conditions.  I call on the Minister to ensure the Department takes action immediately.  People have waited since 2010.  The school has passed all the tests and has done all that was required but now it seems to be rejoining the queue, which not fair.  It is certainly not fair to a DEIS school that has done so well over the years.</p></speech>

Many years ago the Anglican Archbishop spoke out clearly on the matter and asked for it to be taken into account.  It is nothing other than religious discrimination that this has not happened.  The issue would have been forgotten only for the great work done by Derek Leinster.</p> <p>I completely disagree with my colleague, Senator Bacik.  I do not how anybody can be pleased about the prospect of a lonely 65 year old man, coming from a deprived area of Dublin, being named and fined in court.  It seems to me that this is rank and smug hypocrisy.  I remember during the debate here, it flew in the face of all the academic research produced by Queen's University, Belfast, which I put on the record.  I urge anybody who wants to see that research and to know the truth about this matter to read the debate where I put these facts on the record.</p></speech>

An Egyptian television interviewer has been arrested, jailed for one year and fined 200 Egyptian pounds for interviewing a gay man on Egyptian television.  The interviewer himself is a well known homophobe who comes out repeatedly with homophobic remarks.  He interviewed a man about his life as a gay man in Egypt where homosexuality is not illegal.  However, gay men who are consenting male adults in private are consistently nowadays arrested for blasphemy, immorality and debauchery.  I would like to ask that this House requests the Leader to get the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to send a strong protest, on behalf of the House, to the Egyptian ambassador.</p></speech>

Ireland has been ranked among the top ten countries that hold the strongest passports according to the Henley Passport Index.  The index measures the strength of a passport based on a citizen's ability to travel visa-free or using an easy access visa.  Irish passport holders have the freedom to travel to 184 countries, which makes the Irish passport an attractive product.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In that context, I wish to raise an issue that came to my attention over the Christmas when I was speaking to somebody who was home for the festivities.  He is a British national who is married to an Irish woman.  Their children have Irish passports.  He inquired about the possibility of getting an Irish passport but was told that, while it would be possible, he would have to live in Ireland for one year to qualify for naturalisation and thus citizenship.  I agree that there should be rules and stipulations but in cases where a spouse is not of Irish descent but the rest of the family is, are we unfairly discriminating against the foreign spouse where there is a long-standing relationship and proof of many years of travel to Ireland?  We allow generous access to Irish citizenship to people around the world - in many cases to individuals who might never travel to this land in their lifetimes.  However, can we restrict access for a family unit where connections are real and visible for all to see?</p><p>The Constitution insists on a special affinity with people of Irish ancestry living abroad who share our culture, identity and heritage.  Is marriage not the most special affinity?  Can we ask a family to split to reconcile residency issues or ask them to move lock, stock and barrel to Ireland for a year?  That is not practical.  This man has an important job in England, as does his wife.  His children are in school.  The Minister should clarify what we are preparing to do for such hard-working families who travel to Ireland regularly to see elderly relatives and family here.  What are our contingency plans?  What could Brexit mean for the right of UK citizens, derived from Irish law under the EU freedom of movement legislation, to come and live in Ireland without residency permits?  These are serious questions.  Irish passports will have a massive role to play in the context of Brexit.  I accept that the Minister is coming to the House later but we must address these issues.  The uncertainty is unreal so we must obtain clarification on this matter.</p><p>I agree with Senator Ardagh.  We support the nurses and the ambulance personnel.  They are doing a great job.  We must give them our support because they work extremely hard.</p></speech>

Thankfully, nobody was killed or injured but what happened shows that this is a dangerous time when it comes to dissident republicans.  Everything must be done to ensure that they do not have a voice or threaten the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>Yesterday's centenary of the first meeting of the D&aacute;il was a great success.  I congratulate everybody involved.  Yesterday's event reminded me that today is the centenary of the appointment of the first Minister for Foreign Affairs, George Noble Plunkett or Count Plunkett, who, in what was known as "the election of the snows" - effectively a by-election for the British Parliament - was elected to represent the old constituency of North Roscommon.  That election rocked the British establishment to its core.  Count Plunkett was also a Member of the first D&aacute;il.  I was in Westminster on Wednesday night last.  The place was in a complete frenzy.  I do not believe that many of the people who were voting understand the backstop or the Border.  A Brexit without a withdrawal agreement will mean border infrastructure.  Nobody wants a border.  In the absence of leadership in many of the parties at Westminster, I thank MPs such as Ms Yvette Cooper, Mr. Hilary Benn, Sir Keir Starmer and Mr. Dominic Grieve, who are from different parties.  They have shown great leadership in trying to get a solution from the referendum.  The Government should thank those people as well as many more who are outside the parties and are standing up to be counted.  Democracy needs these elected MPs to stand up and be counted.  We need a withdrawal agreement or some other mechanism to ensure there will not be a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p></speech>

As the national broadcaster, it has a responsibility to recognise and respect the vulnerabilities and mental health of the people and communities who are the subjects of its debates.  Tonight, "Prime Time" will feature a conversation about transgender young people.  I want to make it clear that young people accessing legal gender recognition certificates does not mean they undergo surgery.  In an advertisement for tonight's show that has been aired on RT&Eacute;, the presenter, Miriam O'Callaghan, asks why there has been so little discussion of these issues in Ireland.  There are individuals who are desperately trying to transfer to Ireland the division that has been fostered around these issues in Britain.  We are not Britain.  Our extremely progressive Gender Recognition Act was passed into law in 2015 after a very long conversation about marriage equality and the lives of LGBT people.  Since that time, this House has unanimously supported the principle of the Gender Recognition (Amendment) Bill 2017, which focuses on trans young people.  There have been conversations.  I hope this House can send a message today that we value the contribution of trans people to the diversity of this island and we reject transphobia in all its forms.  The US Supreme Court has today allowed Donald Trump's ban on transgender troops to come into effect.  I remind the House that people like Trump and others closer to home have a shopping list and it does not stop with the Traveller community or the trans community.</p></speech>

I thought it was a fantastic occasion.  Everything about the whole occasion, including the colour and the decor, was magnificent.  I think the Houses of the Oireachtas deserve great credit for putting it on.</p> <p>I would like to ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister responsible for jobs and small business to come before the House.  Small businesses like high street shops, bars and restaurants are finding it very difficult to deal with difficulties like insurance, rates, employment, PAYE and PRSI.  They have to deal with 13 or 14 different agencies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They have difficult decisions to make and they are operating in difficult times.

I happened to be in Dublin on Sunday.  I was asked to attend and I saw at first hand the great task that was at hand.  I was in early again yesterday.  It was a major commemorative event and an enormously successful event.  Sometimes we take the staff of Leinster House for granted but the Captain of the Guard, the superintendent and all of their staff did an extraordinary job yesterday.  It was not something that was planned overnight and the work that went into it probably went on for a couple of months.  I express my gratitude to them personally and on behalf of the House.

I join with Senators Dolan, Bacik, Byrne, Devine, Higgins, Feighan, Paddy Burke and Coghlan in speaking about the commemorations yesterday.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, gabhaim mo f&iacute;or bu&iacute;ochas agus mo chomghairdeas le gach duine a bh&iacute; p&aacute;irteach sa chom&oacute;radh.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-spiorad&uacute;il agus inspirational.  Yesterday was a wonderful day, l&aacute; iontach, stairi&uacute;il de cheili&uacute;radh agus l&aacute; iontach agus speisialta do gach Ball den Oireachtas.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, t&aacute; suim m&oacute;r ag a l&aacute;n daoine, ach go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r ag gach Ball den Teach seo agus den D&aacute;il i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus beimid ag pl&eacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge an seachtain seo chugainn.  Yesterday was a wonderful occasion to commemorate the first sitting of the First D&aacute;il.</p> <p>On my behalf and on behalf of the Government, I commend all members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and all who were p&aacute;irteach san &oacute;c&aacute;id speisialta seo.  It was a wonderful day.  It shows the importance of Oireachtas TV and the need for us to promote and use same as a means of broadcasting the work that is being done in both Houses of the Oireachtas and in committees.  In addition, as Senators Warfield and Marie-Louise O'Donnell indirectly referred to in their contributions, it shows the importance of creativity and of what happens within this compound of the Houses of the Oireachtas in terms of visits and being able to re-enact significant moments in our history.  Yesterday was one such occasion and I offer my sincere congratulations and thanks to all involved.  I will not name people but I welcome and congratulate all for the wonderful event yesterday.</p> <p>Perhaps the pin that we all received as Members could be replicated and given to all of the Houses of the Oireachtas staff as a token of our appreciation for their contribution.  I happened to be in discussion with a member of staff yesterday who I will not name, and that person has been here since 1982.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The latter illustrates that the job is not just a job, it is a commitment.  This is a place of work but it is also much more than that.  Yesterday's event was fantastic.  We were all privileged to be elected.  Some of the contributions perhaps offered a dystopian view of the world but I reflect on the fact that we have passed transgender and marriage equality legislation and achieved some infrastructural development.  The country is near full employment, notwithstanding the challenges we face.  The men and women of the First D&aacute;il would be proud of what this and previous Governments have achieved.  I want to put that into perspective.</p><p>I join all Senators who condemned the car bombing in Derry last weekend.  Violence has no place on our island, north, south, east or west.  We had all hoped we had left the dark days of violence behind us.  As Senator Ardagh stated, we must nurture and inculcate in all a desire to maintain the peace process through upholding the Good Friday Agreement and bringing all communities together.  It behoves us to work to ensure that we do not take the peace we now enjoy for granted.</p><p>Senator Higgins rightly mentioned the brutal killing of the mayor of Gdansk, Pawe Adamowicz, who was stabbed while speaking.  We are democrats and democracy is something we cherish.  We must work not only to ensure that it is nurtured, as Senator Ardagh stated, but to protect those who are elected as public representatives.  We must also protect the right to speak and to hold a different viewpoint.  On behalf of the House, I offer Mr. Adamowicz's wife, Magdalena, and their two young children our deepest sympathies.</p><p>Senator Ardagh referred to the lack of green space in Dublin's inner city.  I hope we can engage in a debate on that matter in due course.  It is important that a city has green spaces and trees, places of refuge away from the concrete jungle, the traffic and the noise.  I will be happy to arrange a debate on that matter.</p><p>Senators Devine, Murnane O'Connor, Ardagh and Gallagher referred to today's dispute involving ambulance staff.  We all recognise the importance of ambulance personnel but the HSE is questioning the right to have a representation heard.  The PNA represents 500 ambulance service staff.  The HSE recognises SIPTU, which also represents ambulance personnel.  I hope we can resolve this issue.  It is important that patients are not used as pawns in a dispute.  It is also important that all voices are heard.  I appeal to those on all sides to come to the table.</p><p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell raised the very important issue of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016, elements of which are being refined.  Work is ongoing and when it is complete, the Bill will come back to the House.  I certainly hope that will happen in the short term, namely, in the spring.</p><p>The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, has published the Civil Registration Bill 2019 which will allow for same-sex parents to have the word "parent" recorded on birth certificates.  That Bill will come forward in the spring of this year.  I do not have the exact timetable.  We have asked the Department for more information but we have not got that yet.</p><p>I did not understand the Senator's question on the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.</p></speech>

I agree completely that the arts and creativity are integral to who we are.  Earlier, the Oscar nominations were announced and we can all see the success of the Irish in the arts.  The Senator is right to ask that we consider this matter.  The Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is debating it this week but I would be happy to have a significant debate on the arts, the arts community and our culture and on how they can be part of a new, modern Ireland emerging from the shadow of recession.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I would be happy to have that debate and I commend the Senator for that.  </p><p>I do not have the answer for Senator Conway-Walsh regarding &Uacute;dar&aacute;s Na Gaeltachta and the vacant units in Mayo.  Perhaps she might raise that through a Commencement debate.  In his contribution, Senator Dolan raised the issue of history.  As Members will know, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, has set up a review on the teaching of history as an optional subject.  That is to be completed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, in the coming weeks and we will have a debate in the House when it is complete.  </p><p>I do not have information to hand on the health issues that Senator Bacik raised, but I would be happy to liaise with her about that.  I join Senator Byrne in congratulating all the schools involved in the debate today and I thank them for their work.  </p><p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of Bethany Home, as did Senator Norris.  The Government has today given a 12-month extension to the mother and baby homes commission of investigation.  The fourth interim report has been published today.  In regard to Bethany Home the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has said that she will wait until she has received the final reports before making any decision.  I note the comments of Senators Boyhan and Norris and the commission.  We will have a debate in the House on the matter that Senator Boyhan has raised on 6 February.  </p><p>Senator Hopkins raised the issue of the N5 project, a very important one for providing a gateway to the west.  Perhaps a Commencement matter might be a more expeditious way of getting an answer.  I do not have the answer to hand regarding the project.  I answered Senator Devine on the nurses' strike.</p><p>In response to Senator Higgins, perhaps we need to have a reflective look at what happened yesterday and some of the contribution she made this afternoon and have a series of rolling debates, as Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said.  That would be of assistance to us all and I would be happy to talk to Senator Higgins about that.  </p><p>Senator Reilly raised the issue of St. Finian's community college in Swords.  Perhaps raising the issue as a Commencement matter would be a better way of getting a reply.  Senator Norris raised a number of issues, in particular regarding Egyptian television.  We should all stand with and send a message of support to that person.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade needs to communicate quite clearly to the Egyptian Government our displeasure at the jailing of any person for interviewing people in a manner that allows differing viewpoints to be brought to television and media.  We should all condemn the incarceration of someone for interviewing a gay person.  I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will send a message to the Egyptian authorities on that issue. </p><p>On the issue of passports, having the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come to the House for a Commencement matter is perhaps a better way for Senator Murnane O'Connor to get a reply.  I do not have the information she mentioned.</p><p>Senators Feighan and &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh raised the issue of the centenary and the appointment of the first Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy George Noble Plunkett, 100 years ago today.  Senator Warfield raised a very pertinent point in advance of the RT&Eacute; "Prime Time" programme tonight.  We need to send a very strong message of support and solidarity to our trans community, which is very marginalised and needs support.  We need people to understand and to be educated properly, not in a sensational way.  I hope that tonight's programme is educational, informative and factual.  As the Senator quite rightly said, we should all reject transphobia.  We should all work to ensure that we bring people on a journey and inform them.  There are members of our community who are feeling vulnerable, isolated, rejected and completely unheard.  I hope that tonight and from now on we can stand together and have that debate and a movement of equality and inclusivity.  I would be happy to have a debate in the House following tonight's programme.  I thank the Senator for making that remark.  As the national broadcaster it is important that RT&Eacute; informs in a way that is not sensational or derogatory and ensures equality and respect for all people and all citizens.  </p><p>Senator Paddy Burke raised the issue of retail, and having the Minister come before the House.  I would be happy to do that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The issue of Brexit was mentioned by a number of Members, in particular by Senator Ardagh.

I spoke to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland yesterday and I offered both our concern and assistance.  The police investigation is ongoing to bring to justice those who are behind this act of terrorism.  Such violence has been rejected by the people of this island again and again.  The group that carried out this act cannot claim in any way to be acting on behalf of the Irish people.  I know Senators from all parties and none will share in this condemnation.  There can be no return to the dark days of the past anywhere on this island.</p> <p>The Brexit process in the UK is at a critical juncture.  The Government regretted the outcome of last week's vote in the House of Commons on the withdrawal agreement, even if the outcome itself was not a big surprise.  Prime Minister May yesterday stated her continuing commitment to the withdrawal agreement and said she would continue efforts to build the necessary support in Westminster.  The British political and parliamentary process will take some time to play out.  What we need is for the UK to make it clear on the basis of the outcome of that process how it proposes to move forward.  Only then, in truth, can the EU consider how to respond.</p> <p>As Senators know, the backstop is an insurance policy to ensure that there is no hard border on this island following Brexit.  It an essential part of the withdrawal agreement and we continue to advocate for it.  However, it is our strong hope that a comprehensive and ambitious future relationship agreement will achieve the same end and ensure that the backstop is never triggered or needed.</p> <p>Our EU partners have been consistently supportive and understanding of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and of the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  Their solidarity has been consistent throughout the negotiations.  This was reaffirmed to me by Michel Barnier as late as yesterday, and the unambiguous message remains that there can be no withdrawal agreement without the backstop.  Lest there be any doubt, there should be absolute clarity as well that the EU negotiates as one, and that this united approach will remain intact until the end of the process.</p> <p>Domestically, preparing for Brexit, and for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, is a whole-of-Government priority.  Our planning began ahead of the UK referendum, and in recent months has become more focussed on our no-deal plans.  We are all deeply aware of the potentially profound political, economic and trade impacts of a no-deal Brexit.  The Government is taking clear steps to mitigate these impacts, but given the scale and uncertainty surrounding a no-deal Brexit, we must all recognise that if such an outcome materialises, there will be significant disruption and change.  I have said repeatedly that it will put significant strain both on the political mechanisms in this country and on the economy.</p> <p>That requires a response from the Government but also preparations by businesses and other affected sectors, with the advice and support that the Government is giving.  Since July 2018, the Government has made a number of key decisions on Brexit preparedness, including on staffing, ICT and infrastructure at the ports and airports.  In light of the risks of a no-deal Brexit, this work is now being accelerated and, where necessary, interim measures are being put in place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On 19 December, the Government published its Contingency Action Plan, setting out its approach to dealing with a no-deal Brexit., and Members will have seen the further intensification of preparations so far throughout the month of January where we have added significantly to the detail of that document.</p><p>We are working on the preparation of temporary sites and infrastructure at ports and airports and on accelerated staffing plans through recruitment and redeployment, where necessary.</p><p>The Cabinet earlier this month - and again today - advanced work on the legislation necessary in a range of areas to mitigate the damaging effects of a no-deal Brexit.  There are multiple issues, including students who travel between Britain and Ireland, rail services and other public transport, healthcare, particularly cross-Border, and in the justice and social welfare areas.</p><p>As the House will be aware, it is proposed to group all the legislation affecting different sectors into one omnibus Bill.  This Bill will have 17 Parts focused on the broad themes of protecting the citizen and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs.  This will be complemented by a range of measures by way of statutory instrument.  Essentially, the legislation will be 17 Bills in one involving nine Departments, including the Department of the Taoiseach, and 28 statutory instruments or secondary Bills will be required to complement that.  I look forward to providing all of that detail to the House shortly.</p><p>I look forward to working closely with all parties and Oireachtas Members to ensure that this necessary Brexit legislation will pass through the Houses in a manner which allows for necessary scrutiny but also ensures its passage and enactment before 29 March 2019.</p><p>Our membership of the EU and the stability and solidarity it brings are central to our own preparations.  The approach in areas of EU competence has included the publication of more than 80 separate stakeholder notices to assist businesses and citizens in their preparations.</p><p>The Commission Contingency Actions Plans have provided some welcome reassurance in areas such as aviation and road haulage but have also emphasised the significant disruption resulting from a no-deal Brexit.  These plans have also helped to guide our domestic response.  It is also important to say that while they are providing temporary solutions in areas that would otherwise be in crisis post 29 March in a no-deal scenario, particularly aviation and haulage, those solutions are only temporary, by and large, between the end of March and the end of the year.</p><p>Stakeholder engagement is also critical.  We will convene a fifth plenary session of the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Friday, 15 February, in Dublin Castle.  These dialogues have been an invaluable opportunity to hear directly about the all-island implications of Brexit from a variety of stakeholders and across a wide range of sectors.</p><p>A no-deal outcome is not the one we want but given the ongoing political uncertainty in London, it is only prudent at this stage to intensify our preparations for a no deal.  As the Taoiseach repeatedly has said now, we are not preparing any longer.  We are putting the pieces in place, hoping that they will not be necessary but ensuring that we can do everything possible between now and the end of March, just in case.</p><p>I am grateful for the ongoing support of all political parties.  Parties we have a competitive relationship with politically have been helpful when it comes to Brexit.  That includes all parties represented in this House and the Lower House.</p><p>Regarding legislation, we are proposing that we will publish the heads of the omnibus legislation on Friday.  It will then go to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel., which has given a commitment to publish that Bill in its full detail on 22 February, so its officials will have just over three weeks to do that.  The following week, we will look to take it through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and the week after that, beginning 4 March, we will take Committee, Report and Final Stages in the D&aacute;il.  It will be the following week, beginning 11 March, that it will come into this House.  That will be the week in the build-up to St. Patrick's Day.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many Deputies will not be present, therefore, but there is no reason we cannot get the work done in this House, should it be necessary to do so at that point.</p><p>In general terms, my approach to this subject is not party political; rather, it is transparent and open.  Any Senators who need detailed briefings on Brexit will get them.  I am confident that we will all work together to ensure that any preparations which are necessary for Senators to do a professional job as legislators in passing highly significant legislation to protect citizens will be accommodated.  If we need to pass such legislation, we have a proposed process that can allow it to be done in time.  </p><p>Nevertheless, this is all contingency planning.  The real negotiation concerns how we can achieve an outcome that allows for the passing of a withdrawal agreement and a transition period of between two and four years to give everybody the time and space to plan for the new realities; that avoids the kind of crisis many people will face in the event of a no-deal Brexit, that provides the protections which the peace process on this island needs, and that provides the reassurance of no physical border infrastructure that is needed regardless of the outcomes of the political debates in the next few weeks.  There is little we can do, however, to provide clarity in those negotiations until we get clarity from Westminster, which we should have more of next Tuesday evening.  We might not have all the clarity we need but at least there will be votes on different options.  I look forward to the Prime Minister's response to those votes and her proposal of a way forward to which, I hope, we can respond in a helpful way.  </p><p>Let me be clear: Ireland does not propose any renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement or the backstop provision therein.  That is the position of both the EU and Ireland, and it was reiterated yesterday by Mr. Michel Barnier and in the past few days by Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker and Mr. Donald Tusk.  Despite yesterday's offer of an opinion by a Polish Minister who, it was subsequently clarified, was not speaking for the Polish Government, today in Brussels foreign Ministers lined up to reinforce the point that the position which I outline is the EU's position and that there is strong solidarity and unity behind it.  I hope that reality will be part of the debate in Westminster as we look to find solutions for the future which, I hope, we can find in a new, changed and more ambitious future relationship declaration, on which the EU wishes to work with the United Kingdom, if the British Government wants to move in that direction.  We will wait for a response in Westminster this week and next week, but the Irish position could not be clearer.  It has been the same position for 18 months and it will not change.</p></speech>

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste back to the House and I join him in condemning the car bomb in Derry at the weekend.  Most of us lived through decades of violence in the North.  We saw the futility of that violence, how useless it is and how it put many obstacles in the way of people of both traditions trying to work together.  Thanks be to God, we thought we had put it aside as we moved on from the Good Friday Agreement but where there is a vacuum in politics, there will always be evil, violent men and women ready to fill that vacuum.  It is incumbent on us, therefore, to continue to work for political solutions to the difficulties that face us, not only on Brexit but also in other areas.</p> <p>To date, the bipartisan approach to Brexit in Leinster House has been remarkable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Politicians on most sides realise that the significance of Brexit allows no time for point scoring.

However, the longer the current impasse goes on the more the public realise how irresponsible it would have been to destabilise the Government and add even further confusion to an already fraught situation.  I believe the electorate, in due course, will adjudicate on the courageous decision Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and Fianna F&aacute;il have made in this regard.</p> <p>At the same time, the Government cannot take this consensus for granted, as it seems to have done from time to time.  The language of Brexit is changing dramatically.  In the beginning, the difficulties in Westminster were a cause for concern.  They moved on then to becoming a very serious worry as it appeared that Mrs. May was not finding any way forward and could not get agreement even within her own party.  We are moving very close to the deadline now, therefore, the language in that regard has accelerated.  There is a general awareness now among the public that we are at a real crisis where Brexit is concerned.</p> <p>The question in today's debate is how prepared are we for Brexit.  It is no longer an academic question, just as it is no longer a question of preparing for a doomsday situation which, deep down, we do not expect to happen.  We are down to the wire, with an ever-shrinking number of days left to get an acceptable deal over the line.  To an extent we have been a bit like the three monkeys.  We closed our eyes and ears to what was happening right in front of us, but we can no longer continue to do that.  We have to beef up our Brexit strategy on all fronts in the event of a no-deal scenario.</p> <p>I acknowledge the hard work the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and their Departments have put in to this project in recent years.  I would include Senator Richmond in that.  Theirs has been no easy task but, as I said, they have enjoyed the support of my party through thick and thin in this entire period.  I am asking the T&aacute;naiste to come clean and tell us here in the Seanad Chamber the extent of our preparation for Brexit.  When he went off script towards the end of his contribution, he gave us some indication as to the legislative framework, which is welcome and news to me, but it was rather slow in coming and obviates a number of pages of my script, which he will be glad to hear.</p> <p>People no longer want to hear vague reassurances.  The public want to know what is happening, and this is the time and place for the public to be told.  It is very unfortunate that the action plan was announced on 19 December, just as both Houses were rising for the Christmas duration.  We have not had a chance, as parliamentarians, to examine the Government's Brexit plan until now.  We have been told that a raft of legislation will be needed.  The T&aacute;naiste has now indicated a date for that and that we will have omnibus legislation reaching across a wide range of Departments and so on.  The sooner we get that, the better.  The sooner we see the heads of the Bill, the better.  The T&aacute;naiste might advise us when concluding the level of the drafting of the Bill and whether there are any difficulties attending that about which we should be told.</p> <p>My party's spokesperson on Brexit, Deputy Lisa Chambers, set out our concerns at a press conference this morning.  The T&aacute;naiste has responded today to her concerns and I hope there will be further clarification when the Taoiseach meets with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and the other party leaders this afternoon.</p> <p>Other European countries, which will be far less affected by Brexit than Ireland, have already promulgated necessary legislation while we are still in the dark.  There is also a great deal of confusion, misinformation and half information coming out, for instance, the position on the employment of additional veterinary officers.  We were told initially that up to 600 veterinary officers would be required.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, contradicted that at the end of last year by saying he thought the figure would be 150.  Farmers are worried about that.  We need clarification and certainty on what will happen concerning the movement of livestock, for instance.</p> <p>Road hauliers issued a statement lately to the effect that they are totally in the dark.  We know that additional lands have been purchased at the major harbours, which is welcome.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste will be able to give us further clarification on that as we move forward.</p> <p>To a certain extent we have been distracted by the goings on in Westminster.  What happens in Westminster is critical but to a certain extent it is a side show.  It is impossible to understand the attitude of British politicians.  Their bloody-mindedness has been staggering.  The public in Britain were sold a bad bill of goods and the Tories have continued to compound the problem.  I will never understand the political mentality of people like Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg.  Their capacity for ignoring the obvious is extraordinary.  In any event, we must get on with our own affairs.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste might advise us of the position on the supply of pharmaceuticals.  He has said he does not want people stockpiling medicines.  That is usually a prelude to people stockpiling.  He might tell us more about that.  Also, what is the programme for time-sensitive operations in terms of the transport of agricultural goods, which will not last forever?</p> <p>Already, the Dutch Government has employed 1,000 additional customs officials.  We have hired only 200 yet it is far more important an issue for us.</p> <p>Also, there appears to be a poor take-up in terms of businesspeople's awareness of Brexit.</p> <p>I raise the situation in the North, which is worrying.  I note that the Sinn F&eacute;in leader, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, stated this morning that bringing back the Assembly would not be a silver bullet in terms of Brexit.  She used the same expression in terms of Sinn F&eacute;in people taking their seats in Westminster.  I know I am going over time-----</p></speech>

If I hear the phrase "managed no deal" one more time, I think I will go blue in the face.  There is no such thing as a managed no deal.  It is an absolute worst case scenario about which everything is being done on both the European and the British side to avoid.  I hope that will continue in the fewer than 70 days until Brexit becomes a reality.  Ultimately, when it comes to a crash out scenario, those of us on this island can never be fully prepared.  It would be unfair to assume that everything can be prepared for because there are so many variables that could come into the conversation at a later date but everything that can be done is being done and, regrettably, it is having to be done at this very late stage.</p> <p>I speak regularly with colleagues in the UK but also across the EU.  There is a maddening frustration among continental colleagues who believe this should have been sorted in July.  Unfortunately, it was not and we are in the position now where we are edging ever closer to a crash out scenario, however unlikely we all believe that may be.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Neale Richmond:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I commend the Government's work and I take on board some of the comments that have already been made.  No doubt there are more such comments to come.  We raised concerns about the fact that the action plan was presented on 19 December but we must be fair and recognise that it could not be prepared until the European Commission outlined its plans.  That happened on the morning of 19 December last.  Where criticism is due, make it but be sure to be clear.  People state that not enough work has been done to ensure the statistics are right and there are those who bandy about the number of 1,000 officials hired in the Netherlands.  That number is aspirational.  They have not all been hired; the process has not been completed.  When comparing and contrasting, it should be remembered that the Port of Rotterdam is the gateway to the entire Continent.  That is not the case with Rosslare Europort.  The comparison is unfair and needless.  When we are trying so hard not just to be bipartisan but to be multipartisan - we are all working together on this one - we need to be fair in our criticism as well as our compliments.</p><p>In the context of multipartisanship - I am sure that is the wrong word but my English teacher will correct me in due course - I refer to the report prepared by the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and some of the recommendations that were made all the way back in July 2017.  I thought the report would be dated and ancient history by now but much of the work undertaken in its compilation and many of the recommendations it contains refer to a stage we have not yet reached.  Many will not arise until the trade negotiations that will commence soon after the UK actually leaves.  I refer, for example, to those recommendations relating to the common travel area.  I welcome the work that has been done by the Government on that issue in the context of the withdrawal agreement - and also the reference to the bilateral discussions last week - the work that has been done on port infrastructure and discussions with the aviation industry.  Much of that was underlined in the European Commission's preparedness, as well as in the context of trade.  While the vista of a no-deal scenario is on the horizon and is very worrying despite its unlikeliness, the key issues the Government has pursued are in line with many of the recommendations made in the report by all members of the committee, such as protecting the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement, recognising the rights of citizens across the island, recognising the importance of protecting the European Single Market and ensuring that relationship between the EU and the UK is as close as possible post-Brexit.  I will touch on that as I conclude my remarks.</p><p>What will Irish-UK relations be post-Brexit?  Many people have tried to say that UK-Irish relations are at their lowest ebb.  They must have very short memories or not know their Irish history to make comments like that.  I know from the work the T&aacute;naiste does with his counterparts, including David Lidington and Karen Bradley - and yesterday with Jeremy Hunt - that the relationships on a personal, political and every other level are warm and strong.  Those of us who meet colleagues from Westminster, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach has done via the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, know relationships are still as strong as possible.  I will travel to Westminster tomorrow to speak at a conference at which there will be five or six MPs who support either leave or remain and who come from all parties.  We will continue to have discussions.  When we welcomed our colleagues from the North from all parties - unionists, nationalists, republicans and others - to our special commemoration yesterday, there was a warmness.  It is unfair to state that relations have reached to a new low.  Far from it.  We can see that by looking at the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  We can map what will be the Anglo-Irish, North-South and east-west relationship after Brexit.  The latter will absolutely be a relationship much closer than any other EU member state will have with the UK.  That will allow Ireland to play a key role in the trade negotiations to ensure that everyone in the UK knows we absolutely are the UK's best friend within the European Union.</p><p>We also have a responsibility to look beyond Brexit to our role within the European Union, which will then be a union of 27 member states.  We need to double down our efforts at our missions across the EU whether it is with individual member states or within the permanent representation in Brussels and with our semi-State bodies such as Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  We have to make the financial and emotional investment in our diplomatic team, which has provided us with such great service in the most trying of circumstances in the past five or six years.  Within 12 months of the referendum, Irish diplomats, officials and politicians had held over 500 meetings with their counterparts.  That has stood the test of time.  We see it in the warm relations and in the comments of President Juncker this morning, Michel Barnier yesterday and of the German Federal Foreign Minister.  They will stand the test of time beyond Brexit.  We cannot let that slip.</p><p>I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this matter at every forum.  I welcome the contributions of all Members.  I know all Members contribute in a positive manner.  That is something we absolutely must maintain.  As the T&aacute;naiste stated, now is the time to keep calm and hold our nerve.  The Good Friday Agreement will be protected by the Irish and, I hope and assume, British Governments over these testing weeks.  We do not need to react to every kite or leak in British newspapers, whatever their hue.</p></speech>

Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis an mh&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite aige &oacute; thaobh na himeachta&iacute; a thit amach i nDoire Cholm Cille le c&uacute;pla l&aacute; anuas.  I begin by echoing the T&aacute;naiste's words condemning the events in Derry in recent days.  My party's vice president, our MP in the area, our MLAs and councillors have been working hard along with many others to offer a positive solution and an alternative to those who seek to bring us back to the past.</p> <p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste, as I have done consistently, for his committed attendance in the Seanad.  I acknowledge his attendance to brief us and keep us informed in the best way he can about the situation as it plays out in the Brexit dynamic.</p> <p>I will note a number of contributions.  I agree with Senator Richmond about tempering our response to the agenda of some of those who leak certain red herrings to the media and who seek to further escalate the uncertainty and at times the very justifiable and understandable concern and panic that exists within Irish political life and elements of British political life as this calamity plays out in front of us.</p> <p>The most recent statement, which has very firm credibility, is from the Confederation of British Industry, CBI, in the North, which has indicated that a no-deal Brexit will result in a loss of &pound;5 billion per year by 2034 to the North's economy.  So much for taking back control.  That is the reality of the situation we face and which is being inflicted upon our people against their will.  I always make the point, because I was one of the majority of people in the North of Ireland who voted to remain in the EU, that when we think about all of this in its democratic context, it means we are having this reckless danger inflicted upon us very consciously and clearly against our expressed democratic will.</p> <p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's statement that there will be a reconvening of the all-Ireland civic dialogue.  It is necessary, positive and useful and it will be welcomed by the relevant stakeholders who have sought avenues to contribute and engage with Government.  The Government has been open to that in various forms in recent months and years.  I also welcome the fact that Government representatives will attend the Ireland's Future conference taking place in Belfast on Saturday next.  This will be a significant conference and an inevitable outworking and manifestation of the mobilisation of civic nationalism and how they have engaged with the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and their Government colleagues.  It is indicative of the live dynamic that exists, not only within broader nationalism in the North but which permeates right throughout various sectors, traditions and classes as we face further into the uncertain and choppy waters of Brexit.  It is important and right that Government representatives will be present and engaged at that event.  I am sure they will go with a listening ear and will absorb what they hear from the people on the ground dealing with the realities.  They are the people who will deal with the potential fallout from Brexit as we move forward, not least the danger of a no-deal, crash-out Brexit.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste is right when he said we in this House have come together in a very uniform and united way to respond.  We have had differences of opinion, which is fair enough.  The purpose of these institutions is to provide a platform for the expression of different and legitimate views.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I reiterate that it is not the time for party political swipes.  It is the second time I have had to make that point in this House during the statements on Brexit.  We do not need it.  Regardless of Sinn F&eacute;in and our abstentionist policy, and we all rightly celebrated abstentionism yesterday, increasingly people in the North see Westminster as part of the problem, not part of the solution.  With the greatest will in the world, and I am no mathematician but Sinn Fein's seven MPs certainly do not go into 230 seats, which was the number by which Theresa May lost her final vote, but sin sc&eacute;al eile.  That is a matter for another day.  </p><p>This debate is about clarity on the Government's preparedness for Brexit.  I have a few questions on which the T&aacute;naiste might reflect.  I put them sincerely as they are being asked by people on the ground.  The Government says it will defend citizens' rights in the context of Brexit and our citizenship rights as Irish and EU citizens, but one of the most basics elements of any citizen's rights is the right to elect democratic representation.  With the allocation of the two additional seats to Ireland after Brexit, we had the opportunity to allocate those seats to the North to continue to afford citizens there the rights and the opportunities to have elected representation and to have a voice at the heart of the EU institutions.  We have fallen at that hurdle.  The T&aacute;naiste might reflect on that.  I believe him when he says he does not want to see a hard border in Ireland.  I take him at his word and I know he believes in that.  That is the outcome he has stated he would like but there have been remarks from the EU Commission in this regard today.  He might reflect on that and send a message in response to the people, not least those who live along the Border.  </p><p>The Government has told us it will defend, respect and uphold the Good Friday Agreement and I believe it.  I take it at its word because it is far too important to do otherwise.  However, on the other hand, the Government tells us not to look to the Good Friday Agreement, and the potential lifejacket it offers us, for a solution to Brexit in the form of a referendum on unity, for which there is increasing demand as displayed by the latest polls.  If we are going to defend and uphold the Good Friday Agreement, we should also look to it and adhere to it at its fullest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-01-22a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1408" speakername="Frances Black" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019012200002#HH00400"><p>I wish to share time with Senator Higgins.</p> <p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste back to Seanad and I am glad there is continued engagement on Brexit with both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It was not long ago that we were in this Chamber marking the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, but the closer it gets to 29 March, such debates become increasingly important.</p> <p>We should not be partisan on this issue and I have said consistently that we need to give credit where credit is due.  We have strong debates and disagreements in this House but it is important that we also recognise the significant time and energy being put into Brexit both by the T&aacute;naiste and by the entirety of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our diplomatic staff.  We have managed to unite the entire EU 27 behind a common position regarding the importance of the backstop, but we cannot just assume that this was necessarily a given; it took months, if not years, of careful, intensive preparation.  This should be noted and recognised. </p> <p>The Irish position has been made absolutely clear and it has strong support in these Houses.  The backstop is crucial because it is, essentially, an insurance policy.  It is a binding legal commitment that, no matter what future arrangements are made, we will not accept a hard border on the island of Ireland.  I cannot emphasise this enough.  Recent events in Derry, as the T&aacute;naiste said, are extremely worrying and underscore just how important it is.  On that basis, we also cannot afford to be complacent about where we go from here.  I fully appreciate, for obvious diplomatic reasons, that we have been very careful in how we discuss what might happen over the coming months and years.  We have chosen to emphasise the importance of a legally-binding backstop, instead of dwelling on the implications of a no-deal Brexit that would not include such guarantees. </p> <p>Recent events in Westminster make clear that we need to work through these implications.  We have had the firm support of the EU 27 but the depth of that solidarity will be seriously tested in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Significant sacrifices were made by ordinary Irish people to avoid the collapse of the European banking system, for example, and it would be great to see similar support offered if we are facing the worst impact of a no-deal Brexit when we will need financial and other support.  We may also be faced with the prospect of an external frontier of the EU running across this island, along with demands to maintain the integrity of the EU Single Market, as well as similar World Trade Organization, WTO, obligations binding on both Ireland and the UK.  Recent comments from the Polish Foreign Minister were quickly and rightly nipped in the bud but they emphasise that difficult conversations will be coming in the event of a no-deal Brexit. </p> <p>We are currently waiting on clarity from the UK, specifically from the UK Parliament, as to how it wants to move forward.  There is a very real chance we will not get that.  Broadly speaking, I can see three main scenarios for the priority of avoiding a hard border.  The first is that the UK decides to remain in the EU, the second is that the North of Ireland remains in some form of customs union in the general spirit of what is in the withdrawal agreement, and the third is that a border poll is held on reunification.  Worryingly, the current parliamentary numbers in Westminster are threatening the first two options.  I fully understand the need for sensitivity on the third, but it is undeniable that the potential for a no-deal Brexit significantly increases the possibility that a border poll may take place in the coming years.  That is something we need to be able to talk about in a manner that includes everyone on this island and demonstrates a generosity of spirit and respect for diversity.  There is no one narrative; there never is.  We need to be able to speak openly and carefully about what a border poll would mean in practice.  If people may be asked to vote on reunification, we need to be able to discuss what that would mean economically, politically, socially, and culturally for everyone in Ireland.  It is not inflammatory to recognise this possibility and want to account for it in a sensitive manner.  The T&aacute;naiste said that he is a "constitutional nationalist", who would like to see a united Ireland in his lifetime, if possible in his political lifetime.  That is an aspiration that I share, but Brexit itself should offer a warning of what can happen when one plunge's head-first into a referendum without proper discussion, care, consideration and planning beforehand.  We need to be willing to have these conversations. </p> <p>I have taken part in discussions with the nationalist community in the North and also with the unionist community, who engaged in good faith and regularly asked what a united Ireland would mean, what would the impact of it be on their daily lives and what would change.  We need to be able to account for elements such as the economic impact, recognising any costs but also the potential benefits of an all-island economy.  That is something that a parliamentary committee could do in a non-threatening, inclusive and sensitive manner, working on a cross-party basis.  I would look to the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement where colleagues from all parties and none could engage with key principles of consent and parity of esteem, as outlined in the Good Friday Agreement, in this manner.   I believe the attitude would be one of wanting to support the T&aacute;naiste and his Department in such work.  It is something we must consider. </p> <p>Beyond this, we need to ensure that our Brexit preparedness is not solely economic.  This is something I have consistently emphasised on that committee.  I think, for example, of the EU-supported PEACE programmes, which have been responsible for incredible projects related to post conflict recovery and counselling in the North.  I think of the educational agreements needed to ensure the same opportunities for Irish students in the North.  Post Brexit, how can we maintain crucial environmental protections, as well as human rights protections, both North and South?  In terms of infrastructure, is there potential for increased capital investment, such as a new airport facilities, on which the T&aacute;naiste touched?.  </p> <p>These are issues that require a detailed debate and we must say very clearly now that we cannot have a single omnibus Bill presented here two days before Brexit, with hundreds of pages and no time to engage with it meaningfully.  We need to be given time to do our work as legislators.  Overall, I thank the T&aacute;naiste and his Department for their hard work so far.  I offer my full support in the months ahead and urge him to take the contributions made by this House on board. </p></speech>

Others have commended the Government on the role it played in the negotiations and the right emphasis it has placed on the Good Friday Agreement and its importance not only as an internationally recognised legal instrument and agreement but also as something with an extraordinary democratic mandate from all across these islands.  It is important we underscore that when we hear talk about democracy being used in some of the debates we have seen in the UK.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have spoken about the hard border and although we have heard the assurance 100 times, we may need to hear it again in respect of ensuring that we commit that in any and all negotiations with whatever parties, Ireland will endeavour to ensure we do not return to the hard border either of our own past or the hard borders we have seen in other parts of Europe.  I do not believe that is something any of us want.  Regardless of the scenario or whether there is a deal or no deal, that is something we will have to work on.</p><p>An equally important part of the Good Friday Agreement is the guarantee of human rights which were given to citizens North and South.  Some concern has been expressed in the past week in the House of Lords in the UK by the EU Justice Sub-Committee which noted there seemed to be some dilution in the language being used.  The wording on the commitment to the EU Convention on Human Rights changed to "respecting the framework"-----</p></speech>

I begin, as others have done, by condemning outright the dreadful car bomb in Derry and commend the prompt action of the PSNI which had already started evacuation before the warning was even received and whose actions clearly averted what could have been terrible tragedy.</p> <p>I also wish to refer to yesterday's impressive and dignified ceremony in the Mansion House where we had our joint sitting of the D&aacute;il and Seanad and we were addressed by the President.  The ceremony was conducted with such dignity, in such an appropriate fashion and with such respect for different traditions on the island.  It was in contrast to the shambles we have seen in Westminster and in the shambolic type of debates there.  Our Oireachtas proceedings are conducted with more decorum and with more respect for the views of others.  It is quite distressing sometimes to watch the jeering and sneering that goes on in the House of Commons about such a serious issue as this, and to see a gendered, almost public schoolboy style of debate being used.  That is most unfortunate.  I speak as somebody who lived in London for many years and who was born there to Irish parents.  I love the place.  It is unfortunate that the Brexit debate has brought out the worst in British politics.</p> <p>We have also seen ironies and contradictions in the Brexit debate and the general political discourse on Brexit in Britain, not least of which is the irony that London, one of the most ethnically diverse places in Britain, voted so strongly to remain, as did Scotland and Northern Ireland.  It is most ironic that the DUP purports to represent the people of Northern Ireland-----</p></speech>

Likewise, it is ironic that no Northern Ireland Assembly has functioned for two years, as a result of which there is a clearly a democratic vacuum and an absence of political voices that would genuinely represent Northern Ireland and its interests.</p><p>I commend the T&aacute;naiste, his officials, the team in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and across the Government who have negotiated so hard on behalf of Ireland, not just on behalf of this jurisdiction but on behalf of the entire island in the absence of a real forum for democratically expressing the views of the Northern Ireland electorate through the Assembly.  That has been unfortunate and perhaps has contributed to what has been notable from the British political system generally, namely, an ignorance about the potential and real impact of Brexit on this island, North and South.</p><p>With some notable exceptions we have seen MPs and Ministers from Britain demonstrate a real ignorance about the impact on Ireland.  There are exceptions of course.  I might single out MPs such as Stephen Pound, the British Labour MP for Ealing North.  Senator Richmond is aware that he gave an 80 second dissection of the Brexit impasse in September which went viral because he outlined very starkly what it would mean for Ireland.  He said it is life and death to the people of Ireland.  He pointed out the reality that a 500 km border with 282 crossing points cannot be solved with cameras or surveillance.  He said once a border is reconstituted, it would become a target.  His words are deeply and depressingly prescient.  He also said if one has a target one has to defend the target and one must also protect the defenders.  He further said that once one has uniformed officers on the Border the peace process is undermined.  The European Commission's confirmation today that a no-deal Brexit would mean a return to a border starkly outlines the seriousness of Brexit, especially the implications of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>We have seen some really good commentary from other MPs such as Keir Starmer and Hilary Benn, both of whom I have met, and Stella Creasy and Joanna Cherry from the Scottish National Party, SNP.  I do not wish to condemn British politicians generally, but it has been most frustrating for the Irish side and for the EU 27 to negotiate effectively in the dark not knowing what the British side is seeking and to see the split within the Tory Party deepening to the extent where we saw the enormous defeat for Theresa May's withdrawal agreement.  Clearly, the withdrawal agreement was the best we could have hoped for in that context but it now seems to be dead in the water.  As a Labour Party Senator I very much welcome the significant shift from the British Labour Party last night.  I hope we will see Jeremy Corbyn as Labour Party leader coming out strongly to back a second referendum.  Unfortunately, that voice has been lacking but we now see 71 Labour Party MPs, including leading figures such as Sadiq Khan backing the people's vote in a second referendum.  It may be that it would become a more likely outcome in the 66 days left.  Many of us very much hope for that.  In the absence of any clarity in that regard and in advance of the votes next week about which the T&aacute;naiste has spoken, it is correct that the Government is now preparing and planning for a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>My party leader, Deputy Howlin, raised in the D&aacute;il, as others have raised here, real concerns about lack of preparedness, about a <i>laissez-faire</i>approach to many issues.  In particular he raised the three stark concerns he has about ports and ferries, the recent worrying announcement by Irish Ferries, about the lack of investment in Rosslare Europort and an absence of sufficient infrastructure in our ports generally.  He also raised a concern others have raised about the pharmaceutical industry and the availability of short-life medicines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I know that is a major concern for people in Britain also.  He also referred to the need for investment in infrastructure such as the electricity grid to ensure that we are not going to be impacted in that regard by a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>If there is a positive to be drawn it is the unity of the EU 27 on the backstop.  Others have spoken about the ostracising of the Polish Foreign Minister who broke the line on that and seemed to have been speaking very much on a personal level.  The unity of the EU 27 on the backstop and the need for a backstop is very welcome, as is the unity of purpose nationally where we have seen political parties approach the issue in a constructive manner.  Opposition parties have worked with the T&aacute;naiste.  I commend him for briefing the Opposition throughout the process.  He can be assured of the support of my own Seanad Technical Group.  I think I can speak for them all, although not all members in the group are from the Labour Party.  We will work constructively with the T&aacute;naiste and we are very happy to co-operate on the timeline he has helpfully outlined for us in terms of the Brexit omnibus legislation.  We are pleased to see plans for that crystallising.</p><p>I am also pleased to see the all-island civic dialogue.  I attended previous sessions of that.  It is very useful and helpful to hear stakeholders speak.  There is some comfort and positivity to be gained from what is a very negative situation for Ireland from the unity we have had from our EU colleagues and within our own political system.  However, there are serious questions about preparedness on specific areas and the need to ensure we have adequate recruitment of additional personnel where needed.  Ultimately, while preparing for the worst, we must hope for the best.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A people's vote with a strong, dynamic and positive "Remain" campaign remains the best outcome for Ireland.</p></speech>

I thank him, the Taoiseach, and all the Ministers for the work they have done on this matter to date in protecting Ireland's interest.  I also thank all those in the Opposition parties for the work they have done and for their contribution.  We have shown very much a united front in the way we have approached Brexit, which is important because we have also won the support, as some of my colleagues have referred to, of the other member states of the European Union in dealing with the many challenges we face as a country.  I also acknowledge the important contributions of my colleague, Senator Richmond, to public debates on both Irish and UK media.  Whether it was the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, the Taoiseach, or Senator Richmond, they have very much come across as knowing the issues well and positive about the way forward in dealing with Brexit.</p> <p>There are many challenges and the Government has made provision for new legislation.  It will have 17 different parts, which will be comprehensive, and will cover a wide range of areas, including health, which is an important area.  Senator Bacik referred to the challenges we face in this area, as did other colleagues.  The legislation will also deal with the areas of finance, taxation, financial services and amendments to EU regulations.  In addition to the comprehensive legislation we must now put through, we must also put through, we must approve approximately 20 separate statutory instruments.  They will all have to be carefully drafted to deal with the challenges we face.  I thank each and every one of the Departments and the officials in each Department for the work they are doing in this regard because we face a significant sea change, which we must deal comprehensively with in the way we go forward.</p> <p>We face a number of other challenges, for instance, the important issue of medicines.  The Government has a short timescale now to plan to ensure there is no shortfall or delay in accessing them for those who require medicines.  The Minister for Health, the HSE and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, have done much work on this, but it is one area the Government needs to work on and ensure we prioritise.</p> <p>The transport of goods out of Ireland is another challenge.  More than &euro;21 billion worth of exports is transported from Ireland to other EU countries, and it is important that at all stages Irish companies have access to the transport system to get their goods to their final destination in a timely manner.  This is a challenge and something that must be dealt with.  The Minister responsible is working on it but it is also important he has full co-operation from the various shipping companies, together with the transport organisations and the ports.</p> <p>We have much work to do on this but I know that the T&aacute;naiste, together with the Ministers and the Government, are working on it.  This is a new era because this is something we have not had to face previously and something on which we must all work together to ensure that all the t's are crossed and the i's dotted, no matter what the issue is.  We must be ready for the situation, which I hope will not happen, where there is no agreement from the UK.  It is a challenging situation but also one that we need to be careful about in the wording we use and the comments we make.  It is important that the agreement negotiated by Theresa May be finally agreed at UK level and that an agreement will be in place by 29 March.  I again thank the T&aacute;naiste for the work he is doing in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-01-22a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019012200002#KK00300"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.  This is such a challenging unknown For all of us .  Having spoken to people in my area, the issue is the uncertainty about what will happen.  I welcome the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit to be held on Friday, 15 February in Dublin Castle because it will involve everyone working together to try to work around the serious issues that could face Ireland in the next few months.  The greatest concerns relate to the Border, farming, businesses and employment.  There is so much to be done yet so much uncertainty.</p> <p>I refer to the issue of passports because it is one of the biggest issues in my clinics.  I recently spoke a British national who is married to an Irish woman and who has children.  Their children hold Irish passports.  He inquired about the possibility of gaining an Irish passport but was told that while it was possible, he would have to live in Ireland for one year to qualify for naturalisation, thus citizenship.  Can we ask a family to reconcile residency issues or ask them to move lock, stock and barrel to Ireland for one year?  It is not practical.  This man has an important job in England, as does his wife, and his children are all in school.  I would like the Minister to clarify what is being preparing for these hard-working families who travel to Ireland regularly to see elderly relatives and family here.  What is our contingency plan in this regard?  I would also like to know what Brexit could mean for the right of UK citizens derived from Irish law under the EU freedom of movement legislation to come and live in Ireland without residency permits.  These are all important issues.  Another man to whom I spoke is English and has lived here for 42 years with his wife.  He has children here.  He has paid his taxes, including property tax, all his life.  He applied for an Irish passport but he was told that for refugees and stateless persons, passports are free; for widows or widowers of Irish citizens the cost is &euro;200; and for others, the cost is &euro;950.  This man does not have &euro;950.  What does he do?  He has lived here for 42 years, is married to an Irish citizen, has children, has reared them and has paid his property tax and his other taxes.  What are we going to do to help these people who need Irish passports?</p> <p>I know I only have five minutes.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste for more clarification.  It is only 66 more days until we will know whether this will be good or bad for us.  At this stage we must prepare.  The T&aacute;naiste knows the old saying, "Fail to prepare, prepare to fail."  It is a true saying.  If we are not prepared for a hard border, if we are not prepared to get Ireland back on track, we are in trouble because it is the Irish people who will end up paying the price for all this.  Perhaps he could come back to me with answers to some of my questions.</p></speech>

Much has been said about Brexit.  Those who know more than me have spoken better and know the issues better so I will not rehash in any way what they have said.  We have given our views in several languages and at all levels, and all territories have been represented.</p> <p>Speaking of territories, I would like to ask a question of my colleague from the North, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  He spoke about citizens' rights.  Sinn F&eacute;in MPs were elected in the North and are not in their seats.  Would the Senator outline to us the Northern Irish people's citizens' rights in this regard?  It would be interesting to find out what he has to say about that since he talked about citizens' rights.  Furthermore, regarding the referendum on Irish unity, which we have been hearing about from some senatorial colleagues, when the parties cannot unify themselves in Stormont, how do they expect to unify themselves when it comes to cross-Border unification between the South and the North?</p> <p>I have one question I would like to ask the Minister about the backstop.  We know it is essential, I know the arguments and I know it is not up for negotiation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2390"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, can the Minister outline how far does the fact that it is not up for negotiation create no deal?  How linked is the backstop to no deal?  In other words, what is the momentary and continuing level of causation between the backstop and no deal?  Are the Brexiteers calling the backstop something that it is not?  Leaving everything else aside, this is the impasse, or so we are told.  I do not wish to know about the 26 member states which voted for it because it is an impasse everywhere.  What is the link or level of causation between the backstop and no deal?  Perhaps the Minister will answer that question because the rest of what I have listened to in the last hour or so is just wallpaper from some Senators.</p></speech>

He is in the cockpit and is dealing with this daily.  It is implicit in the Good Friday Agreement that there will be no hard border.  I would have thought that the UK, as one of the principal partners in that agreement, would wish to do nothing to undermine it.  If there is a hard border, what impact would that have on the Good Friday Agreement?  That is logical.</p> <p>Second, the uncertainty Brexit is causing is as big an issue as the outcome itself.  I see no upside to Brexit, particularly for us.  Many of us follow the British Premier League and, consequently, we watch British television channels.  I find myself increasingly watching the news on Sky News and the BBC.  "The Andrew Marr Show" is a weekly diet for me.  I watch it so I can find out the thinking in the UK.  The Minister can give his view on this but I have noticed a drift, certainly in the Labour Party, towards holding a second referendum.  It would appear to be a logical step on the basis that if a general election were held it might not be specifically about the single issue of Brexit.  A referendum is democratic.  We hold referenda in this country and I support that because I believe the people are sovereign.  What is the possibility of a second referendum being held in the UK?</p> <p>Third, I welcome the Brexit preparations.  I hope that common sense will prevail.  In the UK there is a danger that the British Parliament is playing the man rather than the ball.  Members have found themselves in a position where they have no experience of what we have got used to by stealth, which is coalitions collaborating.  Who would have thought in early 2016 that a coalition Government of Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance with the support of the supply and confidence agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il would have survived until now?  That has been in the national interest.  What the UK needs to consider is what is in its best interest.  There is no upside to Brexit either for here or the UK.  I believe a second referendum could provide a solution.  It would be a decision of the people in the UK.  I am not certain that people were fully aware of what they were voting for when the first referendum took place.  It is now a question of finding a way that is ultimately in everybody's best interests.  I do not foresee Europe being strong without the UK or the UK being strong without the EU.  In our case, Britain is our major trading partner and for many in our indigenous business sector it is their only trading partner.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to give his view on the Good Friday Agreement, the impact of not having a hard border and whether that is implicit in the agreement.  I also seek his opinion on whether there is scope for a second referendum in the UK.</p></speech>

I have referred previously to the insanity of placing such a politically complex matter before the most politically unsophisticated and illiterate public in Europe.  I can say that as I am half English.  I am not racist in this matter.</p><p>I admire the dignity that has been displayed by political leaders from all parties in this country in the face of ignorant and ill-informed comment from political figures in England.  There were reasons for the people voting in the way they did.  First, they have shown themselves to be rather unsophisticated politically.  However, a large part of the response was in reaction to the fact that governments all over the world, including in the United Kingdom, in the face of the economic crash opted straight away to rescue the financial institutions that are criminally responsible for causing that crash in the first place.  They allowed the people, the citizens, to go to hell.  Of course that caused a response, even though it was an unfocused and largely illiterate response.</p><p>One of the most unattractive prospects has been the sight of people such as Mrs. Theresa May violating their beliefs.  Mrs. May believes in remain but she pushes leave policies.  This is utterly disgraceful and to be condemned.  It is not democratic.  People ask if Members of Parliament know more than the people.  Of course, they bloody do.  If they did not they would not be elected.  If one thinks dustmen know more about financial institutions and the way the system operates then put them in the parliament.  By and large, however, they do not, although I was rather surprised to see a dustman winning &quot;Brain of Britain&quot; on James Joyce.  He knew everything, including a great deal about <i>Finnegans Wake</i>.</p><p>The result was close and the people voted after having been basted in a swirl of lies and deceit by the Brexiteers.  It may not be politically correct to say that Members of Parliament know more than their constituents but it is clearly common sense.  English politicians should develop, at last, a little backbone and spine and stand and speak for the things in which they believe.  They should develop some principle.  So what if it costs them their seats.  They are supposed to be there for the good of the people, not for their own good or for the interests of their party.  They should be for the interests of the country.  Nobody except a complete eejit would believe that it is in the interests of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.</p><p>I will conclude on the issue of a second referendum.  People in England say it would not be democratic.  That is absolute rubbish.  It is the most democratic thing possible.  They did not have a proper debate before it.  We have only had the debate since they made their half-baked decision.  Let us have a referendum now when people know the issues and know about the cliff over which the political parties are determined to trundle them.  I am a great admirer of Mr. Jeremy Corbyn but I wish he would get off the fence and do something proper.</p></speech>

I think Prime Minister May is trying to carry out their orders in the best possible way she can.  I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste on the intense work he is doing over long hours to keep the Irish cause and the Irish position to the fore in Europe.  I would like to ask a number of questions, the first of which relates to the possibility of a hard border with lots of checks and controls.  When the EU Commissioner for finance came before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, I asked him specifically about who would cover the costs of border controls.  He said that a portion of the money that is collected at customs posts would go towards covering the costs of setting up and operating border controls.  If the UK stays within the customs union and there is no great need for border controls, I am sure significant costs will still be incurred when collecting customs.  The Irish Government will have to come up with the cost of doing that.  It might not be in a position to do so through tariffs or anything else.  Regardless of whether we have a hard border or the UK stays within the customs union, will the EU make a contribution towards the establishment by the Irish Government of European border controls?  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that legislation will come through both Houses of the Oireachtas in mid-February.  In light of the composition of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that this Parliament will disagree with the proposals made by the Government in that legislation.  If significant changes are made to the legislation in question, will that have a significant impact on our position at European level?  What would be the consequences of any changes to the legislation that is to be introduced by the Government?</p></speech>

I would like to make a few comments to provide clarity.  Some quite generalised statements were made to the effect that we are not sufficiently prepared or that there is not enough detail.  I suggest that anyone who has read the document we published on 19 December will see that while it does not have all the answers, it certainly has a lot of detail.  We could not publish the contingency planning document until the European Commission had released a series of documents and memos on planning for a no-deal Brexit in areas of EU competence like aviation and road haulage, which it did that afternoon.  It would not have made much sense for us to have produced a document dealing with up to 20 different sectoral areas, in great detail in some cases, until we could show we had answers in the cases of sectors that would be vulnerable in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The haulage licensing sector is an obvious example.  The temporary solution we have until the end of the year to enable EU hauliers to access the UK, and <i>vice versa</i>, involves the waiving of the licensing requirements that would normally apply to a third country.  In aviation, the safety certification of British airports will be extended beyond the date of a no-deal Brexit, again on a temporary basis, to facilitate point-to-point access into the EU from the UK for non-EU airlines.</p><p>These are the kinds of practical things where there is real detail.  Ireland cannot provide that detail on its own - it needs to be provided by the EU collectively.  Approximately 80 contingency plan papers have come from the Commission at different times.  Most of that is contained in our rulebook around contingency planning, which is evolving and changing all the time.  We built on the detail of that last week by bringing four memos to the Government, one of which dealt with access to medicines.  As long as Britain retains its access as a member of the EU, between 70% and 80% of all medicines in Ireland will continue to come here from the UK or through the UK.  After Britain leaves the EU, many of those products will need to have a different route into Irish pharmacies and Irish hospitals because they will no longer have the authorisation of the EU Medicines Agency in Britain.  Therefore, we may have to look for alternative routes to market.  Last week, the Minister, Deputy Harris, provided a lot of reassurance inside and outside the Cabinet that there will be a continued supply of medicines beyond 29 March in the event of Britain crashing out of the EU.</p><p>We have also dealt with the complexity of the transportation of goods to and from this island.  The vast majority of goods that come to Ireland come via the UK landbridge.  Every year, approximately &euro;21 billion worth of trade comes on and off this island via roll-on, roll-off haulage.  Helpfully, the UK has committed to signing up to the international transport convention, which essentially allows a container to be sealed in Dublin, taken across Britain as a landbridge and brought back into the Single Market in France or the Netherlands without being checked.  That does not solve a potential traffic jam in Dover which could be many kilometres in length.  There is concern that we need to have contingency plans to get goods to and from this island, without being able to use the landbridge that is the UK, in as efficient and timely a manner as we do today.  There have been detailed discussions between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and shipping companies to look at issues around capacity and access points, etc.  Likewise, infrastructure is being put in place as we speak at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport, which are the three key access points into Ireland from the UK, to ensure we can, if we need to, comply with the necessary EU requirements around customs checks, sanitary and phytosanitary checks and health checks, etc. from 29 March.  We are going into a great deal of detail in what exactly we are doing with regard to parking bays, inspection bays, staffing numbers, ICT systems and so on.</p><p>We have also outlined what is needed in terms of legislation.  By the way, this is not being done at the last minute.  The Cabinet signed off on the heads of the legislation today.  As nine Departments are involved, some presentational work is required before it can be published as a collective Bill.  That will be done before the end of this week.  The legislation will then go to the legal draftsperson.  The target date for its publication is 22 February.  I was asked whether we are factoring in enough time, in the event of amendments being made in the Seanad, to allow the legislation to go back to the D&aacute;il to be finalised.  That is a perfectly valid question.  We hope to conclude Committee, Report and Final Stages in the Seanad on 13 and 14 March.  This would provide enough time to go back to the D&aacute;il the following week, if necessary, to finalise the legislation so that it can be signed before the end of March.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have factored in a little cushion room at the end, but we need to be disciplined as a Parliament in both Houses to pass emergency legislation if necessary.<br/><br/>There are some experienced legislators among the Senators who will understand what we are doing.  An example of the situation is the current conditions of cross-Border healthcare, where people from Donegal go to Altnagelvin hospital and children travel from Belfast to Dublin for specialist paediatric care.  We need to ensure we protect that kind of normalisation which we have created on this island, where we share health infrastructure in a way that makes sense both North and South of the Border.  That seamless relationship of health provision which works for everybody is the kind of matter that we will have to legislate for because we will no longer operate in a Single Market, customs union and shared Union in a way that does not involve borders for goods, services or people. <br/><br/>The issue is the same for students.  We must ensure the Government can continue to support Irish students going to university or college in the UK, British nationals coming here and so on.  Likewise, basic services such as cross-Border transport, including rail networks and the train from Dublin to Belfast, will travel from the EU to outside the EU before returning.  We take these circumstances for granted in a Union but we will need to legislate for them in the context of a no-deal Brexit.<br/><br/>In important areas such as welfare provision or pension provision, many people in Ireland receive part of their income from a British pension, while many Irish people in the UK receive part of their income every week from an Irish pension.  That is all part of EU common recognition, the necessary EU directives and so on, but we will have to replace some of those measures with legislation in both the UK and Ireland and a bilateral understanding to ensure a continuation of income post Brexit.  People do not even think about these kinds of matters but they have a significant impact on everyday life and we will have to legislate for them.  There are also other complex financial areas, such as the central securities depository for the buying and selling of shares, where we rely on a UK-based system and we will need to legislate to facilitate them in the future.  <br/><br/>I could go on because there are many other areas but we will have an opportunity to debate them with detailed explanation.  I reassure Senators that there is preparedness for a no-deal Brexit and preparedness for what we call a central case scenario.  The latter is still the most likely scenario, where there will be a transition period of somewhere between two and four years followed by a Brexit which will result in changes that we will all have to learn to live with, legislate for and prepare for.  Either way, legislation will be needed.  If that legislation must be passed in an emergency way on 29 March, however, we will accelerate our state of preparedness to be as ready as we can be.  <br/><br/>No matter how good we are at no-deal contingency planning, however, we will not be able to create a situation where the <i>status quo </i>persists through a no-deal Brexit.  It will be an extremely demanding time for Ireland - for many across our economy, for many vulnerable sectors that rely on seamless trade between the UK and Ireland and for the fragile peace process, North and South, in the absence of devolved government in Northern Ireland, which is unlikely to be back up and running by 29 March.  I hope I am wrong in that regard, and we will work to change the current political impasse in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>I will finish with one other aspect of the Border issue because it has been raised by a number of Senators.  I have missed a number of other matters and I am happy to return to them if Senators wish to discuss them with me afterwards.  To give clarity on the Border issue, the Government is not preparing in our contingency planning for physical border infrastructure between the two jurisdictions on this island, and we will not start doing so either.  We have a deal that took two years to put in place, that addresses all the complexity of both the politics of the issue and the legal, regulatory issues thereof, and that has found a way to prevent in a worst-case scenario the requirement for physical border infrastructure by creating regulatory alignment and putting a customs arrangement in place.  That deal was done and signed up to by the British Government, EU institutions and EU governments.  To Theresa May's credit, she insisted on doing that despite pressure not to do it, and continues to defend the need for a backstop, in spite of many others making a political football out of the issue and describing it as something it is not, namely, a threat to the constitutional integrity of Northern Ireland, although, unfortunately, that has become the narrative around the backstop.<br/><br/>I have also noted that the absence of a backstop and a deal creates a complex and challenging situation for the Government to work with the British Government and the EU institutions to find a way of avoiding the need for physical border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.  The idea that we would throw away a solution which took two years to put together and to which everyone has signed up, because it has become something in Westminster that it is in fact not, is very frustrating.  The focus should be on asking those who advocate doing away with the backstop to answer the question of how they would solve the issue because they also advocate for no border infrastructure.  They make the simplistic argument that because they, the Irish Government, the UK Government and the EU do not want it, there is nothing to worry about.  As Theresa May, the Taoiseach and I have said many times, the issue cannot be wished away.  Rather, a legal, regulatory mechanism that is agreed by all sides is needed to reassure people that we do not face border infrastructure in the future as an unintended consequence of Brexit, given our obligations as an EU member state to protect the integrity of the EU Single Market and customs union of which we are a part and because of which we thrive.  <br/><br/>Deal or no deal, we will insist on finding ways to avoid border infrastructure on this island, but that job will become highly complex and difficult if we do away with an agreed mechanism to solve the problem and create the time and space for a future relationship agreement which, I hope, can be so close and comprehensive that the backstop will never be required to be used.  Let me be clear: we continue to defend the withdrawal agreement in full, including the backstop, because nobody has alternative solutions to the problem in London, Dublin or the EU.  The only solution is through regulatory alignment, and those who talk about technology on the physical border itself do not understand the problem or the need for a level playing field to protect an all-island economy, whether for farmers, fishermen or those manufacturing a product North or South of the Border.  <br/><br/>I look forward to returning to the House.  I hope I will not have to return with the legislation but if I do, I look forward to Senators' co-operation and talking to party leaders in preparation for that to ensure all the information is available in order that nobody will be asked to rush matters and that, if necessary, we can pass emergency legislation for the sake of the country in a timely and efficient manner.</p></speech>

Subsection (6) of our proposed amendment was to provide that a member of those courts would still be able to notify the secretary to the Government in writing of his or her willingness and availability to be appointed to any vacancy for any such judicial office mentioned in the first subsection and to provide that where a judicial office mentioned in subsection (5) stands vacant that in the ordinary course the commission should seek applications from persons who are otherwise eligible for appointment to such office, such as practising barristers, solicitors or members of the District Court or Circuit Court, as the case might be.</p><p>I want to point out to the Minister something which I was taken aback by.  Over the Christmas break there was some coverage of this legislation and its passage through this House.  The coverage was generated by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  On 2 January he said that it was is totally unacceptable to see inordinate delays because of vested interests and he said it is a terrible waste of parliamentary time.  I would not expect him to say any different.  In an interesting <i>Irish Examiner</i>article he went on to say: &quot;The Irish Times has been constantly critical of him for some time ... the opposition there which is relentless is all down to their opposition of the Judicial Appointments Bill.&quot;  He was effectively saying that the poor press he was getting generally in the <i>Irish Times</i>largely stemmed from its concern about this legislation, which is a bit over the top because his other activities merit close scrutiny and sometimes condemnation, with or without this Bill.  He said: &quot;The bill has passed the D&aacute;il but is being filibustered in the Seanad and being cheered on by the Irish Times which is a fairly irresponsible attitude for the newspaper, but that is up to them.&quot;  On 31 December he said:</p><blockquote>The filibuster by legal insiders in the Seanad has come up with an ingenious new delaying ruse.  They will appeal to the judiciary itself to make independent judgments on the very system of political appointment that landed them in their current positions.

The President's role in this is for the President to operate under Article 26 and it is a matter for him to consult the Council of State and take its advice but to exercise in the last analysis his own personal judgement as to whether an Article 26 reference would or would not be appropriate.</p><p>I refer to the suggestion, therefore, that a &quot;new ruse&quot; was to:</p><blockquote>Appeal to the judiciary to make independent judgements on the very system of political appointment that landed them in their current positions.  Wow.</blockquote> <p>That was a disgraceful remark for any Minister in the Cabinet to make about the Article 26 reference process.  It is disgraceful in many respects because it shows remarkable ignorance and a remarkable disloyalty to the terms of the Constitution because this legislation is eminently suitable for an Article 26 reference if that is the view of the President and I do not presume to advise the President on this issue, although I have clear views which I have expressed.</p><p>The point I am making is around why it is wrong for a Minister to try to impugn the Article 26 procedure, as applicable to this Bill.  It is wrong because if this Bill is unconstitutional for any or all of the reasons I have proposed or for others which I have not yet seen or which may occur to others on an Article 26 reference, or if any part of it is arguably unconstitutional in a manner that would require or justify such a reference, I will say that the very purpose of Article 26 is to make sure that something which becomes law and which should be looked at before it becomes law should have an adjudication made on it in limited circumstances.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->From my experience as Attorney General, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, T&aacute;naiste and a member of the Council of State, I know that Presidents are very sparing in their use of Article 26 precisely because of the <i>stare decisis</i>rule to the effect that once a Bill has been referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26 and found to be valid, the matter may never again be canvassed in any court at any level.  Commentators query whether that should be the case.  I would not have inserted it into the 1937 Constitution but it is there and, as a result, Presidents rightly take the view that they should not cut off constitutional challenges to legislation for all time where factual situations, changing values and views on the Constitution may emerge which nobody could envisage and which might justify a constitutional challenge to legislation.<br/><br/>The converse is equally true.  Why is Article 26 there and why would the President refer the relevant matter to the Supreme Court?  There are circumstances in which, having regard to a number of distinct issues, it is crucial that a preliminary check before final promulgation as a law by the President's signature should take place.  One of these is that if legislation which had the effect of unconstitutionally tainting the manner in which judges were appointed were to be passed, it would be far better if that was discovered at the earliest available opportunity.  There are two reasons for this.  The first is that there can be downstream consequences of appointments being made in a unconstitutional manner.  The second is that the fact that whether a challenge might be made depends largely on who is likely to make it.  Without going into an overly long discussion on the matter, we must consider who is likely to make a challenge of this kind.  The person who is most likely to do so is somebody who is directly affected by the legislation.  Will it be a disappointed judge who believes that he or she was improperly excluded from being shortlisted by unconstitutional legislation?  Will it be a disappointed would-be appointee to a position on the Bench?  Who would have <i>locus standi</i>to challenge this?  It is perhaps not just anybody who is an ordinary citizen.  It might be argued that ordinary citizens simply do not have it.  In the context of some views of the law, it might be argued that they do have standing.</p></speech>

Article 26 has functions, one of which is to deal with situations where something the President is considering signing into law appears constitutionally appears suspect.  Another function is in circumstances where the President comes to the view that it should not become law until it is tested because it is unlikely that an action will be taken subsequent to his or her signature of the Bill and its promulgation as a law that somebody will be in a position, without significant embarrassment, to make such a case.  The Minister criticised me for using the term "embarrassment" in the context of asking sitting judges to make applications for all promotional appointments.  Surely it would be far more embarrassing if a member of the Judiciary started an action, the subtitle of which is the pop song "It Should Have Been Me".</p></speech>

That judge would have to litigate.  It would be deeply embarrassing and unedifying.  It is wrong to put anybody in that position.  If anybody was of the view that this process tended to subvert the independence of the Judiciary by requiring its members to periodically and frequently make applications for promotional appointments, a phrase which I use loosely, that person would find it exceedingly embarrassing to make a claim that the process somehow prevented him or her from being shortlisted, especially since he or she would not be told that he or she had been shortlisted or not.  We would have all sorts of discovery issues and other unsatisfactory aspects.</p><p>With regard to the remarks attributed to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport about the new ruse of having the Judiciary look at this under Article 26, it is not a ruse at all.  It is a perfectly sensible issue for this House to consider when it is trying to come to the view of whether there are constitutional difficulties which should make us hesitate.  It is interesting to note what the Minister, Deputy Ross, is reported as stating on this subject by<i>Irish Independent</i>.  The article in question reads:</p><blockquote>&quot;By delaying the judicial bill in the Seanad, they're perpetuating political patronage, they're perpetuating political favours,&quot; the minister said in an interview with the Sunday Independent.<br /><br />&quot;That is what they are doing. So, if that's what they want to do, let them say so,&quot; he added.<br /><br />&quot;They're not dictating policy because they are not introducing new policies. They're quite destructive, that's all.&quot;</blockquote> <p>It continues with a fascinating statement that those behind the delaying of the legislation were &quot;horribly powerful&quot; people, then the Minister stated, &quot;We beat the vintners and we're going to beat the judges and barristers.&quot;  Those are shameful words from any Cabinet Minister.</p></speech>

The statement that this is about cronyism and perpetuating political patronage and favours, and that is what I am doing here, really needs to be underlined when the Minister's own Cabinet colleagues have made 36 appointments.  Either those are good appointments - I think they are good appointments - or they are not.  Either they are exercises in political patronage or they are not, and I do not believe they have been.  Either the appointments that have been made fall into the category of political favours being given to people or they do not.</p> <p>This Government, this Taoiseach and this Minister for Justice and Equality should publicly condemn that kind of language about the decisions which this Government itself has made and say it is unacceptable.  It must say that far from depoliticising the appointment of judges, this language accuses the Minister's colleagues in the most scandalous way of engaging in patronage and favour-giving without any justification whatsoever.  It is about time that Fine Gael got off the fence completely and admitted that it does not agree with this legislation.  The great majority of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas from the Fine Gael Party, with whom I have had private conversations, do not agree with a word of this legislation.</p></speech>

If any member of the Government thinks that the old system is inherently an exercise in patronage or favour-giving he should resign or the Taoiseach should tell him to stop making those remarks.

Why are we asking a member of the sitting High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court who is seeking an appointment or seeking to signal an appointment to any position in those courts to go through this meat grinder process, which requires, if they are appointed notwithstanding the views of this so-called commission, the writing of a reasoned explanation of the Government's decision not to appoint a candidate recommended by the commission?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Let us suppose that 12 persons apply for a job in one of those courts and, typically, eight might be judges.  Three people - one practising barrister and two judges - might be placed on the shortlist.  As I pointed out on the previous occasion, this Bill is designed to prevent people from really knowing what happens.  Let us also suppose that the Government believes that Mr. Justice Bloggs is a better appointee as Chief Justice than any of the three people chosen for inclusion on a shortlist by the commission.  How could a reasoned explanation be given for that apart from stating that the Government thought he was more suitable?  How could that amount to a reasoned explanation?  Unless it stated that it had flipped a coin, it would not be possible to have a less reasoned explanation than to say that the Government believed the person appointed by it was more suitable than those on the shortlist.<br/><br/>If one did not identify the people on the shortlist but merely identified the appointee by means of a little paragraph in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>, somehow asserting their superiority over unnamed persons who were shortlisted, what, then, is this subsection all about?  It is deeply offensive.  It is so ridiculous that I wonder how it got there in the first instance.  It is deeply offensive because it is designed for one thing only.  The only motive for such a strange provision in a Bill is to make it deeply embarrassing for the Government not to accept the shortlist, to plunge the Government into a kind of internal crisis that rather than just saying that it prefers Mr. Justice Bloggs to the people on the shortlist, it must now engage in publishing a reasoned explanation as to why the particular judge it chose was better than three other judges who were recommended and give some reasons for that.<br/><br/>The undeniable and obvious inference to be drawn from the inclusion of that measure in this legislation is that it is designed to prevent the Executive from using its own discretion in cases where it thinks that is appropriate and disregarding what is, in effect, merely advice from an external body in the exercise of a constitutional function.  That is the only possible reason for putting into <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>a reasoned explanation for one person getting a job rather than others is to make it difficult, embarrassing and controversial and, indeed, to impugn in ways the appointment it makes.</p></speech>

One of the curious things about this legislation is that if, for instance, the Government decides to appoint a judge of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, a vacancy thereby will be created in the Court of Appeal.  As the Bill stands, either the Government has to anticipate its decision to appoint an appeal court judge to the Supreme Court and seek in advance that the commission advertises the position in the Court of Appeal or the resulting vacancy has to be advertised.  In respect of each of these matters, members of the Judiciary are supposed to put in a separate application to the commission seeking appointment.  What I find difficult is that a Government that announces that Ms Justice Blogs in the Court of Appeal is to be made an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court, having discussed with the Attorney General the consequences of making such a decision, cannot say that morning that it will appoint Mr. Justice Smyth of the High Court to the Court of Appeal in consequence.  The Government cannot do that.  The new procedure will slow everything down and create an unusual situation whereby that position now has to be the subject of this mass circulation of the Judiciary and of mass application by all the Judiciary who are intent on applying.</p> <p>That is another reason why this clumsy proposed legislation should not be law.  One cannot have that situation.  The Judiciary needs to function smoothly and Cabinets should be in the position that if they decide to appoint a High Court judge directly to the Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal judge to the Supreme Court or an existing Supreme Court judge to be Chief Justice, there will be a follow-on, domino-like sequences of events which they will want to fulfil.  The Government will have to ask each member of the Judiciary who wants to be part of that snakes and ladder process to put in an application, to be considered afresh and short-listed by this commission simply makes no sense.  For the Government to received shortlists arising from a vacancy created by the promotion and to go through a process whereby a shortlist has to be devised by the commission based on a process involving interviews and all the rest is just nonsense.  This is bad and foolish, and we should not go down this road.</p> <p>The 36 appointments I mentioned were good appointments and properly made in proper circumstances by a system that is not broken, if it is operated in good faith.  To ask individual judges of the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court, respectively, to apply to outsiders for every promotional appointment within the courts system, especially in the context of what the D&aacute;il has done in sections 47 and 48, in any event is bad law and is designed to create a situation in which the Government effectively is coerced into divesting itself of its judgment, which is vested in it under the Constitution as to what kind of judge or who should be on the Supreme Court.  As I have said previously, this is a political decision for the Government in the sense that it is a matter of policy and it is not one on which the JAAB is even asked at present to make a recommendation.  It is not one on which its views are in any way relevant and particularly it is not one on which the Government should be curtailed in any way from making its own decision.</p> <p>I regard my arguments as being reinforced strongly by the points I have made about the Attorney General not being in a position to tell the Government who the unsuccessful candidates who were not short-listed were.  I believe all of these factors taken together strongly indicate that this proposed legislation is unconstitutional.  That is not a ruse, that is not a wheeze, that is not perpetuating patronage or doing anybody any favours; it is merely upholding constitutional values and the separation of powers.</p></speech>

It seems to me to be absolutely absurd to preclude the Government from knowing the names on this list.  That is a complete absurdity and I believe it to be unconstitutional.</p> <p>With regard to the article that was referred to, it was rather let down by the immature, comic book exclamation, "Wow", but reference was made to vested interests and legal insiders.  I have been one of those who has been responsible for the detailed examination of this legislation and I do not apologise for one second for being in that position.  I would like to know what vested interests I have, except as a Member of the Oireachtas.  I would like to know in what sense I constitute a legal insider, apart from the fact that I have taken between 40 and 50 cases in the courts and have won every single one of them.</p></speech>

These names are to be ranked in the order of the Commission's preference.  The amendment specifically seeks to ensure there is an adequate gender balance among the nominees for the Judiciary or those recommended. </p><p>I will not go through all of the other amendments in great detail.  Amendment No. 87 proposes to make a similar change to section 41(2) by insert after the word "concerned" the words ", having regard to the objective that the membership of the judiciary should comprise equal numbers of women and men".</p><p>Amendment No. 91 is to section 44, which deals with the appointment as Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal, and President of the High Court.  The amendment uses the same formula in providing that at least one of the nominees for these appointments must be of each gender.  Similarly, amendment No. 93 proposes to change section 46 and refers to the objective that membership of the Judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women.</p><p>Before I speak about these gender balance amendments, I should note that amendment No. 92 is somewhat different, although it is related to the other amendments.  It does not refer to the issue of gender balance but seeks to change section 46 by inserting a specific reference to the need for the commission to make a ranked recommendation.  Section 46, as the Minister will see, refers to recommended persons to be considered first.  It is the section that refers to the Government's consideration for appointment of those persons whose names have been recommended to the Minister.  There is no reference currently in section 46 to the Government having to consider those names in the order in which they have been ranked.  This seems to be an omission given the reference in section 40(2) to persons being "ranked in the order of the Commission&rsquo;s preference" and an identical reference in section 41(2).  While this may seem a somewhat technical point, as the Minister is well aware, every critique or criticism of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, and the current judicial appointments process has tended to refer to the flaw that JAAB recommendations are not currently ranked and, as a result, a group of names may be submitted to the Government for consideration.  It would be preferable if JAAB were to rank the names, thus making the shortlisting process more real in the same way that we rank at interviews and so on.</p></speech>

The reason I have singled out this amendment is that it is somewhat different from the other amendments in this group.  I will speak more generally about the gender balance considerations in the other amendments when I have explained the reasons we tabled amendment No. 92.  We did not do so to change the nature of the Bill but to strengthen the provisions of sections 40(2) and 41(2), both of which require the commission to rank the names of those it recommends in order of preference.  There appears to be a gap or an anomaly in the Bill because whereas sections 40 and 41 include a requirement for ranking, the Government is not required to consider for appointment in the order of the commission's preference when the recommendations come to it, as provided for in section 46.  Amendment No. 92 simply strengthens what is already contained by way of a principle in the earlier sections.  The amendment is related to the other amendments because it concerns how the commission is to make its shortlist.  However, it differs from them in that it refers not to gender balance but to the issue of ranking in order of preference.</p><p>Some argument has been made by Jennifer Carroll MacNeill and others that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board could have ranked applicants before now but had not done so.  One of the strengths of the Bill is that it requires ranking in sections 40 and 41.  The new body will have strengthened powers in the sense that it will be required to rank applicants rather than only having the power to do so.  That will strengthen the position of the commission because it makes the process more real and similar to other interviews.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 86, 87, 91 and 93 refer to the important policy objective of achieving a balanced Judiciary, in particular that the Judiciary should represent the balance of women and of men.  I table these amendments as the author, some years ago, of the first and only major study of gender in the legal professions in Ireland, which I conducted with my colleagues, Eileen Drew and Cathryn Costello in Trinity College Dublin.  The study, which published in 2003 under the title <i>Gender inJustice</i>, examined the issue of gender balance in the Judiciary.  We took note of processes that were being implemented in other jurisdictions to try to encourage more women to seek promotion to the Judiciary and to ensure more women were appointed to the Judiciary.  We noted at the time that Ireland was not the worst among common law countries in terms of the proportion of women in the Judiciary.  From memory, I believe the proportion here stood at between 20% and 25% at the time.  Ireland now leads in terms of gender balance in the Judiciary.  I am conscious that two appointments made to the High Court last week slightly skewed my figures because I had looked at the data beforehand.  I understand women now make up 37% of the Judiciary, that is, the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.  Women make up three out of eight judges in the Supreme Court, which is 38%, and 50% of the Court of Appeal, which is the highest proportion.  That is much better than we see in comparable common law jurisdictions but it is still not as good as in some civil law jurisdictions where there are career judges and a different method of appointment.</p><p>I will not dwell on the difference between the legal systems.  Women make up 51% of the population and in recent years, as the Minister will be well aware, more women than men have qualified as solicitors and women have joined the Bar in much larger numbers than before.  It is important that we at least sustain a figure of 37% or 38% of our Judiciary being female.  For this reason, it is important to place that in our legislation when we are reforming judicial appointment processes.  The Minister will see that the provisions have been drafted in such a way to be gender neutral in the same way that our legislation on the gender quota in politics is gender neutral.  The section of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012, which provided for a gender quota for political parties is also framed in a gender neutral fashion.  It requires parties to select at least 30% of their candidates of each gender.  We saw the difference that legislation made in the 2016 general election when the proportion of women Deputies increased significantly from 14% to 20%.</p><p>It is very important that we are proactive when it comes to our commitment to ensuring gender equality and gender balance.  It is in that spirit that my colleagues and I put forward these amendments.  They build on the work that has already been done in terms of research and on the policy objective framed in the political funding legislation.  They also build on the very good work done on ensuring greater gender balance in the Judiciary.  I have outlined the figures.  The increase since my colleagues and I compiled our study in 2003 is very welcome but we need to ensure it is sustained and we have a diverse Judiciary generally. </p></speech>

However, probably more significant in terms of the judgments delivered and the appearance of equity in the courts would be to make clear that there should be representation from the less advantaged social groups in society.  In my view, having spent a number of years, for one reason or another, viewing proceedings in the District Court, is that there very often was a clear sense, as far as I was concerned, of class justice.</p> <p>I question the grammar of amendment No. 86 which reads: "In page 28, line 22, after "persons," to insert "at least one of whom must be of each gender"."  That line seems unnecessarily to favour bisexuality or gender fluidity.  I wonder if it could be rearranged some way because one person having to be of each gender would be a little bit awkward in the fitting of the gowns and matters like that.</p> <p>With regard to the question of ranked recommendations, I am not as enthusiastic about it as my colleague, Senator Bacik.  When names are ranked as one, two and three the natural presumption is that number one is the favourite, number two is the second favourite and number three is the third choice.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It seems to me to be a further attempt to tie the Government's hands.

I want to briefly respond to Senator Norris's point.  I would obviously bow to Senator Norris in matters of English grammar and I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 86 in any case to see if I can draft it a little more elegantly so I apologise for that.</p> <p>None of these provisions ties hands in terms of gender balance but in the same way as our 2012 political quota legislation, they are simply opportunity quotas that seek to ensure that more women will be put forward as candidates but not to determine who will ultimately be selected as candidates.</p> <p>On ranking, we will agree to differ but it has been suggested by those who have been critical of the current Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, process and who want to move away from political patronage because ranking ensures that there is a clearer indication from the external independent body as to who are the most meritorious candidates.</p></speech>

I will explain why.  Section 7(1) states: &quot;A decision to recommend, under this Act, a person for appointment to judicial office shall be based on merit.&quot;  Section 7(2) states:</p><blockquote>Subject to <i>subsection (1)</i>, where the function, under this Act, of selecting and recommending persons for appointment to a judicial office falls to be performed, regard shall be had to - (a) the objective that the membership of the judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women,&quot;.</blockquote> <p>The subsection goes on to say that it should reflect diversity and, third, should make provision for people with the Irish language.  As I understand the Bill, its policy is that the commission must operate on the basis of merit, but while considering people from that point of view, it shall have regard to the objective that the membership of the Judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women.  That is a simple intellectual exercise.  The overriding rule is merit, therefore the three best people are always recommended.  However, in looking at whether people are best or not regard should be had to the objective that the membership of the Judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women.  We are either adhering to section 7 or we are not.</p><p>The first of Senator Bacik's amendments relates to section 40.  That section as it is proposed to be amended would add to the words &quot;the names of 3 persons, ranked in the order of the Commission&rsquo;s preference&quot; an extra phrase, &quot;at least one of whom must be of each gender&quot;.  Now we have a different concept.  Merit is no longer the overriding cardinal principle.  We are saying that even if one arrived at the view that three women were clearly the best, one must throw in a man and delete one of the women to conform with the Bill.  That cannot be right.  Either section 7 or section 40 operates.  The commission is being told that having looked at the available people to be, for example, President of the Circuit Court and having come to the conclusion that the three best qualified are women, it must then grab the emergency brake because Senator Bacik's amendment provides that it must dump one of the women from the shortlist and put a man on it.  Even though they are clearly better, the commission must hunt for the best of the men who applied and put him on the list to satisfy this requirement.</p><p>I fully understand affirmative action and such ideas-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-01-22a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1392" speakername="David Norris" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019012200002#AAA00200"><p>The Senator does not like them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-01-22a.427" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019012200002#AAA00300"><p>-----but the section 7 approach is based on merit, and in making merit-based decisions, there is a desideratum that there should be a balance between men and women in the Judiciary.  However, in this section Senator Bacik is saying that even if the commission comes to the conclusion that three persons of one gender are the best people, it must slam on the brakes, delete one of them and add a person of the other gender.  She is going too far.  It is not something I could support, and it is not something we should impose on the commission or the Government in such circumstances.  It appears that the Senator is taking and pocketing section 7 as an advance and then seeking to overrule it as well, whereby if there were three people of one gender, notwithstanding the fact there should be balance, the lowest of the three would be knocked off and a person of the other gender would be made available for the Government to choose from.  That is unfair.</p> <p>I have sympathy for the proposition that there should be gender equality in judicial appointments, up to the point of not producing a Judiciary that is not the best that we can do.  My interpretation of section 7 is that the commission should do its best and give us the best judges, but have regard to gender balance as a desideratum.  That is the right solution.  However, the Senator is inviting it to go a stage further whereby if a single gender slate turns up, be it women or men, the commission must delete one person and include a person of the opposite gender to the other two to achieve balance.  I do not think that is what she believes.  If there were three meritorious women, she would be horrified if a man was slapped in just for gender balance.</p></speech>

He wanted to politicise the appointment of the Judiciary in that way and to amend the Constitution to do it, so the Minister should not give me a lecture about this.

This Government has been exemplary in its approach to gender issues concerning judicial appointments without any assistance from the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  One does not need all of this stuff to make good appointments and to appoint good women to the Judiciary.</p> <p>We will go back then to what Senator Bacik is proposing, which is that in addition to what is in section 7(1) which is a merit-based obligation and expressly provides that merit-based decisions must be cognisant of the desirability of gender balance.  That is one thing but Senator Bacik is going one stage further and saying that in addition to that, if one gets three people of the same gender, women or men on a list, one must delete one of them and put somebody whom one did not consider as good as the three recommended in order to satisfy some other criteria.  I am against the proposition so I am against her amendment to section 40.</p> <p>I fully accept that it is well intentioned but in my view it goes too far.  It is unnecessary for the reasons I have mentioned, namely, that merit-based appointments now being made by the Government without any of this paraphernalia are reasonably gender balanced and, second, it requires a clear departure from merit-based decision making to make a token obeisance to gender balancing the shortlist even after the merit-based issues have been taken into account.  I am in favour of merit-based appointments and I am in favour of taking into account the need for a gender balance but I am against the idea of having a 2:1 arrangement for shortlists.  I do not say that critically because I know Senator Bacik wants to rethink her amendments, but I am worried that if one has more than three on a shortlist one might not achieve much by having a proposition that at least one of them shall be a man or one of them shall be a woman.  I am not clear that that is a very good idea.

What Senator Bacik is talking about is gender opportunity quotas and I agree with that.  Sometimes it is about the language we use.  I agree with Senator McDowell that it has to be an appointment on merit alone.  I accept what Senator Bacik says about gender opportunity quotas because that is an important issue but ultimately section 7 refers to the appointment on merit and merit alone and that is important.</p> <p>I wish to comment on what Senator McDowell said.  I will not open up the debate about what is wrong with the current system but as Senator McDowell alluded to, there were 34 appointments to the Judiciary: one appointment to the General Court of the EU; one appointment to the position of Chief Justice; one appointment to the Supreme Court; four appointments to the Court of Appeal; 12 appointments as judges of the High Court; nine appointments of judges to the Circuit Court; and six to the District Court.  They are all judicial appointments or changes within the Judiciary as some of them, already being judges, moved positions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are the facts, though, as printed off today, and that is important.  In addition, I note the Minister's Department ran another advertisement two weeks ago in all the national newspapers again seeking to recruit judges to the various courts and again under the current system.  I am therefore somewhat amazed by all the allegations of filibustering and inappropriateness and all the terrible, objectionable comments being made by one Government Minister on the appointment of the Judiciary.  The Cabinet and the Government have seen fit to endorse 34 appointments, so the system works well.  Given this fact and the advertisement to which I referred, one must ask the question, what is the Government at?  The current system works, the Minister knows it works and no one is saying it does not work.</p><p>Again I make the point that we have been served with distinction by the Judiciary of all the courts.  I think all of us, without exception, can say that.  They have had a tremendous record in serving this State.  This is an important point.  I understand, however, the issue of gender opportunities and quotas.  That should go through every walk of life when it comes to appointments.  I am also conscious, however, that merit must be the ultimate prerequisite for appointment to the Judiciary.</p></speech>

In my initial speech I acknowledged the increase in the number of women serving as judges.  I gave my current count of approximately 37% of our Judiciary being female, which is a huge increase from the time when we did our study some years ago.  It is certainly a very positive sign in my view and, I think, in the view of most people - everyone, I hope.  However, we want to ensure that this gender balance is sustained, and that is the approach we are taking in these amendments.  Section 7 sets out this policy objective and we use the same language in our amendments Nos. 87 and 93, so I do not think anyone can object to these amendments, given that they simply encapsulate the policy objective the Government has already stated in section 7, and in the same terms.  Yes, we seek to go further in amendments Nos. 86 and 91, which, while still providing only for an opportunity quota, state in respect of each clause referring only to three applicants on a shortlist "at least one of whom must be of each gender".  I have already indicated that I wish to withdraw these amendments in any case to look at them again, in particular at the grammatical issue Senator Norris raised.  These amendments, however, simply strengthen the Government's policy objective to have this additional provision included.</p> <p>I have listened to what my colleagues have said about merit and that appointments must be merit-based.  Of course, we all agree with that, but there is a large body of contested literature on what merit means, how we determine it and the criteria we use-----</p></speech>

I know that Senators McDowell and Boyhan will be aware of this.  For a very long time women, and indeed other groups, faced difficulties in this regard.  Senator Norris referred to class bias in the system, which was absolutely a fair comment.  Disadvantaged groups are so called because they face existing disadvantages and there is not an equal playing field.  If a woman applies from a position of disadvantage to a position in which women are under-represented, she is at a disadvantage.  There is not a level playing field to begin with, and speaking about the Holy Grail of an objective system of merit neglects or overlooks this difficulty with the pre-existing disadvantages.  We have written on this before in the case we made in the justice committee in 2009 for gender quotas in politics, which culminated in the 2012 legislation.  In that we talked about the five c's, that is, the disadvantages women face: lack of cash, confidence, childcare, culture and, of particular relevance in the case of politics, candidate selection procedures.  The first four c's also apply to disadvantaged women in terms of career progression in law.  Again, this is documented in our study, in which we did qualitative and quantitative work on gender bias in the legal system - structural biases, not necessarily prejudice.  This is why we need to be careful when we talk about merit.  There is the literature to which I have referred and we are well aware that merit can be a very fluid concept.  It is not a fixed or predetermined concept, and we must take account of pre-existing disadvantage.  It is in this spirit that we table these amendments.</p> <p>I have very much supported the Minister's Government in the affirmative action measures, such as the women-only professorships the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, has proposed.  They are sensible ways in which to address an existing gender imbalance.  Our amendments, taken as a package, seek to do the same thing for the Judiciary, that is, to ensure there is a sustained gender balance in the Judiciary and that this objective is front and centre throughout the legislation, not just in section 7.  It is in this spirit that we table the amendments, but I will withdraw them at this Stage.  I do want the opportunity to debate this further on Report Stage because I am keen to ensure we have a wording on which I might get more support from colleagues on both sides, so I will bring the amendments back on Report Stage but I am glad to have had the opportunity to debate them at this Stage.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 86b reads: &quot;No provision of this Act affects in any way the function and duty of the Government, in advising the President on appointment to judicial office under Article 35 of the Constitution, to advise in accordance with its own judgment and preference the appointment of any person who is eligible to be appointed to such judicial office.&rdquo;.To me, that is the important point.  As I have pointed out on a couple of occasions in the course of this debate, the policy of this Bill is to make it extremely difficult for the Government to fail to appoint somebody nominated in a shortlist compiled by the judicial appointments commission.  The means whereby which this created difficulty is sought to be created are manifold, but the most obvious ones are as follows.  First, every current serving judge who is of the superior courts who is, by definition, capable of serving as a member of the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, if asked by the President of either of those courts, is required to submit his or her name for consideration and to be shortlisted by the judicial appointments commission no matter how often these vacancies arise.  The Minister has made it clear in voting down a previous amendment which I have tendered, that he intends that it will not be possible in future for members of the Judiciary to indicate their willingness to serve by a simple letter to the Secretary of the Government, which is the current practice, without any further requirement of recommendation.  For instance, if the position of President of the Court of Appeal or the position of Chief Justice becomes available, that instead of having all the Judiciary engage in a beauty contest by sending in applications to the judicial appointments commission, what happens at the moment is that they can simply indicate that they would be prepared to be appointed to the office without more writing to the Secretary of the Government who is an independent officer of the State who, presumably, would notify the Government that he had received such a communication.  That is dignified, reasonable and sensible.  The Minister has indicated that that is to be prohibited under the canvassing rubric and under the other provisions of this Bill, and is not to continue, which I think is a mistake.</p><p>I will only briefly refer to it but the second way in which the Government is to be prevented from appointing somebody other than a person recommended is to keep it in darkest ignorance as to what choices were made.  I will make two observations about.  First, it is entitled to know who is available and willing to be appointed.  To say that the Government has a full constitutional prerogative to appoint anybody it wants, as section 40(3) suggests it might, while it is kept in a state of complete ignorance as to what the real potential field of appointees is actually constituted is to render the exercise of that constitutional prerogative very difficult.</p><p>The third thing is that the Attorney General, by being appointed to the commission, by taking part in its proceedings and by knowing who applied and who was not shortlisted, is placed in the most invidious position.  The Cabinet may ask, &quot;Is this the best we can do?&quot;  If that question is asked, the Attorney General must say that he or she cannot answer that question, although he or she would like to be able to tell the Cabinet that there were other people who, in his or her judgment and perhaps in the judgement of the Cabinet if it was to hear about it, would be far better than the shortlisted people.  That, unfortunately, is part of the new Bill, as the Minister has confirmed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister has indicated that he is with me on the two amendments that I have tabled.  The Bill as it currently stands would make it extremely embarrassing for the Government to exercise its own prerogative by requiring it to fill out some kind of exam paper as to why it departed from the recommendation it received.  </p><p>Lastly, there is the difficulty that it undermines the whole status of the judicial independence of our senior Judiciary to require them to constantly make applications to this judicial appointments commission for every vacancy that arises or every consequential vacancy that is created by the filling of a vacancy.  The Minister has failed completely to tell us how they will be informed if they were shortlisted.  He has also failed to tell us how it will be known that somebody was shortlisted but was unsuccessful at Cabinet.  If these things are to be kept in the dark, the Government is like the crew of a submarine, operating below the surface but without any effective periscope.</p></speech>

The amendment goes on to provide that, in advising the President on appointment to judicial office under Article 35 of the Constitution, the Government will &quot;advise in accordance with its own judgment&quot;.  That must be the case.  It must be the Government's judgment, based on its duty to do the right thing by the people and not to be shoehorned by a series of legislative obstacle courses and hedges into doing something with which it is not comfortable.  The appointment of any person who is eligible to be appointed to judicial office must be done in accordance with the Government's own judgment and preference.  That formulation in our proposed new section spells out the constitutional provision or position, 100%, whereas the conflation of mistaken and chaotic procedures and provisions keeping the Government in the dark, which this Bill now contains, is designed to do the opposite.  It is designed to get the Government to defer to the views of this commission because difficulties lie in the way of following its own instinct and judgment in accordance with its constitutional duty.</p><p>I do not believe that the lines proposed to be deleted save this Bill from unconstitutionality because of the other measures in the Bill to which I have referred.  I also do not believe it is right to ask sitting members of the Judiciary to spend of half of their lives sending off applications to a group of people who cannot signify to the unsuccessful applicants what it was about their application that was unsatisfactory.  In fact, that would be even worse.  Even if there were to be some kind of feedback system for dissatisfied judges, in terms of the commission not liking their approach to A and B, for example, are such judges to change their tune in order to send in a more appealing form the next time, emphasising something about themselves or deleting some view that they may have conveyed, by innuendo, to their detriment on the previous occasion?  That is all very wrong for serving members of the Judiciary because it compromises their independence.</p><p>When it comes to appointing judges, one might well say that one is not going to appoint Ms or Mr. Justice So-and-So because when it comes to personal injuries damages, they behave like Santa Claus or the exact opposite, that they are so mean that one does not want them on the Bench.  That is something that the Government might well decide but it is not a decision, under the criteria set out in this Bill, for the commission.  The judicial policy of a judge is a matter of huge interest to the Government on occasion and in particular, with regard to the Supreme Court.  The general stance, outlook and predisposition of a judge on social and legal issues and jurisprudential matters may be of serious concern and are very serious and totally justified criteria on which to judge an individual's suitability for appointment to the Supreme Court.  A person could be highly intelligent but quite reactionary, for example.  He or she may have served on the High Court for the past five or seven years and demonstrated that this is the kind of judge he or she is but the Government may decide, so be it, the judge is independent and as long as he or she is not behaving in a manner which would warrant his or her removal, it is stuck with that judge.  That is what the independence of the Judiciary is all about.  <i>F&igrave;at j&ucirc;stitia ruat c&aelig;lum.</i></p><p><i></i>However, if it comes to an appointment to the Supreme Court, one can bet one's bottom dollar that any Government worth its salt would look at a person who, by virtue of his or her judicial record, has been of one predisposition or another and ask itself if he or she is the kind of person it needs on the Supreme Court.  It might well be that the Government decides to put the legal contrarian onto the Supreme Court to balance up the attitude of other members but that is a decision for the Government to make.  This is a hugely important criterion for an appointment to the Supreme Court but it is one which the commission envisioned by this Bill may not broach.  The commission, which has a lay majority, cannot start evaluating judges by reference to their judicial record.  If the commission is asked to make a shortlist of three for a vacancy on the Supreme Court, it cannot ask Mr. Justice Boyhan, for example, why he decided four cases in a particular way before shortlisting him.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It cannot ask: "Why did you decide them in the way you did?  We find that slightly perplexing."  The Cabinet, behind closed doors, listening to the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice and Equality and making up its own mind collectively, can say; "To be honest, we prefer to appoint somebody else."  That is perfectly right and, by the way, it has happened and I hope to God it will happen in the future.  The Supreme Court is the interpretative court of the Constitution and this, by its very nature, affects the complexion of that court, its weight and balance and, to some extent, its direction.  Those are issues on which the Government is not merely accountable but has a duty to apply its own judgment, and to make the appointment as appropriate.  I am convinced, therefore, that the idea of putting a statutory body, which cannot take those matters into account, and will not be doing so, in a position where it can provide a shortlist to the Government and keep the Government in the dark as to the people it excluded in composing that shortlist, is a knife at the heart of constitutionality.  It is wrong, and it is wrong in principle.</p><p>The Minister may think the existing subsection in section 41 preserves that right of the Government but it is hedged around all sorts of other statutory obstacles to make it difficult for the Government to exercise its own constitutional function in judging the merits and demerits of all who are eligible for a position.  He may think it may save the day but my guess is that if this matter comes to be seen in its entirety, especially in the context that every senior judicial appointment and consequential vacancy appointment has to be the subject of this procedure, it is deeply suspect from a constitutional point of view.</p><p>I notice that a very strange situation is later provided for.  I do not want to be disorderly or to stray into subsequent sections too deeply but it is relevant to the consideration of this point.  One of the weirdest aspects is that if the commission decides it does not want to make a recommendation at all, a process of re-advertising the position has to be engaged in as a mandatory step.  It is not that the Government at that stage is free to ignore the situation; it must cause the commission to re-advertise a vacancy for which it has made no recommendation.</p><p>I hope that in making these comments, even at this late stage, I can convince the Minister that the Bill needs the proposed revision of section 41 to be inserted and the deletion of section 40(3), which is a tattered, fraying, shrivelled fig leaf that does not preserve the constitutionality of this legislation.</p></speech>

I am not satisfied, nor have I been convinced, that the deletion of section 40(3) improves the situation in any way.  I remind Senators that the subsection was included by way of ministerial amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It was brought forward to reflect a measure of concern on the matter of the constitutional function, as has been addressed by the Senator for some time now.</p><p>The insertion of the subsection underscores, if not copper-fastens, the position in law.  I reflected on and sought advice on the matter and I believe it is important that it specifically be inserted.  Notwithstanding what the Senator said, I maintain that the order of preference, as mentioned earlier and as mentioned by Senators throughout this debate, would not limit the advice the Government will ultimately convey to the President under the Constitution, and it is important that we specifically state that in the legislation.  I am happy, notwithstanding anything I have heard, to maintain my position that any ranking or order of merit of persons who may be recommended for appointment to office, and which may be submitted to Government, may interfere with and unlawfully fetter the discretion of the Government, as the Executive, to appoint a qualified person.  I do not accept that the order of preference, the ranking or the recommendation could in any way be construed as being binding on a Government in a way that is contrary to the Constitution.  We have had this time and again during the debate, namely, the anxiety on the part of Government to ensure that in no way is the constitutional position adversely interfered with.</p><p>I reiterate that I continue to listen carefully to the concerns of Senators.  Despite what Senator Norris might think, I have listened carefully to the points he and others have made-----</p></speech>

I do not want to minimise any of these concerns.  They are, in short, the constraints on what an Attorney General might say or do and the concerns about what the Government may be told or knows, or is not told, in certain circumstances, or what it may not know, given the various interactions of key provisions of the legislation.  There are the concerns we have discussed on other amendments about serving senior judges being required in any way to enter what is a selection process and having this expressed in the Bill.  Of course, I am concerned to ensure that nothing in the Bill in any way interferes with the constitutional position.</p><p>Let me say yet again that I am amenable to addressing the concerns that have been raised in the House, if that is the objective of amendment No. 86<i>b</i>, which I feel it is.  I will come back on Report Stage to deal with some of the concerns.  I cannot commit to dealing with all of the concerns, particularly those expressed this evening.  However, in short, I have listened carefully, particularly in regard to the role, words and deeds of the Attorney General, and what the Attorney General may or may not say and can or cannot do.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will come back to that on Report Stage in a way that, I hope, will allow us to progress the Bill.</p></speech>

The Minister should remember something.  He pointed out that this has been a long debate and that these matters have been raised before.  Like me or any other Senator, he has been in a position to table additional amendments to cater for these issues in order that we might discuss them on Committee Stage.  He has preferred to follow a different rubric, namely, to keep his powder entirely dry, just listen to the debate and not deal with these issues - if he does have concerns about them - until Report Stage.  I fully know and accept that it is open to the House to recommit any substantial amendment on Report Stage.  One of the disadvantages of Report Stage is that if that is not done, the debate is effectively guillotined to one contribution of a limited kind from each speaker.  As a result, the dialogue that would be necessary to consider some of these issues is simply not going to happen in the way it should unless the Bill is recommitted in respect of the relevant amendments on Report Stage.  I do not want to anticipate the individual instances in which that may be appropriate or inappropriate.  It would be a lot more satisfactory to someone in my situation if I got a clear indication of what the Minister means by the language he just used.  If he has concerns about the role of the Attorney General, can he share them with us?  I am blue in the face banging on about them and now we have a situation in which the Minister has gone on record and stated that he appears to understand my concerns to some extent and that he is thinking about addressing them.  Surely, particularly as this debate has gone on and on, we should hear now about these proposals to amend the legislation to deal with these matters.</p></speech>

What really worries me is that although the Minister might be disposed to making amendments to deal with some of the issues I have raised, the first debate is going to take place in the august Cabinet room where, thus far, there is at least one person who appears to believe that the points being made along these lines are being made in bad faith and solely for the purpose of perpetuating cronyism, etc.  I really would like to deal with the specifics the Minister to which the Minister referred.  I would like to know if he accepts that there is a problem with criminalising the Attorney General if he or she reveals the identities of unsuccessful applicants.  Is that what I am to interpret from what he said?  Is that the advice he is receiving?  If that is the case, fine.  However, as the Minister pointed out, it is taking a very long time for that to be admitted.</p></speech>

I rose earlier in response to the Leas-Chathaoirleach's invitation in order to be helpful.  What has happened now is that Senator McDowell has gone far beyond what I said.  I recognised that there are concerns and listened to what Senators outlined as their concerns.  I am reflecting on these.  I have not stated that there is a problem.  I have not stated that I share Senators' concerns.  What I am anxious to do is bring forward legislation that can have the assent of the majority of this House having regard to the concerns of Senators.  I am not going to change the Bill to accord with the points that Senator McDowell has been making for the past number of weeks.  I have listened carefully to the concerns and I will reflect on them.  I have been doing so during the course of this debate.  I have not received any advice to the effect that there is a problem.  What I am doing is merely acknowledging concerns.  I will seek - as indeed is the norm - a period of reflection prior to Report Stage.  That is why we have particular Stages.  I am not conceding that there is a difficulty.  It would be unfair of Senators to suggest that I have done so.</p></speech>

This is the first occasion upon which I have acknowledged the existence of the concerns which he has repeatedly conveyed on the role, function and status of the Attorney General.

I welcome that.  The Attorney General is just one matter.  If the Attorney General is to be made free to provide the Government with details of the entire list of runners in the case with a view to giving advice as to whether, over a number of shortlists which the Government may receive, say, for the High Court or the Court of Appeal, there was a worry or dissatisfaction on the part of the Attorney General with the outcome of decisions made by the commission, then some balance would be restored because the Government would have a clearer view of the issues with which it is being asked to deal.  I would welcome the restoration of a degree of balance in that regard.  There are other issues I have raised and we will see about them as well.  The Minister stated that he understands the point I am making and that he is open to considering it.  That is one thing but he is very quick to indicated that he does not see that it is wrong to say that he perceives a problem with the current consequences of criminalising the Attorney General.
