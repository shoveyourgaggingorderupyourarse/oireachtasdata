    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-01-22a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1376" speakername="Lorraine Clifford Lee" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019012200002#B00400"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I wish to talk again about St. Joseph's secondary school in Rush.  The Minister will recall that I had a Commencement matter on 6 November last on the urgent need to provide temporary accommodation and he announced that day that the application had been approved.  We spoke then about the need for a permanent new school building for St. Joseph's in Rush.  I wish to remind the Minister that St Joseph's is a school with 1,000 pupils and it is the only secondary school in the town of Rush.  Rush and all the towns in north county Dublin are expanding rapidly.  It is the fastest growing part of the country with the youngest population.  Obviously, there is a very strong demand there for primary and post-primary school places.</p> <p>The capacity issue needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The Minister approved four prefabricated buildings at that time because there was a crisis.  There are 102 students on the waiting list for places in September 2019 who could not be offered places.  Thankfully, that issue has been resolved.  I mentioned at the time that there was no extra capacity to expand in the school.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Enrolments in the primary schools in the town of Rush had indicated a similar demand for places next year and into the future.  At that time, the Minister said he was actively pursuing a site for the school.  St. Joseph's has an excellent reputation in Rush and beyond.  Its principal, Ms Patricia Hayden, and the teaching staff in the school do an excellent job.  It is a DEIS school and it is linked into the Trinity access programme.  There is 100% progression to third level and apprenticeships from the school, which the Minister will agree is exceptional.  This year, the school had six entries in the BT Young Scientist exhibition.  As there was only one other school in the country with a higher number of entries, that is an exceptional record, particularly when one considers that the school does not have sufficient science laboratories.  All credit must go to the principal, the teaching staff and all the other staff in the school and, of course, the commitment of the parents to the school.  </p><p>The young people of Rush want to be educated in this school.  They demand to be educated in it, but capacity makes that very difficult.  It is worth noting that secondary schools in the neighbouring towns of Lusk and Skerries are also experiencing capacity issues and as such they will not be able to accept any overflow of students from Rush.  On 6 November last the Minister said that a site was being acquired.  However, when my colleague, Councillor Brian Dennehy, a Fingal county councillor who lives in Rush and whose children attend St. Joseph's, tabled a motion on the matter to Fingal County Council on 8 November, he was told by a senior official of the council that there was no instruction from the Department of Education and Skills to acquire a site.  As I understand it, this remains the position.  We were all dismayed with the response received to Councillor Dennehy's motion because we had been led to believe that this announcement was imminent.  There has been land zoned in the town for the school for ten years.  Following on from the work of Councillor Brian Dennehy in Rush, upgrading works on the Park Road are due to commence imminently, which will allow for access to that site.  When will the Minister issue a request to Fingal County Council to acquire this site and when will construction on the new school commence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-01-22a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019012200002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it allows me the opportunity to clarify the position in respect of St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school, Rush, County Dublin.  I acknowledge that my colleague, Senator James Reilly, has kept me up to speed on this issue.  The school is currently located at Convent Lane, Rush and consists of a number of buildings, some permanent accommodation and others prefabricated accommodation.  The site is limited for development due to its size and location in the centre of the village in a settled residential area and it was determined that a new site was required to facilitate provision of sufficient permanent accommodation for the school.</p> <p>The school&rsquo;s trustees recently confirmed to my Department that they are not in a position to provide a site to accommodate a new school building.  Following on from this, officials of my Department have requested the assistance of officials in Fingal County Council in procuring a site for the school under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of school sites.  Under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of school sites, local authorities assist my Department with the process of identifying and acquiring sites for the development of school accommodation.  The first step in this process is the identification of suitable sites by the local authorities.  The identified sites are then technically assessed on a joint basis by officials from the local authorities and my Department's professional and technical staff.</p> <p>Senator Clifford-Lee will appreciate the importance of a thorough appraisal of site options at this point to ensure the achievement of value for money and to minimise the potential of any issues arising during the planning and development stages.  The relevant local area plan provides for the location of a post-primary school site in the Kenure area of Rush.  My Department understands that this site was reserved by Fingal County Council on foot of representations made on behalf of St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school.  Access issues have to date inhibited the potential development of this site but Fingal County Council is currently working to deliver a new roadway which would facilitate such development.  Engagement between my officials and council officials in respect of the potential acquisition of this site is currently ongoing.  It is difficult to indicate a timeline for the completion of the acquisition of a site for the school in question as it is dependent on the outcome of current negotiations and also on the complexity of the conveyancing process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Once a site has been acquired the project can progress to architectural planning.  </p><p>I assure the Senator, however, that my Department is cognisant of the school's current accommodation constraints.  The Department received an application for temporary accommodation from the school.  Subsequently, it issued approval, in principle, to the board of management for the rental of two science laboratories - one being a technical graphics or design communication graphics room and one general classroom, as an interim measure, pending delivery of the permanent school building.   The responsibility for the installation of this accommodation has been devolved to the school authority for delivery.</p><p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir faoi choinne an tseans labhairt leis an Seanad inniu ar an t-&aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.</p></speech>

We have been led to believe that acquisition was imminent.  Fingal County Council require a direction from the Minister and his Department to acquire the site.  The site has been zoned for ten years so it has been sitting there.  The access issues have been resolved.  The upgrade of the park road is imminent and should be completed by the end of the second quarter of this year.  There is no reason the Minister cannot issue the instruction to acquire the site.  It is not good enough for him to come in here and say engagement is "ongoing" and claim there are complex conveyancing reasons.  This is completely unacceptable.  We have been led to believe by plenty of local representatives that this project is a done deal, there will be a new school and the devil and all will be done.  It is clear from the Minister's reply that the acquisition is not imminent.  It is an absolute disgrace that children in Rush are on this site without a playing pitch, a library and with inadequate science and woodwork rooms.  There is simply a capacity issue.  Next year there will not be any room.  There is no room for any further prefabs on this site.  There will be great anger in Rush when people realise that the Minister is not even on the verge of issuing the instruction to acquire the site.</p></speech>

I do not issue instructions to buy a preferred site.  There is a memorandum of understanding, which is an engagement between the local authority, not just Fingal County Council but all local authorities, and the Department of Education and Skills.  As part of that process, there is a communication between Department officials and Fingal County Council to ensure that a number of preferred sites are put on the table.  It is up to them to ensure the communication is open and transparent.  The Senator stated that a county councillor said that there is no engagement going on between officials-----</p></speech>

I am sure the Cathaoirleach has had experience of this as well.  I am seeking definite clarification and, if necessary, a circular should be sent to local authorities on the exact intention of this when the Minister put it forward.  When he came before the House previously, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, stated what it should be.  It should not compound the issue for people who are justifiably applying for planning permission and able to get it.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say in clarification.</p></speech>

It is fair to state, however, that rural housing has been a major issue for 20 years, not least in the Senator's area of north Kildare.  I will outline the position from the perspective of the recently announced national planning framework, NPF.  The latter was published in 2018 and it sets out the overarching strategic planning approach underpinning the sustainable development of both urban and rural areas in the period to 2040.  To articulate the broad content of the NPF in clear and understandable terms, the framework contains national planning objectives to guide and inform the planning process.</p> <p>National policy objective 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas.  It seeks to encourage growth and arrest decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or population decline in recent decades, while also highlighting the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns that are under strong urban influence and under pressure from unco-ordinated and ribbon-type development in order to avoid overdevelopment of those areas.  Some of that took place in the past, particularly in areas close to large urban centres.  This is supplemented by national policy objective 19, which points to the need to ensure that in providing that rural communities meet housing requirements a policy distinction should be made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchments of cities, towns and centres of employment, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low, declining or both.</p> <p>In the context of weaker rural areas, objective 19 provides that the determination of planning applications for single houses in the countryside should be based on general siting and design-based criteria for rural housing in statutory guidelines and plans, having regard to the viability of smaller towns and rural settlements.  These criteria include matters such as landscape, vehicular access and wastewater disposal.  On the other hand, where development pressures and the risk of haphazard development in the vicinity of larger urban centres as designated in local authority development plans are evident, objective 19 advises that it is reasonable that the determination of applications for housing in such rural areas should be informed by considerations beyond the siting and design criteria for rural housing contained in statutory guidelines and plans.  In particular, account should be taken of whether there is a demonstrable functional requirement for such housing in social, economic or occupational terms and whether such development, of itself or in combination with existing and permitted development, would lead to detrimental haphazard and unco-ordinated development.</p> <p>These objectives represent a balanced approach, consistent with long-standing Government policies on sustainable development and previous planning guidelines issued in 2005 under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act.  Planning authorities are required to have regard to these guidelines on sustainable rural housing in the framing of planning policies in their development plans and in the assessment of individual planning applications for rural housing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Under the 2005 guidelines, planning authorities are required to adopt a balanced approach to ensure the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing and haphazard development, particularly in the areas we have mentioned.  Accordingly, the objectives of the national planning framework are aligned with the approach that is already expected of planning authorities under the current guidelines.</p><p>Arising from a European Court of Justice ruling in the Flemish decree case, which is of relevance to the local needs criterion, the 2005 guidelines are being reviewed by a working group comprising officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and representatives of planning authorities nominated by the local government sector.  It is likely that many of the planning applications referred to by the Senator fall into the categories of the local needs criterion or the 2005 guidelines.  The Flemish decree, which linked the sale or transfer of property in certain Flemish communes with the condition that there should exist a sufficient connection between the prospective property buyer and the relevant commune, was ultimately and perhaps not surprisingly deemed by the European Court of Justice to be in breach of Article 43 of the treaty on the freedom of movement of citizens.  Following engagement between the Department and the European Commission further to the case, and subject to the completion of the working group's ongoing deliberations, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government expects to be in a position shortly to finalise and issue planning authorities with revisions to the 2005 rural housing guidelines that take account of the judgment in the Flemish decree case.</p><p>From my perspective, I will certainly talk to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  It is not unreasonable for someone who grew up in a rural area and has lived there all for all of his or her life to expect to be able to continue living in that community.  Obviously, that depends on other important factors like the design of the house, the availability of wastewater treatment, access and the extent to which development has already taken place in the area.  I am aware of some of the inconsistencies about which the Senator has spoken.  To answer his question directly, the ultimate objective is that the revised guidelines will be circulated to each local authority as soon as they are finalised to ensure there is a uniform approach to the national planning framework when it comes to individual decisions at local authority level.  In my distinct role in charge of local government, I must emphasise that each local authority is an independent republic.  It is a bit of an oxymoron to be the Minister of State with responsibility for local government, given that local authorities - quite rightly - jealously guard their own independence, such as they have it.  It is not unreasonable to think the new guidelines should be completed as soon as possible and circulated to ensure there is a uniform approach across the country.</p></speech>

In the case of virtually every application for planning permission for a one-off house that has been refused in County Kildare since 1 November last, objective 19 of the national planning framework has been quoted as part of the refusal.  There is no clarity with regard to objective 19, which refers to "economic or social need".  It has been interpreted as meaning "social and economic need".  The Minister of State added another consideration to the list when he referred to "social, economic or occupational terms".  This will confuse things further.  We want clarity so that people can go by their local county development plans.  Something from higher up should not be dictating what should and should not happen.  It is unfortunate that planners, particularly in County Kildare, are taking objective 19 of the national planning framework on board as a greater priority than their own local county development plan, which was put in place by councillors at local level.</p></speech>

If there is an issue with the development plan in County Kildare, it is open to the councillors in the county to amend it.  I understand what the Senator is saying about objective 19.  By the way, I do not see how the use of the word "occupational" complicates things.  It is quite clear that in the case of someone like a farmer who has an obvious reason to be building in the countryside, that is surely a clarification of things, if anything.</p></speech>

The previous Government accepted this recommendation and, in July 2013, Deputy Enda Kenny announced plans to hold this referendum.  By January 2015, those plans were abandoned by that Government.  In September 2017, the current Government revived this commitment when it announced an indicative timetable of referenda to be held, which included lowering the voting age to 16, to be held in May or June 2019.  As of last month, the Government appeared to have abandoned those plans to facilitate this referendum by stating that it is not within its plans to hold the referendum in 2019.  One has to presume that unless Fine Gael's coalition with Fianna F&aacute;il is formalised, the confidence and supply agreement will end soon after 2019 and, therefore, we will not see this referendum in this Government's term.</p> <p>If I am honest, I have become cynical about Fine Gael's willingness to re-examine the voting age.  We brought forward legislation in this House that would have lowered the voting age in local and European elections and the Government froze it on Second Stage for six months, stating that more time was needed to examine that proposal.  We sought to engage with Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il constructively, but we were stonewalled in those efforts.  When the legislation returned nine months later, Fine Gael chose to oppose it section by section, stating that a referendum on the matter would be held and that it would, therefore, be premature to extend voting rights in certain elections when we did not have the consent of the people to extend voting rights in all elections.  I do not know why it took nine months for the penny to drop.  We are now in a situation where Government has not only failed to facilitate this referendum, but has also opposed others in their efforts to reduce the voting age through legislative change.  It is time to allow young people to have their say in matters that affect their lives.  We will all reap the reward and we will all profit from their inclusion.</p> <p>We are looking for clarity today on whether a referendum can be held within the lifetime of this Government.  Has that potential been explored?  Has the Government considered holding the referendum on the same day as a general election?  If the Minister of State cannot give any further indication as to when this referendum will be scheduled, will he concede that his Government has failed on its commitment to young people and will he give reasons why a referendum that has been sitting on the agenda for six years has failed to come to fruition?</p></speech>

This is at least the second time that we have had this discussion on Commencement Matters.  I acknowledge that the Senator and other Members are strong advocates for a reduction in the voting age to 16, which was recommended by the report of the Constitutional Convention in 2013, as the Senator pointed out.</p> <p>The convention examined this issue extensively and during its deliberations, three ballots took place to inform its proposals in the matter.  In the first ballot, there was a small majority, 52%, in favour of the proposal that the voting age be reduced.  In the second ballot, the members were asked to consider whether to reduce the voting age to either 17 years or to 16 years and the stronger support was for the latter reduction, 48% supported a reduction to 16 while 39% were in favour of a reduction to 17 and 14% expressed no opinion.  A third ballot was also held on whether the voting age should be reduced for some types of elections only, for example, local elections.  The overwhelming view of the convention did not support a reduction in the voting age for specific types of elections only, which is why the Government opposed the Bill to which the Senator referred.  Some 68% of the members of the Constitutional Convention, which was by far the widest margin in a vote on any of these matters, said that there should be no difference between voting ages.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not think it was too controversial a position for the Government to have adopted when that Bill was being considered.</p><p>In line with the majority opinion of its members, the First Report of the Convention on the Constitution contained a recommendation to the effect that a referendum be held in order to amend the Constitution to reduce the voting age to 16 for all elections.  Against this background, on 26 September 2017 the Government announced an indicative timetable for the holding of a number of referendums that came from the work of both the Citizens' Assembly and the convention.  Included in that indicative timetable was the referendum on reducing the voting age to 16, which, subject to the timely passage of a Constitution Amendment Bill by each House of the Oireachtas, was to be held on the date of the local and European elections scheduled to take place in late May 2019.  The forthcoming European Parliament elections must be held in all member states between 23 and 26 May next.  Two further referendums were also to be held on the same date as the local and European elections.</p><p>The Department is responsible for the development of the necessary constitutional (amendment) Bill in respect of reducing the voting age to 16.  On a related matter, it will also be responsible for bringing forward appropriate amending legislation regarding extending the franchise at presidential elections to Irish citizens' resident outside the State.  These referendums, when held, will address two of the recommendations of the Convention on the Constitution.  If passed, these amendments to the Constitution would give rise to the need for supplementary amendments to the Electoral Acts in order to address the practical considerations that would arise.  However, at its meeting on 4 December 2018, the Government reviewed further the progress on the overall programme of Bills to amend the Constitution.  Having regard to other referendums proposed to be progressed in the short term and having particular regard to the heavy legislative programme scheduled for the first half of this year arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the Government agreed that only two referendums will be held in tandem with the local and European elections and that further consideration will have to be given to the timing of a referendum on reducing the voting age to 16.  While the Government remains committed to the holding of a referendum to reduce the voting age to 16 years, it is not proposed that said referendum will be held this year.</p><p>I am sorry that the Senator feels cynical about the Government's position but, as matters stand, people will be obliged to complete two ballot papers for the local and European elections.  With two referendums, there would be two further papers.  There will be several plebiscites at which people will be obliged to complete five ballot papers.  I may be wrong but I do not think that we have ever had an election day when there have been five ballot papers.  The idea that there would be a sixth was actively considered by me and the franchise section and we formed the view that it would be too much.  We also had to be cognisant of the fact that in terms of the preparation of the Bills necessary to hold referendums, there is only certain scope in the Department to continue with them.  Preference was given to the question of those outside the State and whether they would have the right to vote in presidential elections.</p><p>Deputy Adams tabled a Bill in the D&aacute;il which combined voting for citizens overseas and reducing the presidential voting age.  I had a meeting with him in the middle of last year and we discussed several of the issues involved.  He was to revert to me and the Department but never did so.  That is not a sufficient excuse but I would have expected a response within the past eight months to some of the queries that I and the officials raised at our meeting, particularly if he was interested in ensuring that those referendums would be held.  The Government's position is that it wants the referendum to be held but we cannot have a polling day on which people would be given more than five ballot papers.  That is why the decision was made at the end of last year that only two referendums would be held in conjunction with the two elections and the plebiscite.</p></speech>

The Minister of State noted that I and many others in this House are strong advocates for a reduction in the voting age to 16.  Referendums proposed more recently than those recommended by the Convention on the Constitution have somehow leapfrogged this referendum.

The area of Clongriffin and Belmayne is growing in size as is the population.  Renewed plans are frequently put in place for the expansion of that entire community and a population of 50,000 is projected in the coming years.  We are effectively talking about a population on the scale of a large town, if not a small city.  A number of years ago I had a debate in this Chamber with the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, about the need for a new secondary school in that area.  At the time I was told by the Minister that it was not necessary and that the population did not warrant it.  Within 18 months the Department had changed its mind, having looked at the population trends and the projected population, and granted the establishment of a new second level school in that area.  Thankfully, Educate Together is to be awarded patronage and it is to open in September.</p> <p>I make that point purely because we feel a Garda station would benefit policing, security and bring about a sense of community in that community.  There is currently what we might call a Garda clinic which takes place in one of the rooms of the Junction Community Centre in Clongriffin.  On a Saturday, garda&iacute; sign forms, do basic Garda work and are available to assist the community.  An Garda is doing the best it can with the resources it has to serve the community in whatever way it can.  Clearly a Garda presence of that nature is seen to be needed in that area.</p> <p>This area is growing in size.  In the past politicians have been criticised for not engaging in forward planning.  We build residential units but we do not build a community around those residential units to serve them.  I am saying at this early stage that there is a need for a Garda station, just as I said two years ago that there was a need for a new second level school.  The campaigners and I were proven to be correct on that and we managed to be successful in that endeavour.  I know that Government policy has changed over the last number of years, moving away from stationary Garda stations and emphasising the transportation of garda&iacute; in vehicles, on bikes and in cars.  I appreciate that move.  However, given the scale of this community, the size of the population and the number expected to move into that area, at the very least, a positive response from the Minister of State's Department on looking at establishing a Garda station in that area, one that can work with the new communities, give advice to planners on how best to construct new residential entities and with transport links, etc., would be of huge benefit to what I am sure he will accept is a large town, if not effectively a small city, being built on the outskirts of Dublin.</p></speech>

The Minister and I would like to thank the Senator for raising this matter today.  The Senator will be aware that the resources provided by the Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation of &euro;1.76 billion for 2019.  This represents an increase of more than 6% on the initial allocation for 20218.  Very significant capital investment is also being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including investment of more than &euro;242 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021, to enable investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda fleet over the same period, as well as considerable capital investment in addressing the deficiencies in the Garda estate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This investment is in support of the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  However, the Senator will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including responsibility for the formulation of proposals regarding the opening and closing of Garda stations, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  Furthermore, the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.</p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has no direct role in these matters.  He and I are aware that the Senator and some local representatives have suggested that a new Garda station at Clongriffin-Belmayne is required due to population growth and development in the area.  Bearing in mind that it is a matter for the Commissioner to efficiently manage Garda resources, on behalf of the Minister, I can confirm that the Clongriffin-Belmayne area, as referred to by the Senator, is located within the Coolock Garda district.  I also confirm, on behalf of the Minister, that the Garda authorities indicate that the area receives ongoing attention from garda&iacute; assigned to Coolock district.  We further understand that local Garda management in the Dublin metropolitan region north division is aware of issues relating to anti-social behaviour in the locality and, in addition to routine patrols by mobile patrol units, Garda foot patrols and members of community policing units have deployed additional personnel, particularly to specific areas identified as public disorder and anti-social behaviour hotspots, to address this type of criminality.  In addition, the Garda authorities indicate that the community policing unit at Coolock Garda station has ongoing engagement with various residential, commercial and business groups within the community, providing personal security and crime prevention advice at regular meetings throughout the district. </p><p>We understand that Garda management locally has put in place specific initiatives targeting anti-social activities of young drivers, including intelligence-led initiatives, and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with the local authorities to reduce such incidents and opportunities for joyriding, anti-social behaviour and public disorder.  Garda checkpoints to prevent and detect criminality across the districts have resulted in the detection of road traffic offences, the recovery and seizure of firearms, the disruption of the sale and supply of drugs, and the execution of warrants.</p><p>We are informed that monitoring of crime trends and initiating frequent, short-term and varied crime prevention and detection initiatives continue to be strategies employed by local Garda management to target criminal behaviour and spikes in specific types of criminality, including driving-related offences, and other forms of anti-social behaviour. </p><p>As I stated, it is a matter for the Commissioner to manage and direct Garda resources.  This includes responsibility for the formulation of proposals regarding the opening and closing of Garda stations.  The Senator may recall in that regard that A programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment for a review of Garda districts and dispersement of resources.  The resulting report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate entitled, Policing with Local Communities, which was submitted to the Minister by the Policing Authority and published in December 2018, also finds that the responsibility for decisions on boundaries and dispersement of Garda resources, including the number, type and location of Garda stations, should rest with the Garda Commissioner, as is currently the case.  I understand the Garda authorities do not currently propose a new station in the area referred to by the Senator. </p></speech>

It is nonsense to suggest to this House or to me that it is the role of the Garda Commissioner to make these decisions when we all know a member of the Cabinet is well able to trumpet that he apparently was successful in reopening Stepaside Garda station.  He is also willing to tell all his constituents as often as he possibly can that it was his intervention that made that happen.  For the Minister of State to suggest there was no political interference or influence on that decision is a statement of an untruth.  I know it certainly went against the advice of the assistant Garda Commissioner.  As was stated in the Houses of the Oireachtas, he was not in favour of it and did not believe it was a proper use of Garda resources.  It is not good enough for the Minister of State to tell me that this issue has nothing to do with the Government when it has.</p> <p>I advised the Minister of State that the Government stated two years ago that there was not a need for a secondary school in the  Clongriffin-Belmayne area and now it has stated a school is needed.  A Garda station is also needed in the locality because of the projected population.  I am sure that in years to come somebody in the Minister of State's position will inform the House that the Government has changed its mind in that regard.  I ask the Minister of State to stop telling us this is not a political decision when clearly it is a political decision.  Will he review the priorities of the Department to take account of this new population centre and give it the service it clearly needs?</p></speech>

I also understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with the local authorities and local stakeholders, as appropriate.</p></speech>

Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p><p>I condemn in the strongest terms on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group the car bombing at Bishop Street in Derry at the weekend.  It shows how delicate and fragile the situation in the North is at the moment and that we cannot take for granted the Good Friday Agreement and peace on this island.  What we have in the Good Friday Agreement must be nourished continuously and we cannot take our eyes off it at any stage.  It was confirmed today by the Commission that a no-deal Brexit will result in a hard border, which is something we all knew.  Unfortunately, the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the imminent threat of a hard border has added fuel to the fire of some dissident groups and provided them with a <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.  As a result, we are seeing some sort of resurgence.  I acknowledge the work of the Government and civil servants and note that we very much stand by that work in navigating Brexit.  However, we must be cognisant of the fragility of peace on our island and ensure the Good Friday Agreement is sustainable.  As such, I ask the Leader what will happen and what plans the Government has to maintain and sustain the Good Friday Agreement in the wake of a crash-out Brexit?</p><p>I raise also the issue of the lack of green spaces and amenities in our inner cities.  I do not apologise for supporting a campaign on Cork Street, namely the Weaver Square community garden allotments campaign.  This is a small site in the inner city consisting of 27 allotments.  On this small plot, a community garden has been created which has been boxing far above its weight and providing a huge community gain.  Obviously, there is a major housing crisis, which I have raised weekly in the House since elected, but there are many alternative sites in Dublin 8, including the St. Michael's Estate site, St. Theresa's Gardens and the Player Wills factory.  These are huge tracts of land which could, with a bit of imagination and proper planning, provide a great deal of housing and the proper amenities.  The local authority has served an eviction notice on the allotment owners which was to have been executed on Monday in order to facilitate the construction of rapid-build homes.  It is a real shame the community is losing the community garden.  It is a small patch of land but it provided a great deal in community gain.  There are many other large tracts of land which could have been used instead.</p><p>I refer finally to the 500 psychiatric nurses who have gone on strike today on foot of a refusal by the HSE to recognise NASRA, the ambulance branch of the Psychiatric Nurses Association.  Ultimately, it means 500 healthcare workers are not working today.  We cannot afford to lose 500 workers from a system which is already under strain.  The Government must act quickly and cannot allow further strikes to take place in the health sector.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Association has, as we know, scheduled six 24 hour strikes by its 37,000 members to take place on 30 January and 5, 7, 12, 13 and 14 February, respectively, if its members' pay and conditions are not addressed.  While the nurses will provide for emergency responses, the full service these nurses, most of whom are women, carry out will not be provided.  To lose 37,000 members of our health service on any of these days would be shameful and the Government must act to ensure the strikes do not go ahead.</p></speech>

I could not let that go on for much longer and I am delighted to be a part of the group.</p> <p>I want to make three quick points.  The first is to alert Senators to "Showcase Ireland" which is something I think they probably know about.  "Showcase Ireland" is a platform for all that is great in the creative arts in Ireland, in manufacturing, glass, ceramics, wool, fabric, design, silver and gold.  All the products are created and designed in Ireland.  Everybody should, in whatever way they can, platform them in their counties, towns and villages.  To see the artists' stuff in the RDS over the past few days - and the exhibition continues until Wednesday - has been in absolute privilege.  To mention one in particular, Eamonn Terry was a glass-blower in Waterford Glass, and we know what happened there, but he went out on his own.  He now has Criostal na Rinne and makes beautiful stuff.  I would also like to mention Jerpoint Glass, an Irish handmade glass company.  These are people who are still blowing their own glass in Ireland; it is not being imported from any other country.  It is apt that we look at the arts and crafts in Ireland now, especially with what is happening in Brexit, because we need to take our artists, creatives, manufacturers and designers very seriously and make sure they are well resourced.</p> <p>The second thing I want to say is that Garry Hynes, Philip King, Mark Patrick Hederman and Theo Dorgan will be coming to speak to the Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht tomorrow, representing music, literature, theatre and poetry.</p> <p>Could the Leader let me know when the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill will come into the Seanad?  It was delayed before Christmas.  Could he also let me know when the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill will be before the Seanad, something I asked about two months ago?  Many people are in limbo awaiting this Bill.  I also ask when the full commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill will happen.  I was very involved in that in the last Seanad.  Could the Leader give an update on those?</p> <p>I am standing up for the arts and creativity because now, more than ever, they matter.  It is not just economic graft that means something.  Our island is a great creator of arts, crafts and literature and we should look to it as a half saviour.</p></speech>

There is no support or tolerance for that behaviour.  We have a pathway to peace.  We have peace and a pathway to Irish unity - in fact, we have never been closer to Irish unity.  The conversations and discussions now being had in civic society about the possibility of Irish unity mean we can further garner support for Irish unity across the board.  There is no support, tolerance or justification for these actions and I would ask those responsible to just stop that behaviour.</p> <p>My colleague, Deputy Maurice Quinlivan, received information from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that shows that 89 units it owns are currently vacant.  Eight of these units are located in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta sites across County Mayo.  One such unit is in B&eacute;al an Mhuirthead and has been lying empty for 20 years.  It is hard to believe that no use has been found for this site since 1999.  Instead of lying empty, these and similar units should be used to help start-up businesses, community groups or charities.  Even letting these premises for free is better than seeing such a valuable public asset lying idle for such a long period of time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I call on the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to come to this House and tell us how she will facilitate greater co-operation between IDA Ireland, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Enterprise Ireland to ensure that these vacant sites are taken into account and fully utilised for the benefit of communities.  To achieve this, many more site visits to Mayo and the west by IDA Ireland, especially in Gaeltacht areas, are needed.  Last year, up to November 2018, there were only seven such IDA visits to Mayo.  If the Government is serious about creating jobs in County Mayo and other places in the west, all available infrastructure needs to be utilised.  This will not happen if they do not bother coming to see and assess it for themselves.  These units and land in public ownership need to be used as a factor of production and to address many of the problems we have across the State relating to housing and unemployment.  We cannot say that we support indigenous business and enterprise, and that we have situations where there is full employment.  There are pockets of very high unemployment in rural Ireland, many of which are in the Gaeltacht.  We cannot have assets there which are not fully utilised.</p></speech>

It was a magnificent and fitting event.  I was privileged to be part of it as a Member of the Seanad.  I never thought that would happen.  The Seanad was recently saved by a referendum but if it was not for the determination and steel of those people 100 years ago, there might have been neither a D&aacute;il nor a Seanad and that is worth remembering.  It was also a moving and personal occasion for me because I grew up hearing about one Member of the First D&aacute;il, a man named Phil Shanahan, from a small place, Foilmacduff in Hollyford, County Tipperary.  My late mother, Judy, was my teacher and instructor with regard to Phil.  Her family, the Daverns were fast friends of the Shanahans in Hollyford.  I was delighted to meet Phil's great grandniece, Emer Fhatherta, yesterday, who was there to remember Phil.  My mother told me of his lifelong commitment and the sacrifices he made, about his family members, specifically his sister, Sarah, his hunger strike and his generosity.  He went from being a comfortable publican in Dublin to his death in November 1931 in poor circumstances.  He was in Jacob's Factory with MacDonagh.  His pub in the heart of Monto was a home from home and a meeting place for other Republicans.  I spent last Saturday night with his grandnephew, Ramie Shanahan, in the same place where Phil returned to spend his last years before his death.  I saw the treasure trove of documents, papers, memorabilia and talked into the night.</p> <p>It struck me that in the Seanad, we should consider some way that we might be a focal point to remember, honour and promote a better understanding of the lives of these people, their motivations, family circumstances, interests, places of origin, families and comrades.  The downgrading of history was mentioned yesterday in the Mansion House.  Such a focus as this, possibly carried out throughout the year, could reignite the curiosity and interest of the young and not so young in the lives of these ordinary people who did extraordinary things and gave us a legacy that we have a responsibility to live up to.  I would be happy to support any such initiative and ask the Leader if he will consider something along these lines.</p> <p>Phil was a Teachta D&aacute;la for Dublin Harbour.  He beat the unbeatable Alfie Byrne to take that seat but there were four other Tipperary men.  Pierce McCan died from the flu in March that year.  S&eacute;amus Burke went on to be a Minister in Cosgrave's Government.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was also Joseph McDonagh, brother of Thomas, and P.J. Moloney who, like me, was from Tipperary Town.  He had his home burnt out.  They are minor anecdotes of the lives of what I call ordinary people who did extraordinary things.  We might consider some ways throughout the year to give some impetus to it.</p></speech>

I was privileged and honoured to have been present to listen to the very dignified, respectful and appropriate way in which we commemorated the important first sitting of the D&aacute;il 100 years ago.  As a member of the Labour Party, I was pleased and heartened by the emphasis on Tom Johnson's democratic programme and the important values and ideals espoused in it.  It was beautifully portrayed.  The event was organised in a really tasteful and appropriate way.  I commend the communications unit, the Oireachtas staff, the Ceann Comhairle's office and all involved in organising it.  The Labour Party had its own event on Saturday to launch its rewritten democratic programme for the 21st Century.  We will be highlighting it during the year.  Senator Dolan spoke about how to reignite interest.  It is really important that all of us look in all sorts of different ways at commemorating and highlighting the centenary of the First D&aacute;il and ensure that different aspects of it are honoured and commemorated.</p> <p>I thank the Leader for organising the statements on Brexit.  They are timely.  It was in marked contrast to the shambles in Westminster to see the D&aacute;il and Seanad holding the joint sitting in the Mansion House yesterday.  We will have an opportunity to talk about Brexit later.</p> <p>I echo the words of others in condemning the car bombing in Derry and those involved in carrying it out.  It reminds us of the really serious and very real fears that a hard border will follow if Britain crashes out of the EU on 29 March.  The EU Commission confirmed today that a no-deal Brexit will mean the return of a hard border.  That is a really serious worry for everyone.</p> <p>I ask the Leader for a debate on the follow-up to the legislation we passed just before Christmas, which I am glad to see is now in effect.  I refer to the legislation allowing for terminations of pregnancy.  Many of us were concerned last week by reports of one particular case in the Coombe Hospital which was reported as being dealt with in a way that was somewhat troubling.  I hope we will see less of that.  The publicity in respect of the case in question was of concern generally.  Other events in recent weeks have shown us the really urgent need for the legislation to protect women accessing services at GP clinics and hospitals.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, promised that the relevant legislation would emerge in early course this year.  I will be pressing for a debate on it and for bringing the legislation forward.  As far as I know, the Bill in question has not yet been drafted.  We need to know when it will be drafted.  I ask the Leader to make inquiries in the Department of Health about when we will see that legislation because it is essential that those seeking to access services are protected from harassment and intimidation when they do so.</p> <p>I express my satisfaction on seeing the first conviction reported today under the Swedish or Nordic model.  My dear friend and colleague, Senator Norris, will not agree with me.</p></speech>

It was horrific and frightening to see the videos on the news.</p> <p>I compliment all who were involved in organising yesterday's event.  It was very appropriate and went off really well.  I attended another event this morning and I took taxis to and from my destination.  Both drivers had watched yesterday's proceedings on television and were very emotional in expressing their thoughts on them.  Many families and descendants of the Members of the First D&aacute;il were present yesterday.  One of my neighbours is a descendant of Michael Colivet.  It was lovely to meet the Collins family there.  Another event is being held in the Mansion House today, with students from 15 schools engaging in a debate on D&aacute;il 100.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is to be commended.  I was over there this morning because two of my neighbouring schools were successful in having two pupils selected, namely, Megan from Gaelchol&aacute;iste Luimn&iacute; and Katie from Laurel Hill Col&aacute;iste.  It is good that they were both from all-Irish-speaking schools.  It is to be commended that they were selected among the 15 to speak.  I heard some of what they had to say and their speeches were fantastic.  One spoke about the harmful effects of alcohol and the other one questioned where our Irish has gone to.  They were two topical debates.  I congratulate all those involved.  It is good that the youth are continuing the debate today.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we have already had serious issues with ambulance response times in County Monaghan.  In some instances it has taken 70 minutes for the ambulance to reach the patient concerned.  The current dispute in the ambulance service is of particular concern to the people of Monaghan, Cavan and other rural areas.  As the Leader will agree, ambulance workers play a vital role in the provision of health services and those of us in rural areas depend very heavily on those services.  It could be said that people's lives are being put at risk because of this dispute.  I urge the Minister and the HSE to engage as a matter of urgency with the ambulance workers concerned to try to find a resolution to this dispute so that the lives of people in counties Cavan and Monaghan and elsewhere are not put at risk by this dispute.</p></speech>

We heard on "Morning Ireland" this morning that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was due to bring a memorandum to Cabinet this morning seeking a 12-month extension for Judge Yvonne Murphy to carry out her very important work, on which I commend her.  We do not need a lesson here today to explain why things have gone way beyond the original timeframe set.  We know from reports from the commission that the Tuam babies issue came up in 2015 and this was an added piece of work for Judge Murphy to deal with.</p> <p>My concern is with Bethany Home, a Protestant organisation.  For some reason the Government and previous Administrations have failed to take on the importance of this establishment.  It is now known as fact that this was an incarceration house for many women and children.  There is no dispute about it.  These children were in State care or the State should have had a responsibility.</p> <p>The Taoiseach made an excellent presentation at yesterday's commemoration of the centenary of the First D&aacute;il.  He talked about our shameful past.  He talked about institutions, including mother and baby homes.  He said that we would need to do things in different ways and face new challenges.  He is dead right and has my full support.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Zappone, discussed this very important issue with us previously.  If possible we should ask her to come back to the House to debate the matter with particular emphasis on Bethany Home.  Abuse knows no religious bounds.  This wholly Protestant institution has been excluded for reasons I do not know.  In any place where children were in care there was a duty of care on our society, Government, public administration and every arm of the State.  It is important that we give reason.  More important, Bethany Home should be included in a redress scheme.</p> <p>I do not think the suggestion reported in the media today that the commission has to work through the initial 17 institutions is correct.  While I accept its remit was to deal with these 17 institutions and that some people will be disappointed that this will continue for another year, it is important that we send a clear message to people, including Senators and Deputies, who have long campaigned for this particular organisation to be investigated.  It is fair, right and proper.  I ask that the Minister come to the House to share her views, particularly on Bethany Home.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I call on everyone in this House to use their influence on Government to try to push this forward and get this group of people included in the redress scheme.</p></speech>

It is positive that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has given approval for this project, which has long been needed.  It will involve alignment of approximately 15 km of existing roads and a new carriageway of approximately 35 km.  It is important because this is a dangerous stretch of road.  Motorists travel at high speeds through the villages of Frenchpark, Bellanagare and Tulsk, in particular, to and from the west.  Now that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has issued approval, it is critical that this project be progressed to construction as quickly as possible.  It is important that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, gives us an update on the project.  It is included under Project Ireland 2040 but it is critical that construction progresses without delay because there is a high risk involved and there have been far too many accidents on this dangerous stretch of road.  It is nonetheless positive that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has given approval.  Significant work has been completed by the national roads design office in Roscommon, which should be strongly complimented on all its work thus far.  It is to be hoped we will see progression in terms of the project being led to construction very quickly.</p></speech>

It was an enjoyable event and a reminder to us all of the need for us as legislators to progress the democratic programme as set out 100 years go.  I do not wish to put a dampener on it, but members of the deaf community have asked in future for consideration of the interpretation of such events that are broadcast nationwide because they feel they missed out on it.</p> <p>I also wish to bring up the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, strike that commenced at 7 o'clock this morning.  I tabled a Commencement matter on this on 7 November.  In 2010, we march down the street from Parnell Square as part of what was called the 24-7 Alliance.  The years of austerity had seen attacks on our pay.  We marched so pay would not be attacked.  The State was going to retain core pay but let additional payments for night duty, weekends and Christmas go to the wall.  Thus the 24-7 Alliance was born.  Then 500 ambulance personnel made a request to join the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA.  It was a little odd at the time but it has worked out well in the nine years since.  I have questioned him the Minister previously and I put him on notice on 7 November that we do not need to escalate this.  As has been said, the health service in its entirety is escalating the staff's dispute, and it is not just about pay and conditions.  The strike concerns treatment of State and the duty of care that they feel they cannot carry out.  Basically, this dispute is about the right to be heard.  It is about having a fundamental right to join a union and for that union of one's choice to represent one.  Sinn F&eacute;in has no position on the merits or otherwise of pay and conditions claims, only that we believe such disputes are best resolved through dialogue and negotiation.  The Trade Union Representation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2018 has been introduced by Sinn F&eacute;in, and we wish to see it enacted as soon as possible.</p></speech>

This is not a new issue and the group has been advocating back since the days I was working with the National Women's Council of Ireland before I was elected to the Oireachtas.  It is shocking that the former residents are still waiting for recognition and support.  The number of survivors of those homes is reducing and it is important that those who were there should get satisfaction.</p> <p>I join in the commendations of yesterday's event.  Let me articulate my sincere expressions of appreciation for the people of 100 years ago and all those who have followed since in the work of maintaining our democracy.  I was particularly happy with the content, the Declaration of Independence, the Message to the Free Nations of the World and the programme of the first D&aacute;il, which is an extraordinarily important democratic programme, as drafted by Thomas Johnson and reflecting so much of the social movement which had fed into the national movement of that time and of the thinking of Connolly and the ideas of the Proclamation.  Will the Leader create an opportunity to discuss at an appropriate time some of those visionary documents and perhaps see how we could place ourselves in terms of the current vision for the next centenary?  I believe that Senators are inheritors of the democratic challenge in the same way as those in the D&aacute;il and it is very important that we would assign time for reflection and set ourselves the challenge to move forward.  If we look at the extension of the franchise that took place in the 1918 elections, it would be extraordinarily positive if this was the year in which we delivered Seanad reform and extended the franchise and the delivery of greater democracy.  </p> <p>Let me draw the attention of Members and those in the wider world to an extraordinary exhibition - Women in Politics and Public Life, from 1918 to 2018 - which is taking place in Dublin Castle and which closes at the end of January.  I urge everybody to visit it.  It very much tracks the full century of women's political action, the political actions from every decade and the contribution that women have made across all parties.</p> <p>I pay a brief tribute to some politicians, as a key reminder for all of us of the importance of democracy.  We spoke about the tragic murder of the British politician, Jo Cox, a parliamentarian and a person who had championed an inclusive form of politics.  In the past few weeks, another champion of inclusive politics who contributed to an extension of civic participation in the most inclusive sense in this city, the mayor of Gdansk, Pawel Adamowicz, was tragically murdered in the past few weeks.  There was also an incident where a bomb was placed in The Diamond in Derry, the heart of the city.  These are all challenges to democracy and it is important that we never retreat from them but instead redouble our commitment to democratic debate and to representation of the people as sovereign.</p></speech>

Sometimes we take it for granted.   </p> <p>I wish to raise an issue in regard to St. Finian's community college in Swords.  In March 2010, the board of management expressed concern regarding the school's general condition.  There were leaks in the ceilings, a lack of heating and health risks to both students and staff.  A design team started work in February 2013 and produced a report in June 2013.  The final design was produced in August, with planning permission granted in December 2015.  There was not a single objection from any of the local residents.  In April 2017, all issues were resolved and the project was expected to go to tender immediately afterwards, with work was expected to begin in the summer of 2017.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In September 2018, staff were told the school was at pre-qualification stage for the appointment of contractors.  This had been completed by the ETB and sent to the Department but was returned to the ETB without an explanation by the Department.  However, the ETB was told to resubmit.  Here we are in January 2019.  Last week, I visited the school and saw for myself rooms that had no natural light and a home economics room that contained cookers but had only one entrance or exit.  That is a fire risk, as far as I am concerned.  I also saw a disgraceful dilapidation of the building in terms of ceilings coming down.  One can see from the picture I am holding in my hand, although it may be difficult to see it, a roof collapsing with vegetation growing in the room.  Yet students in 2019 are supposed to learn and study in these conditions, and staff are supposed to teach in them.  It is just not good enough.</p><p>Having made a video with Luke Corkery, who is on the student council in the school, I am delighted that 7,000 people saw the video and that some action has resulted.  The ETB has been in touch and, in turn, the Department of Education and Skills has emailed the board advising it to have the design team commence plans for the inclusion of a new zero energy building.  My only concern is that if that means a whole new design and new planning application, then we will be back to square one, which is simply not good enough.  The population of Swords is over 40,000 and 10,452 people under the age of 18 await education or attend educational facilities.  These young people need a proper place for their education.  They have suffered.</p><p>Please do not ask the staff of this DEIS school, the students and their parents who support them to continue to have to exist in these conditions.  I call on the Minister to ensure the Department takes action immediately.  People have waited since 2010.  The school has passed all the tests and has done all that was required but now it seems to be rejoining the queue, which not fair.  It is certainly not fair to a DEIS school that has done so well over the years.</p></speech>

Many years ago the Anglican Archbishop spoke out clearly on the matter and asked for it to be taken into account.  It is nothing other than religious discrimination that this has not happened.  The issue would have been forgotten only for the great work done by Derek Leinster.</p> <p>I completely disagree with my colleague, Senator Bacik.  I do not how anybody can be pleased about the prospect of a lonely 65 year old man, coming from a deprived area of Dublin, being named and fined in court.  It seems to me that this is rank and smug hypocrisy.  I remember during the debate here, it flew in the face of all the academic research produced by Queen's University, Belfast, which I put on the record.  I urge anybody who wants to see that research and to know the truth about this matter to read the debate where I put these facts on the record.</p></speech>

An Egyptian television interviewer has been arrested, jailed for one year and fined 200 Egyptian pounds for interviewing a gay man on Egyptian television.  The interviewer himself is a well known homophobe who comes out repeatedly with homophobic remarks.  He interviewed a man about his life as a gay man in Egypt where homosexuality is not illegal.  However, gay men who are consenting male adults in private are consistently nowadays arrested for blasphemy, immorality and debauchery.  I would like to ask that this House requests the Leader to get the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to send a strong protest, on behalf of the House, to the Egyptian ambassador.</p></speech>

Ireland has been ranked among the top ten countries that hold the strongest passports according to the Henley Passport Index.  The index measures the strength of a passport based on a citizen's ability to travel visa-free or using an easy access visa.  Irish passport holders have the freedom to travel to 184 countries, which makes the Irish passport an attractive product.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In that context, I wish to raise an issue that came to my attention over the Christmas when I was speaking to somebody who was home for the festivities.  He is a British national who is married to an Irish woman.  Their children have Irish passports.  He inquired about the possibility of getting an Irish passport but was told that, while it would be possible, he would have to live in Ireland for one year to qualify for naturalisation and thus citizenship.  I agree that there should be rules and stipulations but in cases where a spouse is not of Irish descent but the rest of the family is, are we unfairly discriminating against the foreign spouse where there is a long-standing relationship and proof of many years of travel to Ireland?  We allow generous access to Irish citizenship to people around the world - in many cases to individuals who might never travel to this land in their lifetimes.  However, can we restrict access for a family unit where connections are real and visible for all to see?</p><p>The Constitution insists on a special affinity with people of Irish ancestry living abroad who share our culture, identity and heritage.  Is marriage not the most special affinity?  Can we ask a family to split to reconcile residency issues or ask them to move lock, stock and barrel to Ireland for a year?  That is not practical.  This man has an important job in England, as does his wife.  His children are in school.  The Minister should clarify what we are preparing to do for such hard-working families who travel to Ireland regularly to see elderly relatives and family here.  What are our contingency plans?  What could Brexit mean for the right of UK citizens, derived from Irish law under the EU freedom of movement legislation, to come and live in Ireland without residency permits?  These are serious questions.  Irish passports will have a massive role to play in the context of Brexit.  I accept that the Minister is coming to the House later but we must address these issues.  The uncertainty is unreal so we must obtain clarification on this matter.</p><p>I agree with Senator Ardagh.  We support the nurses and the ambulance personnel.  They are doing a great job.  We must give them our support because they work extremely hard.</p></speech>

Thankfully, nobody was killed or injured but what happened shows that this is a dangerous time when it comes to dissident republicans.  Everything must be done to ensure that they do not have a voice or threaten the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>Yesterday's centenary of the first meeting of the D&aacute;il was a great success.  I congratulate everybody involved.  Yesterday's event reminded me that today is the centenary of the appointment of the first Minister for Foreign Affairs, George Noble Plunkett or Count Plunkett, who, in what was known as "the election of the snows" - effectively a by-election for the British Parliament - was elected to represent the old constituency of North Roscommon.  That election rocked the British establishment to its core.  Count Plunkett was also a Member of the first D&aacute;il.  I was in Westminster on Wednesday night last.  The place was in a complete frenzy.  I do not believe that many of the people who were voting understand the backstop or the Border.  A Brexit without a withdrawal agreement will mean border infrastructure.  Nobody wants a border.  In the absence of leadership in many of the parties at Westminster, I thank MPs such as Ms Yvette Cooper, Mr. Hilary Benn, Sir Keir Starmer and Mr. Dominic Grieve, who are from different parties.  They have shown great leadership in trying to get a solution from the referendum.  The Government should thank those people as well as many more who are outside the parties and are standing up to be counted.  Democracy needs these elected MPs to stand up and be counted.  We need a withdrawal agreement or some other mechanism to ensure there will not be a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p></speech>

As the national broadcaster, it has a responsibility to recognise and respect the vulnerabilities and mental health of the people and communities who are the subjects of its debates.  Tonight, "Prime Time" will feature a conversation about transgender young people.  I want to make it clear that young people accessing legal gender recognition certificates does not mean they undergo surgery.  In an advertisement for tonight's show that has been aired on RT&Eacute;, the presenter, Miriam O'Callaghan, asks why there has been so little discussion of these issues in Ireland.  There are individuals who are desperately trying to transfer to Ireland the division that has been fostered around these issues in Britain.  We are not Britain.  Our extremely progressive Gender Recognition Act was passed into law in 2015 after a very long conversation about marriage equality and the lives of LGBT people.  Since that time, this House has unanimously supported the principle of the Gender Recognition (Amendment) Bill 2017, which focuses on trans young people.  There have been conversations.  I hope this House can send a message today that we value the contribution of trans people to the diversity of this island and we reject transphobia in all its forms.  The US Supreme Court has today allowed Donald Trump's ban on transgender troops to come into effect.  I remind the House that people like Trump and others closer to home have a shopping list and it does not stop with the Traveller community or the trans community.</p></speech>

I thought it was a fantastic occasion.  Everything about the whole occasion, including the colour and the decor, was magnificent.  I think the Houses of the Oireachtas deserve great credit for putting it on.</p> <p>I would like to ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister responsible for jobs and small business to come before the House.  Small businesses like high street shops, bars and restaurants are finding it very difficult to deal with difficulties like insurance, rates, employment, PAYE and PRSI.  They have to deal with 13 or 14 different agencies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They have difficult decisions to make and they are operating in difficult times.

I happened to be in Dublin on Sunday.  I was asked to attend and I saw at first hand the great task that was at hand.  I was in early again yesterday.  It was a major commemorative event and an enormously successful event.  Sometimes we take the staff of Leinster House for granted but the Captain of the Guard, the superintendent and all of their staff did an extraordinary job yesterday.  It was not something that was planned overnight and the work that went into it probably went on for a couple of months.  I express my gratitude to them personally and on behalf of the House.

I join with Senators Dolan, Bacik, Byrne, Devine, Higgins, Feighan, Paddy Burke and Coghlan in speaking about the commemorations yesterday.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, gabhaim mo f&iacute;or bu&iacute;ochas agus mo chomghairdeas le gach duine a bh&iacute; p&aacute;irteach sa chom&oacute;radh.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-spiorad&uacute;il agus inspirational.  Yesterday was a wonderful day, l&aacute; iontach, stairi&uacute;il de cheili&uacute;radh agus l&aacute; iontach agus speisialta do gach Ball den Oireachtas.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, t&aacute; suim m&oacute;r ag a l&aacute;n daoine, ach go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r ag gach Ball den Teach seo agus den D&aacute;il i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus beimid ag pl&eacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge an seachtain seo chugainn.  Yesterday was a wonderful occasion to commemorate the first sitting of the First D&aacute;il.</p> <p>On my behalf and on behalf of the Government, I commend all members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and all who were p&aacute;irteach san &oacute;c&aacute;id speisialta seo.  It was a wonderful day.  It shows the importance of Oireachtas TV and the need for us to promote and use same as a means of broadcasting the work that is being done in both Houses of the Oireachtas and in committees.  In addition, as Senators Warfield and Marie-Louise O'Donnell indirectly referred to in their contributions, it shows the importance of creativity and of what happens within this compound of the Houses of the Oireachtas in terms of visits and being able to re-enact significant moments in our history.  Yesterday was one such occasion and I offer my sincere congratulations and thanks to all involved.  I will not name people but I welcome and congratulate all for the wonderful event yesterday.</p> <p>Perhaps the pin that we all received as Members could be replicated and given to all of the Houses of the Oireachtas staff as a token of our appreciation for their contribution.  I happened to be in discussion with a member of staff yesterday who I will not name, and that person has been here since 1982.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The latter illustrates that the job is not just a job, it is a commitment.  This is a place of work but it is also much more than that.  Yesterday's event was fantastic.  We were all privileged to be elected.  Some of the contributions perhaps offered a dystopian view of the world but I reflect on the fact that we have passed transgender and marriage equality legislation and achieved some infrastructural development.  The country is near full employment, notwithstanding the challenges we face.  The men and women of the First D&aacute;il would be proud of what this and previous Governments have achieved.  I want to put that into perspective.</p><p>I join all Senators who condemned the car bombing in Derry last weekend.  Violence has no place on our island, north, south, east or west.  We had all hoped we had left the dark days of violence behind us.  As Senator Ardagh stated, we must nurture and inculcate in all a desire to maintain the peace process through upholding the Good Friday Agreement and bringing all communities together.  It behoves us to work to ensure that we do not take the peace we now enjoy for granted.</p><p>Senator Higgins rightly mentioned the brutal killing of the mayor of Gdansk, Pawe Adamowicz, who was stabbed while speaking.  We are democrats and democracy is something we cherish.  We must work not only to ensure that it is nurtured, as Senator Ardagh stated, but to protect those who are elected as public representatives.  We must also protect the right to speak and to hold a different viewpoint.  On behalf of the House, I offer Mr. Adamowicz's wife, Magdalena, and their two young children our deepest sympathies.</p><p>Senator Ardagh referred to the lack of green space in Dublin's inner city.  I hope we can engage in a debate on that matter in due course.  It is important that a city has green spaces and trees, places of refuge away from the concrete jungle, the traffic and the noise.  I will be happy to arrange a debate on that matter.</p><p>Senators Devine, Murnane O'Connor, Ardagh and Gallagher referred to today's dispute involving ambulance staff.  We all recognise the importance of ambulance personnel but the HSE is questioning the right to have a representation heard.  The PNA represents 500 ambulance service staff.  The HSE recognises SIPTU, which also represents ambulance personnel.  I hope we can resolve this issue.  It is important that patients are not used as pawns in a dispute.  It is also important that all voices are heard.  I appeal to those on all sides to come to the table.</p><p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell raised the very important issue of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016, elements of which are being refined.  Work is ongoing and when it is complete, the Bill will come back to the House.  I certainly hope that will happen in the short term, namely, in the spring.</p><p>The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, has published the Civil Registration Bill 2019 which will allow for same-sex parents to have the word "parent" recorded on birth certificates.  That Bill will come forward in the spring of this year.  I do not have the exact timetable.  We have asked the Department for more information but we have not got that yet.</p><p>I did not understand the Senator's question on the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.</p></speech>

I agree completely that the arts and creativity are integral to who we are.  Earlier, the Oscar nominations were announced and we can all see the success of the Irish in the arts.  The Senator is right to ask that we consider this matter.  The Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is debating it this week but I would be happy to have a significant debate on the arts, the arts community and our culture and on how they can be part of a new, modern Ireland emerging from the shadow of recession.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I would be happy to have that debate and I commend the Senator for that.  </p><p>I do not have the answer for Senator Conway-Walsh regarding &Uacute;dar&aacute;s Na Gaeltachta and the vacant units in Mayo.  Perhaps she might raise that through a Commencement debate.  In his contribution, Senator Dolan raised the issue of history.  As Members will know, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, has set up a review on the teaching of history as an optional subject.  That is to be completed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, in the coming weeks and we will have a debate in the House when it is complete.  </p><p>I do not have information to hand on the health issues that Senator Bacik raised, but I would be happy to liaise with her about that.  I join Senator Byrne in congratulating all the schools involved in the debate today and I thank them for their work.  </p><p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of Bethany Home, as did Senator Norris.  The Government has today given a 12-month extension to the mother and baby homes commission of investigation.  The fourth interim report has been published today.  In regard to Bethany Home the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has said that she will wait until she has received the final reports before making any decision.  I note the comments of Senators Boyhan and Norris and the commission.  We will have a debate in the House on the matter that Senator Boyhan has raised on 6 February.  </p><p>Senator Hopkins raised the issue of the N5 project, a very important one for providing a gateway to the west.  Perhaps a Commencement matter might be a more expeditious way of getting an answer.  I do not have the answer to hand regarding the project.  I answered Senator Devine on the nurses' strike.</p><p>In response to Senator Higgins, perhaps we need to have a reflective look at what happened yesterday and some of the contribution she made this afternoon and have a series of rolling debates, as Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said.  That would be of assistance to us all and I would be happy to talk to Senator Higgins about that.  </p><p>Senator Reilly raised the issue of St. Finian's community college in Swords.  Perhaps raising the issue as a Commencement matter would be a better way of getting a reply.  Senator Norris raised a number of issues, in particular regarding Egyptian television.  We should all stand with and send a message of support to that person.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade needs to communicate quite clearly to the Egyptian Government our displeasure at the jailing of any person for interviewing people in a manner that allows differing viewpoints to be brought to television and media.  We should all condemn the incarceration of someone for interviewing a gay person.  I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will send a message to the Egyptian authorities on that issue. </p><p>On the issue of passports, having the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come to the House for a Commencement matter is perhaps a better way for Senator Murnane O'Connor to get a reply.  I do not have the information she mentioned.</p><p>Senators Feighan and &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh raised the issue of the centenary and the appointment of the first Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy George Noble Plunkett, 100 years ago today.  Senator Warfield raised a very pertinent point in advance of the RT&Eacute; "Prime Time" programme tonight.  We need to send a very strong message of support and solidarity to our trans community, which is very marginalised and needs support.  We need people to understand and to be educated properly, not in a sensational way.  I hope that tonight's programme is educational, informative and factual.  As the Senator quite rightly said, we should all reject transphobia.  We should all work to ensure that we bring people on a journey and inform them.  There are members of our community who are feeling vulnerable, isolated, rejected and completely unheard.  I hope that tonight and from now on we can stand together and have that debate and a movement of equality and inclusivity.  I would be happy to have a debate in the House following tonight's programme.  I thank the Senator for making that remark.  As the national broadcaster it is important that RT&Eacute; informs in a way that is not sensational or derogatory and ensures equality and respect for all people and all citizens.  </p><p>Senator Paddy Burke raised the issue of retail, and having the Minister come before the House.  I would be happy to do that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The issue of Brexit was mentioned by a number of Members, in particular by Senator Ardagh.

I spoke to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland yesterday and I offered both our concern and assistance.  The police investigation is ongoing to bring to justice those who are behind this act of terrorism.  Such violence has been rejected by the people of this island again and again.  The group that carried out this act cannot claim in any way to be acting on behalf of the Irish people.  I know Senators from all parties and none will share in this condemnation.  There can be no return to the dark days of the past anywhere on this island.</p> <p>The Brexit process in the UK is at a critical juncture.  The Government regretted the outcome of last week's vote in the House of Commons on the withdrawal agreement, even if the outcome itself was not a big surprise.  Prime Minister May yesterday stated her continuing commitment to the withdrawal agreement and said she would continue efforts to build the necessary support in Westminster.  The British political and parliamentary process will take some time to play out.  What we need is for the UK to make it clear on the basis of the outcome of that process how it proposes to move forward.  Only then, in truth, can the EU consider how to respond.</p> <p>As Senators know, the backstop is an insurance policy to ensure that there is no hard border on this island following Brexit.  It an essential part of the withdrawal agreement and we continue to advocate for it.  However, it is our strong hope that a comprehensive and ambitious future relationship agreement will achieve the same end and ensure that the backstop is never triggered or needed.</p> <p>Our EU partners have been consistently supportive and understanding of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and of the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  Their solidarity has been consistent throughout the negotiations.  This was reaffirmed to me by Michel Barnier as late as yesterday, and the unambiguous message remains that there can be no withdrawal agreement without the backstop.  Lest there be any doubt, there should be absolute clarity as well that the EU negotiates as one, and that this united approach will remain intact until the end of the process.</p> <p>Domestically, preparing for Brexit, and for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, is a whole-of-Government priority.  Our planning began ahead of the UK referendum, and in recent months has become more focussed on our no-deal plans.  We are all deeply aware of the potentially profound political, economic and trade impacts of a no-deal Brexit.  The Government is taking clear steps to mitigate these impacts, but given the scale and uncertainty surrounding a no-deal Brexit, we must all recognise that if such an outcome materialises, there will be significant disruption and change.  I have said repeatedly that it will put significant strain both on the political mechanisms in this country and on the economy.</p> <p>That requires a response from the Government but also preparations by businesses and other affected sectors, with the advice and support that the Government is giving.  Since July 2018, the Government has made a number of key decisions on Brexit preparedness, including on staffing, ICT and infrastructure at the ports and airports.  In light of the risks of a no-deal Brexit, this work is now being accelerated and, where necessary, interim measures are being put in place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On 19 December, the Government published its Contingency Action Plan, setting out its approach to dealing with a no-deal Brexit., and Members will have seen the further intensification of preparations so far throughout the month of January where we have added significantly to the detail of that document.</p><p>We are working on the preparation of temporary sites and infrastructure at ports and airports and on accelerated staffing plans through recruitment and redeployment, where necessary.</p><p>The Cabinet earlier this month - and again today - advanced work on the legislation necessary in a range of areas to mitigate the damaging effects of a no-deal Brexit.  There are multiple issues, including students who travel between Britain and Ireland, rail services and other public transport, healthcare, particularly cross-Border, and in the justice and social welfare areas.</p><p>As the House will be aware, it is proposed to group all the legislation affecting different sectors into one omnibus Bill.  This Bill will have 17 Parts focused on the broad themes of protecting the citizen and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs.  This will be complemented by a range of measures by way of statutory instrument.  Essentially, the legislation will be 17 Bills in one involving nine Departments, including the Department of the Taoiseach, and 28 statutory instruments or secondary Bills will be required to complement that.  I look forward to providing all of that detail to the House shortly.</p><p>I look forward to working closely with all parties and Oireachtas Members to ensure that this necessary Brexit legislation will pass through the Houses in a manner which allows for necessary scrutiny but also ensures its passage and enactment before 29 March 2019.</p><p>Our membership of the EU and the stability and solidarity it brings are central to our own preparations.  The approach in areas of EU competence has included the publication of more than 80 separate stakeholder notices to assist businesses and citizens in their preparations.</p><p>The Commission Contingency Actions Plans have provided some welcome reassurance in areas such as aviation and road haulage but have also emphasised the significant disruption resulting from a no-deal Brexit.  These plans have also helped to guide our domestic response.  It is also important to say that while they are providing temporary solutions in areas that would otherwise be in crisis post 29 March in a no-deal scenario, particularly aviation and haulage, those solutions are only temporary, by and large, between the end of March and the end of the year.</p><p>Stakeholder engagement is also critical.  We will convene a fifth plenary session of the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Friday, 15 February, in Dublin Castle.  These dialogues have been an invaluable opportunity to hear directly about the all-island implications of Brexit from a variety of stakeholders and across a wide range of sectors.</p><p>A no-deal outcome is not the one we want but given the ongoing political uncertainty in London, it is only prudent at this stage to intensify our preparations for a no deal.  As the Taoiseach repeatedly has said now, we are not preparing any longer.  We are putting the pieces in place, hoping that they will not be necessary but ensuring that we can do everything possible between now and the end of March, just in case.</p><p>I am grateful for the ongoing support of all political parties.  Parties we have a competitive relationship with politically have been helpful when it comes to Brexit.  That includes all parties represented in this House and the Lower House.</p><p>Regarding legislation, we are proposing that we will publish the heads of the omnibus legislation on Friday.  It will then go to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel., which has given a commitment to publish that Bill in its full detail on 22 February, so its officials will have just over three weeks to do that.  The following week, we will look to take it through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and the week after that, beginning 4 March, we will take Committee, Report and Final Stages in the D&aacute;il.  It will be the following week, beginning 11 March, that it will come into this House.  That will be the week in the build-up to St. Patrick's Day.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many Deputies will not be present, therefore, but there is no reason we cannot get the work done in this House, should it be necessary to do so at that point.</p><p>In general terms, my approach to this subject is not party political; rather, it is transparent and open.  Any Senators who need detailed briefings on Brexit will get them.  I am confident that we will all work together to ensure that any preparations which are necessary for Senators to do a professional job as legislators in passing highly significant legislation to protect citizens will be accommodated.  If we need to pass such legislation, we have a proposed process that can allow it to be done in time.  </p><p>Nevertheless, this is all contingency planning.  The real negotiation concerns how we can achieve an outcome that allows for the passing of a withdrawal agreement and a transition period of between two and four years to give everybody the time and space to plan for the new realities; that avoids the kind of crisis many people will face in the event of a no-deal Brexit, that provides the protections which the peace process on this island needs, and that provides the reassurance of no physical border infrastructure that is needed regardless of the outcomes of the political debates in the next few weeks.  There is little we can do, however, to provide clarity in those negotiations until we get clarity from Westminster, which we should have more of next Tuesday evening.  We might not have all the clarity we need but at least there will be votes on different options.  I look forward to the Prime Minister's response to those votes and her proposal of a way forward to which, I hope, we can respond in a helpful way.  </p><p>Let me be clear: Ireland does not propose any renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement or the backstop provision therein.  That is the position of both the EU and Ireland, and it was reiterated yesterday by Mr. Michel Barnier and in the past few days by Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker and Mr. Donald Tusk.  Despite yesterday's offer of an opinion by a Polish Minister who, it was subsequently clarified, was not speaking for the Polish Government, today in Brussels foreign Ministers lined up to reinforce the point that the position which I outline is the EU's position and that there is strong solidarity and unity behind it.  I hope that reality will be part of the debate in Westminster as we look to find solutions for the future which, I hope, we can find in a new, changed and more ambitious future relationship declaration, on which the EU wishes to work with the United Kingdom, if the British Government wants to move in that direction.  We will wait for a response in Westminster this week and next week, but the Irish position could not be clearer.  It has been the same position for 18 months and it will not change.</p></speech>

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste back to the House and I join him in condemning the car bomb in Derry at the weekend.  Most of us lived through decades of violence in the North.  We saw the futility of that violence, how useless it is and how it put many obstacles in the way of people of both traditions trying to work together.  Thanks be to God, we thought we had put it aside as we moved on from the Good Friday Agreement but where there is a vacuum in politics, there will always be evil, violent men and women ready to fill that vacuum.  It is incumbent on us, therefore, to continue to work for political solutions to the difficulties that face us, not only on Brexit but also in other areas.</p> <p>To date, the bipartisan approach to Brexit in Leinster House has been remarkable.</p></speech>
