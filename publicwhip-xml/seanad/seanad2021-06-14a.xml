I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, for taking it on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.</p> <p>My ask today seems very reasonable to me.  Those with epilepsy should have an entitlement to the free travel scheme.  Up to 40,000 people in Ireland live with epilepsy with approximately 1,200 of them in Louth.  I fully support Epilepsy Ireland's call to have the free travel scheme automatically extended to those who lose their driver licence due to a breakthrough seizure or where they automatically lose their licence for at least one year until they become one-year seizure free.  There is also a need to see the free travel scheme established in such a way whereby people can apply to receive the benefit directly.  The scheme is currently exclusively linked to other payments such as disability allowance and invalidity pension.  This would allow people who will never be able to drive and who do not qualify for the disability allowance or invalidity pension to apply directly for the scheme.</p> <p>I must be clear that we are not proposing that all 40,000 people with epilepsy be automatically given access to free travel.  Epilepsy Ireland loosely estimates that these proposals would benefit between 5,000 and 6,000 people with epilepsy as 70% of those living with the condition will go on to be seizure free.  For the remaining 30%, some will qualify for the State schemes such as disability allowance or invalidity pension.  The direct cost of bringing this number of people into the free travel scheme would be approximately &euro;500,000.</p> <p>There is no doubt that there will be an argument from the Department of potential flood gates of claims and the high costs involved.  However, we have a real obligation, in particular when we have accepted and signed up to the UN convention on persons with disabilities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Under that convention we have an obligation to enable people with disabilities to live independently and to participate fully in all parts of life.  There is an onus on us to reduce barriers.  If a person who has a driving licence, and is partaking normally like all the rest of us in society in education and work, has a seizure, he or she is put off the road for 12 months.  I have heard awful stories about people who are now unemployed or who had to give up education because they could not afford public transport or they did not have access to public transport.  I hope we get a positive reply from the Minister of State this morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#B00200"><p>I thank Senator McGreehan for raising this issue.  First and foremost, it is important to say that my answer is coming from the perspective of the Department of Social Protection, which administers the free travel scheme.  The free travel scheme provides free travel on public transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  There are two broad categories of people who can qualify for the free travel scheme.  The first group is those aged 66 and over who are resident in Ireland.  This wide category covers a significant number of the people to whom the Senator refers.  Second, those who qualify for certain social welfare payments may be eligible.  This second category of people includes those who are entitled to the blind pension, disability allowance, invalidity pension and carer's allowance, or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC regulations or one with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.</p> <p>Overall, there are approximately 999,000 people with direct eligibility, with an annual allocation of &euro;95 million provided to fund the scheme.  The majority of supports provided by the Department are provided via an income support approach.  While medical evidence is required to determine eligibility for certain social welfare schemes, medical evidence alone does not generally determine eligibility directly for the free travel scheme.  Generally, eligibility for a particular social welfare payment must also be confirmed.</p> <p>If the free travel scheme were to be extended on the basis of medical evidence alone, regardless of whether a person is in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications in order to adjudicate eligibility, thereby significantly changing the nature of the scheme.  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme in such a manner would require additional funding and significant administrative changes and, accordingly, any proposed change could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  However, a very important point to note is that there is a mechanism whereby people who cannot reasonably meet their transport costs from their own resources can apply for financial assistance.  The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme administered by my Department is designed to enable persons to seek assistance in the form of an exceptional needs payment where they cannot meet a necessary cost from their own resources.  Under the SWA, my Department may award an emergency needs payment for travel costs where the circumstances of a particular case so warrant.</p> <p>Every decision is based on consideration of the individual circumstances, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.  Figures available to me for 2019 show that there were 17,214 emergency needs payments made in respect of travel needs, with payments totalling &euro;1.2 million.  It is important that people are made aware of the SWA and the availability of the emergency needs payment for costs, including travel costs, that cannot be reasonably met from their own resources.</p></speech>

In part, I pre-empted his response.  We have an obligation to open up the world for every single citizen.  Under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we have an obligation to reduce and eliminate obstacles and barriers to accessibility.  I hope the Minister of State will go back to the Department and say that we must look again at the scheme.  We can see how much has changed on a range of issues since the arrival of Covid.  We should not do something just because it has been done in the same way for so long.  Let us look at the situation and see how we can provide free travel or more opportunity for people and make their lives easier.  We all agree that there are hidden costs attached to disability.  This is another hidden cost.  I thank the Minister of State for the information on the SWA scheme.  I am sure that has helped and will help, but it will not help everybody.</p></speech>

I understand the situation personally because my father faced this issue in that any time he had an epileptic episode he was off the road for 12 months.  Any extensions to the eligibility criteria to the free travel scheme can only be considered while taking account of the objectives of the scheme as well as funding.  Any decision that could result in significant extra funding requirements and additional administrative measures for a scheme could only be considered in the wider context of overall budgetary negotiations.  I remind Senator McGreehan about the SWA option as well.  I will bring the issue to the attention of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, when I speak to her later this morning.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, is very welcome.  I raise the issue of the costs faced by the over-70s and ask the Government to consider increasing the help provided to them.  In 2018, a &euro;2.50 weekly increase was introduced to assist those aged over 70 with their telephone line costs.  This works out at &euro;130 a year, but the cost of renting a landline is &euro;504 a year.  That is a significant amount for somebody over 70 who is on a very low income.  Many such people are living alone and the telephone is their only means of communication with their family and friends.  In these Covid times many people have been spending a lot of time at home.  What highlighted the issue for me was when I received a letter from an 89-year-old man to say that because he is on the basic pension he does not have a television.  While his TV licence would be free the cost of the different stations is prohibitive.  He also found it was too expensive for him to have a telephone.  His letter highlighted for me the difficulties of people who are on a low income.  During these Covid times, when people have gone through so much, they have relied more on the television for company and on the telephone to make calls.  It is time that we looked at the allowances that are paid to the over-70s to see if there is any way we can give them a helping hand.  People are living longer but the situation is very difficult on people aged over 70.</p> <p>While much has been done to increase the pension in recent years, for some time there were no increases or even partial cuts.  It is very welcome that the pension was increased by &euro;5 in the last budget, but there are other issues that we need to examine.  People can only get the telephone allowance if they are in receipt of certain social welfare payments such as the living alone allowance and the fuel allowance.  An older person who is living with a family member likes to pay his or her own bills and to have his or her independence.  I would appreciate if the Government could examine the situation.  I know it is early, in that the budget will take place in October, but I am sure many Departments are looking at their budgets, so for that reason it is an opportune time to highlight the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#B00700"><p>I thank Senator Maria Byrne for raising this matter.  The telephone support allowance, TSA, which was announced in budget 2018 is a weekly payment of &euro;2.50 equating to &euro;130 per year.  Approximately 136,000 customers are currently in receipt of the TSA payment.  The estimated full-year cost of the scheme is more than &euro;18 million.  The primary objective of the TSA is to support the most vulnerable people at risk of isolation, including the elderly and those with disabilities, with access to personal alarms or phones for security.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=JoeOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Therefore, the criteria for the allowance were framed in order to direct the limited resources available to the Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  People who live alone are considered among those most at risk of social isolation.  This payment, along with the living alone allowance, is also in part a recognition of the greater challenges facing those living alone in avoiding poverty.  The deprivation rate of couples over 65 is less than half that recorded among those over that age who live alone.  </p><p>To receive the TSA, a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, the living alone allowance and the means-tested fuel allowance.  Qualifying core payments for the TSA include payments such as the contributory or non-contributory State pension and the widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension.  Many of the people who are in receipt of qualifying payments for the TSA would already be over the age of 70.</p><p>The living alone allowance is paid to pensioners aged 66 and over who live alone and are in receipt of the State pension or certain other social welfare payments.  It is also paid to people under 66 who live alone and are in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment.  The estimated number of recipients of the living alone allowance in 2021 is over 220,000 and the estimated full year cost of the scheme in 2021 is over &euro;217 million.  </p><p>I am very aware that the living alone allowance is a very important support for vulnerable customers who live alone.  CSO surveys on income and living conditions consistently show that those aged 65 and over who live alone are more likely to be at risk of poverty than people living in multiperson households.  Recent ESRI research from July 2020 supports these findings by highlighting the crucial importance of the living alone allowance in minimising the risk of poverty for this group of people.  That is why in budget 2021 we increased the living alone allowance by &euro;5, bringing the payment up from &euro;14 to &euro;19 per week, at a cost of over &euro;57 million.  Together with the increase provided in budget 2020, the living alone allowance has almost doubled in the last two years.  </p><p>All schemes operated by the Department are constantly reviewed and any decision to change their qualifying criteria would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p></speech>

I am trying to highlight the fact that the cost of everything is increasing and we need to review the schemes in that context.  People are finding it difficult to pay their bills, especially those on lower incomes.  Many pensioners are solely reliant on the State pension of approximately &euro;258 per week.  I ask that the Department would review the allowances in the context of costs going up.  Many people are cutting costs to try to cover other things and this needs to be looked at in that context.   I acknowledge that the TSA provides &euro;130 towards the cost of a telephone but it is &euro;504 for a landline.  I also acknowledge that the living alone allowance was increased to &euro;19 per week, which is great, but there are still people in very difficult circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#C00300"><p>I thank Senator Byrne.  I accept that the situation is as she describes but would reiterate that the primary objective of the TSA is to support vulnerable people most at risk of social isolation, including the elderly and those with disabilities, by providing them with access to personal alarms or phones for security.  Therefore, the criteria for the allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to the Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  As can be seen from recent budget measures supported by evidence-based research, the Government is targeting increases in relevant payments to support the most vulnerable customers.  The increase provided for in budget 2021 means that in 2021, living alone allowance recipients now receive &euro;19 per week in addition to their primary social welfare payment, or a total of &euro;988 over the course of this year.  This budget measure represents a 36% increase in the value of this payment.</p> <p>This increase is particularly important in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Since March 2020 the pandemic has changed our lives profoundly.  These are difficult times for many people, especially the vulnerable and the elderly, particularly those who are living alone.  Therefore, the increase in the living alone allowance payment was an appropriate policy response.  Together with the increase provided for in budget 2020, the living alone allowance has almost doubled in the last two years.

I tabled this Commencement matter following a lot of engagement with small farmers.  I visited a number of farms in the last few days in County Laois.  The farms I am talking about are small, traditional land holdings with Land Commission houses.  Such farms are common in counties Cavan and Kerry.  I was in Cavan last week and was also in Kerry, Clare, Galway and Wicklow.  On all occasions I was there by appointment and visited small land holdings.  The Minister of State will be very familiar with such farms which are generally no bigger than 30 to 50 acres.</p> <p>To be fair to these farmers, they run holistic, sustainable little farms.  They are farms that have been successful at outdoor rearing of cattle all year round.  It is possible to successfully out-winter cattle in certain places where the ground is firm.  They have tailored their farming husbandry and methods to the tight constraints of their farms and are successful.  </p> <p>I spoke to a farmer in County Clare who has had no vet visit his farm in three years and whose animals have not been injected with any veterinary products.  He has approximately 15 head of cattle and runs a very small but concentrated operation, with some off-farm supplementary income.  His farm is sustainable, holistic and can be loosely described as organic in that there is no use of fertiliser and luckily, no veterinary interventions.  </p> <p>I acknowledge the success of the three green low-carbon agri-environment schemes, GLAS.  They are good for farmers, farming and the environment.  I also acknowledge the extension of GLAS, which some farmers availed of successfully.  In the early stages of GLAS in 2017, ring feeders were in operation but their use was stopped.  Under GLAS, a lot of farmers converted to low-input permanent pasture, LIPP, but the knock-on effect of LIPP was to reduce holdings in terms of grazing.  That was a scheme for which funding was available.  </p> <p>Farmers want to continue the practice of out-wintering where possible.  It is not always possible and very much depends on ground conditions and many other issues.  They believe they can do it but want some assurances in the context of CAP.  Who will represent the interests of the small farmers who operate in this way in the context of CAP?  These farmers are engaged in safe farming practices.  They are not spreading slurry at any time or using other fertilisers.  They have a rotation grazing system in place and are careful not to overgraze.  They are conscious that it is in their own interests to have a sustainable farm operation.  Profitability is important to them but so is their land.  They are the custodians of the land, which is important.</p> <p>How can we support these farmers and who will do so?  Can they continue to use ring-feeders, albeit moving them around the farm?  Can they continue to use them in order to feed silage to their animals?</p></speech>

It is good to hear that he was in County Laois at the weekend.</p> <p>Government Departments and their agencies work collaboratively to collectively protect water quality in Ireland.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is the lead authority for the nitrates regulations and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine implements and operates the nitrates derogation.  The current nitrates action programme and nitrates derogation are in place from 2018 to 2021, inclusive.  Ireland has commenced the process of reviewing the nitrates regulations.  Initial consultation closed on 15 January this year but a second consultation is planned to commence shortly.  I invite Senator Boyhan and any other interested parties to contribute to that consultation.  In parallel, Ireland is meeting the European Commission and presenting at the EU's nitrates committee with a view to renewing a nitrates action programme for 2022.  </p> <p>Unlike other EU member states, Ireland has both nitrogen and phosphorous measures within the regulatory framework.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pippa Hackett:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This contributes to additional protection of waters and the environment.  However, every farmer has a role to play in protection of the environment whether they are extensive or intensive farmers.  While there are concessions within the current regulations, SI No. 605 of 2017, for the out-wintering of livestock, additional conditions are included such as: out-wintered livestock have free access at all times to the required land; the amount of manure produced on the holdings does not exceed an amount containing 140 kg of nitrogen per ha per annum; and severe damage to the surface of the land by poaching does not occur.<br/><br/>Small amounts of phosphorous, even from extensive systems of farming, can cause ecological issues to water quality and management of the landscape is critical to minimise any potential losses, especially sediment and phosphorous losses from mismanagement of ring feeders.  Detailed research in the agricultural catchments programme has highlighted that soils, weather and farming practices have a significant influence on the nutrient concentrations at the local scale.  This has important implications for selecting the right measures while also managing farm practices.  Ireland's heterogenous landscape means that measures need to be targeted to achieve the best environmental outcomes.  <br/><br/>The next CAP can influence interventions at farm level.  The development of the CAP strategic plan involves a number of stages including strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, SWOT, analysis, needs assessment, intervention design, financial allocations, target setting and governance systems.  The draft CAP strategic plan will also be subject to an <i>ex-ante</i>evaluation, strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment, including a public consultation on the draft CAP strategic plan and draft environmental report.  <br/><br/>The Minister and Ministers of State have, with our officials, continued to engage extensively with stakeholders on the future of CAP.  Consultations on the development of the CAP strategic plan will continue via the CAP consultative committee, which comprises representatives of the main stakeholders, including farm bodies, non-government organisations, NGOs, industry representatives and academic representation.  It also includes representatives from many Departments and Government agencies, including Bord Bia, Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  The committee has met on 18 occasions with further meetings planned throughout 2021.  Details of the discussions to date are available on the Government website.<br/><br/>The negotiations on CAP are continuing at EU level with intensive negotiations between the European Parliament, Presidency and Commission continuing with a view to reaching agreement at the Council of Ministers meeting on 28 and 29 June.  The Department is continuing to develop the CAP strategic plan in consultation with stakeholders through the CAP consultative committee and other forums.  Consideration is currently being given to measures that will be supported under the new CAP strategic plan and stakeholders will be further consulted on this shortly.  Following the consultation, the draft plan will then be subject to strategic environmental assessment, the <i>ex-ante </i>evaluation and further public consultation processes before submission to the Commission by the deadline of 1 January 2022.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Minister of State had to cover a lot of ground.  However, the real focus I am attempting in my question is on small farmers throughout this country who are sustaining rural communities with a maximum of 40 acres and cannot be given permission to build for in-house cattle.  That is why they are out-wintering in the first place.  We have cut stone in beautiful parts of the world in the west of Ireland.  These farms are small and sustainable.  Their principal income does not derive from farming.  Out-wintering is an essential part of farming that sustains these rural communities.  They want to be able to keep small numbers of stock outside with no fertiliser or spreading of slurry.  They are using their facilities.  We want to keep these people on the land and in their communities in a sustainable way.  I ask the Minister of State to look at some future guidelines that perhaps focus on this small cohort of farmers who wish to continue to be successful in farming in their rural communities up and down this country.  I again thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response.</p></speech>

They are indeed vital to rural areas.  Whether they are full time or part time does not matter much to me at all.  It is about how the land is managed and the water protected.  If we can do that through supporting small farmers to maintain livestock, it is even better.  At the end of the day, it comes down to how the land is managed and the water protected.  We will absolutely do everything we can to support farmers to keep farming in these areas.  It is a part of Ireland we still have that is very unique and we need to cling to it.  I am happy to engage further on this offline if the Senator wishes.  It is a good plan and certainly something I support.</p></speech>

It affects many thousands of workers in this country who provide professional services to the State through local authorities, the HSE, Departments or whatever it might be.  They include engineers, medical staff, lawyers and anybody providing professional services to the State.  In those circumstances, 20% is deducted from their earnings at the end of the year to cover their tax liability because these people are self-assessed taxpayers.</p> <p>Most people are pay as you earn, PAYE, workers and their income tax is deducted at source, which is very convenient, but for self-assessed, and very often self-employed, taxpayers the State takes a 20% chunk at source.  This taxpayer only gets paid &euro;800 on a fee of &euro;1,000.  That might sound harsh but can in fact be a major advantage to the individual because it means that person has a 20% tax credit at the end of the year.  It is of significant benefit to the State's cash flow because it means the money is available to it from the word go, as opposed to waiting a year until a tax return is filed and paid, etc.</p> <p>I raise the issue today to suggest it might be worth the Department's time to consider allowing those people who fall into the professional services withholding tax bracket, to opt to pay at the 40% rather than 20% rate.  Any of them likely to fall into that marginal rate may choose to pay the tax at 40%.  To be absolutely clear, I am not suggesting that would be a tax increase on any of them.  I am suggesting the professional services withholding tax would be collected in a different way.  Rather than taking a 20% chunk at source, we would take 40%.  The idea is the person has a 40% rather than 20% tax credit at the end of year.  </p> <p>Why is that useful for individuals?  In the first instance, if it is not I suggest they do not opt for it.  The idea is this would be available to them so they can choose to go down this road if they want.  Second, as a self-employed person who has been in this situation, it is tremendously helpful, at the end of the year when so many bills are due and there are many other things that need to be paid, to be able to say that the bulk, or all, of my tax is already paid.  It means not having to worry about that extra bill at the end of the year. </p> <p>From the State's perspective, there is clearly an advantage.  From a cash-flow and certainty of receipts position, the State knows exactly how much it has taken from those people providing professional services.  It has that 40% in the bank, as it were, without creating cash-flow difficulties for the Exchequer.  Obviously, if the person who opted to pay 40% does not make it into the top rate of tax then he or she is entitled to a rebate.  However, there is still an advantage, both to the taxpayer who is better able to manage his or her tax affairs as the end of the year approaches, and to the State, which resolves a potential cash-flow issue.  We constantly monitor Exchequer returns throughout the year to see what level they are coming in at.  This creates a much greater level of certainty for the Exchequer regarding people who fall into this category.  </p> <p>I ask the Minister of State if the Department will consider creating this option for mostly self-employed, professional service providers to the State when they are paying tax at source.  Much like PAYE workers, they will be able to opt to pay it at the higher rate to reduce the liability that might fall on them at the end of the year.  This will help their cash-flow management and will also provide for greater cash-flow management for the Exchequer.</p></speech>

When I saw this particular Commencement matter, I felt it was extraordinary that someone would want to opt to pay tax at 40%, but I knew straightaway what was behind it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Professional services withholding tax, PSWT, is a deduction at the standard rate of income tax at 20% from relevant payments made by accountable persons to specified persons.  They are the service providers in respect of certain professional services.  The tax deducted is a payment on account.  I stress that.  It is not, and was never intended to be, a payment to cover the tax liability for the year.  It was always only a payment on account.  That is the key point I want to make.  It is against a person's specified final liability for the year with the amount of PSWT deducted credit against the tax liability for the full year.  "Specified person" can include businesses undertaken via a company, sole trade or a partnership.</p><p>"Accountable persons" include Government Departments, State agencies and bodies, local authorities, colleges and authorised medical insurance providers.  The definition of "professional services" covers a wide range of services such as medical, architectural, engineering, financial, legal and geological services.  Upon making a relevant payment, an accountable person will issue a certificate, known as an F45 form, to the specified person showing details of the payment and the tax deducted.  The legislation provides that a specified person may, in certain circumstances, make a claim for a refund of PSWT in the year in which it is deducted, referred to as an interim refund.  Among the requirements for the making of an interim refund claim is the requirement that the specified person's profits for the previous period have been finalised and that the tax due for that period has been paid.  All claims must be accompanied by the relevant F45s.  Any refund due will be processed and made by Revenue.  That is the people at the other end of the scale, who are looking for a refund.  They might feel the 20% was excessive in their particular case when the costs of running their particular service are taken into account.  It is proposed to introduce electronic professional services withholding tax, EPSWT, from 1 July 2021, which is in the next fortnight or so.  Section 13 of the Finance Act 2020 provides for an electronic payment notification via Revenue Online Service, ROS, and the ending of the paper P45 form.  I am sorry, I meant F45 form.  I should not have mentioned the P45 in this context.</p><p>As an accountable person applies a deduction to a relevant payment it is not possible for a specified person to choose the tax rate which is applied to this relevant payment.  As the query relates to PSWT being withheld at 40% as opposed to 20%, I will focus my following comments on self-employed individuals, because it is all about the persons concerned.  For the income tax year 2021, an individual is subject to tax at 20% on income up to &euro;35,300 and 40% thereafter.  An individual will also qualify for a personal tax credit and an earned income tax credit totalling &euro;3,300.  The result of this is a lower effective income tax rate than 40% on an individual's income.  It is also important to note that an individual is subject to PSWT on his or her gross income, that is, before any deductions incurred wholly and exclusively in the trade such as insurance, rent, salaries, etc.  A self-assessed individual must pay preliminary tax for the year equal to, or more than, the lowest amount of the following: 90% of the tax due for that tax year; 100% of the tax due for the immediately previous tax year; or 105% of the tax due for the tax year preceding the immediately previous tax year.  This option only applies where a person pays by direct debit.</p><p>An individual can choose to pay additional preliminary tax throughout the year should he or she believe his or her current year tax liability will be higher than the previous tax year.  Revenue has advised that there are a number of options available to self-employed individuals to make payments on account in respect of their income tax liability throughout the year on the Revenue Online Service using a ROS debit instruction, or via MyAccount using a debit instruction.  These systems will accept bank account details or debit or credit cards.  A third option exists where an individual can apply for a direct debit instruction.  There is, therefore, an option for persons to pay the additional tax as the year goes on, depending on how they expect their own situation to evolve.</p></speech>

I welcome the electronic element of this that is coming.  It is absolutely welcome and Revenue is generally very good at putting these things online.  I am delighted to hear the Minister of State saying this is all about the individual because that is exactly where I am coming from.  The question I am asking is whether this is something Revenue will do or will consider doing.  Of course we can make voluntary tax payments during the year but that does not reflect the reality of how people work with respect to their tax affairs.</p> <p>The Minister of State has mentioned this is a payment.  My proposal would be an option for individual taxpayers.  It would allow them to choose to pay at the 40% initially, on account, as it were, and to have that money banked with respect to their liability at the end of the year.  I recognise it is not to pay their liability but it helps to pay their liability and gives them a huge advantage when it comes to the end of the year.  I am wondering if the Government will give people the option to do that, to recognise the reality of tax flow problems, particularly for self-employed professional services providers.</p></speech>

The 20% withholding tax applies to vast areas, including ones people will have seen much discussion of, such as some investment funds.  There was an exception made there and it was brought up to 25% for some particular categories but right across the board there is a 20% withholding tax rate and Revenue has said that by and large - I do not have the statistics to hand - that covers the liability for most people.  There are many people who, when all the expenses of their businesses are taken into account, fall into the category where their maximum top tax rate is 20%.  I understand some people will certainly be paying at 40% but I am told the vast majority of those receiving this would not be in that category when the expenses of the business are taken into account.  I will say that should an individual believe his or her current tax liability will be higher than it was the previous year, he or she can choose to pay additional preliminary tax through the year.  I know the Senator said that is not the normal way but many people run their lives by ordering only so much heating oil per month and pay it that way rather than a bill every time the lorry comes to fill the oil tank.  People pay their electricity bill and many people pay their bills on a monthly basis, and there is provision there for circumstances where a person feels he or she has a requirement to do so.  However, I am not in a position to say there can be that option for the 40%.</p></speech>

I am raising the question of the Courtown Hotel emergency direct provision centre, which was opened just over two years ago, to try to get clarity on its future, particularly for the residents there, of whom there are about 36.  The International Protection Service, IPAS, indicated in March that it would be informing residents they would be moved on in the coming months.  That was the extent of the clarity we got.  The communication with residents has been far from ideal.  Indeed, it seems IPAS has only been communicating with certain residents.  In some cases the residents have been told they must move with less than two weeks' notice, and in some cases, only two days' notice.  Very limited information is given to the families as to where they may have to move to.  I must say I can empathise because emails I have sent to IPAS seeking clarity have gone either unacknowledged or unanswered.</p> <p>Some of the residents there are students of Riverchapel National School or Creagh College, a secondary school, and obviously the schools would like to see those students being able to finish out the school year.  There have been some assurances sought on that but it has not yet happened.  There are six families with children due to go into third year this September; they have started on the junior certificate process but they do not have certainty.  The Minister of State will appreciate the difficulty of students moving into an exam year being told they are being uprooted and a different school will have to be found for them.  Some of the residents have secured employment in the County Wexford area, or indeed in Dublin and are now being told they must move.  In the case of one family, even though they made clear they had a hospital appointment in Kilkenny for 10 June, IPAS told them they would be moving on 8 June.  IPAS said it would arrange a transfer by taxi from County Monaghan to Kilkenny for the family concerned.</p> <p>I am aware that on 10 June the Minister met with the Wexford Sanctuary Ambassadors.  Among the ambassadors were Sufyan and Mariam, two of the residents in Courtown.  They had been ambassadors talking about the importance of Ireland as a place of sanctuary.  They sought clarity from the Minister not just for the residents of Courtown but more generally, that there be greater communication from IPAS to residents of direct provision centres.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I know what some of those families have experienced.  From speaking with them, I know they have experienced war, political oppression and hardship.  They have been waiting a long period and we have many problems with direct provision and the speed with which the cases of these families are being addressed.  In north Wexford these families have been welcomed and I pay tribute in particular to Mr. John Kelly in Wexford Local Development, Ms Mandi Tighe with Gorey Youth Needs, Ms Tiffy Allen of Places of Sanctuary Ireland, as well as the wider community, which has made these families feel welcome within the community.  They took part in community activities.  Mariam, one of the women I mentioned, was a tailor by profession and she manufactured 4,000 face masks in the early days of the pandemic and when we were under pressure sourcing personal protective equipment.</p><p>These are families who want to contribute, who have got involved and who have made the north Wexford area their home over the past two years.  Their kids are in the local school and they have helped local community organisations.  At the very least they are entitled to have some information about what is going on but IPAS has not provided it.  I am hoping the Minister of State can provide the answers.</p></speech>

This response has been drafted by departmental officials and perhaps we can get further into the more human side of what the Senator has raised afterwards.</p> <p>There are currently 37 residents in the Courtown emergency accommodation centre, with five residents leaving the centre on Tuesday, 8 June, to move to dedicated accommodation, as the Senator alluded to.  These accommodation centres are at various locations around the country and a further ten residents moved on Friday, 11 June.  It is expected the remaining 37 residents will move to new accommodation before the end of July.</p> <p>The transfer of residents from the Courtown emergency accommodation centre is part of the normal policy to move people out of emergency accommodation and into more permanent accommodation centres subject to the national standards for accommodation offered to people in the international protection process and to regular inspections as soon as possible.</p> <p>In arranging the moves, the international protection accommodation service, or IPAS, of the Department has sought to take account of families' individual needs.  For example, families with children sitting State exams will not be moved until after the exams have been completed.  I hope that brings clarity for the families mentioned by the Senator.  All of the families that are moving will be accommodated in centres that provide for independent living where they can choose and prepare their own meals.  Some are moving to own-door accommodation and all families and single people will be accommodated in centres with staff who are trained to assist their residents to find the supports they need in their locality.</p> <p>All dedicated accommodation centres also have a "friends of the centre" group, comprising residents, staff and local volunteers to assist with the integration of residents into the community and to promote relationships with local groups, such as Tidy Towns committees, sports clubs, Men's Sheds and mother and baby clubs.</p> <p>IPAS officials visited Courtown on 12 March and subsequently held an online clinic with residents on 25 March.  They also attended the centre on Tuesday and Friday last to assist residents with their move.  IPAS has engaged fully with local services, including Tusla, Wexford Local Development and an NGO, Places of Sanctuary, in dealing with the centre and its residents.  It is great that we are talking to all these organisations but the most important group to speak with are the families.  Listening to the Senator's contribution, it seems that was missing.  The officials will continue to assist families to settle into their new accommodation and ensure they are linked with all of the services they need in their new locations, such as school places and access to health services.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, met residents of a number of centres, including several residents of the Courtown emergency centre, at an online meeting with Places of Sanctuary on Thursday, 10 June.  That meeting involved a wide-ranging discussion about all aspects of direct provision and the international protection process with people who are at different stages.  This included people living in direct provision whose applications have still to be determined; people who have been granted international protection and have moved out of direct provision accommodation; and people who have been granted status but are still living in direct provision accommodation.</p> <p>Places of Sanctuary subsequently wrote to the Minister to relay some further concerns regarding the process by which residents at Courtown have been informed of intended moves to other accommodation centres.  The Minister will be following up on these matters with IPAS officials directly.  He will also be following up with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, on a number of other matters raised at the meeting, including case processing times at the international protection office and the International Protection Appeals Tribunal and the processing of applications for family reunification.</p> <p>As Senators are aware, the White Paper to end direct provision, which was published by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, at the end of February, includes a commitment to put in place a systematic programme to move away from reliance on emergency accommodation as quickly as possible.  This is a key element of the White Paper work schedule for 2021.  A decision will require a visit by the Department's officials to Courtown and a critical look at accommodation capacity across the network and at how best to achieve the goal of moving away from reliance on emergency accommodation as soon as possible.  Officials of the Department have communicated regularly with the owner and manager of the centre and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

I appreciate there is a broader issue around case processing times as it will provide greater clarity on the broader question of direct provision.  It is completely unjust that families must wait so long to get an answer to their case, although I know it is a Government priority to address that.</p> <p>I am sorry but I strongly dispute the argument where IPAS claims it has fully engaged with the local community and residents.  If it had fully engaged, I would not be standing here today and local schools would not have contacted me to express concern.  The local representatives of voluntary organisations and the NGO, Places of Sanctuary, would not have contacted me to express that concern.  Major concerns clearly remain about the lack of communication from IPAS.  Frankly, as I know from past experience, I do not have confidence in the ability of IPAS to communicate its message.  It does not matter if it communicates it to me or anybody else, as the most important people here are the residents.  It is clear that IPAS has failed to communicate to those residents.</p> <p>I ask for a very clear commitment after today's debate that IPAS would set out a clear programme of communication with residents and local organisations that are involved with this.  If I have specific questions, it should finally, after all the emails I have sent, get back to me.</p></speech>

I will take all of this to the Minister, as I am deputising for him today.  I will ask the Minister to engage directly with the Senator and have the conversation about what systems are being put in place for that direct communication.</p> <p>I have also heard about the six families with young people heading to do their junior certificate and they have made bonds of friendship in the school.  It is a broader element that must be considered and a conversation must take place on that as well.  I will tell the Minister about this exactly.  I have no doubt I understand precisely why the schools have contacted the Senator.  I apologise to the families for the lack of communication and when I take this to the Minister, perhaps we will rectify the position because of today's discussion.</p></speech>

The building belonging to the Technological University, TU, of Dublin on the Lower Rathmines Road has been vacated because of the university's relocation to the Grangegorman campus.  Space is now available to the Department of Education in the substantial buildings and prefabs on the former TU Dublin site.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A proposal to temporarily accommodate the Harcourt Terrace Educate Together school within the main building vacated by the Technological University Dublin, TU Dublin, has been made by the Department, with a site visit undertaken by the Educate Together school principal last week.  Rathmines College of Further Education, which is located in Rathmines Town Hall directly across the road, has been experiencing a severe shortage of classroom space for some time, and has requested that space be allocated on a long-term basis within the main building, which has been designed for third level education and was originally part of the College of Commerce there.  Facilities in that main building include steep staircases and limited basement toilets, making the building less suitable for the needs of primary school children, in terms of health and safety requirements, and make it more suitable for third level students.  A number of prefab buildings, including a kitchen and staff area and a general purpose room, and access to outdoor yard areas, indicate that the prefabs may be a more suitable temporary location for the Educate Together school community while it awaits the completion of its new Harcourt Terrace school in two years' time.  Rathmines College of Further Education is in need of classroom space for its more than 700 students who are cramped in the current facilities in the Rathmines Town Hall.</p><p>A move would allow for the restoration of the stunning but disused 19th century Rathmines concert hall inside the town hall building.  That amenity could be brought back into use as a civic, cultural and educational amenity for the whole community.  I and other representatives in the area have formed a group called the Friends of Rathmines Town Hall, and we have been working on the possibility of the restoration of the concert hall there.  The town hall and the former DIT conservatory of music buildings were visited by the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, and his officials in the last two weeks.  The Minister of State's Department seems enthusiastic that the project be realised with co-operation between his Department, the Department of Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and in the first instance the Department of Education.  I fully appreciate that there is a short-term need for accommodation at the Rathmines campus, and I fully appreciate that restoration of the concert hall in the Rathmines Town Hall building will take time, but I ask that the Departments in question, and especially the Minister of State's Department and the Department of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, would look at the needs of Rathmines College of Further Education and facilitate the sharing of the space, which has now been vacated by the Technological University Dublin, and that all interests can be progressed in parallel so the Rathmines College of Further Education can have the classrooms and other facilities it so vitally needs at this stage.  I am interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say about this.</p></speech>

The Senator will be aware that in April 2018, a 600 pupil post-primary school that will act as a regional solution for the Dublin 2 and Dublin 4 school planning area was announced.  In 2019, my Department acquired the former Dublin Institute of Technology Rathmines building to accommodate this post-primary school.  This post-primary school was originally to open in 2021 but for various reasons, including that the additional residential development has not yet materialised, the opening has been deferred.  Nevertheless, the future requirement for the school remains and the Department is currently planning for the provision of the required accommodation at this location.  When the Department acquired the property, it was leased back to TU Dublin, which originally owned the building.  TU Dublin vacated the building in February 2020 on its move to its new campus at Grangegorman.  In February 2021, the Department entered a short-term lease with City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, for it to lease the building from February 2021 to the end of June 2021.  At the time, the Department advised the CDETB that it could not commit to a longer lease as it was unclear if the building would be required to meet school needs for the 2021-2022 school year.  The Department indicated that should the building not be required for use as a school for that year the Department would be open to extension of the lease for a further 12 months.</p> <p>The Senator will be aware that each year my Department has to make arrangements for temporary accommodation for schools where delivery of the permanent solution for the school may not be available for the upcoming school year.  A number of schools are being looked at in this regard across the south Dublin area.  Following a review of school requirements for the 2021-2022 school year and the development schedule for the Harold's Cross site it was concluded that there would be insufficient room for the Harcourt Terrace school to remain on the site for the 2021-2022 school year.  The Rathmines building was identified as a temporary location for the Harcourt Terrace Educate Together national school for the next number of years pending the development of their permanent at school at Harcourt Terrace.  Unfortunately, no alternative suitable facilities could be identified in the area for the Harcourt Terrace Educate Together national school.</p> <p>The Department reviewed the facilities in the Rathmines building to identify how best it could be used and whether it could support the co-location of a number of entities.  Following this assessment, however, it was identified that the building had a number of severe limitations, in particular the limited number of toilets and the location of toilets within the building.  Unfortunately, the layout of the building does not support the subdividing of the building for use by different users where there would be a need to separate those users, as would be the case if primary school-aged pupils were to share the building with adult students who would attend a college of further education.  While there are a number of modular units located in a yard attached to the building, the primary school pupils would be using this yard as a play area.  Again, it would not appropriate to have primary-aged pupils and adult students sharing the one area.</p> <p>I note what the Senator has said about the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, visiting the building recently, and I note the Senator's proposals to the Ministers, Deputies Catherine Martin and Simon Harris.  I appreciate the difficult circumstances faced by the Rathmines College of Further Education around the space available to it and the capacity it has.  The Senator referred to the cramped facilities and I will bring this to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Foley, as well as the other Ministers.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting that anything permanent be done in the short term.  What is not generally known among the citizens of Dublin is that in the old Rathmines Town Hall there was an auditorium that could accommodate some 2,000 people, which was before fire safety.   It was a big concert hall that was used as a cinema and as a public meeting space and the like.  Due to constraints in the past 20 years the College of Commerce in Rathmines, or its predecessor, put in a series of what are effectively prefab subdivisions on the ground floor of this substantial auditorium.  If one can imagine the area of the auditorium, please consider the area of this Chamber where we now sit.  Imagine where the Acting Chairperson is now sitting and this ground floor being covered in prefab internal structures, and the space above just left as a void.  That is the situation that exists in Rathmines Town Hall.  It is a real tragedy that it ever happened.  I have looked at the former DIT technical institute building in Rathmines.  There are serious limitations around toilet accommodation no matter who uses it, because it is in a basement and so on.  I fully appreciate that the Minister has plans to build a second level school in the area.  The interests of all these educational institutions and the local community can be looked at together and in the round.  It would be a huge advantage for a school such as the one proposed to be built on this site, to have a major performing space for its purposes also.  I ask that the Minister of State would keep an open mind on the matter and that irreversible decisions should not be made on silo thinking.  There is a broader local interest to be taken into account between a number of very valuable educational institutions.</p></speech>

It is important that there is no silo thinking, especially when we are talking about education.  The Senator appreciates the fact that an Educate Together national school will go into the old Rathmines DIT site from August, and that eventually a post-primary school will go in there also.  There is no other place to put these particular schools, and this is the plan from the Department of Education's perspective.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Josepha Madigan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> A collaborative aspect that would involve all the different Departments, including those overseen by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who the Senator said is enthusiastic about the performance space aspect, can be considered.  It also applies to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.  It is a real shame when an establishment such as the Rathmines College of Further Education does not have sufficient capacity and is limited.  There must be a way to work towards a solution and if everybody puts their minds together, something fruitful could come out of it.</p></speech>

As we see the return of football, I commend the Kildare players on their terrific win against Meath yesterday.  I am sure the Leader does not mind me saying it.  I also congratulate the Kildare ladies who played against our other neighbours in Laois.</p> <p>This week is Men's Health Week.  It is a week when we raise awareness of preventable men's issues.  The theme for this week is making the connections - check in, check up and check it out.  That is an important message to send out to all men.  We rightly spend quite a bit of time talking about women's health issues in the Chamber and it is important to acknowledge the health issues men may have.  </p> <p>I want to talk about domestic abuse and how it impacts men.  The statistics indicate that one in seven men suffers domestic abuse but only 5% ever report it.  Only one national group deals with domestic abuse for men which is Men's Aid Ireland.  It operates in Dublin and has four outreach clinics.  Its phone number is 01 5543811.  We have no domestic shelter in the country for men who may need to take their children from difficult situations and it is time that we had.  I call on the Government to explore establishing a domestic abuse shelter for men in this country.  </p> <p>We now know that 500 testaments to the mother and baby homes commission were not used which is very shocking.  It is very clear that the terms of reference establishing the commission were flawed.  It is very regrettable that the commissioners will not appear before the Oireachtas committee.  Ultimately, the report is flawed.  I welcome that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has said that he is seeking independent international advice in terms of judging the report and judging also these 500 submissions.  It is important that we get redress for the victims who have been so severely impacted by all of this.</p> <p>I know many of us have received correspondence regarding Justice for Reggie, the awareness campaign relating to dog theft and puppy farming.  The campaign is named after a 12-week-old Labrador that was sold and had a really difficult death three days later.  We need much more legislation.  We need greater regulation of online selling sites.  We need a pet register.  We need stricter sanctions for vets who knowingly sign off on ill dogs.  All breeders need to be licensed.  I call for a debate in this House on the matter.  </p></speech>

Our thoughts go to staff who have lost jobs over the weekend and those whose jobs are under threat within the aviation sector.  I welcome that emergency seven-month contracts can issue where a new operator can be found for PSO services to Kerry and Donegal.  It seems like a different world when in late 2019 the then Government of which I was a member was able to buy the Connemara airport for the PSO service to the Aran Islands.  Little did anyone think we would see the collapse in the aviation sector across the world even a few months after that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I acknowledge that &euro;300 million in State funding has been provided by the Government for this sector spanning employment supports, such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme to maintain links between employers and employees, the waiver of commercial rates and the deferral of taxes, all of which are positive in protecting jobs.  Having spoken with senior management in some of our US-based multinationals in Galway, I know that the present status of our aviation sector is of concern to them.  The view is that we are being left behind compared to other countries.  One commented that we need to be more in step with other countries.  Another commented that competitor countries are back operating international travel.  I am concerned about the impact on businesses supported by foreign direct investment, FDI, the impact on the hugely important tourism industry, particularly from Shannon Airport and Ireland West Airport Knock, the hundreds of jobs in aviation across the regions, the wider impact on connectivity and the increasing peripherality due to the collapse in the sector, and the loss of opportunity of new investment.  IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client companies, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and University Hospital Galway, in my own region, depend on connectivity internationally.  I am calling for an urgent debate on aviation given recent developments and implications for connectivity for the economy, whether it be in the west, the mid-west, the north west or the south west.  We are losing ground on all fronts as a nation on aviation.  The Government collectively needs to act to protect a vital national interest.  We need to look at antigen testing, how it is being used in other countries, how it is being used internationally, how it is benefiting other countries and why it is not being deemed to be a runner in this country.  It is broader than the two Ministers for transport.  There needs to be a whole-of-government debate on the sector, on the impact on jobs, on the impact on tourism and on the impact on every sector and every region.  I ask that there be a serious debate on the issue of aviation with the Minister for Transport, the Minister for Health, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform,</p></speech>

Firstly, I have had the privilege of reading the letter sent in by the three commissioners in response to the Oireachtas committee's invitation to appear before it.  I found that the letter was respectful.  It was clear.  It set out precisely why, on the basis of the legislative basis for commissions of investigation and the requirement that persons who participate as commissioners in such processes be seen to be independent, the framework envisages the commissioners doing their best to come up with a clear, unequivocal and objective view of the matter and putting that in to the Minister for publication by the Minister.</p> <p>One of the points the commissioners made - it is one I mention without any degree of recrimination - is that the terms of reference of this commission, as have been mentioned, were ones which were objected to at the very start.  The commissioners made the point that a good deal of their critics were the people who now say that the report should be rejected on the basis that it did not conform to the terms of reference they would have liked.  I want to put it on the record of this House in defence of the commissioners that under the constitutional jurisprudence which applies to tribunals of inquiry of any kind, there has to be constitutional due process.  The idea of the confidential committee was always to be one where a general report would be developed based on what people, who wanted to have their input, gave to the confidential committee report process as their particular experience but, and this is the point, they were given and many of them availed of a guarantee of confidentiality.  That is the first thing.  Secondly, and more importantly than that, they were given the privilege of having input into what would be a general report on their particular experiences without any obligation to be cross-examined or challenged or to stand up their events.  Their version was taken as it was given.  That, as a matter of law, is fine as long as a commission hearing does not proceed to say there was no other side to this matter, there was no other case to be made, there was no cross-examination to take place and the commission is taking it as absolute gospel.</p> <p>I want to put it on the record that the Government is perfectly entitled to get in a third party to look at it from a human rights point of view, if that is what the Government proposes.  I took the trouble of ordering the printed version of this from the Department.  It is 3,000 pages of substantial work.  The commissioners have not got fair or adequate acknowledgement of the massive amount of work they did to uncover a huge scandal in the way Ireland dealt with its most vulnerable people in the past.</p></speech>

I have had the opportunity to travel across Dublin Bay South a lot in recent weeks and it has been really great to see so many places reopening and such general delight at being able to socialise safely again out of doors.  I commend Dublin City Council on many of the great initiatives it is taking in terms of pedestrianisation in city centre streets and in terms of working with others for really creative use of public spaces.  I am thinking in particular of Rathgar village where really good public seating is accessible to all in the grounds of a church run in collaboration with the local authority.  However, in my own area, in Portobello, we have had issues around consultation with Dublin City Council.  I am certainly happy to be working with local residents now to try to resolve matters there and ensure we can create safe and accessible public spaces that all can enjoy without encroaching on the rights of people to live peacefully in a residential area.  I will leave it at that, but we are working on that.</p> <p>I ask for a debate on maternity healthcare and on women's health because, while we are seeing this welcome cautious reopening, there has been a real lagging behind when it comes to women going into maternity hospitals to give birth.  Despite apparent agreement by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Chief Medical Officer that restrictions on partners attending and accompanying women into hospitals should end or should at least be alleviated, we are seeing and I heard even at the weekend reports from women who are in labour in hospital and yet cannot have their partners with them.  It has in some cases led to very distressing experiences for women and it needs to be addressed.  I would ask that we might have a debate on it.  As it is something the Leader feels strongly about, she might contact the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to see what can be done to ensure that if there is a directive that partners are allowed in, it should be complied with in maternity hospitals in a safe manner.  This is at a time where there is huge public concern that I share about the proposed governance structures of the new national maternity hospital.  This is a matter that has been allowed to continue for far too long and we have not heard reassuring intervention from the Minister for Health on it.  We might have a debate on women's healthcare, in particular, on maternity healthcare and the new national maternity hospital, in this House.  It would be a useful and constructive way to engage with the Minister for Health on these issues.</p> <p>Finally, I want to ask for a debate on an international matter.  Colleagues will have shared the same deep concern that I and others felt on hearing the Amnesty International report from last week about the dreadful abuse of Uighur Muslims in China.  I refer to the awful systematic horrors that are being perpetrated on this small minority population in a region of China.  I would ask the Leader that we might have a short debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to express our deep concern about this.</p></speech>

Obviously, we have been in recess for the past week.  During that time a number of things have happened and a number of those things are concerning maternal health.  We bring this up week in, week out.  I thank Senator Bacik for also raising the matter.  I would welcome a debate on it.</p> <p>In particular, I would like to raise the issue of breastfeeding rates in Ireland and also the recent appointment to Safefood of an executive from an infant formula manufacturing company.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is concerning because we have unprecedented commitments in our programme for Government around breastfeeding and maternal health.  We have had a recent announcement of funding for lactation consultants across the country.  We cannot give with one hand and take with the other. <br/><br/>I thank the 24 GPs who wrote about their concern around the recent appointment.  A 2020 report in<i>The Lancet</i>medical journal found that large manufacturers of breast milk substitutes have inappropriately positioned themselves as sources of public health expertise.  We need to be careful and I want to hear from the Minister as to why the appointment was made and what process was followed.<br/><br/>We have one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world.  The WHO has said breastfeeding is the most appropriate thing a state can put its money behind to promote health.  However, 64% of women initiate breastfeeding when they enter hospital and only 37% leave hospital breastfeeding, a matter of days later.  We have to examine why that is.  Let us put money into lactation consultants to support women but let us also make sure we are appointing the correct people in the correct way to our health-promotion organisations.  I would welcome a debate solely around breastfeeding or as part of a debate around maternal healthcare.<br/><br/>We are coming to the end of term for primary schools.  More children are cycling.  There were 65 bikes outside Scoil Iogn&aacute;id this morning.  We have to make sure that we are eliminating the need for cycling advocates all over Twitter telling us how many bikes there are and that we are putting into place all the things this Government has funded to make sure children can safely cycle or walk to school come September.</p></speech>

The issues affecting autistic children and adults are long-standing.  Families, children and adults have had to battle for years for basic rights and entitlements.  On World Autism Day 2019, my colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Funchion, secured unanimous support for her motion calling for a national autism strategy.  That motion caused for an all-party Oireachtas committee to be established and to produce a national strategy.  Ireland is one of the few countries that does not have such a strategy; instead, parents are left to battle the system and rely on support and advice from NGOs and parent support groups.  A national strategy would ensure there would be a one-stop shop that people could access for all of their needs, including diagnosis, occupational therapy and speech and language.  It would ensure Departments would share and co-operate, including the Departments of health, transport and education.  Waiting lists would be co-ordinated so families do not find themselves continuously pushed to the back of the queue every time they need to access a different support.  A national strategy would also ensure we have enough school places and additional educational needs, AEN, class places, and that we have fit for purpose second level supports.</p> <p>I met with the Autism Equality Dublin Bay parents group last week and its members outlined deep frustration with mixed messages regarding AEN classes in the area.  With many children facing a new term without a school place, they were informed that the Shellybanks Educate Together National School has planning permission for two prefabs to be installed on the current grounds to enable the opening of an AEN class and sensory room for September 2021.  When those parents in the local area, anxious to find a place for their child for the coming school year, contacted the school, they were told the school believes the timeline to be unmanageable and the parents would have to wait.  This is not good enough.  The planning permission and the space are there.  The parents and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, are willing to work with the school to assist them in any preparation needed.  The refusal of the school to expedite the AEN classroom is a slap in the face to parents who are desperate to find places for their neurodiverse children within their community. </p> <p>Neurodiverse children should not be forced to leave their communities to access an education.  We need equality across the school system and it is not good enough that access to AEN classes is decided by boards of management not local need.  I ask the Leader of the House to see if we can have an update on when the Government will progress the national autism empowerment strategy that was passed unanimously in the D&aacute;il in 2019.</p></speech>

It is called Alcohol Treatment Services: A snapshot survey 2021.  It explores some of the prevailing issues related to alcohol services in Ireland and it is shocking.  It highlights the significant gap between services needed and those available, the additional difficulties placed on those seeking services and the added harm to children and family networks.  I commend Alcohol Action Ireland for presenting a concise and poignant synopsis of the views sought from service providers who were interviewed over a period of time in 2020.  It distils the commentary on a range of issues, including mental health and trauma, reducing the impact on children and families, gaps in services and barriers to treatment.  I strongly encourage those who have not read it to do so.</p> <p>Alcohol Action Ireland encourages a national discussion around a variety of recommendations that I want to highlight today.  The issue of dual diagnosis arose in the report findings.  It stated the mental health of clients seeking treatment was a significant and serious concern for those surveyed.  Many client users often experienced problems getting adequate treatment for both issues.  The report recommends that, in order to correct this, an investment must be made to ensure services have the capacity to adequately address alcohol dependency and unmet mental health needs. </p> <p>The issue of trauma as a result of adverse childhood experiences was explored.  It was recognised by many service providers within its client population.  The report states that to correct this pervasive problem with trauma, which is so widespread in our country, we need to work to develop a trauma-informed national strategy regarding delivery of the best possible treatment to people accessing alcohol treatment services, including aspects such as models of care and integrated mental health.</p> <p>Another finding is that children are often forgotten in the programmes of those seeking treatment.  Some 50% of those in treatment are fathers or mothers with children having to share the journey to recovery.  I am passionate about this area, as the Leader well knows, through my work with the RISE Foundation.  The report states providers believe children require a specific response if the intergenerational cycle of dependency and trauma is to be broken.  This is so important.</p> <p>I would like to call for a debate on this issue, if possible.  It is an important issue and I also recommend that members read the report and see the impact it has.  I would really appreciate if we could have a debate on this issue.</p></speech>

Many over-60s feel they are vulnerable to the virus and many medically high-risk individuals are in the same boat.  The gap between first and second dose of AstraZeneca was originally 12 weeks but I understand there are recommendations the gap can be reduced to 8 weeks.  I appreciate that was the medical advice at the time, but 12 weeks is a long time when we compare it with four weeks for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.</p> <p>When people received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, the advice was that, after four weeks, they were free to meet unvaccinated people and it was safe to do so.  In my opinion, the arrival of the Delta variant changes that advice completely.  That variant is widespread in the UK, accounting for up to 90% of infections.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The fear is that it will come here if it has not already done so.</p><p>Many countries have already adopted different stances on vaccines.  Canada, France, Spain and Finland, to name but a few, have decided to use different vaccines for the second shot.  Indeed, some medical experts are of the opinion that by giving a different shot the second time, it increases the recipient's chance of not getting the virus.   The time has come for the national immunisation advisory committee and the HSE to update their advice.  We are in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible against the new variant, the Delta variant.  I ask the Leader to contact the Minister with a view to asking the national immunisation advisory committee and HSE to update their advice as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I got the opportunity at the weekend to visit a number of them.  I remind them that the outdoor service enhancement scheme is open from today.  Through it, they can apply to their local authorities for funding.  I look forward to visiting some of the businesses in Dublin Bay South with Councillor James Geoghegan in the coming weeks.</p> <p>On the arts sector, I met an arts group in Longford on Friday last.  I ask the Minister to give certainty to the arts sector with regard to numbers in theatres, etc.  It is extremely frustrating for all those involved that they cannot plan ahead.  I feel the sector can operate with restricted numbers but a support mechanism needs to be put in place to allow it to make sense financially.  I ask that this be kept on the agenda.</p> <p>We all saw what happened to Danish footballer Christian Eriksen at the weekend and noted the importance of having a defibrillator close by.  I was involved in fundraising several years ago to put defibrillators in place in our communities.  Some organisation needs to develop an app stating where the defibrillators are located in order to make sure that there are people trained in all the local areas and that the defibrillators are all working.  From talking to people in various communities, I believe many of the defibrillators that have been put in place are not working.  Some organisation, working through the HSE or Cro&iacute;, should be supported to examine this on a national basis.</p> <p>An issue arises over the high-level border operating model for products of animal origin, which is basically EU legislation that will come into effect on 1 October.  No proper certification role pertaining to veterinarians has been put in place yet.  It requires alignment between the Irish and UK authorities to ensure our food exports can be accepted through the UK border control posts.  If this is not put in place and there is no certainty, there will be jobs put at risk in my community and throughout the country.</p></speech>

The contract that is about to expire has cost this State over &euro;640 million.  That contract has many flaws.  I sought to have the forthcoming tender scrutinised by the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications but that has not really been taken up.  I have used my Private Members' time here to have the issue debated.  Again, the response from the Department was outrageous in so far as it provided no answers.  Now, somebody from Mountain Rescue Ireland has seen fit to contact me and provide me with a copy of the submission it made to the search and rescue project team.  In that submission, Mountain Rescue Ireland is damning of the helicopters in use in this country.  The Sikorsky S-92 is too big and heavy.  Mountain Rescue Ireland has criticised the fact that the helicopters are never available when they are needed at night because night vision capability was not part of the original contract, although eight years ago we paid more than &euro;3.5 million to have the helicopters upgraded.  To my certain knowledge, the services are still not using the night vision technology so the helicopters cannot be used in the mountains.  It is said that the downdraft from the helicopters is so severe that it is a danger to the rescue crews at night.  This results in casualties being put up risk because they have to be taken out of the mountains on foot at night.</p> <p>As a Member of the Oireachtas, I believe I am obliged to do everything I can to make sure this country spends its money wisely and gets the best possible service for its citizens.  I have done everything I can.  My frustration is unbelievable.  I just cannot understand where to go with this now.  How do I get somebody to sit down and do something about it?  The only thing I have got from the Department was an intimidating letter stating that it informed the expert advising it - an expert that had a balance sheet of &euro;13,000 advising on a contract that will probably cost this State &euro;1 billion - of my utterances and he has chosen not to take any issue with me or to take any action against me at this time.  I will not be intimidated by anybody.  At the end of the day, this State deserves the best it can get.  If those concerned think they can bloody well intimidate me out of it, they can think again.  It is in black and white; it is in writing.  That is a damned bad way for any Department to go.  How did we get a children's hospital that is costing billions of euro?  We did not scrutinise when we could do so.  We can scrutinise matters on this occasion before the tender is issued, and we should do so.</p></speech>

I welcome the intervention in this matter by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in the North.  I must mention, in particular, that it is the last act of Ms Arlene Foster as First Minister before she resigned.  It is hard to believe that ten years have passed since Michaela was murdered on her honeymoon in Mauritius in 2011.  That nobody has been brought to justice only adds to the grief of her husband, John.  Yesterday, Michaela's father, the GAA legend Mickey Harte, stated that the authorities in Mauritius want the unsolved murder to go away but that neither he nor John, nor their families, would let that happen.  Michaela was murdered in the jurisdiction of Mauritius.  It is incumbent on Mauritius to investigate the matter fully, which it has not done.  Any help that the Government can give in this respect and any help that the Minister for Foreign Affairs can give the families, as citizens of Ireland, would be appreciated.  What has occurred today is a good step in the right direction.  I welcome the fact that the matter is going to be re-examined.</p></speech>

I salute all the people who work in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, who have been working right through the pandemic, making an unstinting commitment.  I also salute the thousands of volunteers who give blood regularly and not so regularly.  On this day, I encourage those who might not have given blood for a long time to consider doing so.  If there are those who are in a position to donate and have not done so to give it a try because it saves lives.</p> <p>The hospitality industry is open and, hopefully, indoor dining in restaurants will begin in July.  That is fantastic news.  We are all very excited about it and welcome it but there is a serious problem with restaurants in this country in the context of their ability to retain chefs.  I have spoken to a number of restaurant owners over the past few days who are finding it extremely difficult to hire chefs.  I spoke this morning to Adrian Cummins, the CEO of the Restaurants Association of Ireland.  He has explained to me that this is a problem countrywide.  Many chefs who were in this country before the pandemic have gone home to their own countries.  Therefore, we need a three-pronged approach to dealing with this.  First, we need a long-term solution, namely, a certificate-type scheme to train chefs in this country.  This is badly needed because we certainly have a massive shortage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Second, we need an approach from our embassies around the world to identify and promote Ireland and its hospitality industry to potential people who may consider locating here.

There are restaurants which, unfortunately, will not be able to open in July because they will not have chefs.

When will we see a comprehensive response from the Government?  This has not come out of the blue.  We have had disgraceful dithering on antigen testing, along with unacceptable uncertainty for a vital sector in this country.  We need to see a comprehensive response from the Government.</p> <p>I also want to raise the mica crisis in Inishowen and other parts of the north west.  I have been going to Carndonagh regularly for almost 17 years as my husband is from there.  I have never before seen the depth of anger, frustration and desperation among so many in the community about this issue.  Hundreds of families have been left to fend for themselves with their houses crumbling around them due to no fault of their own.  We need to have a scheme that provides 100% redress.  Thousands are planning to come to Dublin tomorrow to make that point to the Government.  We had a scheme put in place for pyrite.  We had a lesser scheme put in place for mica, which is not acceptable.  The 90% offered in that scheme is not enough.  It does not even cover the rent that people will need to pay for other accommodation when their houses are being done up.  It also does not pay for the expert reports.</p> <p>The second key issue involved is that it is not acceptable that a company that sold faulty blocks cannot be held to account because the statute of limitations for product liability is confined to ten years.  There is much frustration in the communities affected.  We see graffiti and hear stories of workers being intimidated.  No worker should ever be subjected to that.  However, we now need to channel that anger and frustration into ensuring that companies are held to account and that the statute of limitations is looked at.  We cannot have a situation where companies fold, evade their responsibilities and simply set up another building materials supply company.  This is crucial for this community and others across the north west.  I hope the Government will act as soon as possible.</p></speech>

That was the second hit-and-run in that particular area.  I call on the Garda Commissioner to pursue what is happening in that area and to investigate it.  Cars are being abandoned after accidents.  That somebody was hit is bad enough.  To do a hit and run and leave a person by the side of the road who is now in a critical condition, is wrong and needs urgent action.</p> <p>I also welcome the hospitality industry's slow, careful and managed reopening.  It is great to see so many people out enjoying it and so many people back to work.</p> <p>I want to continue on the point made by Senator Kyne on aviation.  Sometimes we forget just how much Ireland has contributed to world aviation.  I know this is a subject close to the Leader's heart.  We can go right back to the likes of Tony Ryan and GPA, Guinness Peat Aviation, who went on to set up Ryanair which is now Europe's largest airline by passengers carried and by fleet size, based on 2019 figures.  Michael O'Leary, an Irish person, is a giant of the airline industry.  Half of the aircraft leasing in the world is based in Ireland.  Willie Walsh, a former chief executive at Aer Lingus, then British Airways and the International Airlines Group, is now the secretary general to the International Air Transport Association, representing 82% of the world's airlines.  Eamonn Brennan, former chief executive of the Irish Aviation Authority, is in charge of EUROCONTROL.  The former Senator, P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, set up Aer Arann originally which became Stobart Air.  Alan Joyce is chief executive of Qantas.  Shannon Airport invented the concept of duty free.</p> <p>As a nation and a people, we have contributed huge amounts to aviation.  We are more dependent on aviation than any other European country by a long way.  Even people in the UK can get the train from London to Brussels or Paris, something that we cannot do from Dublin.  Up to 90% of our inbound tourists come by air and 10% by sea.  We need an urgent debate on aviation for inbound tourism.  The Cathaoirleach is from Kerry and is affected by it in terms of connectivity.  My heart goes out to people in Stobart Air but we need an urgent debate on aviation to find out what the Government can do in addition to all it has done already.</p></speech>

A road was raised 8 ft by the county council to protect homes.  This is a turlough, a disappearing lake.  However, water levels have reached their highest in living memory with no sign of waters receding.  Such levels cause fear and anxiety which are endured every single day by families in the area.  They have sleepless nights if there is heavy rain.  This also affects council workers who have to come and save people's lands, farms and homes.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, and the OPW meet weekly.  The Minister of State confirmed that flooding at Lough Funshinagh was always on the agenda.  It was wonderful to have the Minister of State visit our communities around Lough Funshinagh last week.  With funding commitments in place and working together with Roscommon County Council, an engineering solution was found.  An overflow pipe will now bring the waters away from this area.  Last week, the communities of Lisfelim Ardmullen, Rahara and Ballagh around Lough Funshinagh actually saw action to save their homes.  They saw three diggers making way.  People from the local community told me they welcomed the noise of the diggers just like the sounds of birds singing in the morning at 6 a.m.</p> <p>I have worked with the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, along with many public representatives, as well as the cathaoirleach and chief executive of Roscommon County Council, to achieve a solution.  The Minister of State has given significant funding commitments which have provided action for County Roscommon.  I acknowledge the Lough Funshinagh flood crisis committee which has been in touch with all public representatives in the area since last year, in particular since last October and November.  It means relief, an end to anxiety and such joy to the communities affected.</p></speech>

It is hard to believe that it took place ten years ago.  For a decade now, John, the McAreavey and Harte families have been campaigning for justice for Michaela.  I do not want to say too much about it with the investigation being reopened again, other than to extend, on behalf of ever Member, our continued sympathies and solidarity with the McAreavey and Harte families as they take those next steps on that long and arduous journey for truth and justice for Michaela.</p> <p>Other colleagues have reflected on what happened during the Finland and Denmark game during the Euros at the weekend.  Thank God Christian Eriksen is on the mend.  We know, however, of instances across various sports in Ireland where, sadly, people have lost their lives in circumstances such as those we saw at the weekend.  My colleague in the North, Pat Sheehan, MLA, has called on the Minister of Education there to roll out CPR and defib training in schools.  That is good idea which we should consider taking forward.</p> <p>Such training is also something which Oireachtas Members should look at through the good offices of the Cathaoirleach.  There are defibrillators in this building.  It might be worth just taking the opportunity to refresh our memories of where they are, how to get to them and, more importantly, how to use them.  That is a challenge to which we could all step up.  We should look at this for all the obvious reasons should anything similar befall us, no matter where we are.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is an issue of such critical importance and we all know why.

In that context, I hope we can have a debate on the future of work and the need to constantly upskill and reskill our citizens.  I say this in the context of the recent Facebook announcement that it is going to allow staff who are based here to work remotely.  We have seen consumer trends shift dramatically towards e-commerce during the pandemic and last week's G7 communique from Cornwall on securing future prosperity referenced collaboration from cyberspace to outer space as well as protecting our planet.  The World Economic Forum last month suggested that a number of the new jobs that will be much in demand over the next few years include director of remote work, algorithm bias auditor, tidewater architect and human machine teaming manager.  There was also, interestingly, a report by the Law Society of England and Wales, which may cause some concern for colleagues in this House.  It predicted that within the next decade, because of advances in artificial intelligence, we will all have access to lawyers for free and that they will operate in a way very similar to Siri.</p> <p>I welcome this morning's announcement by the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science of more than 10,000 Springboard scheme places in areas where there are specific skills shortages in the economy.   My former colleagues in the Higher Education Authority published a report on the difficulties experienced by mature students in accessing further and higher education, many of which are financial.  Given how quickly we are going to see technology changing all of our lives, we need a full debate on how to upskill and reskill our citizens to enable them to avail of new opportunities.</p></speech>

As a progressive and pragmatic Green Party politician, I refuse to accept their destructive story that decarbonising this important region means we are losing something valuable.  We are not and I am calling that out because what we are actually doing is gaining.  Times are changing and the midlands region is moving on.  Nostalgic memories of days on the bog and the smell of burning turf cannot hold us back.  I acknowledge that turf is still an important energy source for some but our children will not be heating their homes with turf or coal or even with oil or gas.  They will be using electricity and that vital energy will be generated from renewable sources, of which we have an abundance.  Our children know this because they are environmentally and socially aware and as policymakers and legislators, it is our responsibility to be so too and to make sure they have a future in rural midlands counties such as Laois and Offaly.</p> <p>I have seen first hand how enthusiastic people in the midlands are about using our tired, spent bogs as the basis of regeneration.  They want to bring tourism to the area, to work in renewable energy and to create people-first and town-centre-first towns in places such as Portlaoise and Tullamore.  Some would like to keep the likes of Laois and Offaly in the past, forever suppressed, for a few populist, self-serving headlines but I am focused on the future - a clean, green future for which our children will thank us.  When they want to come home, come home they will to good jobs, to a place where they can settle and rear their own families and to an area that has rejuvenated itself into the vibrant and modern region it deserves to be.  This is the green agenda and it is also this Government's agenda.  This is the move from brown to green.  This is the future for the midlands and I intend to play my part in bringing that future vision to reality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1655" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#P00400"><p>Last Friday, we learned of the liquidation of Stobart Air with more than 420 job losses as well as the potential loss of air connectivity on the island and between Ireland and the UK.  Media reports over the weekend suggest that a strategic review is under way at Lufthansa Technik in Shannon and related companies.  Approximately 500 people work there and there is real concern as to what the review will hold for them.  All of this comes on the back of the recent announcement by Aer Lingus that it will close its crew base at Shannon Airport.  There is no timeline for the return of services at the airport and there will be a similar reduction of services at Cork Airport.</p> <p>This is a sobering reminder that notwithstanding the roll-out of the vaccine and the end of the pandemic being in sight, many businesses, particularly in the aviation and hospitality sectors, will not come out of lockdown the way they went in.  It looks like it will take many years for those sectors to recover.  Unfortunately, we are not seeing the kind of engagement from Government that is necessary to give certainty, security and some degree of confidence to the aviation sector in particular.  We seem to be taking a wait and see approach, which is not good enough, quite frankly, either for the people employed in the sector or for those who will be affected if we lose key connectivity.  I acknowledge the Leader is doing her best but I ask her to organise a debate in this House on an action plan from the Government to assist the recovery of the aviation sector.  </p> <p>Finally, others have mentioned the issue of defective blocks and the impact this has had on people's lives.  In County Clare, there is pyrite in the blocks and I know from speaking to members of the group from Clare that they will be in Dublin tomorrow to highlight this issue.  It is devastating for families to see their homes that they lovingly built and created crumbling around them.  We must stop the penny pinching.  There must be 100% redress for these people.  They are expected to leave their homes for up to 18 months while they are rebuilt but are only being offered 90% of the cost, with no support towards rent.  This is outrageous.  We must stop the bean counters buried in the bowels of Departments from ruling the heads, minds and hearts of the Government.  We were able to borrow money quickly when we needed to when the pandemic struck.  Let us keep that simple ethos in place to address a crisis like this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1636" speakername="Paddy Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#P00500"><p>I ask the Leader to arrange for the Taoiseach to come to the House to discuss the pyrite and mica crisis.  This issue was raised in this House by former Senator, Michelle Mulherin, week after week for four or five years.  The current scheme is not adequate and as others have said, it does not even cover people's costs.  We must meet 100% of the costs involved.  A number of other issues must also be addressed when the Taoiseach comes in.  There is pyrite in many council buildings in County Mayo.  What is going to happen to those?  Houses are only supposed to be returned to the condition they were in when first built but in some cases, that was ten or 15 years ago.  What is the position on council houses?  Are they going to be put back to the standards of ten, 15 or 20 years ago or will they be rebuilt as modern houses?  These issues must be addressed.  There is also the issue of accidental landlords and second homes, which is not addressed by the current scheme.  While the 90% scheme is very welcome as a starting point, we must move to 100% and I ask that the Taoiseach comes to the House to address this issue.</p> <p>I am sure the Cathaoirleach would like to join me in wishing a very happy retirement to Ms Ann Nolan from Ballycastle, County Mayo and Ms Mary O' Malley from Achill Island, County Mayo, who have manned the switchboards in Leinster House for the past 37 years and 35 years, respectively.  They have done a magnificent job over those years.  It is great that when one rings Leinster House somebody answers the phone, unlike so many other institutions around the country.  I would like to wish them both a happy retirement.</p></speech>

Their long and excellent service to Leinster House is well known by all of us.  When one rings the switchboard, they are always very professional and courteous.  It is great that Leinster House offers a service where human beings answer the phone.  Ann and Mary have been the voice of Leinster House for decades and we wish them a long and happy retirement.</p> <p>I call on the Leader to respond on the Order of Business.</p></speech>

I will certainly make the request but I suggest it would probably be more appropriate if the Minister comes to talk to us today.  I welcome the announcement of the Taoiseach on Saturday or his utterances.  He wants to find a solution to this.  I think we all know what the solution is.  It is to put an end to the stress the families have been living under for far too long.  In any event, I will make the request and come back to Senator Burke.</p><p>Senator Dooley, among others, asked for a debate on aviation.  I am pleased to be able to say that I had foresight that this issue was not going away.  I genuinely did not expect the announcement that we got on Saturday morning.  The debate on aviation and the future of aviation is set for 21 June, next Monday.  It will be with the Minister for Transport.  I agree with the Senator that there needs to be a wider debate.  The ramifications of our continuing stubbornness with regard to engagement and action on the reopening of our aviation sector, and the other industries it directly affects, are mind-boggling, to be straight up about it.  The impact on connectivity, not only on jobs in aviation but on all the industries that rely on 90% of the tourists we heavily relied on in the past, is going to have a direct effect on the future recovery of the country.  This is not only because of international connectivity.  I note with interest the number of people who talked about the importance of regional connectivity on Saturday.  I am not down-playing the importance - it absolutely important - but we are a small country that heavily relies on international connectivity.  A person can drive from Kerry.  I am not saying we should not have connectivity from our airlines but, with the exception of colleagues in the House and Members of the D&aacute;il, I do not hear anyone talking about the value of our international connectivity that has been built up by the likes of Ryanair that Senator Horkan has talked about over the years as well as our national flag carrier, Aer Lingus.  I am genuinely at a loss to understand and appreciate the explanations being given to us.  If I hear once more of the &euro;300 million given in financial support to our airline carriers I think my head will explode.  That money was given to people to replace the incomes taken from them because we closed down our country on 13 March last year.  It is facetious and disingenuous at the very least to be trotting that number out as if we have somehow supported Stobart, CityJet, Ryanair, Aer Lingus, Lufthansa and all the other carriers that provide international connectivity.  We will have the debate on 21 June and I hope it will be robust.</p><p>I wish to acknowledge the contribution of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Hackett, this morning.  In many ways I agree with her.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne talked about the technology debate that will be needed on the future of work.  He talked about one of the vacancies this morning as the human machine team manager.  It sounds interesting.  The Senator might elaborate when we have the debate.  It is a debate that is needed.</p><p>Senators Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile and Cassells talked about what I believe to be a welcome announcement this morning.  It is probably one of Arlene Foster's last announcements in this role in her public life.  It is important that the families, who are still grieving and who will always grieve until they get justice, are supported by all the institutes of the State.  I wish them well and I hope they get openness and transparent willingness and engagement from the Mauritian authorities to try to find out what happened that beautiful young woman on her honeymoon.  I wish to acknowledge the contribution of both Senators this morning.</p><p>Senator Dolan spoke about the welcome news this morning for her community in Roscommon.  It is lovely to see a full circle especially when the State responds to communities in crisis and the response kicks in fast.  I wish to acknowledge that contribution as well.</p><p>Senator Horkan talked about the second awful accident that happened in his neck of the woods last night.  I wish that young man a speedy recovery.  We need to have a proper debate in this House and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on how road users - the term applies whether I am using my legs, on a bicycle, in a car or using a forklift truck - share the roads and respect each other.  This is especially the case now.</p><p>We have talked much in recent weeks about putting cycle lanes in where they are needed not simply because we can and about putting in place pedestrianisation to enhance the lives of people.  However, we should not fail to acknowledge that it comes with other occurrences.  The debate around how we share our spaces should be valuable.  I will try to arrange that in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>Senator Marie Sherlock talked about the antigen testing.  This is something about which many of us are scratching our heads.  It is not a panacea or magic wand.  It is a tool that other countries, including European countries, are using to aid in their recovery and reopening.  Yet again, for some stubborn reason, we have decided against doing it.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science seems to be the only brave soldier today announcing his four pilots in the universities.  One would be minded to know how he has managed to get around the advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team.  Perhaps he has a little more business sense than other people.  The Senator also talked about Carndonagh and the mica crisis.  I hope we all see resolution to that this week.</p><p>Senator Martin Conway talked about hospitality opening, as did others.  It is welcome to see some of the normal activities, which people probably took for granted before March last year, starting to come back, even if we are all sitting outside with coats waiting for the long-awaited sunshine.  It was supposed to come over the weekend but did not for many parts of the country.  It is, however, welcome to see.  There was a good request to talk to the Minister with responsibility for employment affairs with regard to visa relaxation.  I will send a letter to him today.</p><p>Senator Craughwell talked about something he talks about frequently.  I am at a loss for what to say to him because I understand and appreciate that he has explored all the avenues.  I am not really sure how to respond to him.  I am sorry but I have no doubt he will keep raising it until he gets some sense of satisfaction, and I wish to acknowledge that.</p><p>Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy talked about business hospitality, especially in the arts sector.  I will send a letter to the Minister today to see if I can get any information from him.</p><p>Senator Gallagher talked about some of the people still waiting for a date for their second vaccine.  The national immunisation advisory committee met last week.  The committee acknowledged that it would reduce the period from 12 weeks to eight weeks and that it would be staggered.  It would be nice to see a full statement.  I will come back to the Senator as quickly as I can.</p><p>Senator Black talked about the new report released by Alcohol Action Ireland.  I will try to schedule a debate on the wider responses of the recommendations of that report as early as I can.  Senator Boylan talked about a national autism empowerment strategy.  While I believe everyone in this House and the other House would agree with her, I do not have a response.  However, I will try to come back to her as quickly as I can.</p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly, among others, asked for a debate on maternal health.  Senators Lisa Chambers, Fiona O'Loughlin and Bacik are among the people who bring this up week in, week out.  I know many of us follow stuff on Twitter.  On Twitter this weekend there were two harsh stories that caught my eye.  One was from a Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, a gentleman who works with two of our Senators.  His wife was taken in and he was left outside the door.  Another was from a lady whose daughter had been taken into the Rotunda at the weekend.  She had a photograph of approximately eight or nine men, daddies, who were left standing outside the door on their telephones.  It is simply not good enough.  I do not know what part of the directive that Paul Reid and the Taoiseach have given to our maternity hospitals is not understood.  Partners are not there simply for the fun of it.  They are an integral part of the entire maternity process and the process of giving birth.  Again, probably for the eighth week in a row, I will write to the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach to ask them to respond to us.  This is becoming untenable.  The excuses from hospitals are simply not believable when we saw concerts taking place, albeit small concerts, last week.  We cannot have a prohibition on partners attending births or going in in emergency situations.  It is simply not on.  I will try to organise that maternal debate in the coming weeks but I will try to get a faster response for people with regard to what is still going on.</p><p>Senator McDowell expressed some of his feelings this morning with regard to the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation.  I do not know that I agree with him but he is absolutely entitled to raise his views, just as people who have different views are absolutely entitled to raise them.  One thing I will take umbrage at is that he stated in his contribution this morning that women were given the privilege of telling their stories to the commission.  It was not a privilege to tell their stories.  I am sure it was harrowing and something they wished to God they never had to do.  It is all of the subsequent actions and inaction arising from those women giving their stories that we are expressing concerns about rather than anything beforehand.  I wish to put that on the record.</p><p>Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne opened today with the aviation sector.  Again, he referred to antigen testing.  The debate will be on 21 June.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator O'Loughlin spoke about men's health.

It is not something that would come naturally to me.  I do not watch football but because there was a break in the match on Saturday evening, it became very topical.  One thing I was so impressed by was the solidarity shown by that gentleman's team - how they treated him, his wife and each other and how they supported each other - and the outpouring of solidarity from people all over the world who were watching it.  It was incredible to see the binding nature and how sport can so often bring people together.  I just wanted to say that it was something to behold.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.87" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#T00200"><p>I am pleased to address the House on the Second Stage of the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2021.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a requirement that employers publish certain information on the differences in pay between female and male employees.  The provisions of the Bill will initially apply to companies with 250 or more employees, with this threshold reducing to 50 or more over time.  The requirement will apply in the private and public sectors once the employment threshold is met. </p> <p>The gender pay gap is well documented globally.  Recent research shows it is driven mainly by differences in working patterns between men and women but also by wage differences for gendered roles.  It is hoped this legislation will go a long way towards improving understanding of the pay gap and incentivising employers to use whatever means they can to reduce it.</p> <p>The gender pay gap has long been an issue of concern at EU level and in March 2021 the Commission published proposals for a draft directive "on strengthening the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women through pay transparency and enforcement mechanisms".  Publication of the proposal meets a commitment in President von der Leyen's political priorities and in the EU gender equality strategy.  The proposal focuses on two core elements of equal pay, namely, measures to ensure pay transparency for workers and employers and improved access to justice for victims of pay discrimination.  The Council has commenced first reading of the proposals at working group level and first reading has also started in the European Parliament.  I hope these proposals will complement the work we have begun with this Bill and enhance our efforts to address the gender pay gap.</p> <p>In Ireland, the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, includes a suite of measures which will impact on the gender pay gap, with the most relevant to this debate being the commitment to legislate to require publication of the gender pay gap in large companies.  The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 also has a number of actions to address directly or indirectly the gender pay gap.  The action relevant to this debate is No. 1.23 to "promote wage transparency by requiring companies of 50 or more employees to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results".  Most recently, the report of the Citizens' Assembly made a recommendation to enact and implement this Bill without delay.</p> <p>The work on preparing this Bill began with extensive consultations in August 2017 and I would like to acknowledge the work the former Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, did on this Bill.  The views of interested parties were invited to inform the development of the package of measures to tackle the gender pay gap and to identify issues to be advanced through further discussion with union and employer stakeholders.  Interested parties were invited to make submissions in writing, in particular to comment on the factors creating the gender pay gap and the actions needed to be taken.  In all 38 written submissions were received by a wide range of individuals and organisations, which cited 14 specific factors and 253 suggested actions to tackle and address the existence of the gender pay gap.  The top contributory factor, which attracted the largest number of suggested actions, was non-transparency in pay structures.</p> <p>A national symposium of measures to address the gender pay gap was held in January 2018 and attended by more than 130 people.  The symposium was addressed by an official of the European Commission, academics and other experts and representatives of the social partners, civil society and professional bodies.  Following this, direct consultation on prospective wage transparency legislation with several key stakeholders, including IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the National Women's Council and Senator Bacik, took place.  Officials also met the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, the then Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  Many suggestions were put forward throughout these consultations.</p> <p>On 7 February 2019, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality issued its report  on pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme.  Since the publication of that report amendments to the enforcement framework set out in the Bill were made on Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  These amendments strengthen the Bill and ensure the enforcement provisions are both proportionate and workable, addressing a point raised in the report of the joint committee.  I will discuss these amendments in more detail as I go through the main provisions of the Bill.</p> <p>I would also like to acknowledge the work Senator Bacik and her Labour Party colleagues did on bringing forward the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill, which was passed by this House under the previous Government.  While the Government shares the objectives of that Bill, we are proposing a different mechanism for gender pay gap reporting and believe the Bill being brought forward today is the correct mechanism, which ensures IHREC has an oversight role and proportionate enforcement powers and provides individual employees with recourse to the WRC.</p> <p>I will turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the insertion of a new section 20A in the Employment Equality Act 1998.  This provides that the Minister shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable after commencement, make regulations requiring the publication of gender pay gap information.  These regulations must include certain items of information and there is discretion to include additional items.  The items that must be included are the mean and median gap in hourly gap between men and women, in bonus pay and in hourly pay of part-time male and female employees and the percentage of men and of women who receive bonus pay and benefits in kind.</p> <p>Section 20A(1)(c) requires the publication of the reasons, in the employer's opinion, for any gaps and of the measures, if any, the employer is taking or proposes to take to eliminate or reduce gaps.  This reflects a recommendation in the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the joint committee and came from other interests as well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In addition to the required information which I have outlined, the regulations may provide for the publication of the following information: the mean and median pay gap between men and women on temporary contracts, the percentage of each pay quartile who are men and who are women and the publication of pay gap information by reference to job classifications.<br/><br/>Section 20A(2) provides that, in making regulations, the Minister shall have regard to the estimated costs of complying with and enforcing the regulations.  Section 20A(3) provides for the threshold of employees above which the employer will be required to publish gender pay gap information.  The key point is that employers with fewer than 50 employees will not be covered.<br/><br/>It also provides for the phased introduction of the requirements on certain employers to report, namely, that the regulations shall not apply to employers with fewer than 250 employees before the second anniversary of the making of the first regulations, nor to employers with fewer than 150 employees before the third anniversary.  I will return to the thresholds and the phasing later. <br/><br/>Section 20A(4) provides that the regulations may prescribe, among other things, the classes of employer to which the regulations apply, subject to the thresholds I have just mentioned, the classes of employee and the classes of remuneration to be reported.<br/><br/>Section 20A(5) provides that the regulations may prescribe the form and manner in which and the  frequency with which information is to be published in order to bring the information to the attention  of the employees and the public.  For example, the regulations might require the employer to send the information to the employees in addition to publishing it on the employer's website and uploading it on a central Government website.  Publication will not be required more often than once a year.<br/><br/>Section 20A(6) provides for publication of gender pay gap information by public bodies.  I amended  the definition of a &quot;public body&quot; on the recent Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to provide the most complete and up-to-date definition.  The amended definition of what encompasses a public body is based on section 10 of the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019.  The text of section 10 of the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019 was chosen as it is the most complete and up-to-date definition of a &quot;public body&quot;.<br/><br/>Senators may note that the definition states &quot;a Department of State&quot; rather than &quot;a Minister of the Government&quot; as provided for in section 10 of the Data Sharing and Governance Act.  This move away from the precedent definition is to ensure that where a Minister has responsibility for more than one Department, an individual report for each individual Department is required.  Essentially, the intention is that this legislation applies to the public as well as the private sector where the body in question is within the employment threshold.<br/><br/>Section 20A(7) provides for the situation in which the employer does not have access to pay information on employees.  In that case, the regulations may require the person who has such access to give the information, or access to the information, to the employer so the latter can comply with the regulations.  This arises in the education sector where teachers are employed by a school board but are paid by the Department of Education.<br/><br/>Section 20A(8) provides that the regulations may prescribe measures to ensure that personal data have undergone pseudonymisation before or when they are released.  This means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific person.<br/><br/>Section 3 is concerned with enforcement and inserts two new sections in the Employment Equality Act 1998.  This section was amended on Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The original section 85B provided for the appointment by the Minister of designated officers to investigate how employers prepare the information required to be published to ensure its accuracy.  A policy decision was taken not to proceed with the appointment of designated enforcement provisions due to concerns around how this system would operate practically.  This section was deleted on Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. <br/><br/>Section 85B contained in the Bill before Members was originally section 85C, with the deletion of the original section 85B it has been renumbered.  I also brought forward an amendment to section 85B in the Bill before the House on Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The section now enables the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, to apply to the Circuit Court or to the High Court for an order requiring a person to comply with the regulations.  A person who fails to comply with a Circuit Court order or High Court order is in contempt of that court.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will have regard to the size of the company, the number of infringements, etc., when determining which court in which to issue proceedings.<br/><br/>Section 85C in the Bill before the House was originally section 85D, with the deletion of the original section 85B it has been renumbered.  Section 85C allows for an employee to make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, of non-compliance with reporting regulations by their employer.<br/><br/>The director general of the WRC or an adjudicating officer, to whom one would expect this function will be delegated, will investigate the complaint if satisfied that there is a <i>prima facie </i>case.  If, on investigation the officer finds in favour of the complainant, he or she may make an order requiring the employer to take a specified course of action in order to comply.<br/><br/>This is the only remedy that may be ordered.  For example, compensation may not be awarded, as it is not an appropriate remedy in this situation.  Enforcement of WRC orders is through the District Court.  This section was also amended on Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, subsection (4) of what was section 85D provided for an investigation to be carried out by the director general of the WRC in private.  That was at odds with the findings of the Supreme Court in the recent Zalewski judgment which has implications for the procedures of the WRC in terms of proceedings held in private.  The new section 85C removes the subsection requiring an investigation to be held in private.  In addition subsection (7) provided for an appeal in the Labour Court to be heard in private, unless at the request of the complainant or respondent, the court determines to hold the appeal in full or so much of it as it does not consider should be treated as confidential, in public.<br/><br/>This has been amended at subsection (6) to allow for an appeal to be held in public, unless at the request of either party, the court determines there are special circumstances to hold the appeal, or part thereof, otherwise than in public.<br/><br/>Sections 85B and 85C adopt the approach of requiring a person to comply with the regulations rather than penalising the person for failure to comply.  If they fail to comply they are in contempt of court.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will have regard to the size of the company, the number of infringements, etc., when determining which court in which to issue proceedings.  The Government believes that this more proportionate, court-based enforcement mechanism would ultimately prove more effective than a simple summary offence and fine system, which larger companies in particular might simply factor into costs instead of being motivated to comply.<br/><br/>Section 4 inserts a further category of &quot;parties&quot; into section 88 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.  Section 88 of the 1998 Act provides for the form and content of a decision of the director general of the WRC or a determination of the Labour Court.  Section 4 intends to include the complainant and the respondent where a decision or determination is made under section 85C, in the definition of &quot;parties&quot; to whom section 88 applies.  Senators may note that section 4 in the Bill before the House incorrectly refers to section 85D which no longer exists.  I intend to bring an amendment on Report Stage to remedy this.<br/><br/>Section 5 inserts a provision in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 to allow the Minister to request the IHREC to consider exercising its powers under section 82 of that Act.  This section concerns the carrying out of equality reviews and the drawing up of equality action plans.  It will be for IHREC to decide whether to exercise its section 32 powers following the Minister's request.  For instance, the situation could arise that it becomes apparent to the Minister following publication of an employer's gender pay gap information on a central government website that the pay gap is abnormally large having regard to all relevant considerations.  It would then be appropriate to draw it to IHREC's attention and ask it to consider using the powers I  have mentioned.<br/><br/>Section 6 provides that the Minister shall review the Act before the fourth anniversary of commencement.  This section was also amended on Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, with the fifth anniversary replaced by the fourth to ensure that reporting requirements are fit for purpose as we  extend the reporting requirement to smaller organisations. <br/><br/>I look forward to hearing the views of Senators and to discussing the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.89" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#U00200"><p>Every year in Ireland, there comes a day when women's earnings stop and when men's earnings keep going to the end of the year, effectively at least, because women earn 14% less than men in this country.  Last year that date was 9 November.  This is often explained away as it is not necessarily that a man and woman doing the same job are earning less than each other, but that women and men may be engaged in different kinds of work so it is often the conditions of their working lives on which a light is being shone.  Women often have periods of uncertainty or they look for flexibility.  This is not weakness; it is reality.  We have babies, we sometimes want to be at home, we sometimes want flexible working and we also want to feed our families and not to live in poverty.  We should never be forced into caring roles because of a lack of childcare - the cost of which is being addressed by the Government and the Minister - or through direct discrimination, as happens when workplaces simply pay us less or subconsciously do not think that we look or sound like what they expect from a worker in a specific role, especially roles at a higher end which pay more.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are certainly cases that are brought to the Workplace Relations Commission where women have been asked, at interview, if they plan to have children.  I know one woman who was asked that and did not take a case.  The implication is that they might not have what it takes to stay the course.  The personal rewards for taking these cases are often nowhere near enough to prompt employees to do it.  It is not enough for us as a society to say that that should never happen and that people have their rights under equality legislation and should go off and take a case.  We should put in place safeguards to ensure that it does not happen in the first place, which is what this Bill is about.  We should not, as individuals, rely on the courts to vindicate our rights under equality legislation but put a greater onus on the State and employers to demonstrate compliance with a set of principles which is laid down, in part, by this legislation.</p><p>There are many practices which, quite apart from this direct discrimination, also indirectly discriminate.  The former CEO of Reddit has banned salary negotiations at her company altogether because salary negotiations indirectly discriminate against women, because over our lifetime we continuously earn less in each place we are employed.  We are obliged to say what we were earning in our past employment and in our next employment, doing the exact same role as a man in that role, we end up earning less because of our own negotiations.  I note that the Irish Public Appointments Service asks for previous salaries for senior appointments in the public service.  It might make sense to reform the public service recruitment processes as an early step in order to do more than just publish the information, but to act to reduce it beyond transparency measures.</p><p>I am the Green Party's spokesperson for higher education.  Only 5% of apprenticeships in the country are taken up by women.  That means that we are not doing enough as a State to promote them among women and that we are continuing to say that some forms of work are for women and that some forms are for men.  The real question is why the work women engage in is paying less than men.  Why is the working world often set up to maximise profit instead of ensuring that all work is done in a sustainable way and people of all genders and their children earn enough, regardless of whether they are in paid employment, unpaid employment, caring roles or other roles?  We should ensure that we are all paid the same and that we can all make a living for our children and families.  We should ensure that the kind of work we are engaged in is not something to be ashamed of.  I should not have to feel, if I work in a cr&egrave;che, that I am any less than somebody working in a male-dominated profession.  Unfortunately that is where we are as a society.  If we genuinely want to encourage more men into some roles, then we need to start showing that it is valued.  I guarantee that men will step up to the plate in those roles if they feel they are valued professions.</p><p>The Minister knows how much I speak on the issue of unpaid caring labour.  That is not what this Bill is here to address but it is at the core of the gender pay gap because women take extensive time out of work.  We need to look at measures to promote women going back into the workforce in small businesses as well as large ones because the country relies on small and medium businesses.  We have to look at how we support businesses to take women back and to value the experience that they have had, which was added to LinkedIn recently, during the pandemic, which I thought was notable.  One can now put an emphasis on work that is at home and put into one's profile that one is a stay-at-home parent.  That means that we are now stepping up as a society.  The Citizens' Assembly has recognised the importance of caring work.  In order to promote and help those who are in caring work, we need to make sure that the people who are in caring work are not living in poverty and, more particularly, that their children are not living in poverty.</p><p>Much damage was done with tax individualisation and it is hard to roll back on that.  There are also lone parents and damage was done with regard to them by previous Governments.  We have to recognise all of that and work our way towards ensuring that we redress that balance so that people, regardless of where they work in the home or outside the home, can make choices based on something other than financial imperatives and putting food on the table.  This Bill is a significant step forward.  It is in line with many other countries and it is also a large part of what the Citizens' Assembly examined and encouraged the Government to do.  I look forward to the referendums or at least a referendum with several questions in it, which I hope we will pursue in the lifetime of this Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#V00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  There is always a balance to be identified between an agenda to remove what are objectively obstacles to people's equal participation in society and the economy, which one must always support, and where this drifts into the area of social engineering, which I have an issue with, when we start to tell people and families how to live and arrange their lives, identifying some choices as virtuous and others as less virtuous.  I tend to oppose that.  I approached this legislation with that tension in mind.  I note that this Bill passed the D&aacute;il without a single Deputy opposing it on Second Stage.  Not a single amendment was submitted on Committee Stage at the select committee and Committee Stage was wrapped up within an hour.  This is for a Bill that languished on the D&aacute;il Order Paper for almost two years before being resurrected two weeks ago.  There was not a single vote against it on its final passage through the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>If we have learned anything in recent years, it is that when a Bill reaches the Seanad without there having been a single dissenting voice in the D&aacute;il, we should be at least wary of its contents.  It often means that a Bill is not evidence-based or that it is a tokenistic measure designed to signal the virtue of those proposing it rather than to effect real and meaningful change for the better.  The Government and the D&aacute;il have developed a habit of clapping through legislation rather than engaging in forensic scrutiny.  The business of forensic scrutiny is not helped by a tendency to rush legislation through with the guillotining of Bills and so on.  There is very little respect for the democratic process on show at the moment.  Any policy which has unanimous support on all sides should be subject to even more scrutiny because the critical faculties of these Houses can be dull enough at the best of times but they are further eroded if there is any danger of groupthink.</p> <p>The concept of equal pay for work of equal value has been enshrined at EU level since the 1970s in no small part due to the work of the EU Commissioner and later President, Patrick Hillery.  The Labour Party leader at the time, Michael O'Leary, sought a derogation for Ireland from the equal pay directives, something that the Labour Party should always bear in mind.  The late President Hillery would be more than surprised to hear some of the rhetoric that has emerged from his own party on the issue.  Some of the commentary is facile.  After 50 years of significant leaps and bounds with regard to the rights of women, one would swear that Ireland has been transported back to the 1950s in the last few years, with some of the rhetoric that one hears about these issues.</p> <p>This Bill is founded on the premise that a gender pay gap of 14% exists in the European Union with a gap of 14.4% here in Ireland.  This figure has been accepted without question or analysis by the D&aacute;il or the Minister.  Does that mean that men are being paid 14% more than women for work of equal value?  It does not because that would be a breach of EU law.  The gap is calculated from the difference between the average gross hourly earnings of all male and female employees regardless of the type of job, their experience, differences in education, the location of the job, the supply of jobs versus the demand for particular skills, and so on.  As a result, it is a crude measure with which to analyse this issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is like comparing a basket of apples with a basket of oranges and being surprised that there is a 14% difference between them.  Even the National Women's Council of Ireland accepts that half the gap can be explained by the factors that I have mentioned.  It is a false measure for the 14% figure to be used.  It is used almost, as it were, for its shock value and there is not enough of analysis of the detail behind it.  The 14% gap was portrayed in the D&aacute;il as being the result of out and out discrimination against women.  That is clearly not the case.  There is a multiplicity of factors at play.  Even the European Parliament's own summary of how the gap is calculated states:</p><blockquote>	Interpreting the numbers is not as simple as it seems, as a smaller gender pay gap in a specific country does not necessarily mean more gender equality.  High gaps tend to be related to a high proportion of women working part time or being concentrated in a restricted number of professions. </blockquote><p>The summary also states:</p><blockquote>	...such as care, sales or education.  There are still sectors such as the science, technology and engineering sectors where the proportion of male employees is very high (with more than 80%). </blockquote><p>I was very interested in what Senator O'Reilly had to say.  I agree with her that we need to think about whether we are just thinking in economic terms about the work people do.  Are we factoring sufficiently into this debate the decisions that people make to engage, for example, in care in the home?  How do we put a value on that so that we take into account in the way we are thinking?  There is a lot of talk about encouraging people into the workplace.  When is there going to be more talk about facilitating men and women in the decisions that they will want to take as families?  I mean about which of them, for example, might want to make the decision to step out of the workforce and work in the home in the caring of children.  That is where we need to repitch much of the discussion.<br/><br/>I was delighted that Senator O'Reilly mentioned the scandal of the tax individualisation policy in recent years, which has militated against families.  It is driven by a purely economic view of the person and his or her contribution to society.<br/><br/>Women are four times more likely to work in part-time jobs and, inherently, part-time jobs tend to be lower paid, irrespective of the gender of the employee, for simple reasons of supply and demand.  Perhaps work can be done in this area to encourage employers and rethink how we see part-time work.  It does not necessarily have to be the case that part-time work tends to be the kind of work that is lower paid.  Does the recent experience of Covid and the new emphasis on working from home have something to contribute to this debate and how we order our lives together?<br/><br/>The fact that women work part-time hours more than men is not due to some sexist conspiracy among employers.  It is because a large number of women either choose to remain in the home or choose to work part-time in a job because it suits their family circumstances.  The Netherlands, for example, has a very high proportion of women who work part time.  A 2013 study there stated that women in part-time work have high levels of job satisfaction and a low desire to change working hours.  I see no reason the same might not be true for Ireland.<br/><br/>We should not view part-time work as a bad thing but, again, we need to see if we can create incentives.  It is good news when we are thinking about more family-friendly structures in the workplace.  It is also good news when we examine part-time work in terms of is it being sufficiently valued, particularly if it is work that women are in to a greater degree than men.  It is bad news when we obsess about getting people to change their behaviours when it is for them to make decisions that affect their personal lives.  I want to warn against any danger or risk of stigmatising those who choose to work part time, women who choose to work part time and the employers who hire them by publicly shaming them with a gender pay gap idea, which suggests that women are actually being paid less than men per work done for equal work.  Where that happens is a scandal, it must be targeted and of course it is against the law.<br/><br/>The proponents of this Bill in the D&aacute;il were keen to highlight disparities in individual cases of well-paid, high-end professional jobs but conspicuously less keen to speak about the structure of the workforce, the choices that women and families make for themselves or the decisions that they make to work part time.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I have no problem with this Bill <i>per se</i>but we need a broader debate about how we structure the economy and whether we show sufficient respect for the choices that people want to make and enable them to make that choice.</p></speech>

We, here in this House, are responsible for creating equality.  Sometimes equality is not always provided for by a Bill.  This Bill is about creating equity for men and women in terms of payscales.  That is so much more than his description of this being the choice of women.  I feel that it is a bit rich of him to say it is a woman's choice.</p></speech>

I very much agree with the Minister that this legislation should have been here before now.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il, in opposition, supported this Bill and now we are in government we are delighted to work as part of a fair economy and a fairer society.  A key part of that will be continuing to eradicate the gender pay gap, to hold companies accountable and to highlight the companies that do a good job.</p> <p>Gender pay equality is a concept that is often misunderstood and it has been for a long time.  It has been defined as a percentage difference between the average gross hourly earning for women and men.  We all have become aware of the line of equal pay for equal work, which is the basis for this Bill.</p> <p>The gender pay gap is now a well-known phenomenon, which is receiving increasing attention in Ireland and internationally.  I congratulate my colleague and fellow Senator, Lorraine Clifford-Lee, on establishing the first all-party Oireachtas committee on gender pay inequality.  I am glad to be a member of the committee and during this term we are working to change the so-called traditional view of female participation in the labour force.  The WorkEqual campaign led by Sonya Lennon has done incredible work and continues to highlight gender issues concerning women gaining fair and decent work.</p> <p>The Bill goes some way to ensuring that we, as a country, treat people of all genders equally and it will, for the first time, will provide for a structured and steady flow of information on what is happening in individual businesses.  The amendments agreed by the Cabinet on 30 April will mean that Departments and agencies will have to report on their own gender pay gap and establish a stronger enforcement role for IHREC.  I ask the Minister to extend this concept not within this Bill but in other areas where public bodies, Departments and organisations would have to highlight whether they have a diverse workforce and who we, as a State, are hiring to ensure that we have more diversity in our State-funded bodies.</p> <p>The Minister has outlined that the Bill will require the phased introduction of pay gap reporting for any employer with more than 15 employees.  Employers will be required to report the percentage, mean and median pay gap between men and women in terms of hourly pay for both full-time and part-time employees, as well as bonus pay.  Employers will also report the proportion of male and female employees who receive bonuses or benefits-in-kind.</p> <p>Today, I must address the bigger overall issue of how we, as women, or we, as a society, work.  In general, workplaces have been created by men for men and what is so-called normal needs to change.  Society is changing and what society wants is evolving.  One silver lining from Covid is how the concept of a work-life balance has changed.  It is no longer necessary for employees to be in an office.  Work is more about productivity and results than the inflexible so-called norms of working from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p> <p>There are now more women in third-level education and those who have attained excellent qualifications only for the State to put in place barriers that prevent women from fully participating in the workplace.  I was one of those women.  I have three degrees and good enough work experience but after I had children, I had to weigh up the cost benefit of returning to work.  For me, the high cost of childcare was the issue.  Why would I work for little or no financial benefit yet have so much stress on my family?  Thankfully, we cut our cloth to suit and I stayed at home.  However, when I wanted to go back to work the lack of valuable part-time work that suited me and was flexible enough for me to care for my four children was very difficult to find.  The irony is that I now have one of the most least family-friendly jobs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This gap in my employment history raises another issue, which is one I share with many of my female friends, namely, not having a pension.  I do not have a pension and I am not unusual.  This is going to have a huge a long-term effect.  Unfortunately, many women have poverty to look forward to in their retirement.  If we want to create and operate a society with a fair economy, we must benefit everybody within it.  More women in the workplace is better for everyone.  Diversity provides an economic win.  Studies have shown the financial performance of firms improves with more gender-equal corporate boards.  This is because women and men bring different skills and perspectives to the workplace, including different attitudes to risk and collaboration.  It is known that this results in higher productivity and even higher wages for everybody.</p><p>As someone once said, "a lot done, more to do".  This is a step along the way.  There is so much to do, be it in relation to childcare, the constitutional amendments highlighted by the Citizens' Assembly regarding the value we as a country place on carers and the so-called care economy or the gender balance on State and corporate boards and in our universities and schools.  I am rehashing other debates we have had on gender equality but we must get more women involved in politics and leadership roles.  I have seen a huge difference in the conversation between previous Seanaid and this one because we have 40% women in this Seanad.  I generally believe in 50:50 gender quotas because we will never have an equal society if we do not have gender equality in the Government and among those who create policy.  If we do not have an equitable make-up among policymakers, we will never have an equitable country.</p><p>I very much welcome this Bill.  I look forward to seeing more progressive and positive changes for a fairer economy and diverse labour force in the time ahead.</p></speech>

It shows the priority he is giving it.  I thank him also for acknowledging the great work of Deputy David Stanton as well.</p><p>What is extraordinary is that we have to legislate for gender equality where pay is concerned.  We should have long since moved past the stage where women must prove their worth and that they are of equal value in the workplace.  However, the finding by the EU that there is a 16% disparity in pay between men and women and that in Ireland that disparity stands at 14% demonstrates that we have deeply embedded gender norms with regard to influencing the rate of pay for women in the workplace and attitudes to women in the workplace.  I value the commission reports and the words of Dr. Catherine Day in particular, in her open letter to the House of the Oireachtas arising out of the gender equality assembly.  In it she says: </p> <blockquote> 	Gender equality is a matter of human rights, justice, and fairness.  It must underpin all of our interactions as a society.  The State has a special responsibility to treat all of its citizens equally, regardless of their gender identity, in compliance with article 40.1 of our Constitution (&lsquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law&rsquo;).  </blockquote> <p>This is a big step in that direction.  There is no doubt that a woman is much more likely to experience career disruption.  As an employment lawyer, I have always found astonishing the attitude of employers towards women who might be of childbearing age.  They have a discriminatory attitude that such women are likely to need time off for having babies, as though having babies was somehow irrelevant to our society and not really that important, which is the point I generally make to them about their unreasonable attitudes.</p><p>Women are more likely to carry a disproportionate responsibility in the aftermath of a relationship breakdown in that they are more likely to be the ones who are caring for children.  They are also more likely to be the applicants in family court pursuing maintenance, trying to enforce agreements between partners over the care of children and they are more likely to be the lone parents who are the carers.  All that being the case, we need to ensure that when women are in the workplace their hour there is of equal value to a man&rsquo;s, given they have so many steps along the way that may disrupt that right and that ability.  There is no excuse for it, so I do not accept the particular citing of the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland in that regard.</p><p>Older women, women from ethnic minorities and higher earning women are more likely to be victims of the gender pay gap.  It is so bad that, as Senator Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly said, from around 9<sup></sup>November each year, women are effectively not being paid and are working for free.  I acknowledge also the work of the WorkEqual campaign in highlighting that fact.</p><p>I welcome the provisions of the Bill.  Transparency and publication are the way forward.  The requirement to have transparency should also be a factor in any public tendering, to the effect that there must be a declaration regarding gender-equal pay.  Large multinational companies tend to carry out ethical audits on their suppliers.  I would like to see a category in such audits that deals with gender pay and that it becomes a factor of assessment for companies.  I want companies to drive towards and show that gender equality in pay is important to them.  They should boast about it and have it as a unique selling point. </p><p>This Bill sits nicely in the employment policy legislation.  While the fact that it deals with discrimination against women leaves the way open for cases to be taken in the Circuit Court and High Court, it is much more likely that we will see this litigated at the Workplace Relations Commission.  I had intended asking how the ruling of the Supreme Court that the commission must now be in public would factor into this.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s clarification in that regard.  I welcome this change because public hearings are the best deterrent and means of keeping manners on employers because the reputational damage of a case is a very good negotiating factor, one I use personally, with errant employers.</p><p>I understand also that redress does not include compensation, as it often does not within employment law.  However, I ask that there consideration be made for retrospective application and that redress goes back at least to the commencement of this Bill.  That is not an unusual precedent in employment law.  In the minimum wage area, I have been involved in cases where I secured awards for people going back 15 years where there has been a disparity or a failure to pay.  We should be able to include a retrospective provision as that would be stronger.  While we cannot provide for compensation, we can bring redress back to when the discrepancy arose and a date from which that could be calculated.  That would hopefully stop the catastrophically arrogant decisions of some employers.</p><p>In addition, we have in employment equality a penalisation and victimisation aspect whereby someone who makes a complaint has an opportunity to go back into the WRC in the aftermath of an award.  People need to have the additional protection of being able to take a penalisation claim because complainants may be given different shifts or be treated differently and employers may become awkward after a case.  There is a long-standing precedent in the WRC that persons who successfully make victimisation claims after having taken cases get almost double what they got the first time around.  That is a very good way to deter employers from being spiteful in the aftermath of cases.  Of course, there are fantastic employers out there but unfortunately a small few end up in the WRC.  A few come before the WRC all the time and clearly factor that in.  All of this should be a very sobering warning to employers not to persist in discriminatory practices.</p><p>There are other matters that we need to address.  As one of them is outside the remit of the Bill, I am not quite sure how we would go about it.  In recent years, we have seen an interesting trend in the legal profession whereby the more lucrative areas of law, of which, notwithstanding public opinion, there are not many, are dominated by men.  The less lucrative areas of law are dominated by women.  That is an interesting pattern in behaviour.  Outside of that, we see whole professions, for example, childcare, where women dominate the workforce and again these roles are the lower paid.  A third level-type qualification is now needed to work in childcare.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have had that fantastic professionalisation in the sector.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1631" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#Y00200"><p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to the House and welcome the opportunity to debate Second Stage of this important Bill.  I thank the Minister for his kind words of acknowledgement for the work I and my Labour Party colleagues have done over many years to bring forward similar legislation.  Indeed, the Bill we brought forward seeking to address the gender pay gap passed Second Stage in this House over four years ago, in May 2017.  It passed Committee Stage here in October 2017 with Government and cross-party support and passed Final Stages in October 2018.  Indeed, it then went on to pass Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in November 2018.  It has been a long journey since then to come back before this House with the Government Bill.  While I very much welcome this Bill, I feel it could have been done much more swiftly, and the Minister probably agrees it has been a long time in the making.  I thank him for setting out on the journey and for the consultation, and there was a great deal of consultation.  However, I should say that over the years since I first introduced our Labour Party Bill in 2017, I have spoken at numerous employer, trade union and human resource management events about the gender pay gap and the introduction of a gender pay gap reporting mechanism.  It is clear that employers, unions and public sector bodies across the country are ready and were prepared for this some time ago, given such legislation has been introduced in so many other jurisdictions, and that we have an EU imperative to do so as well.  It could have been done more quickly but, that said, I am glad it is before us now.  I understand it is to move swiftly through this House and that we will have Committee Stage very soon.</p><p>I did not think it would be necessary to say why we need a gender pay gap Bill but it seems there is still some disagreement as to whether a gender pay gap exists and whether legislation is necessary.  To remind anyone who needs reminding, the gender pay gap is the term we use to describe the difference between the pay of women and men calculated on an average basis in gross hourly earnings.  While it is usually presented as a gross hourly earnings gap, there is, of course, also a weekly and monthly gap.  Senator Marie Sherlock has spoken extensively on this aspect and I know she is going to speak on it again today.  We know that, on average, women in the EU earn 16% less per hour than men; that is based on European Commission figures from 2018 and those figures show that Ireland had an hourly gender pay gap of 14%.  This has meant that, across the EU, we mark equal pay day on 9 November, as colleagues are aware, and this marks the moment when women symbolically stop getting paid when compared to our male colleagues, with so much of the working year still remaining.  A similar concept lies behind the idea that at 4 p.m. every day, we stop getting paid when compared to male colleagues.</p><p>Clearly, there are many reasons for this.  Certainly, women and men have different work patterns, there is a great deal of occupational gender segregation across different employments and different careers, and there is a preponderance of women in lower paid and part-time work.  All of us are very aware of these issues and I do not think many of us would accept this is just to do with the choices of individual women.  Women and men, as we all know, make choices within circumstances, contexts and structures not of our choosing.  If we, as a society, cannot facilitate women who want to work more and want to earn the same amount as our husbands and partners, then we should be setting up the structures and the legislative frameworks to enable women to do that, and to support those women and men who choose to work in that way.  That is clearly the impetus behind this Bill, which I very much welcome.</p><p>If there was any doubt about this, just three months ago, the Minister was kind enough to come to this House on International Women's Day to respond to a matter I had put down with Senator Sherlock about the gender pay gap.  As it happened, just that week a piece had been published in <i>The Sunday Times</i>on updated gender pay gap figures for RT&Eacute; showing that one in five women working in RT&Eacute; earns less than &euro;40,000 compared to almost one in ten men, so there are twice as many women on that lower pay in one organisation.  I do not think any of us believe that organisation is unique.  We know from other jurisdictions where gender pay gap transparency legislation has been in place for some time that it can be really effective in addressing the disparity between the earning levels of women and men, for example, in Belgium.</p><p>Senator Sherlock will speak about the weekly gap, which we also know to be very extensive.  The average weekly earnings for women in this country are 25% less than the average weekly earnings of men, which again is a very stark figure more than 30 years after we introduced equal pay legislation.  We know from EUROSTAT figures that this translates into a serious gap in pensions between women and men, so this does not just stop when we finish earning in paid employment because, of course, it has a knock-on effect into pensions.  This is a huge issue that requires tackling and, as I said, I very much welcome the fact we will now have legislation.</p><p>I want to address three specific areas where I feel the Bill could be strengthened and where it differs significantly from the Labour Party Bill we proposed four years ago.  I hope we can address some of these issues further on Committee Stage.  I acknowledge the Minister has already brought forward amendments and that he had indicated in March in this House that he was going to bring forward amendments which would strengthen to Bill.  I welcome that and I hope we can work constructively to strengthen it further.</p><p>I want to outline the three points.  First, in terms of organisations to which this Bill will apply, our legislation applied to all employers with more than 50 employees and we modelled that on the powers already in the establishment legislation for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  We did not see it as necessary to phase in the legislation and given the long gestation period of this Bill, I do not see why it still has this phased basis, starting with 250 employees, despite the fact very few employers in Ireland have such a large number of employees, and it then goes to 150 and only then to 50.  There is a concern that it will take a very long time to implement and to apply to most people working.  I ask why not phase it in more swiftly or, indeed, go straight to 50 employees.</p><p>The second key change is the role of Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which the Minister has spoken about.  We had envisaged a much more extensive role for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission so that it would actually be the body collating and taking the data.  I accept, as I have accepted before in this House, that this might not be the most appropriate mechanism to provide for collation and publication of the data.  However, what concerns me is that the current Bill is so vague as to how this will actually be done.  Again, given the extensive consultation, I would like to hear more about what exactly is proposed under the proposed new section 20A(5), which simply provides that regulations &ldquo;may&rdquo; prescribe the form and manner in which the data will be published, and so on.  At this point, we need to know, and employers, workers and unions need to know, how exactly this will be done and what is going to be the key mechanism.</p><p>The final point is about enforcement and penalties.  Again, I am glad the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will continue to have a role, as we had envisaged in our own Bill.  However, I am concerned about the onus being placed on individuals to go to the Workplace Relations Commission to seek enforcement under the proposed new section 85C.  We can explore this further on Committee Stage and Report Stage.  What is key is that we look elsewhere and look to jurisdictions that have well-established pay transparency legislation to tackle the gender pay gap and that we seek to ensure the legislation is strong and effective from the start, and that it will, therefore, be effective in reducing this ongoing and glaring gender pay gap.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.102" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1686" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#Y00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Bill.  The gender pay gap is not the same as equal pay for equal work.  Paying men and women differently for the same role is illegal, and gender is one of the nine grounds provided for in the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015 that protect women's entitlement to be treated equally in regard to work and jobs.</p> <p>There are several causes of the gender pay gap.  When the lower-paid jobs are taken up by women and few are in management roles, a gender pay gap can emerge.  However, the issues that do not get as much notice or attention in public discourse or in mainstream media relate to the time women take out of the labour market due to caring responsibilities and how the impact this has on their career progression, earnings and pension entitlements negatively affects women.  The gender pay gap reporting mechanism will collect these data for future policy formation.  Women predominantly take on more unpaid work than men, such as caring and household work.  Women reduce their hours at a higher rate than men and spend nearly 60% longer than men on unpaid work per week, according to an EU study.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Implementing gender pay gap reporting will raise awareness among employers, employees, policymakers and the wider public.  The role gender pay gap reporting will play in raising awareness of long-standing inequality in the labour market and sectors adversely affected will benefit future policy decisions to bring about a fair and more equitable system.  I suppose one of the problems - it has been mentioned in this debate - in assessing the wage gap is getting accurate data and that is one of the important aspects of this Bill.  Closing the gender pay gap requires a whole-of-government approach, affordable childcare, the introduction of a living wage, collective bargaining rights, equality proofing, departmental budgets, and enhanced educational and income supports for lone parents.</p><p>Senator Mullen mentioned that this Bill passed without much debate in the D&aacute;il.  I would argue that Sinn F&eacute;in sought to improve the Bill.  We support the introduction of the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019 and we constructively contributed to the Joint Committee on Justice's pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill.  We submitted several amendments that were not included at that stage.  They were submitted again in the D&aacute;il.  We acknowledge that reporting itself will not eliminate the gender pay gap but will bring mainstream awareness to the issue and incentivise employers to play their role in closing the gap.  We were disappointed that the Government did not take on board the amendments put forward by my colleague, Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire, on Committee Stage around strengthening the Bill in relation to the roll-out period, the class of employer that regulation is applied to and the inclusion of employees who are on flexible working-hour contracts.  These were debated by Deputy Funchion in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>We also believe that the Bill should provide for the inclusion of an amendment for the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015.  We do not agree with the length of time given for the reporting mechanism to kick in, depending on the size of the organisation.  We propose that reporting start sooner, at 50 plus employees.  Reporting must be extended to organisations with fewer than 50 employees.  The vast majority of SMEs employ 50 or fewer people.  We believe that 20 plus employees would be a much more worthwhile figure for the purposes of collecting this important data.</p><p>We also want the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to play a bigger role in the monitoring and enforcement of the regulations and that where an employer fails to publish the required information on one or more occasion within a five-year period the Minister would make a request to that company and that the title of the company be published by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.</p><p>On Second Stage, I welcome the Bill.  Wage discrimination for women and also people at the intersections of race, sexual orientation and gender identity, must end.</p></speech>

I am sure we are keen to hear the Minister's response to the issues raised.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for bringing this Bill.  It is also appropriate to thank Senator Bacik.  Fundamentally, this piece of legislation is part of a suite of legislation looking at the intersection between gender equality and employment rights which Senator Bacik has brought through these Houses, including the important legislation on collective bargaining and, indeed, her new proposals in respect of reproductive rights leave.  It is appropriate to acknowledge that because it is an example of taking two equality issues and looking deeply at how they can intersect and how we as legislators can address them both together.</p> <p>There are areas in Senator Bacik's legislation which, I believe, are stronger than this legislation.  I understand many of the principles but an excessively cautious approach, not in terms of impact but in terms of timing, and strength and scope of impact, is being taken throughout this Bill.</p> <p>I join with others in saying that the idea of waiting three years before we look to employers of 150 or fewer workers is not acceptable at all.  It is taking place, the Minister should bear in mind, not simply in the situation where we were a couple of years ago when we were debating the original legislation which has had very long debate and lots of scrutiny, but also in the context of a new Citizens' Assembly which has made clear recommendations and set hard timelines for the kind of gender equality it wants to see in our workplaces.  This Bill is also coming through at a moment post-Covid at the brink of just transition when we are seeing a considerable amount of companies restructuring and reorganising themselves, and the potential rise in remote working.  It is really important that they get things right from the beginning.  Part of them getting things right, their environmental policy, looking at how they use remote working and ensuring that it does not, for example, damage opportunities for progression but that they think things through is that they would be reporting on the gender pay equality issues.  I would urge that, on Committee and Report Stages, the Minister would reduce that three-year period to allow for this to be meaningful and in tune at least with the moment we are in, if not ahead of it.</p> <p>I also note and agree with the concerns about the many places in the Bill where we talk about "Regulations made under this section may prescribe...".  That may be a choice in drafting but it is important that there is certainty and predictability.  In that context, I say "will" would be more appropriate so that we do not have an incremental piece arguing for the delay in these being brought in because we have only tried it this way for a while, we changed it there for a while and now we are only finally producing regulations in one of the aspects.  It needs to start strongly and with intent and clarity.</p> <p>I want to highlight a few areas that I believe might need further strengthening within the Bill.  There are aspects that are really good.  I welcome that the median is being discussed in terms of hourly remuneration.  I also welcome that there is an identification of certain different kinds.  There is a recognition, for example, of temporary contracts and temporary employees.  That will be really important.  We need to make sure this legislation works for all kinds of employees and that it catches the facts of more insecure working-style contracts for many women in the workplaces.  I am concerned that we may not be catching it at the top.  While bonuses are addressed, it is not clear whether benefits-in-kind, for example, will capture the situations we are seeing increasingly where shares are being given as part of a remuneration package.  It is important that would be caught and monitored, and some of the particular privileges and measures that are given to special assignees.  We need to be looking at the gender equality at that level in the workplace as well and making sure that is captured.</p> <p>I welcome the fact that there is at least a snapshot whereby there is a requirement for reporting on the numbers of staff at each quintile within a workplace.  There is something still around progression.  That is why being clearer about the times in which this reporting will take place is important.  That is something that has been key to the success of, for example, the Athena Scientific Women's Academic Network, SWAN, programme within the university systems.  That programme charts and requires evidence of progression and rather than merely a disappointing snapshot from time to time, it shows where is the movement between different levels and what addresses are there.  As Senator Warfield said, there are many reasons for the gender pay gap but they are not excuses.  They are problems to be tackled that they identify.  It is around less women being promoted into higher-paid roles, it is about missing rungs of the ladder for women climbing within organisation but is also around certain kinds of work being undervalued compared with other kinds of work.  There are a number of issues to tackle.  For this to be effective, we need this legislation to provide not only a snapshot but arrows towards sectoral changes because some of the changes will be specific to specific sectors and to the wider national and legislative changes that we need to take to tackle these issues.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill.  I look forward to engaging on it.  There are a few areas that may need strengthening and there are loopholes.  We also need to show seriousness about this and, indeed, passion about implementing it.  That is why I would urge that the Bill be reviewed by the Minister's office with just the thought of if we wanted this to send the strongest possible signal, how would we strengthen it.  There are some very good ideas in Senator Bacik's original legislation in that regard and there are also some good ideas from the Citizens' Assembly.</p> <p>I will finish early in order to facilitate colleagues.</p></speech>

This is a proud day for me because I founded the cross-party group on workplace equality, which focused on the gender pay gap, in 2016.  That groups started a conversation in Leinster House and we held many briefings for Senators and Deputies.  At the time people looked at me when I mentioned the gender pay gap because they did not know what it was.  There was a realisation in both Houses that it was a real matter that needed to be tackled.</p> <p>I am very happy to be joined today by two co-chairs of the group, Senators Bacik and Currie.  The group has grown in strength and we are very happy to see the legislation coming today.  I am glad the Minister pointed out that this Bill is just one of a suite of measures because it cannot be seen as solving the problem in isolation.  I am very happy to have been involved with the WorkEqual campaign with Ms Sonya Lennon down through the years, and speaking about this and getting it on the political agenda is always the first step in any campaign.  We will not get into the justification of a gender pay gap but it exists.  There are many pay gap deniers out there and we have heard from some today but that gap exists and it is a real problem not only for individuals but society and the economy.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons for the gender pay gap and I will run through some of the more common.  As the Minister pointed out, the lack of pay transparency is a major contributor and was the top contributing factor as identified by submissions when consultations on the matter opened.  There is also the question of women stepping out of the workforce for family reasons and a lack of affordable childcare.  We heard about giving women choice but most women I know do not have the choice to return to their jobs.  Where I live in north county Dublin, which has a rapidly expanding population, there are not enough cr&egrave;ches or childminders.  For women who have the option of local childminders or cr&egrave;ches, the cost is completely unaffordable and inaccessible from a pay perspective.</p> <p>If we are to give women a real choice, the State must once and for all involve itself in childcare provision.  There is a historical unwillingness on the part of the State to get involved with childcare provision because it is almost seen that a woman's place is in the home and it will not facilitate anything going against that.  I am thankful that this view is being met head-on but we must seriously and radically overhaul how we do childcare in this country.</p> <p>We can even look around the gender pay gap for women with children but studies have demonstrated that women aged between 25 and 46 with a degree in Ireland earn 28% less than male counterparts, whether they have a child or not.  These differences are down to gender.</p> <p>There are also differences in gendered occupations.  It is a sort of chicken-and-egg scenario because women are in low-paid careers or are the careers low paid because this is where women work and this is the value we put on work done by women?</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, referred to the legal profession and I know much about that as I am a solicitor as well.  She is dead right in pointing out that high-paid aspects of the law are dominated by male solicitors while the touchy-feely lower-paid aspects are dominated by women.  It is very hard for women to break into the higher-paid legal careers.  We have more female solicitors in Ireland than we have ever had but they are not becoming partners.</p> <p>My time is nearly up but I have pages of material.  I could stay here talking about this and use all the time for the debate.  There is conscious and subconscious bias and historical inequalities, as pointed out by Senator O'Reilly.  Women are constantly asked for their pay history, meaning this inequality is carried forward.  There are performance reviews based on subjective factors and there may be a company culture where men may be seen as better performers or given more opportunities to network.  We all know about the golf outings but we have not all been invited to them.  Women do work within organisations, collecting for birthdays and organising nights out.  These are not billable hours but they are very important to the production and work environment.  Women do this but when it comes to a pay review, it is not taken into account.</p> <p>This Bill is the first step we can take.  What gets measured gets done so I am very happy to see this Bill here.  I hope the Minister will pursue this and I have every faith he will.  He should also pursue the other suite of measures.  Companies do not have to wait on legislation as they can start doing audits and putting systems in place now.</p></speech>

We have waited for it for a long time.  The gender pay gap is often criticised as being a blunt measurement and the argument is the 14.4% pay gap does not mean women are necessarily paid that much less in a like-for-like scenario, although I know that happens.  We already have the right to equal pay but we lack transparency</p> <p>The gender pay gap is the overall national percentage difference in average hourly pay for men and women, with women earning 14.4% less than men for every hour that they work, on average.  That happens across their lives and across workplaces.  Women are more likely to work part-time and be in senior positions.  They are far more likely to take unpaid caring roles, whether caring forwards for their children, backwards for parents or U-bending, namely, doing both.  This reflects my life stage and that of most of my friends.</p> <p>Women are deeply affected with the gender pay gap by their role in having children.  With the leave they take they are more likely to fall out of the workplace, as I did because of a lack of flexible work and trying to juggle everything.  There is also the question of accessible and affordable childcare, which can make it less likely that women will return to work.  Sometimes women just want to spend time at home, which is okay too.  I will never regret the years I spent at home with my children, as they were the best years.  It is a pity they do not remember it now.  There is also the question of subconscious bias.</p> <p>Covid-19 has demonstrated how we regress when under pressure.  There is a lack of progress.  Some have criticised the gender pay legislation as a blunt instrument and there is a more complex position to be reflected but this requires a holistic response.  This legislation is the start, not the end.  It will not solve the problem but show where it lies in more detail.  It will provide badly needed data.</p> <p>It is really important that information should be transparent and employees know how their organisation is performing.  Workers should be protected from being identified but they should be empowered to take action if they wish.  It is great that details are being published under ministerial guidelines to include mean and median gaps in hourly pay, bonus pay, part-time pay, as well as benefit-in-kind.  The employee threshold is initially 250 and that will reduce to 50, with a review in four years.  There are countries that have made progress on this matter, and in Iceland that number is 25, in Finland it is 30 and in Sweden it is ten.  I would like us to be ambitious with this trajectory.  I take on board Senator Clifford-Lee's point and progressive companies should take it on board.</p> <p>It is also very positive that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will the power to apply to the Circuit or High Court for an order requiring a person to comply with ministerial regulations and that an individual employee may make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p> <p>I welcome this legislation as part of our strategy to address equality of opportunity, this must feature in a bigger framework for meaningful and transformative change.  This should focus not just on the problem but on the solutions.  I mean this both in terms of a national strategy and the need for organisations to produce their own action plans to address pay and career equity.  We require change at every level of society, whether it is in homes, workplaces or in national policy.  Employers can play a key role in this and we must democratise our workplaces.  We are not at that point yet.  We have 100 years of workplaces in this State but the office has not cracked it for everybody.</p> <p>We need affordable and accessible childcare and flexible workplaces for all.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It needs to be a level playing field.  There is an emphasis on remote working at the moment but remote working is only one part of flexibility.  The people who cannot access remote working can access other parts of flexibility.  I have mentioned Finland to the House before as an exemplar.  We need to democratise our own homes where the care is shared and valued.  I agree with Senator O'Reilly's comments about tax individualisation which is something that I am still very much against.  This is ultimately about facilitating choice and increasing opportunities.  Although I could go on I will stop there.</p></speech>

It is rather ironic that we are sitting in this House with female Members discussing the gender pay gap in the most unfriendly female workspace in the country.  The furore we had when the Minister for Justice was pregnant and seeking maternity leave was outrageous as was that this should happen in a modern society.</p> <p>November 9 has been mentioned today as the day when women will stop being paid while men will continue on receiving payment.  The 14% figure has been mentioned.  The State has set targets of a reduction of 9% by 2025, 4% by 2030, and eliminating pay discrimination by 2035.   Let us be honest about it because pay legislation has been enacted for over 40 years.  Why would we take to 2035 to flatten the curve to have everybody in the same pay?  That baffles me.</p> <p>I commend Senator Bacik and the Labour Party for their Bill which was brought into this House in 2017.  I ask the Minister as he passes through Committee and Report Stages here to seriously take on board any amendments that are brought forward.  Senator Bacik, in particular, has been a great champion of equality right down through the years for as long as I can remember.  </p> <p>The issue of pay gaps in the public sector does not arise to a great deal.  In my time as president of the Teachers Union of Ireland I came across eight women who were employed by a vocational education committee as teachers, who worked a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job every week and through the month of July.  They received the month of August as holidays.  When I came across these women, the first thing that crossed my mind was that the vocational education committee would not have dreamed of doing that if there was one man on the staff.  The bottom line therefore is that women have been exploited right through the ages.  I know from working with men in an environment where we had equal pay that the issue of pregnancy was a constant issue of discussion which revolved around how women were planning their pregnancy to ensure that they were out for a year or were doing this, that or the other.  We have to get away from that and start treating people as equals.</p> <p>I have many things I wish to say here but time is running short.  The public sector is very good insofar as labour is organised and represented.  People have been talking here about going to the Workplace Relations Commission to make representations on issues such as pay.  None or very few individuals are strong enough to go into the WRC on their own to fight their corner.  That is why I will use my last two seconds or minute to plead with people in the private sector to join a union and to become part of organised labour where one has somebody watching one&rsquo;s back all of the time.  So many companies now want people to come in without being members of organised labour.  They say that they will have a workplace committee and we have legislated for that.  Exploitation, however, is going on all of the time and most of the time in my 25 years of trade unionism most of the exploitation that I saw was against women.  I am pleading with women in the private sector to organise labour, join a trade union to be represented and to go forward as a cohesive group.  That is the one request I make.</p> <p>Stopping off at 50 employees as a threshold is not the way to go.  We need to drop that threshold down to 20 or even ten employees.  There is no such requirement as we have known for a long time that this is coming.  There is no need to stage this in the way the Minister is talking about.  As my time a short I will stop there.</p></speech>

I also pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Clifford-Lee, and Sonya Lennon who started the very good WorkEqual campaign in 2016 which certainly educated me and many others about this particular issue.  Closing the gender pay gap is a priority for the Government and completely rightly so.</p> <p>It is estimated that at the current pace of change it would take 55 years to close the pay gap.  That is quite shocking when one thinks about it.  We need to accelerate any change that we can make and it is incumbent on all of us in this House, and of course in the D&aacute;il, to do that.  The gap is experienced very acutely by older women, women from ethnic minority backgrounds and those with disabilities.  It has a particularly difficult impact on certain cohorts of women and we need to be very mindful of that.  Possibly this is because women are disproportionately represented in low-paid and precarious employment.  The gap at the moment is spoken about as 14.4% meaning that women are really only being paid for 75% of the year.  I suggest that it is higher than that at the moment because when we saw the unemployment figures coming through as a result of the pandemic, we certainly noticed that the increase in these figures was higher among women than men.  It could be as high as 17% at this point in time.  </p> <p>Pay transparency is recognised internationally as a good tool to help reduce pay gaps because it gives access to information to employees.  That is important.  It is a first and important step but this is really about how we move forward, what happens next, the follow-through and the cultural change within our employment sector.</p> <p>The gender pay gap is, of course, not just a gap it is a gaping injustice.  We need a fair and equal economy that rewards work and not gender.  Gender should not come into any element of pay.  People need to be paid a fair wage or salary for the work they do.  This legislation will not be enough in its own right.  We need to work on other areas that will help to reduce the gender pay gap and one of these is to establish affordable childcare.  That has to be a priority for this Government.  I know that the Minister fully takes on board the issues around supporting childcare for families and I know that point had been well made by other colleagues.</p> <p>Shared parental leave also has to be improved.  This was dealt with in a Bill that I and Senator Chambers brought in to the last D&aacute;il.  There are many different areas that we need to look at to support women in and coming back into the workplace, and for many reasons.  We all saw the impact of the 2012 legislation in respect of women&rsquo;s pension inequity.  This was quite shocking.  We have moved some way in changing that but the longer women are out of work or in lower-paid employment, the greater the pension gap is going to be which will create problems down the line.</p> <p>It is great to hear the announcement today from the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on the 10,000 places are that are going to be made available on the Springboard+ scheme to encourage people back into the workplace and that women are included in that.  It is fair and accurate to say that it is our generation&rsquo;s task to eradicate inequality and that is a very difficult job to do.  We should be able to eradicate discrimination and the gender pay gap is a form of discrimination against women.   I thank the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#CC00100"><p>The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is welcome to the Chamber.  I am delighted that we are finally debating Second Stage of this Bill today.  It has been a while coming.  I pay tribute in particular to my colleague, Senator Bacik, who introduced legislation in this space four years ago.</p> <p>I wish to make two main comments about the Bill.  The first is how important it is to understand the enormity of the gender pay gap and that there is no single bullet.  I am heartened to hear all the comments today.  The Bill is just one tool in reducing the gender pay gap.  The Minister has heard me talk about the need for collective bargaining.  The right to be recognised for collective bargaining purposes for both men and women is probably the single greatest tool for closing the gender pay gap.  There have been many references to the 14% hourly pay gap.  I get very frustrated when people talk about such a pay gap.  How many of us ever think in terms of how much we are paid per hour?  What does the pay per hour ever tell us about our ability to pay bills, our standard of living or the quality of people's work?  What people get paid per week or per month is what is important.  In 2019 the Central Statistics Office, CSO, earnings data based on administrative data sources told us that the gap between women and men in the labour force is more than 25%.  When we look at those in retirement, the gap is even greater at 28.6%.  We must look at the pay per hour, but we must also look at the hours per week.  We know that 30% of all women in employment in this country are in part-time employment compared with 11% of men, so it is the weekly pay gap that we need to address.</p> <p>The second point focuses on my concerns about the Bill.  While I am delighted that we are discussing the Bill, I am concerned about its lack of ambition.  I appeal to the Minister to get this right now, as opposed to waiting five years for the review to try and address some of the shortcomings as I see them in the existing Bill.  The first relates to the number of workers who will be covered.  What was the evidential basis for deciding on workplaces with 50 or more workers and that the legislation would start with workplaces of 250 or more workers?  The pace of introduction is incredibly slow.  Workplaces with more than 50 workers would only cover 57% of all employees in this country.  It would cover less than 2% of all workplaces.  How can we expect to make any dent on the gender pay gap if nearly half of all workers in this country will be unaffected by this legislation?</p> <p>My second concern relates to the failure to compare full-time and part-time workers.  It has been eloquently articulated by many speakers today that those who are in a part-time work trap have greater difficulty in accessing pay progression in terms of career progression.  Working part time has a significant and real impact on women and men, but women in particular, as there is a greater share of women in part-time employment and therefore on their capacity to progress in the workplace.  We must compare full-time workers with part-time workers.</p> <p>The third point I wish to make is how some of the criteria stipulated in the Bill, in particular regarding temporary work and the share of female workers per quartile across a company, are different to the treatment set out in section 2, which looks at the median, mean, bonuses and other criteria between men and women.  We must be as ambitious as possible for this legislation.  Let us get it right now.  We will submit a number of amendments which I look forward to tabling before next Monday.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  This is an issue of concern for a very long time.  Some of my colleagues in the legal profession fought this battle decades ago and established in the courts the discrepancies in the way people were paid different amounts for the work they were doing.  They deserve great credit for that.  Many of them are still in practice and still fighting that battle.  It is very difficult for us to understand why it has taken so long to bring solutions here, but I praise the Minister for the work he has done and the commitment he has given to this matter.</p><p>I will respond to some of the questions that were posed.  It is very important to acknowledge that this is the beginning of a body of work that I hope will bring a resolution to this issue, but it is not the solution in and of itself.  It is not a panacea to address discrepancies in pay rates.</p><p>Senator Mullen commented on the fact that the Bill was not voted against by any Deputy when it went through the D&aacute;il.  I do not agree that it is a reason for scepticism.  Sometimes when legislation goes through the Houses, we are all <i>ad idem</i>on it because it makes sense and it is the right thing to do.  That is sometimes why legislation is not challenged.</p><p>I read the European Commission's report some years ago that dealt starkly with the different pay rates and specifically the gender pay gap in Europe in the various member states.  At the time I read it I had some difficulty with the methodology that had been employed.  It is very popular in politics today to say one has travelled a journey on an issue and it is easy for me to say that as somebody who was not subject to the gender pay gap.  I know that it existed when I was an employee in the private sector in the past.  When I look back at women who worked with me, with whom I was friendly, I know they were not paid the same rate as me, so I know it happens.  One of the difficulties I had with the European Commission's report was that it did not allow, for example, for the number of years worked by a person who had taken maternity leave.  I now realise in retrospect that it should not have taken account of that because there is a fundamental unfairness and inequity in saying that somebody should be penalised essentially for being a parent.  The fact is that only women can bear the biological burden of giving birth to children, taking maternity leave and creating the bond in the early years and there is a fundamental unfairness in saying that they should be penalised in their work status thereafter.  That is very important for us to recognise.  It is one of the many areas of concern.  Many speakers have spoken about the different areas in which women are discriminated against in the workplace, but it is one area, in particular over the course of a longer career and in the higher paid professions and in positions in multinational companies, where women suffer when they take time out to avail of maternity leave.  Even in the past year since I became a Senator, we have talked in this Chamber about the benefits and the importance of providing leave for both parents and the need to facilitate the early years for parents.  It is so wrong that we would penalise those people for taking the opportunity to be a parent in that context, but more than that, it is also important that we do not disincentivise parenthood and people who occupy that position because we need them to take on that role.  We need them to provide the workers of the future, the taxpayers of the future, the pension payers of the future.  That is tremendously important.</p><p>I will make one other point that is tremendously important to mention in the context of this debate.  I bring myself back to January 2020 during the general election campaign in D&uacute;n Laoghaire when all of the candidates were invited to a hustings in Loreto College, Foxrock, which is a girls school near where I live.  There were fourth, fifth and sixth years at the event.  One of the girls asked what we would do about the gender pay gap.  A response was given by a right wing candidate suggesting that the pay gap was a myth, who subsequently came last in the election and lost his deposit.  That was enlightening.  Much more important than that was the fact that young girls who were certainly not in full-time employment were aware of the issue, understood it and were willing to raise it.  While we require employers, the Government, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and society to take note of it, that gave me great hope because in the future we also need employees to know their rights, to stand up for their rights and question it when they know they are subject to a pay gap that is based on gender or some other spurious ground.  It gave me great hope that there was a young woman in that position, raising the issue and fighting that battle.  I hope she will continue to do so when she becomes an employee.  I congratulate the Minister and look forward to him passing the legislation.</p></speech>

I want to begin by addressing some of the comments made by Senator Mullen about comparing apples and oranges.  His remarks were facetious.  If he actually went out, he would find this is based on evidence.  I would certainly encourage him to look at Central Statistics Office, CSO, data or the data compiled over a long period by the Higher Education Authority on graduate salaries.  If one looks at the CSO data, based on all of its research comparing the median income levels in every single profession across the board, it shows, almost consistently, that men earn more than women.  Senator Ward is correct about some of the higher professions.  Doctors on average were found by the CSO to be earning on average about &euro;30,000 more per year if they were male rather than female.</p> <p>Prior to my election to the Oireachtas, I worked with the Higher Education Authority which carried out annual surveys of graduates which discovered there was a pay gap between male and female graduates.  For the most part, these were ambitious young people who have succeeded and performed.  However, that gap continued to exist.  In fact, it is found to exist even a year or two after graduation and, in many cases, a decade or so.  For those graduates between the ages of 30 and 50, that gap tended to widen.  One fact I found quite interesting was that, nine months after graduation, a male would earn &euro;35,600 on average while a female would earn &euro;31,680.  There is the valid point that men are over-represented in courses around business and technology.  However, when one compares like for like, we are still talking about an annual difference of &euro;1,876.  Even among our third level graduates, there continues to be a significant difference.</p> <p>This is not going to solve the gender pay gap in and of itself.  As we become more aware of the issues and there is more transparency, it will help.  I agree with Senator Higgins when she referred to the Athena SWAN, scientific women's academic network, programme that operates in our third level institutions.  It is important we do not just publish the data but that we look at ways in which progress can be measured.</p> <p>Much more needs to be done, however.  Following on from Senator Ward in regard to young people who are aware of this issue, we need to look at addressing some of the challenges within some of our schools.  There are problems still within some of our schools.  For instance, in many female-only schools, they do not have access to subjects such as mechanical drawing which often leads to careers in a particular way.  In male-only schools, they do not have access to home economics.  From even an early age, if one does not have access to particular subjects, that almost defines the career choice that one will have to follow.</p> <p>We have the potential to challenge some of the stereotypes.  In some of those careers which have been, or seem to be, traditionally dominated, by one gender or another, we need to place much more effort.  We have got to place much more emphasis on encouraging young girls and women into technology and computing.  In teaching, education and other careers, we have got to look at ways of encouraging far more young men.  One is what one can see.  This remains one of the challenges that we see with regard to the gendering of professions.  I do not believe this legislation will solve all of our problems.  Certainly, in terms of transparency and making the data clear, what we can see we will be able to address.</p></speech>

This Bill is certainly welcome.  It has been spoken about for a long time and, as the Minister acknowledged, much work has been done previously on this topic.  It is good to see it introduced here today.  As my colleague, Senator Warfield, said, we will be supporting the Bill.</p><p>The important role both the trade union movement and the National Women's Council of Ireland have played in championing this issue for many years must be recognised.  When I joined SIPTU in the mid-2000s, I remember being told that the gender pay gap was at 17%.  Fourteen years later, it is at 14%.  If we were not to act now, by a rough calculation, we would be waiting another 70 years to try to get some sort of equality.  It is important that we take action now.</p><p>The Bill is welcome but it could be better and more ambitious.  I agree with Senator Sherlock on that.  The Minister might address this on Committee Stage.</p><p>I do not understand why there is a distinction between temporary and permanent workers, particularly when one third of workers who are aged 24 or younger are on temporary contracts.  That cohort of younger workers will be particularly impacted, unfortunately, by temporary contracts.  There should not be a distinction between permanent employees and temporary workers.  It is a simple change to make and I urge the Minister to do so.  We know, unfortunately, that women take up more temporary contracts than men, just as they take up more part-time jobs than men.  That point was very well made by an earlier speaker.  It is a simple way to improve the Bill and make it more inclusive.  I would welcome a positive engagement on that particular issue.</p><p>It would be useful for the Minister to explain why we have to wait three years for companies with 150 employees or fewer.  These asks are particularly onerous of companies.  This has been spoken about for many years.  This will be part of the Minister's legacy after this Government ends and yet the Bill will not effectively be in place for most workers.  That does not seem right.  I urge the Minister to be a little more ambitious in terms of the timings.  Sinn F&eacute;in's position is that companies with 20-plus employees should be included.  This is not onerous information for small companies to put together.  It would mean more workers are included.</p><p>I am concerned about the lack of clarity around fines.  The points made on publicity are important.  Like an earlier speaker, I welcome the fact that Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, hearings will now be in public.  It never made sense for them to be held privately.  The issue of retrospective payment raised by Senator Seery Kearney is a good point which the Minister should look at as well.  One of my concerns is that going to the WRC is quite onerous unless one has a trade union or a member of the legal profession to represent one.  Some set of fines would be a much clearer device that could be used, a measure which could be looked at on Committee Stage.</p><p>As other Members said, this is just one of a number of items which need to be tackled.  It has been a good debate this afternoon because several Members raised the issue of childcare.  Childcare is a central issue in this.  It makes no sense that we organise childcare on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  We would not dream of organising national school education on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis, provided by some private or community groups.  It has to be State-led.  The Government needs to make that move.  I welcome the moves in train of, hopefully, setting up an employment order to try to raise terms and conditions.  I have acknowledged that previously to the Minister.  However, that is only part of the journey.  If we are going to tackle the issue of childcare, we need to do what all progressive countries do.  The best models are in Scandinavia.  We need to develop a State-led childcare system.</p><p>We need to see further action on the living wage.  Again, we know the lowest paid workers are predominantly women.  Again, we need to see further action on that.  Above all, we need to see action on collective bargaining.  I am disappointed by the Government on this because it seems to have set its face against granting collective bargaining rights, particularly its action in writing to the European Commission to request an EU directive not be binding on collective bargaining.  That is a hugely disappointing stance for the Government to take.  I urge it to reconsider.</p><p>I recognise this Bill is a progressive step.  I look forward to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I apologise I was missing for a good chunk of the debate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I heard his opening address, but I was trying to deal with a pressing matter.</p><p>This Bill is very welcome.  It is embarrassing that we are still only at this stage when it comes to the gender pay gap.  It really and truly should not be an issue in 2021 and that it is necessary to bring in legislation to force companies to provide information.  To think that women are paid 14% less than their male counterparts, who are doing precisely the same type of work, is unforgivable.  In the EU, I think that figure is 16%, which beggars belief given the principle behind the EU programme.  One has to wonder.  In addition to that, people with disabilities tend not to have the confidence and strength of character to negotiate with a strength of character, conviction and belief because they are grateful to get a job in the first place, to a large extent.  It is shocking to think that approximately 80% of people with disabilities in this country still rely on State support.  In this day and age, one can see the depth of quality of people with disabilities and the contribution they can make and are making, yet eight out of ten find themselves needing State supports.  It is breathtaking.  It all feeds into the overall discussion of equality of opportunity, employment, pay and conditions.</p><p>This Bill is welcome.  I remember, in the last Seanad, Senator Bacik highlighted this issue among many other issues that affect people in employment, women in employment in particular.  It is an incremental step in the right direction, that is for sure.  I share concerns that a company with 150 employees or less will not be subject to scrutiny for a protracted period of time.  Looking at the community I come from, most of the businesses there employ fewer than 150 people.  I would struggle to think of one, outside of a public service operation, that employs more than 150 people in the north-west Clare area.  Therefore, workers in all those companies will not have their situation and the discriminatory nature of their payment articulated for some time.  </p><p>I cannot see any logic in not fast-tracking this, to be quite frank about it.  Business is a bureaucratic nightmare in this country anyway.  Including a simple reporting mechanism once a year in terms of what people are paid &ndash; the figures and the data are there anyway &ndash; is not going to add to the bureaucratic nightmare that is running a business in this country.  I urge the Minister to talk to his officials on whether it is possible to accelerate the timeframe of this, because our generation is the generation that will be judged on dealing with this issue for once and for all.  Previous Oireachtas Houses dealt with glaring issues like the eighth amendment, which needed to be dealt with and was dealt with by the last Oireachtas, as was the marriage equality situation.  We became world leaders when we had a popular referendum on marriage equality which passed.  Let us become world leaders and show the EU how it is done.  Let us bring the figure of 14% down to nil and do it at an accelerated pace.  There is no reason this cannot happen within months rather than years.  If we do that, we will have the moral authority to lecture and talk about equality to other countries, not just in the EU, but worldwide.  However, not until such time as we get our house in order.  We can do it, we should do it, we will do it and it is the right thing to do.  Let us do it in a reasonable period of time.  Let it be one of the legacies of this Government.  Let us not rush to get this done at the end of the term of this Government.  Let us backfill it and do it at the start of the term of this Government.  We are a year into its term, at the end of this month.  By year 2, let us have grasped the nettle on this issue and have dealt with it.  Then we can show ourselves as an example, yet again, on social issues to other parts of the world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#EE00200"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as teacht isteach. I thank him profoundly for all his work done since last July on many issues on inequality in different guises.  This Bill is very welcome.  I know the Minister is only getting started and is not going to nail everything in one Bill, which would be impossible.  The programme for Government committed to legislating for the requirement of the publication of the gender pay gap in large companies and this Bill fulfils that commitment, so I thank him for that.  We can tick it off the long list in our programme for Government.</p> <p>The gender pay gap is not equal pay for equal work, that is not what this Bill is about.  There is much confusion in the media and certain sections of society over what this is about.  It is not a simple task of paying women the same as men.  The question of why we have more women in lower income jobs than men must be answered.  We have fewer women in senior and high earning roles.  We need employers to ask themselves why that is.  With or without any Bill, why are we here today, in 2021, having to pass such a Bill?  We must challenge everyone, including certain Members of the House in the way they have spoken, to ask ourselves whether we have gender stereotypes.  Do we have them throughout society, in schools, the media, advertising, in our minds?  Statistically, men apply for jobs they feel underqualified for more than women do.  Why is that?</p> <p>Of course, we must improve conditions for the care sector and value parents who chose to stay at home more, both fathers and mothers.  It often seems women must work harder to be appreciated in their job.  Even then, they can be seen as overeager or getting too big for their boots, while men, if they have charisma and charm, can often get away with not being as hard working.  We must encourage employers to tackle bias in recruitment, promotion and pay.  Going deeper, we have much work to do in understanding why so many roles are gender specific.  Why are there far more women in caring roles, such as teaching, nursing and stay-at-home parenting?  I do not think it is fair to say that women care more than men, yet we seem to be the ones doing most of those caring roles.  Why are there many more men in cerebral roles, roles which are seen as academic?  I did a degree in maths, physics and computers and I was one of the only women in the place.  I was often told that I was grand, the lads would sort out the project, and that I should just sit and look pretty, that sort of thing, or shift one of the lads.  There is much more going on than what this Bill is dealing with, but we must look at the cause of the Bill.</p> <p>Parents also have a role to play, as do toyshops, kids clothes designers and everyone else.  There are significant specific issues.  I was at a child&rsquo;s birthday party recently where there were gender specific lucky bags.  There are gender specific lucky bags, clothes, toys, scooters and even bikes for children.  It is ridiculous.  It drives me insane to see that it seems to have become worse.  Some 19 years ago, I took my son to a large toyshop for his first and last time.  There was a cerise pink aisle with all the dolls, babies and pink stuff, and then there was the war and sports aisle, with the camouflage and blue for the boys.  That was 19 years ago.  I cannot imagine what it is like now.  I decided that day that I would not go into one of those places again.  For someone who is sporty and into wearing sporty clothes, I found it completely maddening.  Recently, I brought my ten-year-old niece on a shopping trip, but we could not find anything for her because she was like me, she was sporty.  Everything had sequins and frills which she was not into.  We do children a disservice that this is still going on in this day and age.  We must push back on the private and public sector.</p> <p>It is not specific to men.  Sexism is rife among all of us.  I remember going to Calais with 53 volunteers, one of whom was really glamorous.  I was thinking "Oh my god, she will be mother useless".  She was by far the best.  She stopped wearing make-up, rolled up the jeans and the sleeves and got stuck in.  I learned from that experience that we have a deep sexism coming from the patriarchy and previous generations which we must check ourselves on.  I often find through my experience in environmental, activist and lefty movements, that I experience sexism there as well.  I might make a valid point and the male facilitator would not hear me.  Then a man would come on, make the exact same point and would get huge validation for it.  It is there and it is everywhere.  We must realise that we have it within ourselves as well.</p> <p>One has the stay-at-some dads.  They are also, in some ways, undermined or seen as being less as men.  One can have the case of the father of a child who never turns up or pays any maintenance of any kind, rocks up once on the school sports day, and all the women think he is amazing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The standards have to be equal.  All we want is equality.  We are not saying that we are better, smarter, more caring or anything.  It is just a matter of equality.  In 2021, it is embarrassing that we have to have this legislation, but I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, for bringing it in.  I think Senator Clifford-Lee for her work since 2016.  I thank Senator Bacik and the Labour Party.  I do not want to be embarrassed any more living in the State and I look forward to further legislation getting rid of this ridiculous situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#FF00200"><p>Well said, Senator Garvey.  If the Minister was a woman and woke up tomorrow in Luxembourg, it is a tad smaller than Ireland, with only 630,000 people, but it has the Court of Justice of the European Union, and the Minister was on his way to work, he would be pretty happy getting his croissant and espresso, because there is only a 1% difference in Luxembourg.  There is nowhere in the EU where it is zero but in Luxembourg it is 1%.  The gender pay gap refers to the difference between the average gross hourly earnings of men and women.  This covers all levels and roles within companies.  In Luxembourg, there is a good reflection of equality and representation of women.</p><p>If the Minister woke up as a woman in Estonia tomorrow, there is a gender pay gap of close to 22%.  If using the time of year to show when women stop getting paid well, a woman is probably not getting paid after August.  Here in Ireland, when do women stop getting paid compared with men?  When a woman is rushing in the morning to get kids ready with her partner or maybe on her own, getting them to school and then going to work on time, or perhaps she is able to do hybrid working, in rural areas she would be extremely lucky to have after-school care and if not, she is racing to pick them up again at 1.30 p.m.  Perhaps she might also be a carer.  That often happens in rural areas because we have an ageing population.  Perhaps she is looking after older family members.  When do women in Ireland stop getting paid compared with men?  As mentioned here, it is 9 November.</p><p>Why does this matter?  With Covid and the lockdown, more women have lost jobs, including in hospitality, retail and travel.  The lower paid roles, including childcare and healthcare, all impacted on women.  Throughout a woman's working life, the gap widens the more time we spend in work.  Childcare, family care and taking a break all have an impact on a career, and again the gap widens.  If one is a single mother living in Ireland, one is five times more likely to be living in poverty and that means one's children and family living in poverty.  We need gender equality now.</p><p>We need ways to support women to get back into the workplace, moving towards a living wage and affordable childcare.  We have so many opportunities to reskill with more than 10,000 places announced today by the Minister, Deputy Harris, for Springboard+, and we also have ways for women and men to earn and learn with new careers with the plan for apprenticeships.</p><p>The PwC Women in Work Index pointed to how gender equality after Covid will regress to 2017.  We have to double our efforts over the next few years to reach gender equality.  Across the world, <i>The</i><i>New York Times</i>and <i>The Financial Times</i>refer instead of a recession to a &quot;she-cession&quot; because of the amount of women's jobs lost.  The Government recently made commitments in the economic recovery plan to progressing this legislation and to preparing research for a living wage. In the report of the Irish Citizens' Assembly on gender equality, a chapter is dedicated to pay.  Recommendation 32 states that targets should be set to reduce the hourly gender pay gap, currently 14%, to 9% by 2025 and to 4% by 2030 with a view to eliminating it by 2035, which would be lucky.  That is just shocking.</p><p>This Bill means that companies of more than 50 employees will publish information on salaries according to gender and if there are significant differences, should publish a statement about why.  We will have this Bill enacted firstly for companies larger than 250 employees and then in a tiered way for more than 150, then for small and medium enterprises of more than 50 in the third year, in both the private and public sector.  To match statistics on gender pay gaps with EUROSTAT, which counts companies with more than ten employees, I would like to see this considered at a later stage.</p><p>We all need to make this count.  If one is a student looking to go to college this year, one will be able to see how one's college holds up when it comes to gender equality.  How is it doing with bringing forward female professors?  If one is a consumer, how is one spending to support inclusive companies which are going the extra mile?  If one is a star graduate looking to kickstart a career, one can now find out about the gender pay gap at the company one is looking at, which is knocking on one's door.  If one is in HR, one knows that more diversity makes better decisions and more innovation.  That has been proven again and again.  One knows the challenge of large pay gaps.  If one is a smart investor, one is looking at the gender pay gap.</p><p>For funding agencies across each Department, this now needs to become part of how we evaluate companies and businesses when applying for funds.  We do not have equality.  We need laws and legislation.  That is why we need the Seanad at 40% female representation and that is why we need that in the D&aacute;il.  I fully support this Bill and ask the Minister to make it count.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#FF00400"><p>I thank the Senators who have contributed to the debate.  We are all of one mind about the need to address this issue.  It was a welcome opportunity to discuss the gender pay gap and the proposal before the Seanad.  Almost all Senators stated that the gender pay gap was a real and pressing issue that impacts on women in the workforce throughout their working lives and, as a number of Senators pointed out, in retirement as well.  The Government is committed to reducing the gender pay gap but it is also conscious that the regulations published under this Bill are only part of the solution.  Senators Clifford-Lee, O'Loughlin and Ward all made that point.  With 65% of all employees in the State estimated to fall within the scope of the regulations, the publication of gender pay gap information will provide a range of data about firms and sectors and how they contribute to the gender pay gap in the economy as a whole.  Senators Higgins and Currie mentioned that both the mean and the hourly wage gap will be disclosed.  The former reflects the entire pay range in a company and the latter excludes the impact of unusually high earners.  Data will be published on bonus pay, since this is an important element of remuneration in some sectors.  Mean and median pay gaps for part-time employees and employees on temporary contracts will be disclosed.  It is important to account for temporary contracts.  Women work part time to a greater extent than men.</p> <p>The proportions of male and female employees in the lower, lower-middle, upper-middle and upper quartile pay bands must be published.  This will show the extent to which men and women are represented at the various pay levels in a firm.  The publication of this information is likely to incentivise employers to take action to reduce the gender pay gap insofar as that is within their control.  Sometimes it will not be within their control, perhaps because of segregation in education or the overall labour market, where women are underrepresented in some areas.  However, it will be possible in many cases for employers to pursue positive action measures which are within the law and which will, over time, increase the number of women in high-earning, higher-remunerated roles and levels in firms.  Having this information will also support and direct Government policy to take meaningful steps to address the gender pay gap, especially where that is beyond a specific employer's control.</p> <p>Other relevant provisions in the programme for Government which will work in parallel with the regulations that will be made on foot of this legislation to reduce the gender pay gap include being guided by the Low Pay Commission with regard to any future changes to the minimum wage.  It includes reducing the cost of childcare for parents through investment in the national childcare scheme, including universal and targeted subsidies to assist parents with childcare affordability and getting back to work and training.  That is something that almost every Senator referenced in their contributions and my Department is working to address it.  It includes increased leave and support for parents and increased remote, flexible and hub working arrangements.</p> <p>The Balance for Better Business initiative has had some success in improving gender balance at senior levels.  It was established in July 2018 as one of the actions in the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020.  This independent, business-led review group was established by the Government to improve gender balance and senior business leadership in Ireland.  Balance for Better Business has set out actionable and progressive targets for companies listed on Euronext Dublin and for private companies in Ireland to encourage them to address the gender balance issue on their boards and leadership of teams as a matter of priority.  Since the initiative was launched, the percentage of women on listed company boards continues to improve, with ISEQ 20 companies now having 27.4%, up from 25.3% in September 2019 and 18.1% when Balance for Better Business was announced in 2018.  This surpassed the interim target of 25% by the end of 2020.  Actions have been identified and prioritised in the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 to address persisting gender stereotypes such as unconscious bias, which is a contributing factor to the gender pay gap.</p> <p>To address matters outside gender for a moment, Senator Conway spoke about disability and the importance of addressing that issue.  I will introduce legislation to deal with elements of the assisted decision-making service.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will also be bringing in provisions from the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which lapsed at the end of the last D&aacute;il.  That includes increasing the public service obligation for employment of persons with disabilities from 3% to 6%, which is a significant increase in the public service obligation.  It will be a job of work to achieve that but it is one I am sure the Government and the public sector, working together, can and will achieve.</p><p>Senator Mary Seery Kearney and others mentioned the recent Citizens' Assembly on gender, which laid its final report before the Houses of the Oireachtas earlier this month.  The issues raised during the work of the Citizens' Assembly and the issues it voted on and made recommendations on reflect the key concerns around addressing some of the biggest challenges we face in moving towards a more gender-equal society.  My Department looks forward to working on some of the issues around constitutional amendments, the provision on the position of the woman within the home and dealing with the idea of carers within the home as well.  I look forward to working to advance that.  The wider recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly are comprehensive and they cut across the work of many Departments.  Some 25 of the 45 recommendations sit squarely within my Department, so it was a nice list of work that was handed to us, but it is stuff I am really passionate about working on.  Obviously, it is for the Oireachtas, as a whole, to examine and respond to the detailed findings of the Citizens' Assembly.  However, as I said, many of the items will be advanced by my Department and, indeed, many of them, like the legislation we are addressing today, were already identified within the programme for Government as something we want to work on.</p><p>To conclude, when Senator Bacik and others referenced the issue of the gender pay gap a number of weeks ago, I said it was a priority for my Department and for the Government to have the matter addressed.  The slow pace of the development of these proposals has been outlined by the Senator, as well as by Senator Marie Sherlock.  What I will say is that we are still within the first year of this Government.  We have taken it, we have prioritised it, it has passed through the D&aacute;il and it is coming through this House.  I look forward to engaging with Senators on Committee and Report Stages.  I and, I think, everyone else want to see this important legislation on the books quickly so we can start to see those reporting mechanisms taking place and we can start to gather the data so wider Government actions can be taken to reduce that gender pay gap, but also to push and support businesses, both in the public and the private sector, to work to reduce and eventually eliminate that gender pay gap.</p></speech>

This Bill is a key enabler for the new public service pay agreement, Building Momentum, and allows for a range of reforming pay matters, including implementation of aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare.  It continues the process of unwinding and repealing financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  As such, it builds on changes that began with the Lansdowne Road agreement in 2015 and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act of 2015, and continued with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 and the public service stability agreement of 2018 to 2020.</p> <p>The Bill will allow implementation of the pay increases provided for by Building Momentum.  Before dealing with the specific provisions of the Bill, I note that in December 2020 negotiations concluded on a new public service pay agreement, entitled Building Momentum, which will apply for the next two years.  This agreement was accepted by my colleagues in Cabinet and ratified by the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, on 23 February.  That decision by ICTU is welcome as it will deliver stability for the Government, public service users and public servants over the lifetime of the agreement.</p> <p>We will all agree that the public service has stepped up to the challenge of the Covid-19 crisis and delivered a world-class response.  Public servants have been quick to adapt and re-adjust the way in which services are delivered so as to minimise the negative impact of the pandemic on the public.  It is important that this agreement recognises the value of the work of our public servants during this pandemic and provides for affordable increases with pay adjustments weighted towards those on lower incomes.  This is balanced by ensuring that the Government continues to exercise a prudent approach to the overall management of our public finances.</p> <p>The economic sustainability of this agreement is based on a pay pause for the majority of 2021 and modest but reasonable pay increases in 2022, when we expect a strengthening economy and labour market recovery as the vaccine roll-out takes effect.  The agreement provides for general pay increases of 1% in October 2021 and October 2022, or &euro;500, whichever is greater.  I am also allocating a sectoral fund amounting to 1% of basic pay to resolve any outstanding issues such as those that resulted in industrial action in the period of previous agreements.  </p> <p>The agreement is weighted towards those at lower incomes with an increase of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants.  These groups will also benefit more from other measures in the agreement, including changes to overtime rates and premium payment adjustments.  The pay adjustments provided for by the agreement are phased, with implementation commencing later in 2021.  In that regard, the agreement is fair, affordable and sustainable, and recognises the economic challenges facing the country.  Most important, the agreement provides certainty on pay and industrial peace over the next two challenging years.  A key element of the deal, one which taxpayers expect and the unions have now agreed, is that industrial peace will be maintained and that there be no additional cost-increasing claims.</p> <p>The agreement sets out a reform agenda that seeks to embed the agility demonstrated during Covid into enhanced public service delivery in the future.   These include harnessing the capacity of technology and remote working across public services.  It takes a new sectoral approach which recognises that different areas may have unique and innovative approaches to providing service delivery.  A key element of this is that each sector will produce and publish reform plans that will demonstrate delivery every year.  Crucially, payment of the 1% sectoral fund will be conditional on the delivery of actual reforms.</p> <p>There will be scope to extend opening hours of public-facing services, so when people need to see someone to access a public service, it will be at a time which is convenient for them.  Learning from experience in the Covid-19 pandemic, mechanisms will be agreed where staff will move quickly to different parts of the public service to deliver a response to critical or urgent demands.</p> <p>As noted, the Bill will also enable progress on a range of pay reform matters.  I will touch briefly on two of these: Sl&aacute;intecare and the seagoing commitment scheme in the Naval Service.  A key objective of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation process is to remove consultant private practice from public hospitals.  Central to implementation of this reform is a move to public-only consultant contracts and to tailor such contracts to align with wider Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.  Taking that into account, all future consultant appointments will be to a new Sl&aacute;intecare public-only consultant contract from a date to be decided shortly.  The Sl&aacute;intecare contract will have no provision for private practice and will be available to all existing consultants.  The offer will be informed by a process of consultation with key stakeholders.  The new contract, noting the significant reforms involved, is to be offered at an increased pay level.</p> <p>The seagoing commitment scheme is one of a number of measures advanced in 2020 to support recruitment and retention in the Naval Service.  It provides for a &euro;5,000 payment for each 12 months of seagoing service.  Naval personnel of able rating and above with at least three years' service of enlisted rank of able rating and above and of officer ranks are eligible.  </p> <p>These measures, which support reform, recruitment and retention in particular areas of our public service, cannot be progressed to payment under existing FEMPI Acts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This underscores the need for the amending legislation.</p><p>In summary terms, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 provided that no change could be made in the pay of a public servant without legislative amendment, a court order or a determination that there is a legal entitlement to a pay increase.  While it is possible to set a pay rate for a new grade or post, it is not possible to change the pay of an existing public servant in a post.  The Bill provides for amendment of the restrictions on increases to public service pay introduced by the Act of 2009.  This will allow the Government to provide for changes to remuneration and greater flexibility in the allocation of available resources to public service pay requirements.  In the short term it will allow implementation of the pay increases provided for by Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022, the new public-only Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract and seagoing service commitment scheme.</p><p>I will turn to the details of the legislation.  The Bill amends or repeals sections 4 and 5 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 and section 12A of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011.  This means the Bill provides for amendment of the restrictions on increases to public service pay introduced by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.  It provides that, in addition to changes to pay arising from an Act of the Oireachtas, an order of a court or a determination that there is a legal entitlement to a pay increase, increases in the pay or allowances of public servants may be sanctioned.  It amends the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 to ensure that where a contract of employment is amended in accordance with amended provisions of the Act of 2009 no further ministerial sanction is required under that Act.</p><p>I will break the Bill down by section.  Section 1 sets out a definition of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 as the "Act of 2009".  Section 2 amends section 4 of the Act of 2009 to provide that in addition to changes to pay arising from an Act of the Oireachtas, an order of the civil courts, an order of the Labour Court or a determination that there is a legal entitlement to a pay increase, increases in the pay or allowances of public servants may be sanctioned.  Section 3 amends section 5 of the Act of 2009 to provide for retrospective application, up to the date on which this proposed Bill is enacted, of a provision allowing for amendment of contracts of employment to increase pay.  Section 4 amends section 16A of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 to ensure that where a contract of employment is amended in accordance with section 4 of the Act of 2009, as amended by this proposed legislation, no further ministerial sanction is required under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011.  Section 5 provides that the Short Title of the proposed legislation is the Public Service Pay Act 2020.</p><p>Concluding the repeal of the financial emergency legislation is an important milestone in the history of the State.  Underpinning this achievement and the new public service pay agreement is the strong performance of the economy.  The economy is expected to recover next year.  Indeed, in 2022 the economy is expected to grow by approximately 4.3 % as outlined in the forecasts of the Central Bank, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the OECD.  These institutions forecast GDP growth of 4.6%, 4.1% and 4.3%, respectively.</p><p>Labour market conditions are also expected to improve next year with employment growth of 3.2% and 3.6% projected by the Central Bank and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council for 2022.  As a result of the growth in employment the unemployment rate is projected to decline to 7.8% or 6.7% in 2022.  These would be well below the record levels recorded in 2020.</p><p>Our approach is about balancing the need for pay restraint, stability and certainty in the delivery of public services with the need to support ongoing public service reform.  Key areas of our public services have experienced and responded to challenging demands over the past year.  The Bill allows for implementation of reasonable pay increases and provides a means of using pay, where appropriate, to support the wider public service reform agenda.  On that basis I commend the Bill to the House.  I look forward to hearing the views of everyone in the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#KK00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the publication of the Bill.  It is a throwback to the last financial crisis of 2008-09 which has been with us throughout the past decade.  In that time we have gone through the Croke Park, Lansdowne Road and Haddington Road agreements, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act of 2015, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 and Building Momentum, which was ratified by ICTU in February.  I wish to acknowledge the role of Government in all of this.</p> <p>I have been watching "Reeling in the Years" for the past number of Sundays.  The programme is a reminder of the consequences of the financial crisis.  Through those crisis years the solidarity of the unions in recognising the benefits of engaging in an agreement with Government has gotten us back on track as a country.  Covid-19 has set back but not ended the economic progress of the country.  It is worth bearing that in mind.  A strong economy due to businesses, workers and Government policy means an increased tax take to reinvest in society and services.  Capital projects are particularly important for the ongoing ability to grow and sustain the economy and create jobs.</p> <p>Covid-19 has changed things of course.  Unemployment has, unfortunately, soared.  However, thankfully, due to our books being balanced, the waiving of the fiscal rules within the EU because of the crisis and the good name of Ireland on international markets we were able to borrow to provide supports such as the pandemic unemployment payment, the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme and other supports.</p> <p>The Building Momentum agreement recognises the need for a prudent approach while also giving more support to those on lowest pay.  The agreement is based on a pay pause until October 2021 but allows for increases in 2022.  The agreement provides certainty on pay and industrial peace in the coming two years as we rebuild our economy, finances and workforce.</p> <p>As a member of the Joint Committee on Health I welcome in particular the progress on one of the core objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare, that is, the removal of private consultant practice from public hospitals, as announced by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in December 2019.  This will bring us more in line with international best practice.  I hope that as part of this move we can roster in or allow 24-7 health services.  The use of theatres at weekends will be part of that.  I also welcome moves to support recruitment and retention in the Naval Service.  This has been commented on a great deal in respect of our ability to keep ships sailing and in respect of the valuable work our naval personnel do in coastal defence and all else that they do.</p> <p>The issue of remote working is not new but it has certainly grown in stature and importance because of Covid-19.  I wish to acknowledge the work of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The Gr&eacute;as&aacute;n Digiteach na Gaeltachta or gteic network of digital hubs predated Covid-19.  It was rolled out in advance of Covid-19.  The work of the Western Development Commission as part of the Atlantic economic corridor has been significant as well.</p> <p>We have seen an extraordinary focus on remote working because of Covid and as part of the response to Covid.  It has worked well across much of the public sector.  Is any analysis being done on how well it has worked in improving efficiencies and productivity?  Is it the case that the people who are most productive while working in an office are the most productive while working from home?  Has that changed?  Has there been any analysis of that?</p> <p>Remote working has an important part to play in our public services in future as well as in improving quality of life by reducing travel time, providing more time with families and more time at home, and ensuring less stress from commuting.  Moreover, it is good for the environment by reducing our carbon footprint.</p> <p>This is changing all the time and there are great benefits for the regions.  We all preach about regional balanced development and ensuring that all regions grow, including those in the west and the midlands.  This has the potential to encourage redevelopment of some of our more peripheral locations and those that have had low growth rates in recent years.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill.  It is a throwback to the past but something that remains of concern to some of our public servants.  I wish the Minister of State well in the deliberations in the House.</p></speech>

I welcome in particular the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest.  I was heavily involved in trade unionism at the time the FEMPI legislation was running through.  I remember in particular the pain we inflicted on our public servants in the draconian way in which we cut their salaries.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There were public servants who had bought houses and set their lives in train when, suddenly, along came the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation and their lives were destroyed.  It is good to see that it is coming to an end.</p><p>There is one question we have to ask.  The Minister of State was not in power at the time, so this question is not a reflection on him.  Last week or the week before, we saw Microsoft returning profits of &euro;227 billion through a Dublin office without paying one penny in tax.  How is that still happening?  This country was on its knees in 2008 and in 2012.  I travelled the length and breadth of Ireland explaining to members of my union why we had to take a pay cut.  I feel such a cheat now because there are those in this country who are living a bloody good life and who never suffered at any point during the collapse of the economy in 2008 to 2009 or in the following period from 2010 to 2012.  I appreciate the county had to get back on its feet but I am afraid the pain and suffering all went in one direction.  The easy target was picked and that target was the public servants.  I accept that quite a number of private sector employees lost their jobs, but the ones who stayed working, the ones who managed the vulture funds and those in the accountancy and legal firms all boomed during the collapse of the economy.</p><p>As my colleague has just said, the move to improve Sl&aacute;intecare is fantastic.  Let us see the hospitals work better for the public.</p><p>The seagoing commitment has been a failure.  Our Naval Service is now what is referred to as a two-tier service.  As a result of the three-year service requirement, there can be two sailors on the same ship, one having two years' service and the other four years' service, and there is a difference in their income.  We have to go back and look at that to see how it can be rectified.  Instead of helping with retention, this measure has exacerbated the issue of departures from the Naval Service.  That needs to be looked at again and fairly quickly.</p><p>The restoration of pensions for public servants is a welcome measure.  In speaking about the restoration of pensions for public servants, I will say that the public servants who have no representation anywhere are the Members of this House.  We are hit with class K PRSI, which was brought in through an Act in 2021, as far as I remember.  It effectively uses the social welfare system as a tax.  Some 4% of our salary is taken and we get nothing for it.  Deputies and Senators who lost their seats in the previous election had nothing to call on.  Their social welfare records were broken and that will travel with them for the rest of their lives.  That is fundamentally wrong.  Another issue is that Members of this House who had been paying pension contributions into a long-service increment had this increment taken off them arbitrarily.  I hope that is going to be restored as FEMPI is unwound because, at the end of the day, we are all workers in one way or another.</p><p>I will speak about an issue affecting members of the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in particular.  Provision for pension abatement has been around since the 1920s, or certainly the 1930s, but it had never been enacted.  It is now the case that any public servant who retires and then comes back into the public sector has his or her pension abated.  A prisoner in Mountjoy Prison had his pension taken from him because he was a guest of the state; he was in jail.  That prisoner took his case to the Supreme Court, which ruled that a pension cannot be touched as it is a property right.  Unless the State recognises the property rights of those public servants who had paid for and earned a full pension and restores those pensions, such public servants will have to go to the courts and force it to do so.  I have no difficulty with the concept of a person not being able to profit by returning to the public service, but this requires legislation to allow for different rates of pay or different pay scales.  Right now, the Defence Forces are in dire need of specialist personnel, for example, armourers and artificers in the Naval Service.  They cannot get qualified people to come back.  Why would they come back?  They lose their entire pension as soon as they step through the gate.  Not only that, but they also run risks with respect to the future.</p><p>We are going to have to look at the issue of pension abatement.  A pension is a property right.  Indeed, a former Member of this House, whom I will not name, went to jail for improper actions and people cried out for his pension to be taken from him because of the money he had cost the public.  At the end of the day, the courts ruled a pension is a property right.  In addition to unwinding the damage done to pensioners through FEMPI, the issue of pension abatement needs to be looked at and the provisions in this regard repealed.  If you want public servants with pensions who are returning to the public service to be paid less, then that should be done through their current pay rather than through their pensions.  Their pensions are theirs.  I do not expect the Minister of State to be able to give an answer on that matter today but I would like it if he would communicate with me in the coming days and let me know where we stand with respect to pension abatement.  It is wrong in every sense of the word.</p><p>The seagoing commitment scheme was a great idea but it has not worked out in the way we expected.  There was a latent aspect to it which has backfired.  We need to look at that.  We also need to look at the tax break that was available to sailors in the previous budget to see if it could be improved a little bit.  These are all incremental steps which would bring us along the way.</p><p>Finally, we might thank the public servants, including Members of this House, who took a serious hit to keep this country in its worst times.  I am afraid, however, that FEMPI will always be seen by those of us who worked in the public service as the most draconian measure and one which set out to target those who could not fight back.  At the end of the day, we are told the country is on the up again.  I agree with my colleague that Covid has set things back but the predictions for the future are good.  I would hope to see some of the damage done over that period being undone.  I wish the Minister of State the best of luck with the Bill.</p></speech>

It is my first time to be in the House with him since his elevation to ministerial office.  We served together on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and I am delighted to see him in his current position.  I am delighted for him.  Well done.</p> <p>If I wanted to have a trade union representative, I suppose I could look to Senator Craughwell who referred to those who lost their seats last year.  I was one of those unfortunate Senators who lost their seats in the middle of a pandemic and, as the Senator has mentioned, I was not entitled to anything because I paid class K PRSI.  As I said to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in the Seanad four or five years ago when he was the Minister for Social Protection, this class of PRSI is a supertax on public service.  If that is what we want it to be, we should say that.  We should not call it pay related social insurance if we are to pay it at a rate of 4% only to find there is nothing available to us when we go looking for it.  I knew there was no point in looking for anything but, about a year into it, I decided to look into it and found that class K PRSI contributors are not eligible for the pandemic unemployment payment, an eye test or dental benefit.  We are eligible for nothing.  If the system wants everybody in this House and judges to pay 4% for nothing, we should call it a supertax on politicians and judges.  There may not be public sympathy for us; so be it.  This, however, goes back to an era when politicians probably had many other sources of income.  They ran businesses or had other professions.  Many people in this House are at it pretty much full-time.  They do not necessarily have other sources of income.  If that is the case, let us not pretend this 4% deduction is for social insurance.</p> <p>To go back to the Bill about which we are actually talking, the Public Service Pay Bill 2020, as someone who had four grandparents who were public servants at various stages of their careers, civil servants, garda&iacute;, teachers and so on, and two parents who also worked in the public service, I am very understanding of what happened during the period of FEMPI with regard to both pay and pensions.  As a councillor, I paid class K PRSI.  This used to be paid at 0%.  One paid nothing and got nothing.  It then became 4% but one still got nothing.  This Bill, however, is a welcome development, particularly as it relates to Sl&aacute;intecare and hospital care.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The idea now that consultants who are paid by the system must work exclusively for the system is a positive and let us see how Sl&aacute;intecare works out.  There is a big body of work to be done.  I wish the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and all of the team involved with it the very best.</p><p>I am not going to rehash everything that the Minister of State has said in his very comprehensive opening statement, but I will point out that the deal is there to implement Building Momentum and is very welcome more than ten years on from FEMPI.  I remember being at a meeting at which the Taoiseach of the time, Brian Cowen, outlined that public spending was approximately &euro;60 billion per year, of which &euro;20 billion was being spent on social welfare, including children's allowance, pensions and the wider social welfare, and another &euro;20 billion was being spent on public sector pay and pensions.  His point was that if the Government were to make cuts to the remaining &euro;20 billion, it would be sending local authority workers out with no materials to use - nothing to cut the grass with, nothing to put in their lawnmowers, nothing to fill the roads with and nothing to use to fix the traffic lights.  It was a very painful time but, it is good and very welcome to see FEMPI being wound down.  It will be gone in the very near future.  This Bill allows the Minister to do certain things.  It was very sensibly said at the time in the FEMPI legislation that no more could be done.  It has been very restrictive in what it has done.</p><p>I would like the Minister of State to reflect on a matter that he will not be able to deal with today.  There has been a very welcome increase in councillors' pay in the last month or so, but councillors are the only people in the entire public service who are not entitled to a pension.  All of the 949 local authority members are in the public service and work hard.  They pay taxes, the universal social charge, PAYE and PRSI but at the end of it all they have no pension.  A part-time person in a very lowly paid State job is entitled to a pension.  It will not be a very valuable pension because he or she will not be paid very much but it is a pension.  In many cases, councillors with long service have given up career opportunities and other opportunities to work very diligently on behalf of their local communities.  Therefore, I ask that the Government considers giving councillors a pension sooner rather than later.  It would not be a very expensive pension for the State to fund because councillors' pay, albeit with an increase, is still very close to the bottom of the pile in terms of what people in the public service are paid.</p><p>The wider public needs to appreciate where their taxes go.  It goes into garda&iacute;, teachers, nurses, local authority workers and everybody in the wider public service, including the health service.  All of the people on whom we rely every day for everything we need, in many cases, are in the public service and that is why we need to tax people.  Of course multinationals need to pay their way, but if they funnel revenue through Ireland with no property in Ireland and no revenue being generated here, it may not be us they need to pay.  I refer to the famous Apple row, in which there was not necessarily any reason we should collect the money.  I am certainly in favour of the idea that stateless companies and companies that can hide their revenue from the whole world are taxed.  Clearly, Ireland produces and generates much revenue for these companies through its employees in this country providing services for the worldwide users of their services.</p><p>I wish to reflect on an ongoing row that is simmering away for the secretarial assistants of many of the Members of this House and the Lower House.  Technically, secretarial assistants work for the State and for the Members but they are not officially civil servants.  The Minister of State is aware of this very long-standing issue and I would like him to address it in his concluding remarks, if he can. </p><p>It is positive that we have partnership with the unions and the public service.  There has been agreement right back to the era of Charlie Haughey on various things.  Back in the 1980s it was much better to work together than to have divisive rows about various terms and conditions.  It is very positive that we have the Public Sector Pay Bill 202.  I wish the Minister well in its implementation.  Equally, I wish the Minister for Health, who will benefit most from Sl&aacute;intecare, the very best in that implementation.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#MM00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  As a Senator elected to the labour panel following nomination by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and as a former SIPTU official, I am conscious of the real impact that the Building Momentum wage agreement will have on workers across the public sector, particularly lower-paid workers across the public service such as healthcare assistants, home helps, special needs assistants, hospital porters, staff in clerical grades and local authority workers.  The reality is that if these workers worked in the private sector, many of them would fare much worse.  In some ways, Building Momentum represents so much about what is good about being employed in the public service, which is job security, pay progression and protection for trade union membership.</p> <p>The pay increases for many staff are very modest, with 2% over a two-year period or &euro;1,000, whichever is of greater benefit.  Building Momentum is not just a pay agreement.  It is an agreement that commits to reduce working hours and provide protections on public service outsourcing.  The trade union movement fought for and won those commitments in this country's darkest days when public service pay rounds were being negotiated during the bailout.  There is a commitment to restore overtime rates and twilight premiums for certain sectors.  The support within the trade union movement is very obvious.  In excess of 90% of the membership of F&oacute;rsa, SIPTU and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, voted for this pay deal.  Not every union could support this pay deal and we need to think of them as well.  In particular, I think of the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association and other unions that have long-standing grievances that did not arise today or yesterday.  There are issues with grade recognition and alignment that need to be resolved.</p> <p>I wish to make three specific comments.  First, I shall refer to sectoral funds, the focus on which is an innovation of this pay deal.  Over the last number of years, we have seen calls within certain elements of the public sector and, indeed, some public sector unions.  I have also seen some academics look on from outside and argue that we need to have sectoral pay deals.  This pay deal recognises that we need a pay agreement for all of the public sector.  We cannot pit librarians against nurses or pit maintenance workers within local authorities against some other public sector worker.  We need to look at their pay together.  However, there are some "stone in the shoe" issues.  I am heartened that the issue of teachers' pay has made considerable progress in this deal but there are other issues, particularly student nurses' pay.  There are other issues across the public sector and I hope that some progress can be made within these sectoral funds.  I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, have said that the fund is conditional on the delivery of actual reforms elsewhere.  We cannot have some of these long-standing pay alignment issues held to ransom by demands for reforms elsewhere.  We need to consider those issues that have become a source of huge frustration within the public service.</p> <p>The second key issue I would like to mention is the question of who is and is not covered, or who did and did not have a voice at the negotiating table in the context of this pay agreement.  We have an ongoing situation where both the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to be denied a seat at the table.  We have a series of opinions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Most recently, the European Committee on Social Rights highlighted that Ireland is out of step and in breach of the European Social Charter through its failure to allow the Defence Forces to be represented by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the negotiations.  That is not acceptable to members of the Defence Forces.  I acknowledge there are measures in the Bill that relate to the Defence Forces but, ultimately, it is about their ability to be recognised and to have a seat at the negotiating table.  </p><p>The last issue I wish to raise relates to the setting of higher level pay rates within the public service.  There has been an unseemly situation relating to the Secretary General of the Department of Health and how the pay of that person was set in recent months.  There was a group tasked with determining pay for senior civil servants but it was disbanded several years ago and we are now in a situation where the recruitment of senior civil servants is dealt with in a structured process through the top-level appointments committee, TLAC, but the decisions made with regard to the pay of those senior civil servants are vested in the power of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There are serious questions for the Government with regard to whether this situation can be allowed to continue.  The most senior civil servant in the State acknowledged when he appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment some weeks ago that it is not a good system.  It is incumbent on the Government to put a system in place for determining pay because it is not good enough that while student nurses who were working were denied pay, the Government saw fit to grant a pay increase of slightly more than &euro;80,000 to a person coming into the role of Secretary General of the Department of Health.  That is not good enough.  The optics of that decision and the message it sends to public sector workers is not acceptable.  We need a new system to be put in place.</p><p>I welcome the Bill but it is only a bridge to a much longer and more comprehensive deal that needs to commence next year in terms of pay for public sector workers in the next decade.</p></speech>

Is deas &eacute; a fheice&aacute;il.  I welcome the Bill.  It is really important.  I will focus on three major points in the Bill that it is important to clarify and speak to.  For me, it is massive that public consultants are now going to be paid to only be public consultants.  As a person who has only had access to public healthcare, I have felt the wrath of consultants trying to bi-locate, for want of a better word, having been left waiting on trolleys in corridors as consultants tried to keep private patients happy while working in a public hospital.  I have experienced consultants being very undermining and dismissive of the health issues with which I was dealing and also of the health issues of my son.  This is a massive day for anybody who only deals with the public health system.  The passage of the Bill means we might actually get to meet consultants rather than just meeting their registrars.  I often went to see a consultant whose name was on the door but never met him or her.  It is a massive day for anybody in the public health system as consultants will be paid just to be our doctors, rather than the doctors of others who can afford to pay for private healthcare.  To get pushed up and seen mid-consultation is a horrendous practice.  It is great that this is finally happening.  It is very important because those who cannot afford private healthcare are often made to feel lesser anyway, not to mention the consultants not bothering with them or walking out of the room mid-consultation because they have been called by a richer person.  This is a significant day for the couple of million people who cannot afford private healthcare.  As private healthcare becomes more expensive, more people will rely on public healthcare.  As politicians, one of our key jobs is to provide good healthcare, so I really welcome that aspect of the Bill.</p> <p>It is really good that the Bill will reinstate the pensions that were taken away after the recession from pensioners who deserved them.  Those pensioners will now be back on an equal footing with others.  We want to have equality and this Bill will bring it about.</p> <p>A few school friends of mine were in the Naval Service.  It is really good that the Bill will bring about improved payment for those in what is referred to as the seagoing service.  That is a good day for them.</p> <p>The Bill does not affect everybody.  It is almost naive for people to demand everything of a Bill.  I have learned in my 11 months in the Seanad that there is no one Bill that will fix everything relating to public service pay but the Bill before the House rectifies three clear problems, so I welcome it.</p> <p>To return to my passionate first point with regard to consultants, I am curious whether there is further information available with regard to what this will mean for public health users.  Will there be more consultants?  Is the plan that there will be shorter waiting lists as a result?  Will it be possible to hire more public consultants as a result of this pay increase making it more enticing for them to just deal with those who do not have private healthcare?  Will such patients finally get to meet consultants rather than just their registrars?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#NN00300"><p>It is nice to see the Minister of State.  He is very welcome.  I welcome the Bill on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.  It was very hard fought for.  The negotiations by the trade union movement were intense and, at stages, looked like they would not be successful.  Thankfully, they were successful in the sense that enough was delivered for the trade unions to go back to their members.  I pay tribute in particular to the leadership of the major unions and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for negotiating a skilful agreement.</p> <p>There are a couple of aspects of the Bill that are worth highlighting.  The first is that the pay increases are not ideal but the fact it is set out in such a progressive manner, with the lowest paid benefitting most, is significant.  That was very important in terms of carrying the agreement through.  We often forget that the salaries of many public servants start at approximately &euro;25,000 and, after ten years, get to &euro;35,0000.  I refer to operatives in local authorities, healthcare attendants in hospitals and cleaners in schools.  They are the real backbone of the public service.  Those people are not well paid.  The fact that the Bill has a progressive element in terms of that pay rise was crucial.  </p> <p>The second important part is the sectoral bargaining element, which is significant.  It, too, was very skilfully negotiated.  There is a host of issues that have been building up in the health service in particular over the past ten years.  They have been ten very difficult years for public servants.  The Bill should give them the ability to sign off on agreements and actually recognise pay awards that should have been made in that time.  It is really important that those awards are implemented and that the process is not dragged out in terms of not delivering particular reforms because it is really important that the Government does not take public servants for granted.  This pay increase is not particularly significant but it is progressive and there are other elements of the Bill, particularly the sectoral bargaining element, that are very important.  However, it is crucially important that they are implemented.</p> <p>The other aspect of the Bill I wish to recognise is the continuing protection against outsourcing.  That is vital because, unfortunately, the track record shows that both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il like to outsource.  They like to take things that belong to the people and hive them off to the private sector, so it is crucial to have that provision as a bulwark of protection, again negotiated by the trade union movement.</p> <p>The Bill is significant in terms of pay equality.  That was well fought for by the teachers' unions in particular to bring about the restoration of pay equality for new entrants to teaching.  That had been more than upsetting for members of the teaching profession so it is a very welcome development in the deal.  It is important to put on the record that we expect further and significant recognition of public servants, the people who have been keeping the country going to a large degree, particularly the front-line workers in the public service, when this particular deal concludes at the end of 2022.</p> <p>While we are speaking about agreements and dealing with trade unions, it is important to raise a couple of related issues.  The first, which has already been raised, is the ongoing failure to really deal with the issue of the Defence Forces and to recognise there is a fundamental wrong in terms of not allowing its members to have proper trade union recognition.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask that the Minister of State address that in his response.  It has gone on for too long.  There is no reason it should not be dealt with in a way that is fair and progressive.  As Senator Craughwell outlined, it is clear that not enough has been done for those workers.  Equally, the issue of student nurses has not been dealt with satisfactorily.  It is something that is in the Minister of State's power to address and I hope he will do that.</p><p>Above all, it is very important the Government addresses the elephant in the room when it comes to trade unions, namely, the ongoing refusal to support the right to collective bargaining for workers in this country.  It was more than disappointing to see the T&aacute;naiste write to the European Commission asking it not to make binding the directive on minimum wages.  That directive would have had a key knock-on element of increasing the scope of collective bargaining here and committing the Government to see that happening, yet the Government has gone out of its way to align itself with some of the most right-wing governments in Europe to ask the Commission not to make the directive binding.  We do not want to have to do that.  We have not heard an explanation for that.  Maybe the Minister of State might give it us in his response.  Members of my union, SIPTU, and across the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are more than disappointed by this stance.  If we believe in the value of workers, of front-line workers in particular, how can we not grant them the right to collective bargaining?  How can we continue to be one of the outliers in the European Union in not granting that right?  It is a key issue that needs to be addressed.</p><p>Otherwise, we welcome this Bill.  I pay tribute to the trade union movement in particular and look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

It is a very short Bill but it is very important.  I am disappointed by some aspects.  It does not go into great detail on benchmarking.  I was a Member of this House when benchmarking was introduced.  It was supposed to be the bee's knees for the way forward but we have not done any analysis of where we are with benchmarking or what we achieved with it.  It gave huge pay increases, not least to us in this House and to the Members of the other House.  It gave huge increases to the public sector.  It drove up a lot of costs.  I would like to know what we have achieved since the then Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, brought in benchmarking going back 20 years.  It is time we had a big analysis of that.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill and many of its contents.  I very much welcome Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is great we would have fully dedicated consultants working on behalf of people in hospitals and in health areas.  Restoration for teachers is also very important.  It is important that pay is increased for new entrants to the teaching profession.  All those things are very welcome.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste outlined there will be two week's sick pay for workers.  There is maternity, paternity, statutory redundancy of two weeks and now we have sick pay.  All this has to be paid for.  People who are working are quite entitled to all things, not only the public sector but also the private sector, but to get them they have to be paid for.  How are they paid for?  They can only be paid for by collecting taxes and increases in product prices.  There is no doubt the prices of products will have to be increased to pay for all of these things.  It is only right the people who are working would get well paid and have all these entitlements that are outlined.</p> <p>There is a golden opportunity to open up the public sector.  It is a closed shop and this Bill does not address any part of it.  Look at John Bruton, for instance.  He was the European ambassador to America; quite a big job.  He would not qualify to be an ambassador of Ireland to even the smallest country in the world.  I do not know where anyone from outside the Civil Service was brought in to be an ambassador.  There are quite a lot of people who have graced the Houses of the Oireachtas, D&aacute;il and Seanad, such as Bertie Ahern, Enda Kenny and Brian Cowen.  Is there any reason they would not make great ambassadors for this country?  This is an area that should be looked at.  This Bill should encompass those things.  We should have a good debate on those issues.  The public sector is a closed shop in many cases.  It is very difficult to come from outside to get into the public sector.  You do not have the experience, you do not have the knowledge, you do not have this or you do not have that.  That is what people are being told from the outside when they try to get into the public sector.  We have an independent body that selects people for those jobs but it is an area that should be looked at.  These Houses should play a more hands-on approach on some of these issues.</p></speech>

I was in Roscommon town on personal business this morning and when I came out, the tyre burst on my car.  I thank the lads in Roscommon who did a quick change for me and sorted me out.  I should have been before.  That is the reason I am running a bit late.  Thanks to everyone, and I appreciate the House letting me speak after I was supposed to be here.</p> <p>Like many others, I welcome this Bill.  As others have pointed out, the Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract will require consultants employed by the State to focus 100% of their time on the public work within the public health system.  At present, under the financial emergency measures in the public interest Acts, which everyone knows as FEMPI, no changes can be made to the public service pay for particular groups or individuals in the absence of legislative amendments.  This limits the Government's ability to deliver key policy commitments as they arise.  The Government is committed to reform of our health services, and that has to happen.  The Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract, as we all know and accept, has to be key to that.  This legislation will enable the contract to be progressed by the Minister for Health in the coming months.  Similarly, the proposed new enabling legislation is also required to enable public health doctors to move to consultant contracts.  The Minister for Health has said he wants the consultants for public health to be put in place as quickly as possible.</p> <p>There has been much talk here about the public service.  I agree with Senator Burke, I would like to see it opened up.  There should be new initiatives and new ideas.  We should pay tribute to many in the public service, and indeed to the rest of us, for their excellent duty and care to their jobs over the very dark period for our society.  Despite all the criticisms, we can say Ireland handled the Covid shock in quite an exemplary way.  Our vaccine roll-out has been well handled.  Some of the problems that arose were due to the shortage of vaccines coming into the country.  How our local authorities have responded has been remarkable.  In some cases we got things done we were told in recent years could not be done, which is also an eye-opener.  I found a huge amount of co-operation from the staff in the Department of Social Protection whenever I called about people's issues.  All that should be recognised.</p> <p>Sometimes, derogatory comments are made about the public service but I must remind everyone the FEMPI cuts took a lot of money away from the people in the public service.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The cuts have not been totally unwound yet.  It must be acknowledged when rebuilding our economy after a very dark period that the public service played its part.  The workers were angry about what was asked of them but they did it.  They did it for the sake of the country, and that should be acknowledged.</p><p>Like others, I welcome this development today.  Naturally, my party is supporting the Bill but I hope that we can have further reform of the public service, as others have said.  It would be good for our country.  If Covid has done anything, it has shown us that Irish people like a challenge.  They have risen to the current challenge.  Our public service has done so also.</p></speech>

I welcome the Bill because it is facilitating pay restoration.  It was very difficult in this House between 2011 and 2014.  The decisions that had to be made were extremely difficult.  It is, therefore, very welcome to be passing legislation now that is having the opposite effect.</p> <p>I, too, would like to see the public service transformed in the way I know it wants itself to be transformed.  Its staff are by and large fantastic.  During Covid, they demonstrated exemplary flexibility and an ability to adapt and transfer when necessary.  We saw thousands upon thousands of public servants providing an excellent service working from home.  Many lessons have been learned.  The Government has certainly taken note of the positives that have been demonstrated by the public service.</p> <p>Admittedly, the health service needs a lot of attention.  We are going to see significant change regarding health.  That said, it is important to acknowledge the wonderful public servants in the Department of Health, led by the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, and his deputy, Dr. Ronan Glynn, whom I believe exemplify everything that is positive about the public service and of which we can be proud.  That is just to name two people.  In many ways, they are figureheads but they are important figureheads because of how they do their business and advise the Government.  The respect the Government has for them, in spite of pushback on many occasions, reflects their quality.  There are many more like them throughout the public service.  I have had the great privilege for ten years in this House to work with senior public servants to try to effect change.  By and large, my experience has always been very positive.  </p> <p>The public service needs to be modernised.  I listened carefully to what Senator Burke said about Ireland's ambassadorial appointments throughout the world.  He makes a very good point.  There needs to be more fusion between the private and public sectors.  Those entering the public sector should not see their doing so as taking on a role for life.  If they so wish, they should be able to develop their skill set and move into the private sector, and perhaps move back into the public sector afterwards.  That type of flexibility and transferability very much needs to be facilitated.  The public service needs to be attractive to people from the private sector because it needs to keep attracting the best society has to offer.  I note the number of new staff promoted in the Houses of the Oireachtas, even within the committee secretariat and other sections.  Considerable experience has been lost through retirement, which is a pity.  The Minister of State is very aware that there is a big loss of skills and knowledge but, at the same time, some of the people coming up along the line and who have become clerks of committees and have taken on very senior roles, even in this branch of the public service, are people one would be immensely proud to work alongside.  They have done a phenomenal job.  That is reflected throughout the public service.  The public service needs to become more flexible and dynamic, however.  It needs to become more attractive to the private sector.  It even needs to become more attractive to Irish citizens abroad who might be working in specialised areas and who might like to come home to join it.  Therefore, there is much work to be done.  However, this legislation, which is to restore pay and create a framework for the elimination of the FEMPI cuts, is very much welcome.</p></speech>

Go h&aacute;irithe sa ch&aacute;s sin, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimhe.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.  It is tremendously important as we return to some form of normality.  After the cuts under the FEMPI legislation, it is only appropriate that we restore the pay.  I absolutely endorse the comments made by Members on the need to recognise the good work done by the public service.  It is so easy, in the media and public opinion, to do down the public service, including the Civil Service, and to disregard their work.  It is so easy to forget that, without them, the country does not run and the systems do not function.The needed services we receive throughout this country, be they in the health service or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the services offered by Civil Service officials do not happen without the hard work done by the members of the public service.  It is entirely appropriate that we recognise that.</p><p>I am going to raise a branch of the public service that is so often forgotten because those concerned are not employed directly by the State.  They are self-employed people, namely, barristers, particularly barristers who work for the State and barristers who work as part of the criminal justice system.  I am a criminal barrister and have worked for quite a long time as part of that system.  Therefore, I do not deny that there is no self-interest in my comments.  Setting that aside, however, I am aware that the Chair of the Council of the Bar of Ireland, Ms Maura McNally, SC, has been in the media quite a lot recently raising this issue because it is an important one.  The problem has reached crisis point.  Approximately 250 barristers work in the area of criminal law in Dublin and throughout the rest of the country.  They are specialists in this area but they are self-employed.  They operate through the criminal legal aid system, which is what pays them for the work they do.  From the State's perspective, they offer a huge package that offers great value for money because it does not have to pay them or look after them as it must do with employees.  It does not have to pay holiday pay, sick pay or maternity pay.  The barristers do not enjoy any of the other rights that ordinary employees of the State benefit from, particularly in the public service.  It is, of course, correct that those rights exist but an external consultant or contractor to the State gets none of the benefits.  With regard to the criminal Bar, the State benefits from a couple of hundred people whose work is extremely specialised and who have spent a lot of their own money qualifying.  They have survived in very difficult times to get to the point they are at and to provide their service, which is tremendously important because it allows the criminal justice system to work and allows us to comply with our obligations under international law.  The way they have been treated by the State is quite appalling.  Criminal barristers' levels of pay are the same as they were in 2002.  They comprise the only group of which I am aware that has received no restitution or reinstatement whatsoever of the fees they were paid before the crash.  Under the FEMPI legislation, depending on the category one is talking about, cuts may be of up to 70% of the pay that would have been received from the State.</p><p>There is a very popular misconception that barristers are at the top end of pay scales and all the rest of it.  That is definitely not true.  The maxim that crime does not pay certainly applies to criminal barristers.  The figure that has been mentioned for junior barristers appearing in the District Court, for example, is &euro;25 per day.  That is what we are talking about.  They have never had their fees reinstated.  It is appropriate, although barristers are not covered by this Bill, which cannot help them, that we remember that there are still individuals who are <i>de facto</i>public servants.  Even though they are self-employed, they are serving us all as a public and serving the State.  They are forgotten by the Government in terms of the reinstatement of their pay.  It is appropriate to raise that.  I ask the Minister of State to bear it in mind.</p></speech>

Senator Horkan raised the issue of pensions for councillors, which I did not expect to hear about and which is not covered by this Bill, a point Senator Horkan made.  He also raised the case of secretarial assistants, who fall between two stools as they work in the public sector but are not public sector employees.  Their pay was not cut by FEMPI, but it was already incredibly low and their plight is recognised.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in talks with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission because the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has to approve any changes to their pay and conditions.  I would like to see a change in their pay and conditions.  Talks in that regard are ongoing and I will talk to my officials about the issue.</p> <p>Senators Sherlock and Gavan were praiseworthy of the Bill and pointed out there had been union co-operation to reach this point.  They also pointed out it is progressive and people at the lower end of the salary scale will receive much higher increases than those at the top.  That is as it should be.  We can see the hard work done by special needs assistants, SNAs, and often the people who are the essential workers and who are the low paid, as we were all reminded during the pandemic.</p> <p>Senator Sherlock made the point she would like to see a new system for the determination of pay and pointed out the cases of Secretaries General in particular Departments.  This Bill is not needed to change the salary for a vacant position.  It was always possible to change that, but it was not always possible to change the salary of somebody already in position.  This Bill allows that to be possible without having to come up with primary legislation or go to the Labour Court for a determination.</p> <p>Senator Garvey mentioned the new public consultant contract.  I am delighted that public health specialists, who have come to the fore during the pandemic, whose value to society is incredible and who prevent health problems before they happen, will, as a result of this legislation if it passes, all now be entitled to apply for the new consultant contract.  This will mean the public health service will be consultant-led rather than specialist-led, which has been a request for many years.</p> <p>Senator Kyne referenced working from home and asked whether there was any analysis of homeworking and whether it had been a success.  Studies have been done and it is clear from people's own accounts that a large proportion of them would like to work from home full-time, a larger proportion would like to mix working from home with working in the office, and a smaller number of people want to return to the office full-time.  The Department for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, under the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is providing guidelines to support that and allow people to work from home unless it is not possible to do so.  Most people's desire is to achieve that hybrid status where they can work it around their lives, spending some days at home while having meetings or social contact in the office for a couple of days as well.  It will be one of the positives to come out of the pandemic that will be possible and people will have a better quality of life as a result.  There have been academic studies on it.  Previous studies on working from home had not shown it was a positive thing to do, and it turned out the people who volunteered, who had self-selected to work from home, were perhaps not the most industrious.  When everybody was made to work from home, it turned out the average person was more efficient at home and got more done.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell asked about the Defence Forces.  Union recognition for the Defence Forces is a matter for the Minister for Defence and cannot be changed by this Bill or by my Department.  I am committed to seeing the Defence Forces and Garda associations fully represented in public sector pay talks, as they ought to be.  I look forward to what comes out of the review of the Defence Forces that is ongoing.  Senator Craughwell also mentioned the pension abatement for public sector workers and suggested it would be better if pay rather than pensions were abated.  He referred to pensions as a property right and compared it to the right of prisoners to claim pensions when they reach pension age.  That is something I have not considered but I will do so.</p> <p>Senator Gavan praised the Bill for a number of reasons including the sectoral bargaining element and the restoration of pay equality for new entrant teachers, which was sought for many years.  He referred to the right to collective bargaining.  I am a little confused by that because, as far as I am aware, it is enshrined in European law under one of the treaties we ratified.  I believe it is the Charter of Fundamental Rights that guarantees the right of all European citizens to collective bargaining and perhaps we can-----</p></speech>

Senator Burke suggested ambassadors could be drawn from outside the public service.  That is certainly an original suggestion and the names he provided were also interesting.  Clearly, some countries have a hybrid model where either a civil service track is followed or someone is selected by government.  I am not sure if that is under consideration but I will pass it on to the Department of Foreign Affairs and ask it.</p> <p>Senator Conway referred to the need for a flexible and dynamic public sector, which is absolutely right.  It is why the issue of reform and linking reform with pay rises are present throughout this Bill.</p> <p>Senator Ward highlighted the plight of criminal justice barristers who are on very low pay and had their fees cut during the previous financial emergency.  Those fees were not raised subsequently and there has not been a pay rise since 2002.  It is true that barristers are in a profession where, like rock stars, a tiny number of people earn a lot and a large number earn barely anything at all.  It is a matter for the Department of Justice, probably in consultation with my Department, to determine rates.  I am happy to talk to Senator Ward or anybody else who wants to discuss that.  I am sure there are plenty of barristers in this House and in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>I look forward to the Bill being progressed in the weeks ahead, particularly as it is needed to give effect to the Building Momentum pay agreement.  That agreement involves general pay increases in October, and in October of next year, of 1% each or &euro;500, whichever is greater.  It also involves a new sectoral bargaining fund amounting to 1% of basic pay to resolve any outstanding issues such as those that resulted in industrial actions in the period of previous agreements.  Work on the implementation of the fund and the identification of the sectoral bargaining units, for example, is well under way and I look forward to seeing it progress over the period ahead.</p> <p>This Bill is needed not just for Building Momentum but also for the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract in the health service, which is a key part of the reform of the public health system.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and his Department will continue to work on the advancement of the new Sl&aacute;intecare public-only consultant contract.  The Bill is also needed for the implementation of the seagoing service commitment scheme, which is a very important reform for the retention of staff in the Naval Service.</p> <p>I look forward to continuing to work with Members of the House on progressing the Bill.  I hope it will pass Second Stage and proceed to Committee Stage so that implementation of the new public service agreement and related matters can proceed.  The views expressed here today will be carefully considered prior to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

The euro is the second most widely used global currency after the US dollar.  Figures released by the European Central Bank this year show there are 25 billion euro banknotes in circulation, with a value of over &euro;1.4 trillion.  Responsibility for protecting the euro currency against counterfeiting is shared between the EU authorities and all member states.  This is achieved through a comprehensive package of technical, administrative and criminal law measures, which have over time proven to be very successful.  Figures published by the ECB in January show that counterfeiting is down 17% year-on-year and is now at an historically low level.  In 2020, the chance of a note being counterfeit was only 17 in 1 million and most counterfeits are of low quality and are quickly detected and removed from circulation.</p> <p>Although this threat has been contained, with high-tech security features making euro banknotes secure and easy to distinguish from counterfeits, the regime will continue to evolve to ensure protection in the future.  This Bill will update Irish law to reflect four pieces of EU legislation in the area.  These are, by and large, already implemented, either in law or existing practice, and the Bill reflects the evolution of an already successful regime to ensure that we meet our EU obligations.</p> <p>The current law in regard to counterfeiting is contained in Part 5 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, which gives effect to the earlier EU measure in this area, namely, Framework Decision 2000/383/JHA.  The 2014 directive updates and replaces that 2000 framework decision and establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area.  Article 3 of the directive requires criminal offences to be in place in respect of making, altering or importing counterfeit currency and possessing instruments and security features for making counterfeits.  While, for the most part, the provisions on counterfeiting in our existing 2001 Act meet the requirements of the 2014 directive, it is necessary to make a number of amendments to this Act to align with the 2014 directive and to fulfil our obligations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The European Commission issued a reasoned opinion on 3 December 2020 to Ireland in respect of the remaining aspects of the transposition of this directive and there has been ongoing engagement with the Commission.  Several aspects of the directive are being refined and clarified by this legislation, including the import-export of counterfeits from non-EU states, the use of legal instruments for illegal purposes, the counterfeiting of non-circulated currency, possession of materials that may be used for counterfeiting, extra-territorial jurisdiction and liability of bodies corporate.  These changes are contained in Part 2.</p><p>In addition to transposing the outstanding elements of the 2014 directive, the Bill will also provide for statutory powers in respect of monitoring, supervision, enforcement and some related powers relating to three interrelated EU legal instruments that are in force: Regulation 44/2009, amending Regulation 1338/2001, laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting; Council Regulation 1210/2010 concerning authentication of euro coins and handling of euro coins unfit for circulation; and European Central Bank Decision, ECB/2010/14, on the authenticity and fitness checking of bank notes.</p><p>Part 3 will place existing supervisory practice in respect of these measures on a statutory footing and give the Central Bank of Ireland, CBI, powers in respect of some firms that do not financial regulation legislation.  These issues:are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and his officials have been closely involved in the development of the Bill.  The provisions in Part 3 will provide the necessary powers:and functions for the CBI in respect of monitoring and enforcement measures relating to suspect counterfeit euro currency and currency deemed unsuitable for recirculation.  The CBI is also the Irish branch of the ECB and, therefore, is responsible for, and needs the power to, fitness check euro notes and coins.  </p><p>Part 4 places on statutory footing the designation of the currency centre of the CBI as the national analysis centre for euro notes and the coin national analysis centre, CNAC, for euro coins.  It also provides for the recovery of costs by the CBI in respect of euro coins, in particular the protection of the euro against counterfeiting.  Part 4 also contains consequential amendments to other legislation.  </p><p>I will now move on to the specific provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 is a standard provision that sets out the short title of the Bill and the arrangements for the commencement.</p><p>Part 2 sets out the amendments to the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 to give full effect to the 2014 directive. </p><p>Sections 2 and 3 provide for relevant definitions.  Section 4 creates a specific offence of making or altering a designated note or coin with the intention of passing it off as genuine.</p><p>Section 5 creates a new offence of receiving, obtaining or transporting anything a person knows or believes to be a counterfeit note with the intention of passing it off as genuine.  This complements the existing definition under section 34 of the 2001 Act.</p><p>Section 6 substitutes the existing offence in section 36 of the 2001 Act in respect of receiving, obtaining and having control or custody of currency instruments, counterfeiting instruments or security features for the purpose at making a counterfeit note or coin with the intention of it being passed off as genuine.</p><p>Section 7 revises section 37 of the 2001 Act in respect of importing or exporting a counterfeit or currency note or coin. </p><p>Section 8 provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction in respect of the relevant offences under the Part and amends section 38.</p><p>Section 9 provides for liability by a body corporate and inserts a new section 38A. </p><p>Section 10 amends section 39 of the 2001 Act by defining "designated bodies", "credit institutions", "transporter of funds" and "payment service provider".  The new definition of a credit institution will incorporate a number of institutions previously listed in section 39. </p><p>Section 11 provides for a technical amendment to section 58 of the Act of 2001 regarding liability for offences by a body corporate to exclude its application to Part 5 in view of the new section 38A inserted by section 9.</p><p>Part 3 relates to the obligations of relevant persons in respect of ensuring authenticity and fitness of euro bank notes and coins.  it sets out the new monitoring, supervision and enforcement powers of the CBI. </p><p>Section 12 provides the definitions that will apply to Part 3, including the "relevant persons" to which the obligations apply.  Section 13 provides for the functions and powers of the CBI, including monitoring and taking measures to ensure compliance with the EU instruments, verifying the specific procedures referred to and performing the specific controls and functions referred to.</p><p>Section 14 provides that the CBI may impose requirements on relevant persons to take specific measures, including measures to rectify non-compliance with certain obligations and to comply with the condition of a permission granted by the CBI.</p></speech>

I am just looking around the Chamber and seeing colleagues I knew in UCD but also a councillor in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council - Senators Ward, Boyhan and Conway, who was in UCD with me.  Ireland feels that bit smaller today than it ever did.  It is my first opportunity to congratulate Deputy Browne on his appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for law reform.  I have been appointed as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on law in the Seanad so that might be why I managed to achieve this small coup, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach called it.  I will certainly not repeat all of the very informative speech given by the Minister of State detailing all 33 sections.</p> <p>Much of what we are implementing now is there in practice, if not in law.  Hopefully, in future, we can bring the euro to the countries we used to be able to use it in such as Spain, Portugal and France when we get travelling again.  In the past year, probably more than ever, we have used fewer coins and notes than we ever did.  Electronic money, tap and go, chip and pin and all the other technologies probably mean that we will use less hard cash than we ever did.  Nevertheless, it is very important legislation.  A Fianna F&aacute;il Minister is bringing it through the House and along with the rest of the Government, the Fianna F&aacute;il group is supporting it.  Much of it is in place.  It is very important that we do it and we have those security measures in place across the eurozone to deal with anyone who is caught for or involved in the counterfeiting of euro notes or coins, which we know was big business with lots of criminal gangs and organised crime outfits involved in the forging of notes and coins.  It is probably less prevalent because standards are getting higher and higher.  I welcome this Bill and I will not delay the House on it.  I thank my colleagues, particularly Senator Gallagher, for deferring to me on this occasion.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Some would say that we are merely engaged in a bit of housekeeping.  As the Minister of State outlined, the Bill reflects what we are already doing and transposes an EU directive into Irish law, which is to be welcomed.  Senator Horkan said I stood aside to let him speak on this occasion.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows, us country boys are very obliging and we would not like to think that the city slickers would take advantage of it.  I have no doubt that this will not happen.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On a more serious note, I am not going to delay the passage of the Bill through the House.

I support the Counterfeiting Bill 2020, which updates Irish law to reflect EU legislation in the area of counterfeiting.  It is important and it is a good legislation.  The purpose of the Counterfeiting Bill is to complete the transposition of Directive 2014/62/EU and to make provision for three additional EU instruments dealing with authenticity, the fitness of checking of euro bank notes and coins and measures for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting.</p> <p>I note the Bill specifically relates to the counterfeiting of hard cash, both notes and coins, but it does not relate to online money laundering.  Perhaps the Minister of State can confirm that.</p> <p>I understand the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General have worked closely with the Minister of State's Department to draft this complex but necessary legislation.  The proposed changes in this Bill will give powers and functions to the Central Bank of Ireland to monitor and enforce measures relating to suspected counterfeit euro currencies.  That is to be welcomed.</p> <p>As I stated previously, the Bill does not relate to online money laundering, which is of concern.  I took the time to look at the contributions of the Minister of State in the Lower House on this matter and I understand from some of the commentary in the D&aacute;il that the Government proposes to introduce separately measures on cybersecurity, fraud, anti-money laundering and terrorist finances through other legislation.  Therefore, it would be helpful if the Minister of State would advise this House of his intentions in relation to those issues.  While they are not part of this legislation, they are related to it and they are important.  Every day of the week, we hear about financial, money and counterfeiting crimes.  It is a challenging area and a difficult issue.  However, the issues of cybercrime, fraud, anti-money laundering and terrorist financing are important and need to be addressed.  I would like to hear what the Minister of State's intentions are in relation to the matter.</p> <p>Perhaps the Minister of State will also advise the House if he has requested observations from the European Central Bank or other stakeholders in relation to the substantive content of this Bill.  Have they responded to any request that the Minister of State has made of them?  If so, what has been the response of the Minister of State's Department to those issues?  If the Department has not responded, I ask the Minister of State to confirm that contact has been made with stakeholders and that they have been invited to make a submission.  If stakeholders have not made a submission, what steps has the Department taken to engage with them?  Hopefully, they have responded and the Minister of State is in a position to share their response with us this evening.  Certainly, I would hope their response can be shared with us between now and the next time this legislation comes back to the House.</p> <p>I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Economic Crime Bureau for its continued work, albeit behind the scenes.  We do not know much about it but we know it is going on.  I thank the unit for its work in challenging counterfeiting, and in particular, the payment card and counterfeit currency unit that is operating successfully.  It focuses on tackling money fraud and counterfeiting crime.</p> <p>This Bill seeks to update Ireland's legal and administrative regime in respect of counterfeiting.  I support the work of the Minister of State and the key objectives and principles of this important Bill.</p></speech>

The Bill goes through a number of boxes that need to be ticked from the point of view of the implementation of the European law.  I agree with the course of action being taken by the Government to separate cybersecurity from counterfeiting.  While I recognise that they occupy the same space in many respects, they are very different issues.  I do not think that we could use amending legislation, as this one is in respect of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, to implement all of the quite complex measures that need to be put in place to deal with counterfeiting and those issues.  I welcome the Bill in that regard.</p> <p>I particularly welcome the extra-territorial elements in section 8 of the Bill, which are most important, particularly now.  I know others Senators have mentioned that we are dealing in cash less than we were, but that overlooks the importance of this particular legislation.  As ordinary citizens, we are using less cash.  We are using contactless payments.  People can make payments using their mobile phones or they can tap and go.  That leaves a very clear digital trail behind the expenditure in and out of one's account.  That is not something that is necessarily entertained by criminal elements who want to use cash to buy goods, services, or whatever it might be.  Cash still has a very significant role in the underworld, the black market and with criminal elements.  It is entirely appropriate, therefore, that we are dealing with it.  I do not think that cash is so far gone beyond the use of society that we should not put in place these measures.</p> <p>It has been recognised that many of these measures are technical.  They represent things that are happening in practice already.  It is extremely important that we satisfy and tick that box to say that it is done and that we are now implementing the European legislation, albeit late.  It is also important that we, as an outlier in Europe, geographically, and next to a country which is now a third country and one through which many people must travel if they are going over land with goods to the Continent, have in place these measures and the amendments to the 2001 Act to ensure that we are as safe as possible in terms of having the powers that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and law enforcement need to tackle any counterfeiting that might be going on.</p></speech>

I welcome also this legislation, which essentially transposes into Irish law the EU directive of 2014 on the issue of counterfeiting and counterfeit euro notes and kinds.  Why has it has taken more than seven years for something as important as this to be implemented?  I agree that the use of cash has decreased dramatically, particularly in the last year, in our country.  Nonetheless, the use of cash will continue for many years into the future.  As such, we must ensure that we have the necessary armoury to deal with counterfeiting because it is a problem across Europe.  Other European countries have transposed the directive into law.  We are coming to the table late.  We need to have a discussion in broad terms as to why it has taken nearly a decade to implement what is law in Europe and what was decided in Europe seven or eight years ago.</p> <p>I also agree with my colleagues in respect of other measures in terms of cybersecurity.  Chip and PIN cards, contactless payments and credit cards are used everywhere now, from taxis to restaurants to the purchase of property.  I absolutely agree that we need to bring forward very robust legislation to deal with crime in this area.  As consumers use of Internet banking, laser cards, other forms of technology and apps such as Revolut and PayPal increases, criminals will follow.  They will find ways of infiltrating it and scamming people.  Therefore, we need to ensure that we have the armoury, in terms of the legislation, that is necessary to deal with it.  We must ensure that we equip An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and the other arms of the State with the necessary legislation so that they are in a position to deal swiftly with this type of crime when inevitably increases.  It is already a problem, but it will increase.  </p> <p>This legislation, albeit late, is welcome.  I sincerely hope that it passes all Stages in the House without division.</p></speech>

It will give effect to European Council and Parliament regulations dealing with it and also with the authentication of euro coins.  It will give effect to an ECB decision regarding the authenticity, fitness checking and recirculation of euro banknotes and it makes provision regarding the designation of the National Analysis Centre for euro notes and the CNAC for euro coins.  The Bill introduces criminal offences and grants additional monitoring and enforcement powers to the Central Bank.  It also provides for a range of new powers and functions for the CBI in respect of monitoring and enforcement measures relating to suspect counterfeit currency and euro currency that is not deemed to be suitable for recirculation.</p><p>The Green Party unreservedly welcomes the Bill.  The ECB and the State must invest as much they can in safeguarding our financial security online.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that enough is being done?  Has the Department sufficient resources in managing what is an ever changing situation?  The Continent and the EU have seen incredible changes.  What we have now is unrecognisable from what we had at the start of the Covid.  As previous contributors said, we are moving to contactless payments.  Coins and notes could be a thing of the past.  We will have to revisit it sooner than we think to keep up with the counterfeiting measures of tomorrow and the futuristic approach to ensure we are one step ahead of the fraudsters who are only too keen, willing and able to defraud us and society.  We must be on our guard at all times.  I welcome this Bill.  I also welcome the Minister of State to the House, which I should have said at the start.</p></speech>

I will not needlessly delay the House or the passage of this Stage other than to say I share the concerns and regret of some colleagues about the delay in the Bill coming before the House.  A number of colleagues also raised the issue of new forms of criminality with respect to finances and how way we adapt to counterfeiting given the increasing move to online services and various services referenced by Senator Conway, be it PayPal or whatever it may be.  My colleagues in the other House expressed a range of observations during debates on earlier Stages of the Bill as it went through the D&aacute;il and I reiterate those points.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in support the Bill.  It is important the Minister of State would at least made some reference to the questions relating to the online issue.</p></speech>

Many questions have been raised in welcoming this legislation.  We are supporting what has come from Europe.  This Bill is about protecting the consumer and business people.  As a former business owner, I am aware of people who had their cards stolen and used or who have been scammed.  There has been a major increase in people using their cards and it is all about the Internet.  As a colleague said, the fraudsters are always two steps ahead of everyone else.  The tighter we can make the legislation to protect everybody, the better.  I welcome the legislation and support it.  It is important to put as many measures in place as possible to protect against fraud.  I pay tribute to the members of the Garda who assist people who have been scammed or have been the victim of a counterfeiting fraud offence, be it counterfeit notes or cards.</p></speech>

While the Bill, for the most part, is technical in nature, its subject matter is very important and it also tangentially touches on very important issues.</p> <p>Regarding the delay in bringing forward the Bill, when I was appointed as Minister of State last September, a significant number of EU directives needed to be transposed.  With great thanks to the departmental officials and with the support of the Seanad, we have been able to clear out a significant number of those, including the Criminal Justice (Mutual Recognition of Decisions on Supervision Measures) Act, the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act and the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Act 2021.  There was a backlog and a delay but we are working hard to clear that backlog and we have gone a significant way towards doing that, and we are also dealing with this Bill today.</p> <p>On the issue of white-collar crime and online corruption and crime, I reference some of those Bills we passed.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering Terrorist Financing) Bill, which was signed by the President and enacted, seeks to tackle and update our laws in line with the EU on tackling online money laundering and terrorist financing.  Cross-border measures and co-operation are fundamental.  Criminals are operating cross-border and on an international scale.  States need to work and co-operate together.  Similarly, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Act 2021 also seeks to tackle corruption that may be happening within the Union.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, published the Hamilton review and it forms a fundamental part of the justice plan of 2021 in tackling corruption and white-collar crime.  That would include any online aspects.  The Minister published a cross-governmental plan on implementing the review on 19 April 2021.  This sets out 22 actions to be implemented over the next 18 months.  It is a very comprehensive plan which will target a great deal white-collar crime and corruption.  I echo the sentiments of Senator Boyhan in thanking the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau for its sterling work in this area.  It will see its number of officers rise from 46 to 112 as well as a significant investment in ICT to enable the bureau to target online white collar crime and corruption.  </p> <p>In accordance with the obligations under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, and the European System of Central Banks, ESCB, statute, the ECB was consulted by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on this Bill and an opinion from the ECB was received in February.  This opinion was supportive of the Bill in general stating that the ECB welcomed the draft law, which will ensure the preservation of euro banknotes and coins in circulation resulting in continued public confidence in euro banknotes.  The opinion, however, noted the CBI should be remunerated for its task regarding euro coins and, in particular, relating to the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, and there was a note of concern that this was only partially done at present.  That matter was raised by Deputy Howlin in the D&aacute;il and we addressed it then.  An amendment was accepted on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to address any outstanding concerns regarding the ECB.</p> <p>I am happy to engage with the Senators on this Bill.  It is an important one that we can deal with as quickly as possible.  I am happy to address any concerns Senators may have.  </p></speech>

I thank my colleagues in the Civil Engagement Group for their support and sponsorship for this important legislation and for allowing it to be taken during our group&rsquo;s Private Members' time.  I also thank Sebastian McAteer in my office for drafting the Bill and everyone who has been involved in getting to this Stage, including the National Women&rsquo;s Council and amazing activists on the international stage such as Dr. Julie Macfarlane, Zelda Perkins, Georgina Calvert-Lee and Ifeoma Ozoma who have so generously fed into this process to date by sharing their personal experiences and insights.  I also thank Tobi Lawal and Yara Algaha for their ongoing research on this issue for my office.</p> <p>I thank the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and the officials in his office for their engagement with me in recent weeks on the Bill&rsquo;s provisions and other colleagues in the House for indicating their support and for attending the Bill&rsquo;s virtual launch on Thursday last, in particular the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, and other stakeholders.  </p> <p>Part of my motivation for working on this legislation in recent years has been in support of a number of friends who unfortunately signed non-disclosure agreements, NDAs, before we really understood how far-reaching they were in the community sector.  In the community sector State money would have paid for those legal fees.  As I looked into it in more detail, I realised how widespread the use of NDAs was.  A few years ago, a group of university academics decided to contact me confidentially about the use of a non-disclosure agreement in their university relating to the same repeat offender who was moved around the college and then eventually on to another school.</p> <p>It is said that these are used throughout the technology industry and in other sectors, including in legal firms.  It is very widespread but also very hidden because people are terrified to speak out against them.  We were also contacted by a number of legal professionals who, when they saw our research go out, were concerned that they are obliged to use them as part of their work.  They do not want to use them and are concerned at how far-reaching some of them are.  </p> <p>Our research highlighted the misconception that these are in the best interests of the victim.  That is how it is framed to a person after probably their most vulnerable point.  After weeks, months or years of bullying, sexual harassment or gender-based harassment when they are offered the NDA, they just want out.  They cannot say where they are and they will sign anything just to allow them to walk away and try to build their lives back up again.  However, like everything, that changes.  It takes more than just time to heal from abuse, sexual harassment or discrimination.</p> <p>It also takes away the person's voice in the end.  Most people want to speak up.  Our research has found that after a few months or maybe a bit of distance from the situation in most cases women have regretted that they are now in this legal bind where they cannot speak about what they went through.</p> <p>Our research found that one of the concerns related to reputation.  Colleges or firms, including firms in the tech industry do not want to damage their reputation by allowing somebody to speak out.  It is very sad that organisations want to build their reputation on silencing victims.  We should want to build our reputation on empowering and protecting victims, not the perpetrator.  </p> <p>I could speak about so many areas affected by this, including the idea of two third parties and who is not at the bargaining table.  Someone who is discriminating against or bullying a colleague may be protected and then given a glowing reference so that the employer can move them on.  It is known in the industry as "pass the trash".  Employers wipe their hands and are thankful to get rid of them but they have simply gone on to some other unsuspecting university or place of work.  There is generally a pattern to their behaviour.  When we are sitting down and we are signing an NDA between an employer and an employee or a perpetrator and a victim, we are not only signing it in terms of the people who are in that room.  We need to think of the third parties who are also being endangered by giving a glowing reference for someone to start over again without their pattern of abuse ever being picked up because of NDAs.</p> <p>What is a non-disclosure agreement?  It is a legal agreement that ensures silence and allows for such principles to be protected and a legal basis to protect perpetrators.  It is simply untrue and a further manipulation of a victim to imply that settlements require NDAs.  NDAs are required to protect the employer's reputation and the perpetrator's identity.  </p> <p>If they were in the best interest of the victim then it is only the victim that they would protect.  We should be under no illusion; this is not the case.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In fact, when victims are stepped back from the harmful situation and away from the scene of their harassment or discrimination, they begin to feel stronger in themselves and want to speak out.</p><p>No one denies that there are many scenarios where a legal non-disclosure agreement may be needed or even desirable.  Trade secrets may need to be protected, industrial relations in progress may need to be safeguarded and intellectual property may need certain legal protections and guarantees.  However, in recent years in Ireland and in other jurisdictions around the world, we have seen a certain creep emerge, where NDAs are now cropping up in scenarios where they were never originally envisaged and where the legal silence that they both cause and effect are actively damaging the public interest and the common good.  Openness, transparency and accountability are fundamental principles of a functioning and fair society.  They underpin our democratic systems and the code of conduct by which we all engage with each other in public life.</p><p>The right to share the details of one's own experience is a fundamental right, a human right, one tied up in the fundamental principles of freedom of expression.  Any legal instrument that restricts individuals, groups or communities from exercising said rights must be treated with extreme caution, due to the risk that such agreements and the silence that they cause could eventually lead to.</p><p>When such abuse happens in the workplace, a victim may decide that remaining in a workplace with an abuser is simply too painful, if a perpetrator is not terminated, as is often the case.  That victims would then be faced with a legal non-disclosure agreement and forced into unwanted legal and enforced silence about their own painful experience is utterly and totally indefensible.  This practice must be banned and that is why I am proposing this legislation.  It will allow victims the time and space to recover from their experiences without a shroud of legal silence preventing them from sharing their trauma.</p><p>In terms of the legislation itself, it is a relatively short Bill.  It would insert a new section 14B into the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended, to stipulate that the use of non-disclosure agreements that relate to sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace would be extremely restricted and regulated.  Essentially, all such agreements would be banned, other than those that are requested by the victims themselves to protect their own confidentiality, that is, the so-called victim's exception.  However, the Bill sets out a number of very robust conditions that would be needed for such an NDA requested by the victim to be enforceable.</p><p>First, the victim must have been offered independent legal advice provided at the expense of the employer.  Second, there must have been no undue attempts to influence the victim to include a confidentiality clause.  Third, the agreement shall not adversely affect the health or safety of a third party not involved in the making of the NDA or the public interest more generally.  Fourth, the agreement must include an opportunity for the victim to waive confidentiality in the future if he or she so chooses.  Finally, the agreement must be of a set and limited duration.</p><p>In terms of the Bill's other provisions, we would make it illegal for an employer to enter into an NDA with just the perpetrator in order to cover up his or her unacceptable behaviour.  Furthermore, we would make any subsequent NDAs that were signed but were not made in accordance with this Bill null and void and it would be an offence to enter into such a contract.  Furthermore, in terms of retrospectivity for NDAs signed before the enactment of this Bill, they would only be enforceable going forward if they had also been made in accordance with the strict provisions set out earlier.</p><p>Furthermore and later in the Bill, subsection (8) sets out important provisions relating to information sharing that even an NDA that is legally signed under this Bill cannot apply to, for example, whistleblowing under the protected disclosures legislation, communications relating to the harassment by the Garda, a lawyer or a therapist.  Finally, the Bill would require that agreements made under this Act must be written in plain English, insofar as is possible, that the Minister would make regulations for a standard form for such agreements and that the Minister would also issue guidelines on the use of NDAs in employment equality practice for employers, employees and the legal profession.</p><p>The last provision would ensure that non-disparagement agreements, that is, agreements that prevent a person from being critical of an employer, would not become a backdoor to further NDA abuse in this area by ensuring that any non-disparagement agreement that restricts a victim from sharing details relating to harassment or discrimination would be covered by the restrictions put in place by this Bill.</p><p>Those are the provisions of the Bill.  I believe that they are fair and generous in how they support the autonomy and voice of victims of harassment to make themselves heard.  I believe it would be one of the most comprehensive regulations of this area in any jurisdiction in the world and would allow Ireland to become a real leader as we continue to shine a light on the treatment of the marginalised at the hands of the powerful, both in our modern day society and as we look back to reckon with a shameful history of institutional abuse and incarceration, particularly of women, minorities and the marginalised.</p></speech>

I commend her and her assistant, Sebastian McAteer, on the work they have done in introducing an important piece of legislation, one that is needed internationally.  It has been really remarkable to note the level of distress caused by them and the concern around the abuse of NDAs internationally that has arisen in response to this legislation, based on what was an initial area of inquiry on NDAs within one realm.  That shows how necessary the Bill is.  The event to launch the Bill was very powerful because it showed us that this is something being sought internationally.  Crucially, NDAs do not just compound the abuse of a victim, they also represent an abuse of the law and the spirit of the law and that is what is important.  In my limited time I will highlight those two strands, which are equally important in underscoring why this legislation is needed.</p> <p>Georgina Calvert-Lee, who is an equality and employment lawyer with great experience of NDAs in the United States, spoke about the fact that NDAs were a form of legal agreement originally designed to protect trade secrets which became weaponised as a tool to suppress human rights.  She explained how far NDAs have strayed from their original purpose and the fact that there has been a conflation of issues.  If a person gets a settlement, an NDA will be attached, but there is no necessary connection and they do very different things.  They are at odds with each other.  A settlement is a reparative recognition of damage that has been done, whereas an NDA is the disappearing of the evidence of the damage.  It is the denial of that damage on the record.  They are in fact very much at cross purposes in many cases in situations of abuse.  One has a reparative role and the other compounds the trauma.</p> <p>In terms of the silencing, we have heard from whistleblowers who spoke about NDAs which, for example, do not allow them to speak to a therapist.  Zelda Perkins spoke about the real trauma beginning after signing an NDA, when she realised she could not speak to a therapist or her family.  It is very different to have something that is a trade secret, intellectual property or something that belongs to an organisation or employment, and something which is effectively one's life and story.  That is really important.  Let me be clear: there is nothing in this Bill that requires people to share their story, but it empowers people to shape their own narrative going forward.</p> <p>When we look at the debates we have had in this House on mother and baby homes and the impact of gagging orders and waivers in the past, we know that when people are silenced their desire to tell their story does not disappear after two years, five years, ten years or 15 years.  They carry the damage of their story not being told all the way through their lives.  That is why the Bill is important.  It is important for individuals in terms of the damage caused but, crucially, it is necessary for society.  So many sexual abuse cases very often end up in a scenario of "he said, she said", of two narratives placed against each other.  What we have seen regarding NDAs is also "he said, she said" but with the same perpetrator.  Each individual does not have to go and battle for justice with a huge raft of evidence of a pattern of abuse not being recognised by an institution.  People are being put into a gladiatorial situation with somebody who has a pattern of abuse that is not recognised because of the use of NDAs.  That means we do not get the systemic change that we need and that institutions do not address situations of serial concern and serial abuse.  The extraordinarily impressive individuals who have aligned themselves with my colleague's Bill have done so because they have that record.  I refer to people like Julie Macfarlane, who won the Order of Canada for her work on sexual abuse, who has championed this legislation.</p> <p>In terms of society it is also important to recognise that NDAs are agreements specifically designed to pervert the course of justice.  For example, many of them say that one should not speak to the police.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why there are provisions in the Bill that specify authorities such as the Garda, mental health professionals, the Office of the Ombudsman and Revenue.  It is to ensure that the obligation that individuals have, and the desire that people have to improve society on the basis of their experience, will not be thwarted and that best practice will not be perverted for society as a whole.</p><p>Finally, it is important that we do not just support these sentiments in principle and then just tell individuals not to sign NDAs or organisations to try to employ best practice and not use NDAs.  We need to send a signal in legislation.  We need to take NDAs off the table in sexual abuse cases in order that there will be no question of them being used and that their use will not be subjected to power dynamics within any individual institution.  That is why we need to deal with this in legislation and not in any other way.</p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

It is nice to see him again.  I congratulate Senator Ruane on her work on the Bill.  To my embarrassment, it concerns an issue I was not well briefed on before the debate.  I am grateful to her for highlighting this work and advocating for this change to create a safer and more just place for everyone.  I very much welcome the debate and the Bill and I am glad to say we will support it.  It is my pleasure to support Senator Ruane in getting this legislative change.  I am proud to be a tiny cog in her wheel pushing this through.</p> <p>When I was reading the Bill and learning about it, it stirred up a great deal of anxiety in me.  We are dealing with a legacy of silence and of placing victims in what one might call purgatory.  The idea of non-disclosure agreements made me think how they were used in Ireland almost by default, through a fear of speaking up, until brave victims stood up and told their truth.  We have seen the consequences of secrecy and of moving abusers from one place to another, protecting low-lifes and creeps and putting more people at risk of abuse.</p> <p>I listened to the webinar that Senator Ruane organised and I was sad to hear about the concept of "moving the trash" raised by Professor Julie Macfarlane.  It was a new term to me.  It was coined to describe the continued protection of abusers, moving them from one organisation to the next.  Unfortunately, that is a familiar tale in this country, particularly in the context of the church.  The contributors to the webinar related deeply upsetting experiences.  We as a country should never hand abusers and employers a get-out-of-jail card.</p> <p>It is outrageous that non-disclosure agreements are used against victims to reduce their rights.  The law should always be actively weighted in favour of, not against, the victim.  It is never in the public interest to bury abuse cases.  Currently, as was noted, no legislative provisions govern NDAs or confidential clauses in settlement agreements, and the extent of the use of NDAs in Ireland in these circumstances is unknown.  Let us hope we can get to the bottom of that and lift the lid on some of what is happening.</p> <p>I fully agree that the public interest lies in ensuring that instances of harassment or discrimination in the workplace are not concealed.  As Senator Ruane rightly said, the right of a victim to negotiate his or her settlement to protect his or her privacy is important and should always be respected.  The Bill will empower the victim.  It will empower individuals to have ownership of their abuse, their life experience and the choice to give back.  That should always be in the victim's hands, irrespective of the next step.  Abuse, in whatever form it takes, is all about the destruction of an individual's power, person and agency, and non-disclosure agreements continue to take the power away from victims.</p> <p>An issue that makes me so uncomfortable relates to the fact that abuse is often classed as a trade secret and that a crime can be treated like a corporate act.  Abuse and discrimination are against the law.  This highlights another issue, in cases of sexual abuse and violence, when the victim is almost put on trial.  Every step along the way, the distribution of justice is definitely not in the victim's favour.  Thankfully, there are some ongoing reviews and reforms at the Department of Justice, so I hope that will help in that regard.  A company has no business in the matter of policing abuse or of treating it as a trade secret.  Some NDAs, as Senator Ruane noted, work to subvert the course of justice.</p> <p>The Bill will be a global template.  For a country that is still dealing with a legacy of abuse and silence, this will be one way in which it can go about getting back its good name.  Let us stand with victims and support them.  There is no place for the protection of abusers.  I very much welcome the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#DDD00300"><p>I congratulate Senator Ruane and the wider Civil Engagement Group on bringing forward the Bill.  It demonstrates a level of thoughtfulness and is an intervention that is honourable in itself and honours victims and survivors of sexual abuse who have, shamefully, been subjected to NDAs.  That is a most appalling use of an NDA and it perpetuates the abuse in a most egregious manner.  I apologise for missing Senator Ruane's contribution because it clashed with an appointment I had.  I did not mean any disrespect in not being here.</p> <p>As other Senators were speaking, I thought to myself that much of my prepared contribution will be explaining that I have never prepared an NDA for this use as a legal professional.  I apologise for what I am going to say, therefore, because it may sound as if I am trying to distance myself.  It is important in the context of the Bill to put on record that NDAs have a place and a legitimate role.  The normal circumstances in which they should happen are in the context of businesses in exploratory talks with one another, where they need to exchange information and nobody should benefit from the commercial advantage of the information exchanged.  In that context, an NDA is perfectly legitimate.</p> <p>Similarly, in the context of normal severance packages, there can be a non-disclosure element but it will generally be couched in the terms of confidentiality and non-disparagement.  Just because a confidential agreement is reached with a soon-to-be former employee, that does not mean it is necessarily sinister or that anything sinister is going on or being covered up.  In my experience of the NDAs I have written, they usually occur where a relationship has broken down to such an extent that it cannot be redeemed and, therefore, the most honourable way forward is a severance package of some sort.  Both parties will agree, and perhaps they will both litigate successfully or unsuccessfully, but the risks of litigating are not to anyone's benefit, so such agreements serve both the employee and the employer.</p> <p>In order for such an agreement to have legal force, however, it has to have been freely entered into by both parties.  There have been instances in my experience where I have held up agreements, even though there was a rush to sign and get it over with, to make people sit back and have those few days of cooling off and deciding whether this is really what they want to do and whether they in fact do not want to proceed.  As a result, they will not sign out of fear and panic but rather will get advice, especially given that the employee is invariably the more vulnerable party.  They must have the benefit of legal advice and the agreement has to contain exemptions for disclosure.</p> <p>The sheer extent of the use of NDAs that has been outlined is shocking, although I confess I have not come across such cases.  It is normal for severance agreements to have non-disparagement clauses and for an obligation of secrecy, even to the extent of the existence of the agreement in some instances, because it may set a precedent or have other consequences.  It is never envisaged, however, that in an unforeseen cause of litigation, it would be used to prevent somebody from going to the Garda.  That is an appalling abuse and an appalling twisting of legitimate business practices.</p> <p>In the context of the employment environment, a couple of issues need to be considered.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->First, the use of an NDA where there has been sexual harassment or discrimination is manifestly inappropriate and this Bill is perfect in that regard.  </p><p>Let us be clear on the obligations on employers.  They must create a safe place for people to work in and they must have policies and procedures in place that are effective.  The complainant should first be encouraged to go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Alongside that, the employment relationship has to be dealt with and that SI 146/2000 sets out how a grievance is to be dealt with.  There is nothing to preclude a perpetrator employee that is found, on the balance of probabilities, to be guilty of sexual abuse in this context from being sacked, as this is gross misconduct.  There are things like that which employers just should do.  There should be no place in law for these.  </p><p>What is horrific about this is that it is facilitating putting the blame in the wrong places.  The employer is absorbing a blame of association and facilitation, which is in itself is wrong.  If one has the misfortune to employ someone who is the perpetrator of a sexual offence, that is horribly unfortunate.  It is most unfortunate, however, for the person who is the victim of that perpetrator.  By using an NDA, one is somehow saying that the victim is to blame, the employer is to blame where it is the perpetrator that is to blame and that should be the only message.  That is where this Bill makes that very clear and apportions the responsibility and blame to the one person by exempting the use of these agreements for which it should be a criminal offence for anybody to so use.  It is shameful that any lawyer should consider and facilitate this and I am appalled by anyone who does so.  </p><p>We should write to the Law Society and Bar Council to say that it should be in the code of conduct for these not to be in place.  Well done and I thank the House.</p></speech>

The Labour Party is very happy to support this Bill.  We have spoken a great deal in recent years about believing, listening to and supporting women but that talk is hollow unless we act and legislate to fight harassment and abuse with the powers available to us as legislators.  I was struck, when thinking about the Bill during the past week, about the lack of information that we have about NDAs in this country.  By definition, there are no register or data available.  I commend Senator Ruane on the Bill but also on promoting awareness around the use of such agreements.  In some ways, we are using the phrase &ldquo;non-disclosure agreements&rdquo; here but to many of those who have been forced to sign them do not know what they are signing other than that it is a tool of silence so that the wrong that was initially perpetrated against them is reinforced again by ensuring that they never talk up.  I commend all of the efforts in the online surveys and public events to raise that general awareness.</p> <p>In essence, this Bill seeks to address that power imbalance in the worker-employer relationship.  As I have just said, in many cases this is just reinforcing the initial wrong that was perpetrated against that worker.  We know that this has taken place across almost every sector.  I think of my own time working as a SIPTU official and of some of the cases that we came to learn about and understand where there was an attempt to silence women, in particular, because of what went on.  </p> <p>I am also thinking more recently of the Irish traditional music scene where there has been the harrowing testimony of women who were assaulted and discriminated against.  They have not necessarily been subjected to the signing of NDAs but it is that culture of secrecy and the fear of what repercussions will follow if indeed people talk up.  This is very much a workers rights&rsquo; Bill in that regard and one that we are very proud to support.  </p> <p>I am also struck because the UK Government announced plans to enact such a Bill in 2019 but we have yet to see any progress in that.  Indeed, the Archbishop of Canterbury was urging members in the Church of England to cease the use of NDAs to cover up instances of racism within their own church hierarchy.  It is only through legislation and leadership among organisations that this issue can be addressed.  </p> <p>I welcome what Senator Seery Kearney said in respect of lawyers and the responsibilities they have and, in particular, the Bar Council and Law Society, to influence their members as to the use of these agreements.</p> <p>My final point is that I am particularly heartened to see that this is an amendment to the Employment Equality Act 1998 rather than just a stand-alone Bill because workplace harassment is an affront to employment equality.  In 2019, the International Labour Organization, ILO, devoted its entire convention of that year to harassment and violence in the workplace.  It identified the use of NDAs, arising from the #MeToo movement, as one of the tools used and abused by employers to try to silence people within the workplace.</p> <p>Senator Ruane or possibly Senator Higgins spoke earlier about Ireland perhaps being one of the first countries to put legislation in place.  That would be a very positive and proud achievement if we were to do that because we have not seen legislative action in other countries.  It is something, however, that is certainly needed here and I commend and support the Bill.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, is very welcome to the Chamber.</p> <p>There have been very justified, kind and positive words said by my fellow Senators about this initiative and I wish to join them in wishing this endeavour the very best.  It is an example of where politics is working.  We are, first, in a democratic republic with democratic institutions.  Second, we have an Opposition Member being true to her role as a legislator and amending the law in a very novel, needed and urgent way, ahead of the UK and others.  </p> <p>We will have disagreements on other days.  We had a motion last week sponsored by Senator Boylan who wished to change the fact that the housing assistance payment, HAP, should not be calculated as part of the disposable income of an applicant when the seeking of civil legal aid is being assessed.  That was suddenly changed.  This should feel like an empowerment of all democratic Members of this Upper House.  Occasionally, we hear it said that it is all Government business going one way.  </p> <p>This is an example where it took great ingenuity, resilience and dedication but Senator Ruane has struck a blow for a better and fairer workplace and she deserves to be commended on that.  She did so in a way which was so measured.  She opened her speech to move this motion by saying that NDAs have a place.  We are not dissing them in their entirety because these agreements and their very presence, in certain circumstances, can be a catalyst to settle a case in a full and final consent settlement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P. Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=VincentPMartin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am talking about outside the realm of this particular Bill.  Given our Constitution, litigation and court proceedings are held in public or in open court.  It may be a year before the scheduled time that a case will be ventilated - the trial of the action.  There might be a motion at an early stage for discovery.  A case can settle on the eve of the discovery motion being moved because at that stage it will have blown open into the public sphere.  The fear of publication or the odium that would follow it can often be a positive motivating factor in a way that legitimately buys silence in certain circumstances.  The measured approach taken provides an exception to this and it is not a belt-and-braces approach.  The Senator said the victim has the prerogative to say "No" and that the employee need not go along with it and may seek an exception.  There may be certain circumstances or unforeseen consequences but we have that covered.</p><p>The Bill has also covered something for which I have been campaigning for years.  It is to demystify all aspects of the law and make the workings and operations of the legal system, whether in contracts or affidavits, more accessible and understandable to the public.  The Bill, as proposed, uses simple English.  In this day and age it is not too much of an ask but I am glad it is included.  It will not be caught in the Shakespearian language of centuries ago or in legalese.  It is another good reason to welcome the Bill.</p><p>It is important to say that, for anyone who believes they are caught, the court will be the ultimate adjudicator.  I have been in cases involving a confidentiality clause when a third party is suddenly involved.  One side does not want the clause.  The other side may be petrified of disclosing or would love to disclose the detail.  A party may be only too happy to disclose but fears being sued in contract for breaching obligations and would, therefore, have to go to court.  In ultimate circumstances the court is there to protect people and people should be aware of that.</p><p>I wish to make two observations at this early reading of the Bill.  It seems there is such good statutory intent behind the Bill.  It would essentially prohibit non-disclosure agreements following an incident of workplace sexual harassment or discrimination in almost all circumstances.  I wonder whether a broader point is for another day.  This Bill is to amend pivotal employment legislation, and that is an achievement in itself.  The legislation lives and is there to be changed and reformed.  In a sense, the Senator is breathing new life into the legislation and using it as a vehicle for change and for good.  The concept is strong.  Does some similar measure have a role to play outside the workplace where it could be covering up serious crime?  That is for another day, but there are other circumstances I would be concerned about where the silence bought is of a serious criminal nature.  That silence ought not to be bought at any money.  No money should be able to buy that silence.  I am talking about outside the workplace.  This Bill is focused and pragmatic and deals with amendment to the employment legislation.  I welcome that it requires the Minister to make regulations under the Act, including for a standard form of agreement.</p><p>I will finish with that.  I am trying to work ahead.  Creative people might come up with a different name for a non-disclosure agreement.  This is so important.  They have different names and styles at the moment.  They are called confidentiality clauses in a contract and a non-disclosure agreement can be a separate rider.  The Minister has a crucial role to play in publishing guidelines.  People circumvent landlord and tenant law.  They create a licence and then suddenly they are outside the ambit of the Residential Tenancies Board.  I am concerned about that and I am flagging it at this early stage.  It will require considerable input, co-operation and expertise from the Minister.  My thanks for your indulgence, a Chathaoirligh, as I went a little over time.</p></speech>

I commend our colleague, Senator Ruane, and all the Civil Engagement Group.  They have consistently brought relevant and crucial Bills to the Chamber and this Bill certainly falls into that spectrum.  It has the full support of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party.</p><p>As a trade union official this is a problem I often came across.  We saw some horrendous practices and a great power imbalance in the workplace when we were trying to get justice for members.  In some cases they simply wanted to leave because things were so horrendous.  We could get a settlement but not before non-disclosure agreements were signed.  That is a horrible reality of working life in a minority of workplaces but the point is that it happens.  Everyone agrees it should not be happening.  I commend almost every speaker so far.  There seems to be consensus around the importance of this legislation.  I urge the Minister to give it full support not only today but at every stage.  This Bill will really make a difference for working women.</p><p>Let us be clear: non-disclosure agreements silence workers.  They stop victims of sexual harassment, discrimination or bullying at work from having their voices heard and from getting justice.  Using a non-disclosure agreement to prevent someone from speaking out, to prevent the truth from coming out or to cause any undue stress to workers in the workplace is wrong.  The practice of using NDAs to hinder, prevent or slow injustices or to keep employees in an unjust silence must end.  This Bill allows that to happen.  What is sought is transparency and openness in this area for employees.</p><p>There was an excellent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>that featured Senator Ruane.  I imagine many of us have read it.  It was shocking to read that women were paid as little as &euro;5,000 in severance after abuse and then were forever silenced by being forced to sign non-disclosure agreements.</p><p>In Britain, the Trades Union Congress said in 2019 that too many employers are using NDAs to shirk responsibility for tackling and eradicating sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at work.  Trade unions have long argued that non-disclosure agreements prevent victims of sexual harassment, discrimination or bullying at work from having their voices heard.</p><p>It is time to take action.  A report from the Women and Equalities Committee in the UK Parliament revealed that NDAs are being used routinely to cover up mistreatment at work.  That committee condemned the use of NDAs to cover up discrimination and sexual harassment and called on the UK Government to reset the parameters around the use of NDAs.  The committee report relays 45 recommendations and concerns for the Government in Britain in respect of this issue.  Unions in Britain have said that in some sectors employers insist on confidentiality clauses before discussions on virtually all settlement agreements begin.  This is another issue.  Workers are often forced to sign a NDA simply to get a job reference to make progress in their careers.  Employers are not legally obliged to provide a reference so sometimes the only way to get one is by agreeing to a restrictive confidentiality clause.  Often victims regret signing these agreements.  They are often in a difficult position after years of abuse in the workforce.  We can never tackle problems as deep-rooted as harassment and discrimination while employers are free to sweep them under the carpet.  The solutions are clear and the good news is that the Minister has a solution available to him this evening.</p><p>This is valuable legislation.  Senator Ruane has drafted it in the right area.  The Employment Equality Act is exactly the place to take this action.  I hope the Minister will give it full support and allow for swift passage through these Chambers.  The Minister has the power to do that.  There seems to be broad consensus that this Bill is one we should all get behind and one of which all of us in the Seanad could be proud.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#GGG00100"><p>Like colleagues, I welcome the Bill Senator Ruane has introduced.  I support the principle behind it and am glad the Government is not opposing it.  As has been outlined, there is a place for non-disclosure agreements.  They were originally intended to cover areas involving commercial sensitivities, trade secrets and intellectual property.  These must be protected.  That makes sense.  These agreements, however, should never be used in a way that is designed to protect the perpetrators of harassment or discrimination.  I would extend these provisions beyond sexual discrimination to discrimination on the basis of race, sexual orientation and disability.  Where there is an attempt to cover up something which, in normal circumstances, would not be permitted, non-disclosure agreements, NDAs, should not be entered into.</p> <p>We know that simply enacting this legislation will not get rid of discrimination and harassment in the workplace and in wider society but it will at least allow us to be much more aware of the problem.  We still need to have broader discussions in society and to look at training and implementing policies.  It is often great for the big companies that have HR departments which can focus on these matters, but it can be a real challenge for smaller companies that do not have a HR department.  An employer may only have a small number of workers and has to try to juggle everything.  We still need to look at a lot more investment in training so that people can understand the challenges that exist.</p> <p>This is an issue which is not only being addressed in Ireland.  In the state of Victoria in Australia, a ministerial task force was established this year with the specific objective of looking at ways in which workplaces could be made safer for women.  One of the areas being looked at is the area of non-disclosure agreements.  In Australia, much of the learning came from the experiences of institutional abuse.  There was royal commission in Australia, not dissimilar to the inquiries here, and in many cases it was found that Australian institutions got away with a great deal because they used, or misused, non-disclosure agreements.  In many jurisdictions, and particularly in many of the American states, efforts are being made to introduce similar bans on non-disclosure agreements in cases of harassment and discrimination.</p> <p>As colleagues said, this amending legislation is right.  Our approach in all of our employment legislation must be victim-centred.  We have to believe what we are being told and we have to listen to the concerns of victims.  I tried to play devil's advocate with the legislation.  I asked myself why an employer would try to agree an NDA and what would be the rationale behind that decision in these circumstances.  The overwhelming majority of employers would be aghast at the idea of sexual discrimination or harassment.  Much of it is about trying to protect the reputation of the company.  That is the fear they have.  They see a case arising and, although their concern and sympathy is for the victim, they realise that if they end up having to fight it, particularly in the public domain, a great risk to the reputation of the company arises.  </p> <p>The speed and cost of litigation are an issue.  For the most part, the whole aim of litigation is to try to reach some sort of settlement.  In many cases, employers take the view that, if it is easier to get something done quickly without trial by social media by coming to a settlement agreement, they will settle for that.  We have got to shift that culture.  We have to let employers know that, apart from the legislative perspective, it is right for them to deal with such issues in the public arena and, if cases go to court, that it will not be prohibitive for them to address the issues.</p> <p>I commend the legislation, the principle of which is correct.  There are some details which we can look at on Committee Stage.  Non-disclosure agreements were intended for specific business purposes.  They were never intended to cover up cases of harassment and discrimination.  For that reason, I am glad that the Government is not opposing the Bill.  I hope that we will take action and move on the principles behind the Bill as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The preparation of this Bill, however, has been really thorough.  So much work has gone into it that the only value I can really add is my support for Senator Ruane and the Civic Engagement Group.  I thank Seb McAteer in Senator Ruane's office, who has put a lot of work into this.  I also commend the Cathaoirleach and the Senator on the webinar.  It was great to be able to discuss something in that much detail.  It really set us up for this evening.  That can really be seen in the contributions.</p> <p>I have some experience of this issue through my circle of friends.  In my friend's situation, they became so low and the situation became so toxic that they just wanted out.  Others have reflected similar sentiments tonight.  The webinar discussion brought the international dimension to this debate.  It helped me join the dots as to the potential scale of this and to understand the global university ecosystem as it relates to the idea of passing the trash.  The issue also pertains to international companies based in Ireland, including technology companies, as was mentioned by the people the Senator had on.  It is also an issue in indigenous companies and in the community sector.  The Senator laid that out in way that affected me powerfully this evening.  It was the first sector she talked about.  It is happening.  The person I know to whom it happened was in a not-for-profit body.  This practice is happening and we have to address it.</p> <p>I am grateful that I live in the post "me too" era whenever normalised discrimination is strongly called out for what it is.  Despite this, we are here again discussing shame and judgment as barriers to fully dealing with sexual harassment, harassment and discrimination except now the reputation of the organisation is taking priority instead of the protection of potential victims.  We discussed this matter this evening.  We need to reframe what a good corporate reputation is.  We need to empower companies to understand that it is okay to value and support whistleblowers, to deal with these issues effectively and openly and to think about their long-term workplace culture before their short-term corporate reputation.  They need to address the issues head on.  They must take responsibility for what has happened and deal with it in an action-based way within their organisations instead of literally filing it away under the corporate carpet.  </p> <p>There are two wrongs here and neither belong to the victim.  Both the perpetrator and the organisation that believes that anything that happens within it has no relevance outside are in the wrong.  The victim has done nothing wrong, yet he or she can be further disempowered.  If we ask victims seeking justice in these situations why they are doing so, they say that is because they do not want it to happen to somebody else.  That these agreements would take that option away is really disturbing.</p> <p>I welcome the thought that has gone into the Bill.  The Senator said that is about the victims' choice and that it should be up to them whether they want to protect their confidentiality.  I also recognise the importance of NDAs.  I came across them a lot in my old industry, marketing.  If one is taking on an agency, one obviously has to ensure that information about marketing and trade secrets is protected.  I get that but companies should only be able to use these agreements, not abuse them, as the Senator has so effectively outlined.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This legislation relates to the Employment Equality Acts and proposes to amend them under the nine grounds of gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.205" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1632" speakername="Frances Black" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#HHH00200"><p>I commend my good friend and colleague, Senator Ruane, and her parliamentary advisor, Seb McAteer, on the incredible work they have done on this Bill.  There is no doubt that the Senator's dedication to shining a light on this troubling and highly sensitive areas has been inspiring.</p> <p>I congratulate her on the launch of this Bill with the amazing panel of experts who have long advocated against NDA abuse.  I will comment on one expert who spoke, Professor Julie Macfarlane, distinguished professor in the University of Windsor in Ontario.  She personally experienced the impact of NDAs when she discovered a secret settlement made to protect her university and former colleague after his termination for harassment and intimidation of students.  Revealing the true circumstances behind this departure led to her being successfully sued for defamation as her employer hid behind the NDA.  It is shocking to think this is going on in universities.  Can Senators imagine if it happened to their own child and they were silenced and not able to speak about it?  I know from working in the area of therapy about the impact on mental health of not being able to speak about something like that.  It is almost blaming the person for what has happened.</p> <p>I am happy to support this.  I will not speak on the technical side of the Bill.  Senators Ruane and Higgins have done that.  They have clearly and accurately laid out the intention and context of the Bill.  I will speak about the importance and significance of the Bill in empowering victims in Irish society.  Silence has fallen on the Irish people far too many times throughout history.  We have covered up some horrific truths and buried them with shame so I am delighted to see this Bill and that it is not being opposed by the Government.</p> <p>How could there be a legal basis for covering up a crime?  It is shocking, unethical and immoral.  It is not of benefit to the victim or anybody who comes in contact with the perpetrator if an employer negotiates an NDA to hide instances of abuse or bullying and then provides a glowing reference so the person is free to move on.  They are desperately failing in their duty of care.  We can never have a society where we strive to bring about justice for victims only in return for silence.  That is not justice.</p> <p>I am delighted the Minister is supporting this Bill to value the importance of protecting victims at all stages of abuse, not only to speak out but to move to a time where protecting the perpetrators is no longer an option.  NDAs serve to protect upper level executives and managers who abuse their power and do nothing to help victims.  Where a potential offence has been committed and somebody as a result is dealing with trauma and injury, it is horrific that we have a tool enshrined in law that ensures this crime will not be reported.  We have given a legal basis to silence victims in the past and protect perpetrators and their employers.  That must end.</p> <p>This Bill is important for society in general and especially for women.  It is particularly poignant in the light of the recent conversation on the mother and baby homes waivers, which is yet another horrific example of women being able to access justice where in return they never speak of the injustices they have experienced.  The Bill signifies an end to this silence and the conditional justice women have been tethered to for too long.  It breaks the traumatic silence that has harmed many victims.  I am grateful to be part of the Civil Engagement Group and a friend of Senator Ruane, proud to be here today and appreciative of the fact the Government is supporting this.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Ruane, her staff and the co-sponsors of the Bill for their work in bringing forward this important legislation.  The objectives of the Bill are laudable and, accordingly, the Government will not oppose it.</p> <p>No person should feel they have to hide their experiences, and no one should ever be put under pressure to conceal harassment or discrimination to protect an individual, an institution or a company reputation.  Victims of harassment often have an incredibly difficult time coming forward and the responsibility of an employer is to recognise where there is harassment or discrimination in their workplace and protect employees by taking steps to prevent or address this.</p> <p>Senator Ruane's Bill addresses the use of NDAs following a harassment or discrimination suit.  It is fair to say not much is known about the extent of this issue in Ireland.  Senator Seery Kearney said that in her experience in employment law she had not come across the practice.  Senator Sherlock likewise said she had not come across specific examples.  We are aware of high-profile international examples, which the sponsors of the Bill have cited as an influence on their work on the issue, of the use of non-disclosure agreements to conceal significant and long-running instances of sexual harassment and discrimination.  However, there is no research on the point in this jurisdiction.  That is why I was particularly interested to hear of the instances Senator Ruane cited of people she had engaged with.  Senator Gavan cited examples he was aware of through his trade union work.  I hope to engage further with Senator Ruane to get detail about these real-life instances so we can understand how these NDAs are being used.  It is my intention to commission a piece of research led by my Department into this phenomenon in Ireland and the circumstances in which NDAs are used in this manner.</p> <p>There are a few issues with the drafting of the Bill, which is not to take away from it as a piece of work.  The Employment Equality Acts currently do not consider the use of NDAs in the context of sexual harassment and discrimination.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This Bill will obviously introduce a new concept to legislation.</p><p>While we may wish to prevent the use of non-disclosure agreements to conceal instances of harassment or discrimination, we do not want to fetter the ability of an individual employee to negotiate his or her own settlement.  Non-disclosure agreements have a place within general employment law, a point to which a number of Senators referred.</p><p>We did have a concern that some of the Bill's provisions would appear to make non-disclosure agreements unworkable from a practical point of view.  Accordingly, we would require some careful rewording of certain provisions to ensure a balance is found which does not impinge on the individual employee.</p><p>There are also no other legislative provisions in place regarding the use of non-disclosure agreements in employment.  I understand they are commonly used for the protection of business confidentiality in settlement cases.  It is important to avoid unintended or far-reaching consequences to non-disclosure agreements in general arising from the specific purposes Senator Ruane is seeking to deal with in this Bill.</p><p>There is some degree of an information gap in this area.  However, there are also some real-life experiences of the use of non-disclosure agreements in the pernicious way as has been described.  I look forward to the research the Department will do to gather those real-life experiences and using it to shape appropriate legislation.</p><p>The Bill proposes to amend the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015, which prohibit discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment under the nine grounds of discrimination in employment, including vocational training and work experience.  The Employment Equality Acts cover a range of aspects of employment, including equal pay, access to employment, work experience, terms and conditions of employment and dismissal.  Under the Acts, where an employee feels he or she has been discriminated against under the legislation, that employee can make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.  This legislation provides important protections to employees and makes a clear statement to employers that they must provide a workplace free from harassment, sexual harassment and discrimination.</p><p>We know there are ongoing instances of discrimination.  The Workplace Relations Commission annual report for 2020 shows that in the reporting period, 939 employment equality complaint referrals were received, citing 1,260 specific grounds.  Of these complaints, 290 cited the disability ground, 278 cited the gender ground, 210 cited race and 206 cited age as at least one ground for the complaint.  These statistics show us the range of discrimination which may be taking place.  I am heartened by fact complaints are being made, however, as it shows employees are aware they have these protections and have recourse where they feel discrimination has occurred.</p><p>It is important our equality legislation be agile and responsive to the changing nature of the workplace.  As we have seen from the Covid-19 pandemic, the workplace has come to mean many different things.  It can even be as basic as your own kitchen table.  The programme for Government recognises the need to ensure our equality legislation provides the necessary support to all employees.  It contains two important commitments for possible amendment of the legislation.</p><p>The first commitment relates to the gender ground under the legislation.  It commits to amending the gender ground in equality legislation to ensure someone discriminated against on the basis of gender identity is able to avail of this legislation.  Everyone is entitled to live in their true identity and to be who they are inside and outside of work.  The Government is aiming to provide certainty to all people that the protections of the equality Acts apply to them.  Work to examine this issue is under way in line with the commitment to review the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts to ensure transgender, non-conforming and intersex people have explicit protection within the equality grounds in the national LGBTI+ inclusion strategy, the oversight committee for which I chair.</p><p>The second commitment relates to the examination of the introduction of a new ground of discrimination based on socioeconomic disadvantaged status to the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts.  This is an important commitment and reflects the growing understanding that socioeconomic status can have a wide-ranging impact on people's lives.</p><p>These commitments are central to the focus on the Equality Acts in my Department.  Any changes to the legislation, however, require careful consideration and the development of detailed proposals.  I anticipate some form of public consultation on the inclusion of socioeconomic status as a ground for discrimination will take place in the coming months to understand the experiences of those who face this discrimination.  This work will inform any plans for legislative proposals.</p><p>I hope to include any examination of the issue we are discussing today in the work on the programme for Government commitments.  I request the sponsors of this Bill to allow time to conduct any research.  This will ensure we are properly identifying and addressing this issue in a way that takes account of the policy good while not preventing an individual employee from making his or her own choices.</p><p>Equality is an ideal we are striving for but it is one which needs protection.  The Equality Acts provide that protection and, as I have noted, they need to be responsive to the changing world.  The programme for Government commitments reflect the seriousness with which the Government regards that legislation.  I am happy the Oireachtas is supporting us in identifying issues which may need to be addressed.  Once again, I thank the sponsors of this Bill for their work and for highlighting this particular concern.</p><p>As Senator Martin said earlier, it is measured legislation.  My Department would like to undertake discrete research on the real-life use of non-disclosure agreements in the way the Bill seeks to outlaw.  I have outlined several concerns about some elements of the wording.  However, I do not set out those small caveats in a negative way.  I am taken with the particularly pernicious practice the Bill seeks to outlaw.  I look forward to working with Senator Ruane and her staff in bringing out a strong legislative solution.</p></speech>

Today, we are part of history.  I thank Senator Ruane and her office for all the hard work she has done on this Bill to date.  Before I ever had the opportunity to come to this House, Senator Ruane has been a great role model to young women like myself.  I thank her and her office from the bottom of my heart for bringing this legislation forward today.  It is an issue that is not spoken about much.  I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this Bill.</p> <p>This Bill would right serious wrongs in our society.  Women in Ireland are being forced to sign non-disclosure agreements around abuse, bullying and discrimination they face in employment in order to receive severance payments.  Women in this position are being victimised twice: first, through the abuse they face while in the workplace and, later, when their power to tell their story is taken from them.  The person who engaged in the abuse or discrimination is protected by this enforced secrecy.  In Irish society, we are so used to cover-ups and moving people along.</p> <p>Under Senator Ruane's Bill, non-disclosure agreement requests by the victim of harassment or abuse to protect their confidentiality would still be legally enforceable.  It is important that women who want that protection can still have it.  No other non-disclosure agreements following cases of workplace sexual harassment or discrimination would be permitted.  Senator Ruane learned that non-disclosure agreements are not uncommon.  Non-disclosure agreements to protect sensitive commercial or legal information would not be affected by this legislation.</p> <p>When we are talking about cases of sexual harassment, non-disclosure agreements work to silence victims.  Abusers may then go on from job to job without being held accountable for their actions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Through the use of NDAs, employers are often relieved of their responsibility to hold people accountable for their actions.</p><p>Senator Ruane recently held a very powerful launch for the Bill which featured the first woman to break an NDA signed with Harvey Weinstein, a film producer who is now a convicted sex offender, as well as other women who are actively challenging the use of confidentiality clauses in the UK and the United States.  We heard about the additional trauma this silence imposed on victims of sexual harassment and discrimination, women who have already experienced trauma.  We have heard about the human cost of this enforced silence to women and other victims of abuse.  This should not be the case.  The Bill respects and supports women and other victims of abuse, bullying and discrimination by giving them back their voice.  Speakers at the launch told those in attendance that this will be Ireland's chance to be a world leader in this area.  Now it is our opportunity not to take a step in the right direction, but to take a leap in the right direction, guided by Senator Ruane and other Oireachtas Members.   It is very welcome to see the support for taking a step in the right direction in the context of employment, especially for women from different backgrounds, as Senator Ruane rightly said in her opening remarks.</p><p>While the Minister is present, I will highlight the importance of addressing the gender pay gap, which the House discussed today, in the context of employment and equality in employment.  A cohort of people are being left out and face discrimination in terms of not even being able to get jobs in workplaces, so there is a need to consider bringing in quotas going forward.  It is a conversation for another day in the context of ethnic minority groups because there are not many people from ethnic minority groups in employment in the mainstream market.  I wish to point that out again.  That is work that I and the Civil Engagement Group will be undertaking.  I thank the Minister for supporting this very important Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1674" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#KKK00200"><p>I will be brief.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me in even though I was a little late arriving.  As Senator McGreehan said on behalf of our side of the House, we will not be opposing the Bill.  Indeed, we support it.  Like other Senators, I compliment Senator Ruane, who has done a lot of work on the Bill.  Of course, Senators Black, Flynn and Higgins have given significant support to it.</p> <p>The Bill proposes the insertion of a new section into the Employment Equality Act 1998 to restrict the use of non-disclosure agreements in the context of workplace sexual harassment or discrimination.  Of course, this is an issue that needs to be addressed.  All Members accept that.  We have the responsibility, as legislators, to stamp out that type of thing.  The Minister probably clarified a few issues in his contribution.  Basically, the Bill would prohibit non-disclosure agreements following incidents of workplace sexual harassment or discrimination in almost all circumstances.  The only exceptions to the rule would be when the person who experienced harassment or discrimination requests a non-disclosure agreement to protect his or her confidentiality, or what is known as a victim's exception to a general prohibition rule.  The Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015 currently do not consider the use of NDAs in the context of sexual harassment and discrimination, so the Bill will introduce a new concept to the legislation.</p> <p>NDAs have a legitimate basis in the context of a company using them to protect commercial interests and confidentiality.  Although it is undesirable for them to be used to cover up discriminatory or illegal behaviour, if they are severely restricted, that may have the effect of limiting the possibility for employees to obtain a settlement without having to take additional and potentially costly action, such as at the Workplace Relations Commission or through the courts.  No current data exist on the use of NDAs for that purpose but they are frequently used for commercial purposes.  There are no legislative proposals governing NDAs, confidentiality clauses and settlement agreements, but there is increased sensitivity to and scrutiny of the use of NDAs and that is why it is important that we have this discussion on the Bill brought forward by Senator Ruane and her colleagues.  The current position is that for a settlement agreement to be enforceable it must be freely entered into without undue pressure or influence, the signatory must have the benefit of independent legal advice and exceptions to confidentiality should be made to allow for a range of disclosures, including to appropriate regulatory or statutory bodies or law enforcement agencies.</p> <p>Those are my observations.  I fully support what the Senator is doing.  It is important to stamp out this practice.  There is no doubt that women suffer from it more than men, but some men suffer as well.  What the Senator has done and is trying to do is important.  It is an important debate and I welcome what she is trying to do.  She might have some answers to the points I raised and, if so, good and well.  I make the points only to set out the current situation.  I fully support anything we can do to improve the situation and I genuinely believe that is what Senator Ruane is trying to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-14a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021061400002#KKK00300"><p>I thank all present for their attendance and very positive contributions.  It is a real sign that we are learning from the mistakes we have been speaking about for years in terms of people being silenced, victims not being empowered and cover-ups for perpetrators for whatever reason, whether it is reputation or because a culture has crept in.  I will try to address some of the points made.</p> <p>Senator McGreehan spoke about how the law should always weigh in favour of the victim.  That is very true but, unfortunately, it is not what has happened in Ireland and elsewhere.  Many people do not even get to access the law in any shape or form because non-disclosure agreements are being offered even at the point of making a complaint, before any internal investigation to actually find a resolution or who is at fault.  NDAs are sometimes introduced at the earliest possible point of a complaint.</p> <p>I was delighted to hear Senators Sherlock and Gavan refer to unions because the unions play such an important role on this issue because it is a workers' rights issue but, unfortunately, a culture has crept in.  While carrying out our research we encountered instances where the union representative suggested a non-disclosure agreement might be the right course of action so that the person can move on.  That shows how much it has crept into the psyche in terms of it being normal in the context of settlements.  It goes back to many of the comments regarding severance and settlements and how there may be a need for NDAs in settlements.  This is not the case.  Settlements can be made without non-disclosure agreements.  There may be a need for a confidentiality clause regarding how much was paid and such logistics but definitely not with regard to covering up a crime.   There is no legislative framework in the Bill with regard to the use of NDAs but there has to be legislation that addresses anything being done to cover up a crime.  The very principle of this is that we need to make sure we create legislation that does not facilitate the covering up of crime.</p> <p>I welcome the significant stakeholder support we have had on this issue, such as from the unions.  The more we talk about this issue, the more we will empower unions and various representatives in different sectors who want to see a change to this to have a voice and a platform to bring that about.  We are beginning to consider the issue and call it out as being wrong.  </p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney spoke about who should absorb blame.  As a victim of sexual assault outside the workplace, it is my belief that there is something collective when people share a history of trauma, in whatever way that may be.  In the months leading up to this debate, I, as a person who has experienced trauma, have had to read many instances of the use of NDAs and many case studies and I feel connected to that.  No Member of the House has suggested that any person who has had to sign an NDA should absorb the blame.  I think this Chamber has sent a good message today that those who had to sign an NDA should not absorb that blame but, rather, quite rightly, it is the perpetrator who should absorb it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It showed the power of an industry to weed out perpetrators instead of protecting their reputation so that there is not an incident in a newspaper, court hearing or on social media.  I would rather be known as the person who risked getting rid of someone who had tenure in a university and risk the lawsuit for sacking him.  I would want the reputation of standing up to that.  We should absorb the blame.</p><p>Ifeoma Ozoma co-sponsored a Bill in California.  She is an amazing woman who took a case against Pinterest about the use of a non-disclosure agreement.  When we talk about the international context, those big tech companies that she is challenging are based here and contributions today acknowledged that.  They have that culture of the misuse of non-disclosure agreements.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned going further than just sexual harassment.  The Bill goes further than that and all of the nine grounds of discrimination would be captured within it.  I am using sexual harassment and discrimination to make it understandable and accessible to the people who hear us talk about it.</p><p>Senator Currie spoke about whistleblowers and workplace culture and how she knows friends who have signed this and come to it from that personal point of view.  We have never carried out research so I welcome research.  People are afraid to speak about it.  I had to ring three people today who know that they have inspired this legislation over the last few years to tell them not to panic if, at any stage, it looks like I am going to give it away.  I will not because it is traumatising.  They feel that fear.  We have started on this research and have a small sample.  We have to find a way to carry out that research adequately because behind that silence is widespread use of non-disclosure agreements.  We need to figure out how to break past that silence and fear.  One woman said that she cannot speak and asked what if she loses her mortgage or is sued, since she could not afford to pay her bills.  Those are people's real fears.</p><p>Senator Eugene Murphy mentioned that men are affected too.  Many men have contacted us.  There was a pattern in the sample that contacted us.  They were men who were bullied in the workplace after highlighting and calling out a discrepancy in a financial issue or such and then later had to sign a non-disclosure agreement.</p><p>Senator Flynn mentioned that people are being victimised two, three, four or five times.</p></speech>
