Like many public representatives, I recognise the importance of the housing adaptation grant, the housing aid grant and the mobility aid grant for many constituents.  These grants can be, and for so many are, life-changing and they ensure many of our older population and those with a disability can continue to live in their homes in comfort, with the continued support of their loved ones.  Nevertheless, I have been getting an increasing number of worrying calls from applicants to all the grants indicating they cannot afford to proceed with these grants given the rising building costs and the current limits on the grants.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In many cases the 95% maximum of the &euro;8,000 housing aid grant is simply nowhere near what is needed to replace those ancient windows, those out of date electrics or that leaky roof.  The &euro;30,000 available under the housing adaptation grant will not ensure that a loved one can continue to live at home, supported and cared for by those who know him or her best.  I am sure I do not have to tell the Minister of State that in many cases I and other public representatives who I speak to are dealing with applicants who have no other option than to consider moving out of their homes or for a family to consider full or part-time care for their children or family members in nearby appropriate facilities.  The costs to these applicants and the State are worrying in the extreme.</p><p>I also want to raise the situation of tenants who are waiting for work to be done by their local authorities.  In many local authorities I know that a system is applied by the council with the A list being the highest priority and those who receive a C listing being the lowest priority.  In many local authorities the waiting list for those on the A priority list is growing.  I am informed that the allocations to tenant upgrades are far less than what the Government offered to private homes.  If a number of extensions are needed in local authority homes this will result in little or no other works being carried out, given the cost of the building of such extensions and the amount of funding allocated to these grants by the Government.  Many of us have asked why these are not rolling grants, which would allow local authorities to plan this work as opposed to waiting on a yearly announcement from the Department as is currently the case.  It must be difficult for councils to be waiting on word each year on how funding will be allocated in order to plan tenders and associated works, while at the same time, with growing building costs, having to return to the Department for approval for works over certain limits.</p><p>I want to thank the local authority officials who work on these apartments.  I have always appreciated their co-operation and assistance and they go above and beyond the call of duty for so many people on a daily basis.  When I raised these issues last year I was informed that the Department was carrying out a review of these grants.  I sincerely hope the Minister of State can bring us some good news today.  Building costs have dramatically increased in recent years and I am currently directing many applicants to the community welfare service to try to bridge the gap and allow as many applicants as possible to carry out the work they need to qualify for, and in so many cases, that they desperately need.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#C00200"><p>I will give a general outline and then I will come back to the Senator's specific points.  Our Department provides funding to local authorities under the suite of housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability, to assist people in private houses to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs, which also facilitates early return from hospital stays.  Our objective in this is to keep older people living at home and independently for as long as possible.  The grants include the housing adaptation grant for people with a disability, the mobility aids grant and the housing aid for older people grant, which are 80% funded by our Department, together with a 20% matching contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The detailed administration of these schemes, including assessment, approval, prioritisation and apportionment between the three schemes, is the responsibility of local authorities.  Funding of &euro;81.25 million is available nationally in 2022 for the housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability scheme.  The receipt and processing of housing grant applications has continued successfully throughout the pandemic and the carrying out of such works was specifically exempted from the construction restrictions under the public health regulations which were put in place.</p> <p>The Housing Options for our Ageing Population policy statement emphasised my Department's commitment to streamlining the application process and ensuring that grants were more accessible to applicants.  In this regard, my Department engaged with all 31 local authorities in 2019 to review the detailed administration of the grants.  My Department also engaged with key stakeholders, including the National Disability Authority, ALONE and Age Friendly Ireland, which helped to bring greater clarity to the development of a single application form and updated guidelines.  Subsequently, a revised single application form to cover the three grants, which was tested for plain English, issued to all local authorities together with revised guidelines for implementation.  My Department is working to ensure full implementation of the new process, which will make the grant application process more accessible as well as standardising the individual local authority approach.</p> <p>In addition to this improved streamlining of the grants scheme, Housing for All commits to undertaking a review of the range of housing grants available to assist with meeting specific housing needs, both for our ageing population and for people with a disability, which includes a review of the existing grant limits and income thresholds applicable to the grant schemes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This review is currently under way and it will be completed later this year.  It is important to highlight the increased allocations for 2022, which were issued earlier this week to each local authority.  The increase represents more than 8% of a national increase in allocations, continuing the overall year-on-year increases in the grants since 2014.  However, I acknowledge that construction costs have stayed ahead of this 8% figure.  This is a significant issue about which there is no doubt.  The Department is conscious of it and it will work with the local authorities to resolve it through the review process.</p><p>Again, I acknowledge the role of local authority staff.  The Senator is correct that they have been, and they continue to be, exemplary in the support they are giving to communities and to families who are trying to steer through this grant application process.  The issue of rolling grants might be included in the review and it is something I will take back to the Department as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1684" speakername="Mark Wall" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I am very much aware there is one form for the three different grants.  That has helped about which there is no doubt.  However, the problem at the moment is that I have to direct the majority of applicants with whom I am dealing to the community welfare service, which is another arm of Government, in order that they can complete their grants.  The &euro;8,000 limit is simply not good enough.  To take the &euro;30,000 limit as an example, the cheapest building costs the person could get amounted to &euro;70,000.  Yet, the grant only offers &euro;30,000.  The person is still in hospital and cannot leave.</p> <p>It is like what the Minister of State said in that we want people to return home and to live in the comfort and care of their loved ones.  That is what this is all about.  The reason I mention those grants is to see if those limits will be increased to reflect rising building costs.  I hope that is being looked at the moment.  It cannot happen quickly enough for those who need the grants.  Many of these grants are stalled at the moment because people simply cannot continue with them, because they do not have the money.  That is the problem here.  I hope the Minister of State will address this as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

This is, in itself, a testament to the success of the grant scheme.  There is significant uptake.  There is always a waiting list.  However, we have to give consideration to the rising building costs.  They are unfortunately affecting every sector of Housing for All, as well as all of our plans.  I hope the review will give consideration to all these issues and, in particular, the issue of which the Senator speaks about, namely, rolling grants.  The critical thing we are trying to achieve here is to keep older people living in their homes for as long as possible, with the support of carers and their loved ones.  That should be our ultimate goal.  That has always been the aim of this particular grant scheme.</p></speech>

I thank him for coming in to answer this matter.  I raise this matter because it has been brought to my attention by an Independent county councillor in Cork, Mr. Declan Hurley.  Much attention has been paid in recent weeks to the rising cost of living in Ireland.  We are not unique in that respect in the western hemisphere.  From cuts in excise duty to lump sum payments, the Government is engaging in a suite of measures to aid families and individuals in maintaining their standards of living in the face of inflation.  This is to be recognised and to be commended.</p> <p>One area that has proved particularly problematic is that of energy in its broadest sense, from home heating to petrol to home electricity to broadband.  Earlier this month, the once-off payment of &euro;125 to those who are in receipt of the fuel allowance was allocated.  This was a bonus to those who are feeling the pinch of rising costs in that area.  However, a key aspect of this kind of assistance is the threshold associated with it.  The cut off, which is usually based on income, decides exactly how many households can avail of it.  As important as it is to raise payments, lump sums or awards to react quickly to changing circumstances in the economy, it is equally important to examine and to appraise the threshold.  </p> <p>Many families find themselves having to pay close attention to their weekly earnings.  They are becoming wary of additional sources of income and raises as they may end up losing out on items of State assistance, resulting in a net loss of income.  While making this distinction between eligible and ineligible households is flawed, it remains the most efficient way of administering such schemes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, this only remains true if that threshold accurately reflects the reality of the experience of families in the country and is raised or lowered to maintain the balance of expenditure and need.</p><p>In light of the expenses faced by families in the area of fuel and energy, I ask the Minister for Social Protection to make the necessary arrangements with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to raise the qualifying income threshold for the fuel allowance.  The current income levels for receipt of the fuel allowance are as follows: &euro;373.30 for a single person aged under 80 years; &euro;542 for a couple where the qualified adult is aged under 66 years; and &euro;600.30 for a couple where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over.</p><p>My ask of the Government is that the fiscal examination of the effects of the inflation on fuel and heating costs take place and that this informs a raising of these income thresholds by an amount deemed proportionate to allow households with stretched budgets to avail of the support.  I ask that the Minister for Social Protection indicate whether this option is one she will investigate.  If not, what measures does she have in mind in order to further alleviate the burden of heating costs on the most vulnerable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#E00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am taking the question on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs through a combination of financial supports, energy efficiency awareness initiatives and investment in programmes to improve the energy efficiency of housing stock.  Much of the latter is being done through my own Department with regard to the local authority stock.</p> <p>On the fuel allowance payment, as part of budget 2022, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, announced a &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate of payment with immediate effect.  This brought the weekly rate up to &euro;33.  A number of expansions to the eligibility criteria for the fuel allowance payment were also announced at that time.  The weekly means threshold for the fuel allowance scheme was increased by &euro;20 to &euro;120 above the appropriate rate of contributory State pension.  This represented a 20% increase in the threshold and enables more people to qualify for this support.  With effect from the start of the next fuel season, the qualifying period for jobseekers and supplementary welfare allowance recipients to access the fuel allowance payment will be reduced from 15 months to 12 months.  The Government has, therefore, implemented significant expansions regarding the fuel allowance through budget 2022.</p> <p>Further Government measures were only recently announced to help mitigate the effects of rising energy costs caused by the war in Ukraine and wider international energy challenges.  As part of this package of measures totalling over &euro;500 million, an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to all households in receipt of the fuel allowance payment.  It is expected this additional lump sum will cost an estimated &euro;49 million in 2022.  This means low-income households will see an increase of 41% in fuel allowance support provided during this fuel allowance season compared with the previous one.  A recipient household that would have received &euro;735 in fuel season 2020-21 would see an increase of &euro;304 to &euro;1,039 in fuel allowance payments in fuel season 2021-2022.  When taken in conjunction with the electricity costs emergency benefit payment, due to be paid in April, this household would have received over &euro;500 in additional targeted Government supports over the course of this fuel season.</p> <p>The fuel allowance is not the only payment available from the Department of Social Protection to help people with their energy costs.  The household benefits package comprises the electricity or gas allowance and the free television licence.  In 2022, the estimated cost of the gas and electricity element of the package is &euro;203 million and will benefit over 476,000 households.  The gas and electricity element is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month for 12 months of the year.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Department of Social Protection operates both exceptional and urgent needs payments as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need that they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through the community welfare officers.  The provision of any further additional supports to those in receipt of the fuel allowance payment would have cost implications and could only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p> <p>It is important to note significant interventions have been made by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and across Government to try to tackle this current crisis around energy costs.  In the long term the strategy must be to deep-retrofit our homes, including both local authority stock and private housing stock.  The general incentives brought in by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for the local authority stock will, over time, make a significant impact.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, we are cognisant of the fact that the challenge remains for people now.

I appreciate his reply but it is not enough, judging by the way things are going with inflation at the moment.  While I know the green agenda means getting rid of coal eventually, the price of a bag of coal has gone up by 50% since last September and it will go up again in May with the increase in the carbon tax.  The price of 1,000 l of oil is almost &euro;1,500.  What the Government is giving at the moment is simply not enough in the context of current inflation rates.  The Government definitely needs to do more with regard to increasing the threshold for the fuel allowance.</p></speech>

That said, there is no doubt that the transition needs to be managed and that is something of which the Government is cognisant.  We are mindful of the fact that we need to support families through the crisis that has hit us all.</p> <p>The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and her Department have not been found wanting in terms of trying to ensure that supports are put in place to protect vulnerable households.  As part of budget 2022, the annual increase of &euro;5 per week in the fuel allowance had an immediate effect in bringing up the weekly rate to &euro;33.  This, coupled with the additional measures that the Minister introduced, is part of a broader suite of progressive measures that the Government is considering.  The Taoiseach was speaking about this in the D&aacute;il earlier.  We are continuing to review the situation to see what additional supports we can put in place to ensure that families can meet these challenges.  There is no doubt that this is a real challenge for Government.  Our capacity to address these issues is limited but we have been progressive to date.  We will continue to evaluate, monitor and support people in whatever ways we can.</p></speech>

A year ago I tabled a similar matter and the Minister of State was also kind enough to respond on that occasion.</p> <p>I am seeking an update from the Department of Education on the status of two school building projects in Ballinasloe in the context of capacity for children at primary level.  I am referring to Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa, with which the Minister of State is familiar and also to the site acquisition for St. Teresa's Special School.  The Minister of State has visited St. Teresa's Special School and is familiar with its location in Ballinasloe.  I am seeking a response today on the status of these projects.</p> <p>Since raising the project at Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa last year, there has been very positive engagement between the design team, the school's board of management, the principal, Ms Christine Connor, and Galway County Council.  There were challenges related to access roads for the new school building and Galway County Council was to engage with the Department of Education to reach an agreement on how this would be managed going forward.  The design team also had to add three additional classrooms to the plans, which have now gone back to the Department for review.</p> <p>We need to move this on.  I want to see this school building included in the Department's capital infrastructure plans for this year, as a priority project.  We need to move this along so that it can be considered in June or July for the 2023 budget.  Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa caters for close to 300 children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The children have to cross roads to get to the school, which was created in 1996.  We are all aware of this.  The families have gone through the school.  There are parents - mums and dads - who were promised a school and who now have their own children going to the school.  I would appreciate any update the Minister of State can give me on the issue.</p><p>Second, I am asking about the site acquisition for St. Teresa's Special School, which is dedicated to the education of children with moderate, severe and profound special needs and autism.  We are very fortunate to have the school.  The 11 students have now increased to 36.  In the past week we have also seen an announcement for two extra classrooms for additional accommodation, which was very welcome, because the children there were in the canteen.  They now have a space.  I got to visit it last week with the Minister of State and the principal, Anita O'Reilly, and it was phenomenal to see the space that is there for children.  As well as that, the Minister of State will be delighted to know that they held their own St. Patrick's Day parade a day before St. Patrick's Day.  All the children came out festooned with decorations and were walking or in wheelchairs with their carers.  It was pure joy for families and children in that school.  We need to deliver a proper school and adequate space for the children.  The Department of Education indicated that a 4-acre site had been secured with the HSE.  Could I request an update on what stage this is at?  Has the property been secured and is the process finalised?  Is it at stage 1 preliminary design or has it moved to stage 2 design?  Who is the contact for the board of management and the principal in the school?</p><p>I appreciate the Minister of State's time and her consideration of these questions.  I acknowledge the work of the board of management with the special educational needs organisers, SENOs, who put forward the case to justify the need for the space in Ballinasloe.  We want to welcome and support families coming to our area from Ukraine in our schools but how are we going to do that when we cannot even accommodate the children who are there at the moment?  The schools are already over capacity.</p></speech>

It is a major building project that is planned for Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa, and there is also the major building project for St Teresa's Special School.  I will deal with Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa first.</p> <p>As the Senator is aware, it is included in the Department's construction programme, which is being delivered under the national development plan.  The brief is to provide for the demolition of the existing school building and the construction of a new school building to include 16 general classrooms, with 13 special resource rooms, two speech and language resource rooms and a two-room special educational needs, SEN, unit.  Senator Dolan mentioned that there has been considerable delay.  I agree that has been the case.  There has been back and forth between the local authority and many different stakeholders regarding the matter, which has been less than satisfactory.  However, some of the questions were legitimate and had to be answered.  I note that there is a review of the specifications for the provision of the extra three classrooms currently with the Department.  Once the review is complete, comments will issue to the board of management and its design team in order that we can bring the project forward.  It is unfortunate sometimes that with the best will in the world these things can be delayed.  It is going to take everybody to come together to try to resolve all of the issues.</p> <p>The Department is in communication with the school authorities and its design team and is committed to assisting the school in every way it possibly can.  We want to make sure that children have access to a proper building in order that they can learn the various curriculums they need to learn in a satisfactory way.  I understand that the design team has been asked to review all of the plans it has been given.  Until planning permission is secured, it will not be possible to give a timeline for the project proceeding to tender stage.  The planning and building unit is under the remit of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, but she will be aware of the fact that this issue has been raised in the Seanad today.  The Department will be aware that Senator Dolan has tabled this matter for discussion in a Commencement debate.  That will concentrate minds in terms of delivering on this project.</p> <p>I visited St. Teresa's Special School with Senator Dolan.  It is a wonderful school environment with a wonderful principal in Anita O'Reilly and her incredible team.  It was a very special day when we were able to announce the fact that the school would be moving.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Josepha Madigan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will be a brand new, eight classroom special school with significant ancillary accommodation on a greenfield site.  At the moment it is providing for 36 pupils.  It will probably be in a position to expand.  At present it is in temporary accommodation in two temporary classrooms to deal with immediate needs.  The Department is in communication with school authorities around the appointment of a design team and a progression of the project into architectural planning.  I understand it is at an advanced stage of the conveyancing process, which is positive.  It is moving, albeit that it sounds slowly, but there is always a process when talking about conveyancing.  The i's need to be dotted and the t's crossed.  It is happening incrementally.  As Minister of State with responsibility for special education I have asked the building and planning unit to make sure that this is expedited as soon as possible because obviously our children with additional needs who are most vulnerable are in less than satisfactory conditions at the moment and we want to make sure that they are rehoused in a more satisfactory way.</p></speech>

I know there are always reasons for these delays but it is so frustrating because, what do we say to these parents?  What do we say to these children when it goes on year after year?  What I would ask is that the Department with the design team, having worked with Galway County Council - and again to acknowledge there has been very positive engagement over the past 12 months - submit the application for planning.  As the Minister of State said, until it goes through to planning, until we get the statutory approvals through planning permission from Galway County Council, we cannot move to the next stage.  I want to see that happen.  That has to happen.  Last year I believed that was going to happen in April or June.  I thought we would be at a different stage right now with this school.</p> <p>I understand there has been accommodation for extra students and all of this has to happen.  However, I am asking for the Department to prioritise this project in particular, that we would support them every step of the way, be it supporting the board of management and the design team which is engaging proactively with Galway County Council.  Meetings have been set up on this issue.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for the information on St. Teresa's Special School.  It is absolutely crucial that we see that project move and I understand that it is now at stage 2, the design stage.  Is that correct?  The lands comprising a 4-acre site have been transferred from the HSE to the Department of Education.</p></speech>

As I said I am doing all I can to make sure that is expedited because they are children with additional needs.  I know the school, the incredible team and staff there and indeed the children.  It was wonderful to hear about their St. Patrick's Day festival.  I hope that will be expedited as soon as possible.</p> <p>In regard to Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa, Galway County Council has had issues with the planning permission but both sides need to resolve the conditions there.  The most important aspect of this is communication and that there is ongoing engagement and collaboration to move it forward so that they can get planning permission as soon as possible.  There were a number of delays due to the Department having a new team of engineers.  For example, there were requests from the local authorities and there were access and planning issues.  I think the majority of those have been resolved so now it is a matter of the Department communicating with the school authorities and the design team, and committing to assist the school in every way it possibly can.  We are trying to oversee that as best we can.</p></speech>

I am sure that, like me, he agrees that for our researchers it is essential that there is a very strong and clear career path for them and that as part of that, their pension entitlements are clarified and indeed that they are entitled to pensions.  One of the things that we have invested a great deal of time in recently is around enhancing the research capacity of the technological sector.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Unfortunately, we still do not have a resolution on the pension entitlements of those researchers working in the technological sector.  The Minister of State will be aware of the impact on the former Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, as part of the new Shannon university, of not getting clarity on the pension issues for research there and the concern that is causing.</p><p>If a person is to be employed as a researcher in one of the traditional universities as opposed to the new technological universities, he or she is treated in broadly the same way.  The same terms and conditions apply across the board with perhaps one significant exception relating to pension entitlements.  The pension entitlements of those in the traditional universities, for the most part, have been clarified.  It is clear they are treated as public servants for pensionable purposes.  Those in the technological university sector are not.  Those in other State agencies, such as the Marine Institute or Teagasc, are treated in the same way as the traditional universities for pensionable purposes.  </p><p>There is an equity question with respect to researchers.  There is also the question of allowing our technological universities in a very competitive market to be able to build their research capacity.  They must be able to ensure their research staff are treated in the exactly the same way.  I understand, because of some of the historical questions, why this issue has not been resolved until now but this has been on the desk of the current Department and the previous Department, the Department of Education and Skills, for quite a number of years.  There have been individual queries and the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, has raised this on a regular basis.  I do not know why it cannot be solved.</p><p>Even in situations where those researchers are funded by some of our State agencies, if they receive their funding from Science Foundation Ireland, the Irish Research Council or the Health Research Board, part of the funding or grant allocation includes allowing for pension coverage.  This is a question of equity and of allowing higher education institutions to be able to compete on a level playing field in respect of researchers but, most importantly, it is about giving those researchers who have been impacted some level of certainty.  THEA has estimated that approximately 450 people are impacted by this.  This issue has been doing the rounds for years.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could give us some clarity and certainty with regard to the final decision that will be made on these pension entitlements.</p></speech>

The question relates to the fact that researcher grades such as postdoctoral researchers, for example, have access to public service pensions in some higher education institutions but this access is not universal across the sector.  My Department is currently working to support that standardisation of researchers&rsquo; pensions access in the higher education sector and has been engaging with the management bodies in the higher education institutes affected on the issue for some time.</p> <p>Researchers in the institutes of technology and technological university sector do not have access to public service pension schemes.  Researcher grades in traditional universities and other public sector bodies do have access to these schemes, as the Senator outlined.</p> <p>My Department has been engaging positively with the management bodies in the higher education sector, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Education to establish the requirements of a business case to support access to the single public service pension scheme for this group.  Significant data have been sought by my Department in order to make a comprehensive and supportive case to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which will made a final determination in this case.  Most recently, further engagement with the sector took place with a view to establishing forecast data for future researcher numbers in the institutes of technology and the technological universities.  These data will be incorporated into the overall business case, which is advancing well at this stage, and I expect it to be finalised shortly.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Niall Collins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2205"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2205&amp;amp;pid=NiallCollins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The enablement of greater research capacity in the technological sector is a key factor in the technological university agenda, as Senators will know, along with other critical issues my Department is working on, such as the OECD review of academic contracts.</p><p>The Technological University Act was enacted in 2018.  Since then, we have seen huge growth in the sector.  We are soon to have five technological universities with the establishment of Atlantic Technological University on 1 April.  That will followed soon after by the establishment of South East Technological University on 1 May 2022, about which Senator Malcolm Byrne knows very much.</p><p>Previously, the focus of the former institutes of technology was on teaching and regional engagement.  The need for research in the sector is now more prominent.  The Technological Universities Research Network, TURN, report was published in 2019.  The report made 12 recommendations that will provide the technological universities with a solid foundation for their development.  These recommendations fall within three thematic areas that the report has identified as being key building blocks for successful technological universities.  One of these thematic areas relates to building research capacity.  The report identified that research capacity would be enhanced through increased funding in human capital development, such as staff development and recruitment among other areas, for human capital growth.  I am satisfied that this will be key in achieving strategic objectives for the sector under the Technological Universities Act 2018.  The business case that my Department is working on will support this development.</p></speech>

There is very little I would disagree with, except that the answer that has been prepared for him does not respond directly to my question other than to say that his Department is continuing to work on this matter and that there will be an answer shortly.  The researchers who are impacted by this situation are concerned because many of them have heard that the issue will be resolved shortly for quite a long time.  The institutions that are impacted also have a difficulty.  The Minister of State will be very familiar with one of them because it is on his doorstep.  To localise this matter, what is happening means that the University of Limerick, UL, and Shannon can offer researcher posts with the same job description.  However, UL can provide certain guarantees regarding pension entitlements for the researcher that Shannon cannot.  That is unfair, and the situation is replicated right across the country.  The Minister of State indicated that the matter will be resolved shortly, but a timeframe would be very much appreciated.</p></speech>

The Department and I fully get that pension entitlements are fundamental to people taking up jobs.

Today, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, announced a series of welcome reforms to the leaving certificate.  I ask for a debate on those reforms in the very near future, which I am sure can be facilitated.  I particularly welcome the introduction of two new subjects, one in the area of drama, film and theatre studies, and the second in the area of climate action and sustainable development.  The latter subject is the critical global issue of our time and many students will be interested in it.  The greater emphasis that will be placed on the arts in our school system is also welcome.  The introduction of a new subject in the form of drama, film and theatre is very welcome.</p> <p>Any passenger who has travelled through Dublin Airport recently, and I know several, will have complained of the long delays at security.  These are not just long but completely unacceptable delays.  When people ask if they turn up two hours in advance of their flights, and short-haul flights at that, whether they will be guaranteed to get through security and catch those flights, and Dublin Airport authorities cannot guarantee it, that is not acceptable.  In a progressive country such as ours, to send out a message that Dublin Airport is incapable of ensuring there is a sufficient number of security staff to be able to process the large number of passengers that can be expected is just not acceptable.  We know we are coming towards the Easter holidays when we will see an increase in the numbers and will be moving into the much busier summer season.  I ask the Acting Leader to raise this with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, as a matter of urgency, and that he receives guarantees from the authorities at Dublin Airport that they can ensure passengers who are there do not have to wait an unreasonable length of time to go through security.</p> <p>I will raise the matter of the census.  I encourage everyone to fill it in this coming weekend.  I ask that we consider, for the next census in 2026 and beyond, moving it onto blockchain, and that we look at having a dynamic blockchain-enabled census and new ways for the State to gather and utilise data.</p> <p>In addition, I wish all the census enumerators the very best of luck as they knock on doors and try to gather census forms.  I am aware of a small minority of muppets who are trying to cite some nonsense that the census does not apply to them.  One of the things we need to remember in this State is that we have many rights as citizens, but we also have responsibilities.  It is an individual's responsibility to fill in his or her census form.  I ask that we stand in solidarity with those small number of census enumerators who have received abuse on the doorsteps and that the full rigours of the law will be faced by those who refuse to fill in their census forms.</p></speech>

I was education spokesperson in the previous Seanad and have a keen interest in the area.  I support Senator Malcolm Byrne's call.</p> <p>The main reason I rise is to raise a matter relating to the Revenue Commissioners.  I have been inundated with calls from people who cannot get through to Revenue.  There is a helpline open.  Revenue closed its offices to the public at the start of the pandemic in March 2020 and its offices are still not open for in-person meetings.  Every other public and private sector organisation is open.  It is fine going online but it is not everybody's cup of tea to manage their affairs online.  Some people find that if they have a technical issue, they are not able to resolve it through the online service.</p> <p>I visited the office of the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin today.  I visited the office in Limerick on Friday.  Neither of the offices was open.  Revenue is taking calls in the morning but trying to get an appointment online or a place in the queue is very difficult.  It is a difficult situation.  It is not easy for older people or for people in general.  I am looking for the support of this House.  We should write to Revenue and call on it to go back to in-person meetings.  This has happened in every other private and public sector organisation.  It is time for Revenue to reopen its doors.</p></speech>

Today is the day of his funeral.  He was educated at St. Conleth's College, approximately a mile from the House.  He discharged his function has a journalist with great bravery until he was murdered by Russian soldiers as part of Vladimir Putin's murderous, illegal and criminal invasion of Ukraine.  It is important this House notes the occasion.  An Irish citizen was murdered by the Russians.  We should never forget who was responsible for this and who took the decision to unleash that savagery on the people of Ukraine.  To all of Mr. Zakrzewki's friends in Ireland, I express my deepest sympathy and condolence.</p> <p>I raise the need for a debate in this House on the provision of private rented dwellings.  A foolish decision was made last year when it was decided that all tenancies which last more than six months should become tenancy contracts of indefinite duration.  This came from a Department that is blighted by making stupid decisions.  The same Department wiped out bedsits with a four-year delayed proposal when then Minister, former Deputy John Gormley, was in charge.  That was a so-called reform in the interests of improving the standards of tenancy accommodation.  We now have shared accommodation, which reverses the entire thrust of that initiative.</p> <p>The point I want to make is that if anyone wants to know why private landlords are now deserting the rental market in droves, it is because we have stupidly and at the behest of the same Department introduced a law to the effect that all tenancies which last more than six months cannot be terminated except on one of four statutory grounds.  The consequence of that is that people who simply wanted to let a house for five years with no questions asked and no reasons given, one way or another, cannot do so anymore.  They must have one of the statutory grounds for evicting their tenant in the long run, whether their relationship with the tenant is good or bad, or antagonistic, no matter whose fault the antagonism is.  Those landlords are stuck with those tenants forever unless one of the four statutory grounds exists.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I am not a slave to market ideology, but we intervene in markets at our peril.  We did this with bedsits and we saw the consequences when 10,000 to 15,000 dwellings for the most vulnerable of people were annihilated.  Now, we are doing the same again.  We are driving private landlords out on the presupposition that they are all in the same category as real estate investment trusts investing billions of euro in Ireland and that they can take tenancies of unlimited duration in their stride.  They will not.  As a consequence, a very serious mistake has been made.  I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister to come back to the House to explain why it is necessary to have contracts of indefinite duration and what the consequences of that have been for the supply of private rented dwellings owned by private landlords.</p></speech>

The theme is dismantling Israeli apartheid and developing Ireland's strategy.  The keynote speaker was Michael Lynk, who is the UN special rapporteur on human rights for the occupied territories.  He has written six reports and he was absolutely clear today that Israel is an apartheid state.  In making that statement, he joined not only Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch but 450 human rights organisations across the world.  He set out very clearly the legal case proving the statement to be true.  As part of his presentation, he shared some quotes from Israeli politicians.  I thought it would be good to share them with colleagues here today.  I will start with the current Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett.  He says: "I oppose a Palestinian state, and I am making it impossible to conduct diplomatic negotiations that might lead to a Palestinian state."  Israel's current Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yair Lapid, is due to take over as Prime Minister in 18 months.  This is an interesting quote from him: "My principle says maximum Jews on maximum land with maximum security and with minimum Palestinians".  That is pretty clear, is it not?  I should not even need to bother with this quote from Benjamin Netanyahu.</p></speech>

I will not divide Jerusalem, I will not evacuate any [settlements] </blockquote> <p>The one disappointing part of the engagement with Sadaka today was the fact that every political party was invited to send representatives.  Just two parties did not bother.  It will not surprise anyone to learn those two parties were Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  I commend Senator Martin, who did attend and spoke very ably on the issue.  I want to say very directly to the Acting Leader that both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are standing on the wrong side of history when it comes to this issue.  Thanks to Senator Black, we have the occupied territories Bill.  It needs to be passed because otherwise the record will show that this Government did not take the steps required to challenge apartheid as it exists today.</p><p>One of the other things Michael Lynk said was that, when looked at in detail, apartheid as applied in Israel is much worse than the apartheid regime in South Africa.  For example, in South Africa they did not say only these people could walk on particular roads but they do that in occupied Palestine.  I appeal to the Deputy Leader for a further discussion on this issue.  I would also like an explanation as to why neither Fianna F&aacute;il nor Fine Gael bothered to send a representative to that conference today.  It was appalling and it went down like a lead balloon.  It is time we all took a stand for justice.  We should remember how we tackled apartheid in South Africa back in the 1980s.  We came together to apply sanctions.  We have a route to do that via the occupied territories Bill and we should do it.  There are no excuses for the Government not to act on this issue.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of talk in the past number of weeks about our Defence Forces and what future they should or might have within Europe and on the world stage.  The desperate and unjustified attack by Russia on the sovereign state of Ukraine has concentrated many minds on this subject.  I read yesterday that Cabinet is discussing increasing our defence budget to &euro;2 billion from the current expenditure of approximately &euro;1 billion.  In any conversation about the future of our Defence Forces, serving members and their representative associations must be to the forefront.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A number of public representatives have called for those representative associations to be allowed to affiliate to ICTU and many of us have been doing so for a number of years.  Indeed, the recent report by the Commission on the Defence Forces recommended such an affiliation.  The Minister could immediately allow the Permanent Defence Force Other Rank Representatives Association, PDFORRA, and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, to affiliate and to position themselves for forthcoming public pay talks.  I appreciate that a debate on this issue has previously been requested.  I chaired a Commencement matter in the House recently in response to which the Minister indicated he would return to the House for a discussion on the report on the future of the Defence Forces.  It is beyond time that debate took place and I ask the Acting Leader to request that debate as soon as possible.</p><p>Separately, I welcome a report published yesterday by Kildare County Council entitled Local Just Transition Plan for West Kildare and recognise the importance of it to so many people who live in that part of my home county.  The plan sets out to identify projects to support and advance sustainable social, economic and environmental development in the transition to a low carbon future in west County Kildare.  Given the historical dependence of this region of Kildare on Bord na M&oacute;na and given the many great bogs in the area, this report and the way in which its recommendations will be supported and implemented will be crucial to all those who live there.  The economic and social indices of this region need the urgent supports outlined the report.  I look forward to working with Kildare County Council and the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly on the needs of this region.  The many great communities of west County Kildare, including Kilberry, Kildangan, Monasterevin, Rathangan, Ballyteigh, Milltown and Carbury, need the support of this report.  They need investment urgently and I look forward to working with the House and Kildare County Council in that regard.</p><p>Finally, I again raise the issue of secretarial pay.  The Acting Leader, as a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, has spoken about this previously.  We had a debate in the House a number of months ago about the urgent need to justify the pay of our secretarial assistants.  I have not heard much recently, other than having read about it in national newspapers.  Will the Acting Leader or the Cathaoirleach update us on the issue?</p></speech>

It was hosted by Sadaka, the Ireland Palestine Alliance.  As my colleague, Senator Gavan, said, Michael Lynk, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Palestine, presented some stark findings from his latest and final report on Palestine.  His assessment is damning.  He concludes, in agreement with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other organisations, that Israel is an apartheid state subjugating the Palestinian people and denying them dignity and the right to self-determination.</p> <p>Crucial to this assessment is Israel's construction of 300 illegal, Jewish-only settlements in occupied-territory housing for more than 700,000 people.  Not only does this expose Palestinians to daily acts of violence from settler extremists, who represent the most radicalised section of Israeli society, but it precludes the formation of any spatially and demographically coherent Palestinian state, which is a key part of the peace process.  For the Palestinians living under Israeli apartheid, life is fraught with physical violence and state oppression.  Checkpoints are erected in a random and arbitrary fashion, which impedes Palestinians&rsquo; movement and leaves them subject to aggressive colonial policing by Israel Defense Forces, IDF, soldiers.  Israeli citizens, including settlers in the occupied territories, enjoy the protection of a civil court system, with fair procedures for those accused of a crime; Palestinians are subject to an alternative justice system comprising military tribunals, with a 99% conviction rate.</p> <p>For the Palestinians living in Gaza, conditions are even worse.  Israel restricts the entry of food and the supply of electricity and medicine.  The former UK Prime Minister David Cameron, hardly a radical, has described Gaza as an open-air prison.  Indeed, it is an open-air prison that is periodically carpet-bombed by the Israeli military in an unjustifiable, disproportionate response to rocket fire from Palestinian militants.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I believe they call it "mowing the lawn", and that is in an open-air prison.  That is what they are doing.  It is half the size of County Louth and what is happening is horrendous.</p><p>It is not only Amnesty International but Human Rights Watch and the UN special rapporteur also used the term "apartheid", as did a former Shin Bet director, Ami Ayalon, a former Attorney General of Israel, Michael Ben-Yair, former Secretary General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, and, most importantly, people who have lived through and defeated apartheid in South Africa, including, the Nobel laureate, Desmond Tutu, and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor.  In diplomacy and international law, language matters.  If a Member of the Oireachtas referred to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a "skirmish", we would rightly rebuke him or her for failing to capture the gravity and magnitude of the crimes being committed.  We cannot be coy about this.  I feel frustrated, as the Deputy Leader can imagine, and I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, come in and discuss these findings by Michael Lynk.  I am happy to hear that the Minister will be meeting Michael Lynk tomorrow, but I would like it if a representative from Fianna F&aacute;il would also meet him.  I call on somebody from Fianna F&aacute;il to have a meeting with Michael Lynk in order to hear about his report.</p></speech>

With the collapse of the aviation sector during the pandemic, we all accepted that there would be some recovery time needed but what passengers at Dublin Airport experienced last weekend was unacceptable.  I appreciate that the Dublin Airport Authority is taking necessary steps in hiring and training the necessary staff but it is unbelievable that we have airlines asking passengers to come to the airport three and a half hours before their appointed departure times, even for short-haul European flights.  Something has gone dramatically wrong.  I ask that the Minister would come to the House to provide an update on the situation.  I encourage people to use Cork Airport as a means of flying to Europe and the United Kingdom because it is a passenger-friendly facility and the queues there are much smaller than those at Dublin Airport.  Notwithstanding that, it is important that the Minister come to the House.</p> <p>I ask that the Minister for Education would also come to the House to debate leaving certificate reform.  All of us who have been involved in education, as the Acting Chairman has, welcome the changes announced today.  We welcome the fact that the written examination will be worth no more than 60% of a student's exam results at the end and the fact that some students will be able to sit a particular exam in fifth year.  The initiation of change is one part but clarity, engagement, consultation and delivery of the final piece of the leaving certificate reform are why the Minister should come to the House.  I ask the Acting Chairman and the Deputy Leader to ask her to come to the House as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

We will never know the true extent of the efforts of volunteers around the country but they are at work everywhere and I thank all of them.  We are sorely aware, however, that injustice and suffering continue the world over.  In Afghanistan last week, the Taliban reneged on a promise to allow girls to attend secondary school, with thousands of girls turned away from school gates.  One girl, who spoke to the Afghan news outlet TOLOnews, burst into tears as she described being "turned away after waiting 186 days - she had counted - for school to resume.  She asked: "What is our crime?  That we are girls?"</p> <p>On the other side of the world, a so-called liberal democracy shows similar signs of authoritarian leanings.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau received a wake-up call in the European Parliament last week when he addressed it on the topic of growing threats to democracy and failed to count himself among those threats.  Last month, I spoke about Mr. Trudeau being the first Prime Minister in Canada's history to invoke the powers of the Emergencies Act, which were used to violently quell a legitimate protest.  At the European Parliament session, it was stated that the world had watched how, under the quasi-liberal boot of Trudeau, women were trampled underfoot by horses and how the bank accounts of single parents were frozen so they could not pay for their children's education and medicine, for utilities or make mortgage repayments.  I received, as I am sure many colleagues have, correspondence from an Irish citizen living in Canada.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This one is from Paraic, who is originally from Connemara.  It states:</p><blockquote>	I cannot board a plane in Canada to fly to Ireland because I am not vaccinated.  The Government of Canada has set a mandate that states that no unvaccinated person shall board a plane, train or bus, whether to travel domestically or internationally.  I believe it is the only country in the western world that has imposed this sanction on the unvaccinated population.  Although I was able to be medically exempt from this by my doctor because of a PCR test, the parameters that the Canadian Federal Government set out to the no-travel rule does not allow me, and likely does not include most people.  The Canadian Government has set the following terms as to what is not an emergency and urgent travel.  These are: travel to visit family, attending weddings, funerals and attending to personal matters, such as buying a house, seeing or caring or sick family members, discretionary travel, such as for a vacation or recreation and situations where activity can be held virtually. </blockquote><p>These are our citizens who are locked up in another country and who cannot travel back to their own native homes.  This requires immediate intervention by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  I ask the Acting Chair to bear with me as I am nearly finished.  </p></speech>

The two big main players in this country at the moment are the ESB and Coillte.  We should know their plans going forward.  This behoves the Minister to come into the House to outline that to us.</p> <p>The other issue I would like to raise is on the tariffs that are being paid to domestic customers.  I feel that that tariff should be raised.  This is because the ESB is enjoying free electricity from people who are putting some energy into the network and no tariff is being paid at the moment.  They have raised the price of the charges that they are charging for the ESB.  The gas companies have, too.  Yet, the tariff does not seem to have gone up.  The tariff that has been set, or that has been proposed to be set by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is 10 cent per unit.  That tariff should be raised.  It should be paid to the domestic customers immediately, because they are supplying into the grid as it is.  </p> <p>I would also like to raise the issue of battery packs.  There is some ambiguity about whether you need a battery when you have a smart meter.  Some people are saying you do need a battery.  We need the Minister to come in here as a matter of urgency to deal with all of those issues.  We are in a great position here to produce energy.  We will have long days from now until September.  The domestic input can be quite sizable, as well as the main production, whether it is onshore or offshore, or whether it is the ESB or Coillte, or the ESB and Coillte working hand in hand to produce a resource that we have in abundance in this country.   We should be tackling this on all fronts.  </p></speech>

Nobody has ever accused pensions of being sexy, but there is the reality in the demographics in Ireland and in the changes in the population that mean that we have to prepare for a pensions crisis that is coming down the road.  It is entirely appropriate therefore that the Government would put this scheme in place.  I welcome the fact that employees will benefit both from contributions from their employers and from the State.  It is perhaps the most effective way that we can prepare people for retirement and we can prepare the State coffers to deal with the fact there will be a huge number of people who will be pensioners and who will essentially be paid for by people who are working.</p> <p>The question I have, and this is why I think we should ask the Minister to come into the House for a debate on this, is on how this will function for self-employed persons.  People who are self-employed do not have the benefit of an employer paying into their pension.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is no auto-enrolment for them and yet we have said so many times self-employed people are the backbone of the economy.  They are the backbone of employment within this economy.  Small businesses and people who take the initiative to set up businesses and take on the burden, risk and responsibility of being an employer will apparently not benefit from this auto-enrolment scheme.  May we therefore have a debate whereby we talk about how this scheme is also going to work for small business owners, self-employed persons and sole traders?  How is it going to work for them?  What is the State going to contribute to their pensions so they are not left behind when the time comes?</p></speech>

As the Acting Leader may know, the new four-month deferral policy is now in effect but it seems that, contrary to assurances from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service during a Newstalk interview on 22 December of last year, the service has suddenly decided to continue to include oral sex between men as grounds for deferral.  Women who have had sex with bisexual men will also continue to be deferred for four months instead of the previous 12 but again, the man in this scenario may be free to donate during that period while the woman is prevented from doing so.  No explanation has really been given for these and saying it aloud it all seems a little topsy-turvy and does not follow logical sense.</p> <p>Due to a freedom of information request from a member of the public, my understanding is the initial plan was to move to a three-month deferral for gay and bisexual men.  However, during one of the meetings, one of the attendees suggested a four-month deferral and it seems this was just accepted.  No scientific or other kind of basis for this suggestion was given during the meeting, beyond simply that France was implementing a four-month deferral at the time.  In the meantime, Ireland was importing blood from England despite the latter never having a four-month deferral.  It has instead moved from 12 months to three months and is now at an individualised assessment for all donors.  It seems this four-month period was plucked out of thin air to mimic France and even France has moved away from it.  It seems every piece of evidence shows this new deferral policy has zero basis in science or medicine and is instead purely ideological.  That is no way to run a national blood service, especially when the scientific alternative, namely, individualised risk assessment for all donors, is available and easily implementable.  It is in use in Northern Ireland and Britain, from which we are currently importing blood.  They do not have this deferral system.</p> <p>This is not the first time the issue of blood donation has been raised in the House.  It is not good enough we are running our blood donation service based not on scientific reasoning but instead on a seemingly ideological basis.  I wanted to raise it in the House because doing the above is not good enough.  Blood is a vital service.  It literally saves lives.  Our blood service still seems to be using this unscientific method despite assurances year after year and I believed, from the programme for Government, that this was going to change.</p></speech>

Since last September, the industry has seen huge losses on a continuing basis.  I was talking to pig producers in Barryroe on Friday evening.  They have been losing up to &euro;50 per pig on a continuous basis since last September.  These are multimillion euro losses.  It is affecting both the milling companies and the manufacturing of the product itself at the other end.  It is a high-input product where a low value is put on the meat itself at the end of the process, which is disappointing.  The real issue is that this is our third biggest sale of product going out of Ireland from the agricultural industry.  It is third behind milk and beef.</p> <p>It is a very important entity in west Cork, in particular.  We have Staunton Foods and we have 40 pig farmers there.  That is 40 families attached to this industry for decades.  They do it to the very best of their ability and are renowned throughout the world for what they do.  This industry is on the brink at the moment.  Unless we have really significant investment by the Government, we could lose our pig industry, which is one of our most important entities.  We are looking at a scenario where the cost of feed has gone up by 90% since last September.  The costs of energy and transportation have increased dramatically.  We are looking at 10,000 jobs and &euro;1.8 billion in sales to the economy.  We could lose one of our real prime cuts, which is what our pork and pig industry means to our economy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Unless we step into the market now and support it, we will lose these people.  Just today I was told by pig farmers protesting outside Leinster House that they will have to stop breeding their next lot of young pigs.  If farmers start culling sows now, as is being proposed at the moment, they will not have the breeding stock to bounce back when the market returns.  In that situation, we will lose vast numbers of pig farmers.  They are literally going into liquidation.  It is appropriate for this House to have a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine as soon as possible because we are facing a scenario in which the Irish pig industry is lost forever.</p></speech>

I agree that we must have a science-based policy approach.  Last week I asked the Minister for Health to give confirmation of when we will move to the individual assessment approach but was just told that it would be by the end of this year.  The Minister also needs to justify the use of a four-month rather than a three-month delay period and to explain the basis for same.</p> <p>I also want to raise another issue related to the health service, that is, the excessive waiting times in accident and emergency departments and the number of people on trolleys.  Yesterday there were 583 people on trolleys across the country.  We are heading back to the pre-pandemic days of overcrowded emergency departments due to the failure of the Government to properly resource hospital capacity expansion.  We can only increase capacity if we properly resource enough beds and the staff to safely manage them.</p> <p>Earlier this month a full-time carer spoke of his ordeal in Tallaght Hospital where he waited for 24 hours to be seen with his son who had suspected appendicitis.  While he waited in the accident and emergency department with is sick son, he had no choice but to leave his disabled wife and their daughter with autism home alone.  As he said himself, every nurse and doctor he met was fantastic.  They were caring, deeply apologetic and fed up to their back teeth with the systemic issues and working conditions.  He spoke of how there were not enough seats for people to sit on.  Even well people accompanying others cannot be expected to stand for 24 hours.  With another Covid surge upon us which will inevitably increase pressure on the already exhausted healthcare workforce, the Minister for Health needs to outline how he intends to increase capacity in our emergency departments.  I would also like the Minister to explain the four-month delay and to confirm the date for moving to the individual assessment process for blood donations.</p></speech>

Like many of my colleagues, I have received emails as part of a campaign expressing concern with regard to the front-loading model of SNA allocation.</p> <p>I have discussed this with officials in the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and believe it is a really good idea.  It is right to have SNAs in place when a child comes into a school, with the school given discretion with regard to the allocation of hours in response to the need.  There is an equality of access that comes with that which is very important.  It means that every child, regardless of whether he or she has a diagnosis, can be allocated a certain number of hours if his or her parents express a need for same.</p> <p>However, I also appreciate the concern that with this model a lot depends on the competence, efficiency and effectiveness of the special needs co-ordinator in a school, whether he or she is communicating well with parents, is in receipt of the education passport and has spoken to either the pre-school, in the case of children starting primary school, or the primary school in the case of children transitioning to secondary school.  The latter is important to ensure the proper passing over of information.  There was a time when SNAs in post-primary schools went back to visit SNAs in primary schools but again, that comes down to the effectiveness, passion and willingness of the special needs co-ordinator in a school and whether he or she is thorough and comprehensive.  </p> <p>There is a concern out there and I am sure many in this House would like to have the opportunity to contribute to a debate on these matters and to express some of the concerns of those who are emailing us.  I ask that we invite the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to the House for a debate on this matter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In this regard, I support this front-loading model.

Sadly, it is only four.  We are not following the example of other countries across Europe.  That leaves somewhere in the region of 28 or 29 still here.  Why we need that many in this country I do not know.</p> <p>It is not unknown that I am pretty active on social media.  This weekend somebody decided to attack, using my wife's name and my children's names.  That, to me, is totally unacceptable.  I contacted Twitter and told them what had happened.  Twitter came back to me and told me no rule was broken.  I am used to people attacking me on a regular basis because I am a former member of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Irish Rangers.  I served with more than 1,000 Irishmen.  They were all proud Irishmen - Catholic, Protestant from North, South, east and west.  All of us were proud of what we did.  I will never be anything but proud of it.  The day I got elected to this House the first people to welcome me were from Sinn F&eacute;in.  Deputy McDonald was asked how she felt about a former Brit being elected by members of Sinn F&eacute;in and she said the world had moved on, which it has.  Every day of the week somebody has a go at the fact that I am a former Brit.  Here we are in this House.  I am a former Brit.  I served in the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Irish Rangers and I am damn proud of it.  I was a bloody good soldier when I was in it, but I will not stand over the likes of Twitter allowing my family to be used as a weapon to try to beat me.  My wife and my children are private citizens.  They never ever come into the public domain.  They never speak publicly on anything, and nobody has the right to use their names.  It is time that we curtailed these social media platforms with respect to being able to identify who it is that is speaking.  My colleague, Senator Ward, mentioned this only the other day.  I have no difficulty with somebody having a pseudonym, but I must be able to identify who they are, where they are and what they are about.  I deeply resent the fact that this clown decided to use my family.  People can attack me any day they want.  They can meet me outside the gate and talk to me if they want, but they must never use my family.</p></speech>

We have seen that over the past year.  We have seen the Irish Second-Level Students' Union being part of the process to decide how we do accredited grades the year before last and how we manage the leaving certificate.  Today, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, announced measures to support students with this reform.  I also acknowledge the former Minister for Education, Deputy Bruton, who initiated this review, and officials from the Department of Education and the State Examinations Commission, along with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  There has been a body of work around this, including at the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, which has been working on a report on leaving certificate reform.  The first major change is 40% of exams will be by continuous assessment.  That means only 60% of all subjects will be by written exam.  It will support many students.  It will be fantastic for students who do not feel at their best on the day of their exam to know that not 100% of their grade is riding on it.  It also allows for a wider review of student skills to excel.  There will be easier access to third level because if students are able to explore and do more practical assessments through continuous review, it means that there will be a lower level of drop out.  Students will know more about the choices they want to make in terms of their career.  Second, new curricula and subjects have been added to develop the arts and culture area as well as the climate crisis.  Drama, film and theatre studies are being added to the curriculum.  Another addition is climate action and sustainable development, which again will help to prepare students to deal with the climate change challenges ahead.  New qualifications have also been added.  There will be a new exam at junior cycle level for students with special educational needs.  Even better, we will see a revised transition year programme and greater access for transition year students.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is important.  I might highlight that at the Department of Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Minister, Deputy Harris, is currently running six pilots in secondary schools that are looking at doing pilots of apprenticeships.  In other words, students are getting an opportunity in transition year to try out some of these apprenticeship programmes.  We currently have about 64 apprenticeship programmes ongoing.  This will be a fantastic way for students to get an opportunity to test these out. </p></speech>

Senator Malcolm Byrne, supported by Senators Maria Byrne, Dolan and Buttimer, talked about leaving certificate reform and the welcome introduction of two new subjects, namely, climate action and sustainable development and drama, film and theatre, from 2024.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, has set out a vision and a work programme that encompasses a range of areas including a new curriculum, new subjects, changing the final assessment procedure to significantly reduce reliance on final examinations and the introduction of a teacher-based assessment component.  There is much very welcome reform and I acknowledge the work of the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and all its members, in their engagement with the Minister.  We also will ask her to come in and debate what I believe to be a welcome and good news story.</p> <p>Senators Malcolm Byrne and Buttimer also spoke about the long delays in Dublin Airport.  We have discussed the collapse in aviation over the past two years because of Covid-19.  Now that the industry is back up and running, it is absolutely not acceptable that people are suffering the delays that they are suffering in Dublin Airport.  While Senator Buttimer is right to welcome people to Cork Airport, as I am sure many people would, and indeed to Ireland West Airport Knock and Shannon Airport as well, it is not a laughing matter for anybody who was caught up in the unacceptable delays at Dublin Airport.  I will certainly invite the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan and Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, in to discuss this matter.</p> <p>The census is a hugely important time.  Going back to the time of Herod, we heard about the census.  It is important that people are counted.  The data are used for each district electoral division for the country to plan in regard to healthcare, education and all aspects of society.  Nobody should be abusing any public servant and census enumerators who are doing their job should not be abused.  Certainly next year, as I understand it they are moving to an online system.  I am sure there will still need to be a follow-up system as well in certain cases.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne talked about the offices of the Revenue Commissioners being continuously closed.  That is not acceptable.  It is important that the Revenue gets back to pre-Covid-19 days, notwithstanding the present increasing numbers of cases, and that there are in-person meetings with people who need to engage with the Revenue.  I will ask the office of the Leader to write to the Revenue Commissioners to ask them to expedite the reopening of offices of the Revenue Commissioners throughout the country.</p> <p>Senator McDowell rightly discussed the funeral today of Pierre Zakrzewski, an Irishman who was educated in Ireland and whose family live in the locality in Dublin, who was a journalist and biographer.  He is just one example of the savagery of the unjust war within the Ukraine.  We remember Pierre this afternoon.  Senator McDowell also asked for a debate and I will request a debate in relation to issues on the housing matter, housing and renting.  We have all come across landlords who are getting out of the industry or are planning to so do because they consider it is not worth it.  Certainly that would have knock-on effects, exacerbating the crisis that we have within the rental sector and of homelessness.  I accept that bedsits were fine for a certain cohort of people and once you remove those, you remove valuable accommodation.  They had to be of a proper standard and up to scratch but removing those was a mistake.  I will invite the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.</p> <p>Senators Black and Gavan talked about the Sadaka conference in regard to Palestine and Israel.  I will invite the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to come in to debate the issue of Palestine.  I am not aware of who exactly was invited to the conference or where that letter or email went to.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Normally it would go to Government.  I am not sure to whom it was sent, if it was the Minister.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to come into the House to provide an update on ongoing issues regarding Palestine.<br/><br/>Senator Wall spoke about PDFORRA and RACO and their ability to affiliate to engage in collective bargaining.  I have previously urged the Minister to come in to discuss all defence matters as with the review of the Defence Forces, the substantial body of work done by the independent Commission on the Defence Forces and all that goes with it, there is enough material to have a large-scale debate on the future of our Defence Forces, having regard to all that has gone on, whether it be pre-conflict with respect to the manoeuvres off the south-east coast and all that has gone on since then regarding the provision of aid to Ukraine, our neutrality, NATO and associate membership and all that goes with it.  There is much to discuss in that very important sector.  I will ask for a debate on it.  <br/><br/>Senator Keogan raised the situation of girls in Afghanistan.  Education is such a fundamental right.  Afghanistan, to be best of my knowledge, is still a member of the United Nations.  We will contact the Minister and the ambassador to engage on this matter.It is extremely important.<br/><br/>The Senator also mentioned Canada.  It is very much a democratic country.  It had an election last September and Prime Minister Trudeau was re-elected.  We have had debates in this House on our Covid-19 laws and not everyone was happy with them.  I am sure not everybody in Canada was happy with their Covid laws but it is a democratic country.  It is very welcoming to Irish and other immigrants from around the world.  If there are specific genuine issues the Senator has, and she mentioned a man from Connemara which sparked my interest, I suggest she raises those concerns with the ambassador to Canada in the first instance and take it from there.<br/><br/>Senator Burke raised the energy issue and Coillte and asked that we invite the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to discuss the energy issues we have had.  We recognise the major impact that rising energy prices are having for Irish people.  There were announcements two weeks ago on fuel, excise and VAT and it is important those be kept under review.  The Council of Ministers meeting last week that the Taoiseach attended considered the whole area of VAT on fuel.  That is extremely important.  Under the present rules, any temporary reduction would result in that VAT going back up to 23% thereafter when the change was reversed.  That would be a major change.  It is important to examine the changes that can made.<br/><br/>Senator Ward spoke about the auto enrolment scheme for pensions.  We know the pensions issue is a major concern for people.  Often people leave it too late in life to think about or engage in providing for a pension.  It is important we consider auto-enrolment.  The Senator is right to say there are areas where that might not happen under the system.  I will invite the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to come into the House to debate the issue of auto-enrolment and the overall pension plans.  She has asked the sectoral committee to examine the issue.  I will certainly invite her to come to the House to discuss that scheme.  The Minister has said participation in the new scheme will be voluntary and workers will have the ability to opt out.  The scheme includes a matching employer contributions and State top-ups.  For  every &euro;3 saved by a worker, a further &euro;4 will be credited to their pension savings account.  When fully established, a worker earning &euro;35,000 per annum will accumulate a fund of &euro;293,000 over his or her working life.  This is an important area but certainly we need to ensure people are aware of it and that any issues are ironed out in advance.<br/><br/>Senators Hoey and Boylan raised the blood donation policy.  I understood there were positive announcements on this a number of months ago.  Perhaps if they tabled a Commencement matter they would get an early definitive response and if they tabled it jointly, the issue might be more likely to be selected by the good offices of the Cathaoirleach.  Other than that, we can request the Minister to come into the House to discuss the issue.  This is an important area.  Blood is often in short supply .  There is no reason we would have different policy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other parts of the island, the UK or mainland Europe.  It should be based on science.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Lombard talked about the crisis in the pig industry.  The IFA highlighted the issue outside the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Senator is right that the pig sector is intensive.  It is a high input cost sector due to the use of energy, feed and transportation so is particularly prone to the higher energy, fuel and feed costs that we have seen over the last period.  I will ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine to come to the House to discuss this very important issue.</p><p>Farmers taking decisions to stop putting sows back into pig would have further long-term impacts on the sector and a possible culling of the sector.  While there is always what is called a pig cycle in terms of prices, the industry is in a very difficult situation.  If an industry like this one collapsed entirely then it would be very difficult to gear it back up again, which we have seen before in certain areas like sugar beet.  The pig industry is worth protecting in terms of the number of jobs involved and the product so I will ask for a debate. </p><p>Senator Boylan raised the issue of blood donations, and the waiting times in accident and emergency departments.  The Joint Committee on Health is doing a body of work on this issue.  Recently the committee had before it representatives of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU to discuss overcrowding.  I know that we are to invite in representatives of some of the hospital groups as well.  The issue must be continuously kept on the agenda.  If there is a specific issue of an individual hospital or group then I urge the Senator to table a Commencement debate.</p><p>Senator Seery Kearney talked about the modelling of SNAs.  There is no perfect model because the work is demand-led.  Sometimes when a school has an SNA and suddenly does not have the children then the school loses the SNA, which is a matter of great concern to that school.  Certainly there were issues with the existing model.  I will invite the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, in to speak on the issue.  </p><p>Senator Craughwell welcomed the expulsion of a number of officials from the Russian Embassy, and I am sure the matter will be kept under review.  He also talked about the scurrilous attack on his wife and children of which I was unaware and my sympathies go to them.  As he rightly said, they are private citizens as are all of our family members.  The cut and thrust of politics is one thing and we are all subject to attack.  Some of it is unjust and some perhaps just, but that goes with the job.  Nobody forces us into these jobs but family members should be out of bounds in terms of any sort of attacks.  It has become too easy and prevalent for anybody to type something anonymously.  This matter has been raised within the Houses of the Oireachtas and meetings have taken place with Twitter, Facebook and a number of companies.  They have all said that they are private companies that are there to make money.  However, at the same time, they too easily allow people to run fake accounts to say whatever they like.  The worrying thing is that the individuals who receive comments do not know the identity of the sender.  It could be somebody that they know who uses a fake account.  The recipient could be quite familiar to these people yet they are not brave enough to say who they are or show who they are.</p><p>I think that I have covered all of the contributions made by Senators.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  This Bill is primarily about the transfer of functions from one Department to another in an area we all know about and that is important.  There have been no amendments other than two tabled by me, which were ruled out of order.  I will take this opportunity to say that no matter how apparently normal and necessary the provisions of a particular Bill are, it should not be the case that a Bill like this is rushed through the House like a dose of salts without an opportunity being given to table amendments properly, to have them considered and, arising out of whatever discussion might take place, to give people an opportunity to consider again the bringing forward of amendments on Report Stage.</p> <p>I indicated to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, last week that, in my view, there is a need to provide for better corporate governance in the context of the making available of moneys in the charitable and voluntary sector.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I made the point that such moneys should not be made available to organisations that were not providing proper audited accounts.  I previously raised the specific example of Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, which received moneys from the State in circumstances where it had not supplied audited accounts.  That arrangement has at least been suspended for the moment.  I also made the point that it does not matter what organisation is involved or what cause it is promoting.  It is simply not good governance for money to be made available from the public purse, funded by the taxpayer, to organisations in circumstances where they have not supplied properly audited accounts.  I gave the example of the requirement on us, as politicians, and on funding for political parties.  Where there is not appropriate accounting, the payment of moneys from the Exchequer stops.<br/><br/>The amendments I had tabled have been ruled out of order but they are, in my view, sufficiently related to the subject matter of the Bill because the Long Title clearly provides that the Bill provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the corporate governance arrangements of the HSE.  I accept the ruling of the Cathaoirleach that my amendments are out of order.  The amendments would have provided that no payments would be made by the Executive to a service provider which is a body corporate in respect on arrangement under section 34 until the service provider was in compliance with its obligations under section 343 of the Companies Act.  That is a reasonable and responsible amendment to propose.  It is sufficiently related to the subject matter of a health Bill that is described as containing miscellaneous provisions.<br/><br/>The section of the principal Act I was proposing to amend is among those being amended in this Bill.  I find myself in the situation that not only have my amendments not been accepted for consideration but there is no opportunity or break allowed for me to consider bringing forward those amendments on Report Stage and to ask for further and better consideration by the Cathaoirleach of their relevance to the subject matter of the Bill.  It is not good for our democracy when we have cursory, and sometimes apparently arbitrary, consideration of the relevance of certain amendments to the subject matter of Bills.  It seems to me that the procedural resources available to these House to prevent willy-nilly introduction of extraneous matters into legislation, including the guillotine and other procedural arrangements, are already ample to prevent abuse of the parliamentary process.  I am concerned by the all-too-frequent rulings that rule amendments out of order in circumstances where we are rushing legislation.  There surely must be time available to consider sincere and well-intentioned amendments to Bills that are proposed by Senators.<br/><br/>It is clear that the amendments I tabled would have restricted funding to organisations, such as TENI or any other charitable or voluntary organisation, unless they provide audited accounts.  That is just responsible legislation.  It is what the public would expect.  There is widespread public concern about the waste of taxpayers' money.  It seems that when it comes to considering if that sufficiently relates to the subject matter of the Bill, it is clearly not related to some of the specifics that the Bill contains but is certainly relevant in general terms to the Long Title.  The Long Title makes reference to the provisions in this Bill for revised corporate governance and accountability arrangements of the HSE.  It seems to me there is scope for a more inclusive approach to serious amendments that are being proposed to legislation.  That should be even more applicable in circumstances where mine were the only amendments tabled.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Surely, it was not the case that these amendments were going to contribute to the holding up of necessary legislation.  That simply was not and is not happening here.  I wish to take the opportunity to register my disappointment with the Cathaoirleach's ruling that the two amendments I proposed in all seriousness were out of order.  I further regret and, on that basis, oppose the continuation to Report Stage in circumstances where there is no chance being given to seek further clarification around that decision.</p></speech>

The Bill will be back before the House on Report Stage next week.  The Minister and Senator Seery Kearney would like to say a word.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.102" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#FF00300"><p>I cannot comment on the decision of the Cathaoirleach to rule amendments out of order.  That is within the competence of this House.  Since items are being placed on the record of the House, I am concerned about the notion that this Bill is being rushed through the House.  I do not believe that is the case.  It is transfer-of-functions legislation and there is a general view across both Houses to facilitate that happening because the Bill is focused on moving governance structures from one Department to another.  Nevertheless, this has gone through all Stages in the D&aacute;il and we have not asked for Committee and Report Stages to be taken jointly in this House.  Both Stages are being taken separately.  If they were being taken together, I could perhaps take the criticism that the Bill was being rushed but that is not happening here.  The Senator had the opportunity to place amendments.  He did that and they were ruled out of order, which was a decision for this House.</p> <p>It is also important to recognise that there is urgency behind this legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I are eager for responsibility for disability to fully move to our Department in order that we can do what we want and place a detailed focus on the issue of disability, a rights-based focus, and fully enact what we as a country sought to achieve through our signing up to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, that is, to deliver a person-centred approach rather than a medical-centred approach to the issue of disability, thereby uniting what was previously under the remit Department of Health within our Department.  The Minister of State and I are looking forward to that opportunity and, hopefully, from 1 May, we will be able to do that.  Notwithstanding the fact that there is urgency behind this Bill, my view is that we are not rushing it.</p> <p>As to the substantive issues Senator Mullen raised, it is important to note that a health amendment Bill will be brought forward by the Government.  That Bill will undertake significant changes to the governance of the HSE, including the revision of its board and its wider corporate governance.  My understanding is that the general scheme of the Bill has been approved.  The heads have not been brought forward to the Houses yet.  That is legislation with which issues of governance would appropriately sit and there may be an opportunity for amendments to be made when it comes before the House.</p> <p>Since we are putting items on the record, it is important to remember that a HSE governance framework is in place that oversees how the HSE governs section 38 and section 39 organisations and all the other funded organisation that operate under it.  The HSE is governed by that document.  Service agreements and grant aid are covered in terms of how they operate.</p> <p>This is a significant Bill and I am glad it has received the consideration of the House on Committee Stage.  I look forward to it being passed by the House in a number of weeks' time and to the transfer of functions for responsibility for disability to my Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#FF00400"><p>I thank the Minister for his contribution.  The basis of Senator Mullen's amendments is valid; it is reasonable to expect that there be accountability.  I completely and utterly support that.  I do not believe it is placed here.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, having the clear line of accountability is urgent, as is making sure we have a senior Minister who is clearly in charge of disabilities and disability services and as is having accountability and oversight of the HSE in circumstances where services shamefully are not being delivered.  At times, decisions are made that prejudice the service delivery of the HSE based on personality clashes and all sorts of issues that are outrageous.  Therefore, I very much welcome the move of this Department and the fantastic work of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, into the Minister's Department.  From our working relationship, I know that I can get on hounding him very effectively and that he will listen to what we say and hear what we need.  To be fair, much of what I have to say the Minister will know and be apprised of it already.</p> <p>I am glad to hear there is a health amendment Bill that will deal with the governance of the HSE.  The Senators and I will probably have much to say on it together when the time comes.  I also think I could support Senator Mullen in the context of the Charities Act and a review of the Charities Regulator and how that works.  Not only should we have accountability for taxpayers' money but we should also have accountability in respect of charities that are taking large sums of money from Russian oligarchs.  An EU report has pointed to some such Irish charities, which have been the very charities that have spoken out against matters of the State.  There is an interesting alignment going on that my office is currently researching.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was present when we last spoke on this Bill on Second Stage.  It is great that the Minister is here on Committee Stage.  There is a real urgency for oversight.  In community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7 that covers the constituency in which I live, there are no services available for children at present.  It is terribly under-resourced and we have a real problem with recruitment and the panel system.  Somebody has to grab that issue by the scruff of the neck and sort it out because there has been a delay in getting the appropriate people into the appropriate places.  I look forward to that responsibility being under the remit of the Department because thus far, we have not been making any progress while it was under the health remit.  I appreciate and support this Bill.</p></speech>

I apologise for that misunderstanding on my part.</p> <p>My central point was that I am concerned about the ruling out of order of these amendments because I believe they were sufficiently relevant.  I disagree with my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, on that.  She has, of course, grabbed the headline of the day by suggesting there are charities in Ireland getting money from Russian oligarchs.  All I want to say is, please, tell us more.  I am on the record as opposing and decrying foreign money from wherever it comes, be it from Chuck Feeney, for all his good work with universities, or Amnesty International getting money from George Soros around the time of the abortion referendum, which was not acceptable.  I am sure what the Senator has to talk about will be equally unacceptable and we look forward to hearing more about that.  Perhaps legislation will be necessary to deal with this issue.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for mentioning the HSE corporate governance framework.  The point of my amendments flows from the fact that there is far too much latitude.  It should not be a matter of discretion by the HSE to turn a blind eye to the fact that certain organisations have not supplied audited accounts in circumstances where other organisations would lose their funding.  It seems that some bettering of the discretion of the HSE may be necessary in this area.  When the Bill referred to by the Minister comes forward, I hope we will not be told when bringing amendments, similar to those I have attempted to bring forward today, that legislation to do with the corporate governance of the HSE is somehow different from the standards that the HSE must apply when taking decisions about how it exercises its decision-making capacity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not want to hear it argued that the structure of the corporate governance is one thing and the decisions the HSE takes on the funding of organisations is another.  Neither do I want to hear that my amendments are to be ruled out of order on the basis of some such spurious distinction.  My frustration and that of many Members of this House flows from this simple fact: if the Minister had sought to bring forward amendments such as I have brought forward, as the sponsor of this Bill, he would have had no problem.  There would have been no objection.  It is those of us who seek to amend legislation who are fettered in our attempts to do so, and as the Minister knows, we have relatively few opportunities to bring forward Private Members' legislation.  My overall point is there needs to be a more generous and inclusive attitude to serious attempts to amend legislation, and the invocation of the rule around relevance to the subject matter of the Bill must not be done in such a broad and extensive way as to prevent legitimate issues, which are considerably well related to the subject matter of Bills, from being brought forward.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#JJ00300"><p>I thank Members for the invitation to be here.  On behalf of the Government, once again I utterly condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine.  We are also mindful of the terrible toll being inflicted on Ukrainian citizens.  As a Government and as a people, we remain resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine and we reiterate the call on Russia to cease all hostilities immediately and to withdraw from Ukraine unconditionally.</p> <p>At a time tractors are in the fields, lambs are being born and cows and calves are heading for grass in Ireland, our farming brothers and sisters in Ukraine are taking up arms to fight for their country's freedom.  I welcome the strong solidarity shown by Ireland and the European Union as a whole with Ukraine in the face of its illegal invasion by Russia.  We will work with EU partners to consider and implement appropriate responses.  This includes ensuring that food security is maintained for EU citizens, for the Ukrainian people and in the wider global context.  Ireland is providing &euro;20 million in humanitarian assistance to the UN and the Red Cross to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.  My Department also provides flexible funding of &euro;25 million per year to the UN World Food Programme, supporting that organisation to provide a flexible timely response to humanitarian crisis.  In addition to the immediate humanitarian crisis, which must take priority, there will be implications across all sectors.  Considerable volumes of both global feed and fertiliser originate and are traded through Ukraine and Russia.  Fuel and energy costs are also a concern for farmers and the food industry.</p> <p>Since the invasion of Ukraine, I have taken a proactive approach to dealing with the massive challenges facing our sector.  Farming is not alone in dealing with these challenges but our great sector is particularly exposed as a result of the invasion and we are working hard to support farm families through this situation.  I met with the main farm organisations and Teagasc on 8 March to discuss the impact on Irish agriculture and supply chains.  I have also met members of the Irish Grain and Feed Association, IGFA, and representatives from the fertiliser industry.  I established the national fodder and food security committee with the preparation of a response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs and to developing contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.  I will continue to engage closely with the sector as we work together on this significant challenge.</p> <p>Within my Department, I established a rapid response team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agrifood supply chains and to contribute to the whole-of-government response to the crisis.  Last week, I announced a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector and a multispecies sward initiative, worth more than &euro;12 million to support farmers.  This is an exciting initiative that will help us reduce our dependency on imported feed.</p> <p>At EU level, I attended an extraordinary EU agriculture ministers meeting in early March and the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels last week.  The Ukrainian agriculture minister, Roman Leshchenko, spoke via video connection at the Council about the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the agricultural sector.  My Department has also been engaged at a number of other EU meetings in recent weeks to discuss food security issues, including a meeting of the European Food Security Crisis Preparedness and Response Mechanism, EFSCPRM.  I outlined to my EU colleagues that Ireland has continued to strongly support the most extensive EU sanctions on Russia for its outrageous actions.  We must also ensure that the actions we take in that wider context, together with the burden that must be borne, are sustainable, and this will only be the case if we work together to do all we can to maintain food security for our own citizens, for the Ukrainian people and in a wider international context.</p> <p>I outlined my particular concerns regarding the impacts of the conflict on agrifood supply chains, especially on inputs such as fertiliser and feed.  As the situation is obviously volatile and evolving, I stressed the need from an EU perspective to continually assess developments and to be ready to take necessary responses to minimise the impact on our collective food security.</p> <p>At farm level, the fallout from the invasion is likely to have an impact on the price and availability of animal feed and fertiliser, which are vital farm inputs.  Ireland imports significant volumes of animal feedstuffs, including feed from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.  Russia and Ukraine are significant sources of global cereal exports, so the price and availability of cereals globally is impacted.  The availability and price of animal feedstuffs are a concern across all farming systems.  The effect of these impacts is being felt most sharply in the intensive pig and poultry sectors where feed costs represent a significant portion of overall productions costs.  There are sufficient supplies of animal feed at present and Irish importers are actively competing on the global market to ensure that supply continues uninterrupted.  Animal feed stocks and imports are being monitored weekly by my Department.  The role of Teagasc and farm advisers is crucial at this time in providing timely, practical advice for farmers on nutrient use efficiency.  Fodder availability on farms for next winter depends on several factors, particularly grass growth and silage production this year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the main, we came into the winter in decent shape in terms of fodder stocks.  While there are cattle and sheep out on grass on many farms, I am conscious that the winter season is not over yet for many.  We must think conservatively when it comes to silage grain to ensure that we have more than enough to cover the amount of stock on an individual farm.  In essence, what farmers plan to breed, they must also plan to feed.  There has been a reduction in fertiliser use on farm to date this year in response to the Teagasc soils, nutrients and fertiliser campaign.  Last October, I tasked Teagasc with developing this roadmap to reduce our dependency on chemical fertiliser.  It was launched earlier this year.  It is a credible roadmap that will be good for the environment, as well as good for farmers&rsquo; profit margins.  </p><p>I am also aware of the particular issues in horticulture and I have engaged with the sector.  Energy is a significant input for many horticultural enterprises, because crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers and mushrooms are grown indoors in glasshouses and in protected greenhouse structures.</p><p>Fertiliser costs are rapidly increasing also.  This is an immediate issue for all farmers.  Russian fertiliser imports accounted for 22% of our total fertiliser imports in 2020.  Fertiliser availability is key to ensuring sufficient fodder for next winter, as well as grass for the season ahead.  There is a need to ensure the most efficient use of organic and chemical fertiliser, so that farmers have sufficient feed for their animals.  We are in regular contact with the fertiliser industry on possible mitigation measures.  We are inputting to cross-governmental consideration of related issues as well.</p><p>Fertiliser stocks nationally are down this year to date in comparison with last year.  However, it is estimated that there are adequate supplies to meet farmers&rsquo; spring requirements, although prices have risen considerably.  All farmers are encouraged to review requirements over the next two months to secure fertiliser supply, if that is not already in place.  It is important that all farms put in place a nutrient management plan to set up their farms to grow the grass that is required for the year ahead.  Advisors will be assisting farmers with this plan.  </p><p>A recent Teagasc survey found that most tillage and dairy farmers have secured their fertiliser requirements for the moment, while dry stock farmers, many of whom plan on spending less fertiliser on grazing ground, are finding it more difficult to secure their fertiliser requirements at the moment.  I would be concerned that these farmers will be unable to secure their fertiliser requirements over the coming weeks and months, because it is critical and crucial that we have enough fodder for the winter and spring coming.  </p><p>The new national fodder and food security committee, NFFSC, which I have established, will play an important role in discussing contingency plans and in providing advice to farmers on how to manage under constrained fertiliser supplies, if that proves necessary.  The agrifood sector relies heavily on fuel of various types, from road diesel to agricultural diesel, to marine diesel and to natural gas.  The year 2020 saw fuel prices at their lowest in a decade, while 2021 and this year see fuel prices rise to their highest in a decade.  This is adding a significant additional cost to farmers, processors, road haulage and the fishing industry.  For many farmers, the energy cost has risen by 80% to 100% in the past year.  All sectors have been impacted by the crisis, including the seafood sector.  The price of marine diesel has increased significantly, and net profit margins have fallen.  With weak profitability, some vessels are now close to being uneconomic with the increased fuel costs.  There is the possibility that vessels will cease operations and will tie up.  For most meat and dairy products, and subject to no significant disruption in food processing, there is no immediate threat to domestic food supply, because Ireland is a net exporter of these products.   </p><p>Our great sector is facing one of its most significant challenges in many decades.  In times like these, it is crucial that we take a proactive approach and that we take steps to limit any potential disruption to our feed and supply chains.  I know that farmers, fishers and the agrifood sector will rise to the challenge and will meet it head on.  By working collectively and collaboratively, we can ensure that the sector is insulated against the worst of what might come from supply chain disruption.  However, the next number of weeks and months will undoubtedly be challenging, some of the most challenging periods in our lifetimes.  I will support our farmers, their families and their businesses in the best way possible over the time ahead.  I will continue to engage with stakeholders to consider how to manage any disruption to supply chains, in particular to animal feed supply chains, that will be caused by the ongoing situation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#KK00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate.  I condone his condemnation of the illegal and unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine.  This will create trying circumstances for us here in Ireland, in our agricultural community in particular.  However, these are mere shadows of the turmoil, the pain and the grief that are being suffered by the Ukrainians.  I would like to be associated with the Minister&rsquo;s remarks in asking for the Russians to leave as soon as possible, without any conditions.</p> <p>Many people in conversation say that mechanisation and nitrogen have underwritten global population growth when it comes to food security since the Second World War.  The fertiliser nitrogen, as well as our diesels and fuels, were already heading for a crisis situation before the invasion.  Costs had escalated and this was putting much pressure on our farming community.  Many farmers decided, due to cost, to possibly cut back.  This was irrespective of whether or not they were in the schemes.  They decided to cut back on their fertiliser for the coming year because of the exorbitant costs.  They probably even cut back on some of their work.  There may have been bits of tillage that were not to be done this year, but that would have been done in previous years.  This is because of the price of bringing in contractors, who incur enormous diesel expenses.  When we combine that with the invasion and with the situation in Russia and Ukraine at the moment, we are heading towards a serious crisis.  Desperate times call for desperate measures and we are in desperate times.  </p> <p>The weather is the one area over which we have no control.  This area could have a big say over this situation before the year is out.  We are hoping that we will have a good summer, one that is not too dry, and that the harvest and winter coming will not be too bad.</p> <p>I welcome, as the Minister has outlined in his own statement, the national food and fodder security committee, the soils, nutrients and fertiliser campaign, and the Minister&rsquo;s rapid response team, which is to be chaired by the Secretary General.  I also welcome the fact that he met with the farm organisations and Teagasc early in the crisis.  I also welcome his targeted tillage support package and multispecies swards.  However, just on that issue, I have a couple of questions and a couple of observations.  That money is available to people who plant crops, to those who go into tillage and who have not had tillage previously, or to those who put tillage in fields that have not been ploughed previously or in which there were no tillage crops last year.  The Minister outlined the potential for a fodder shortage in the coming year if we do not get this right.  I also ask that question from my own perspective as a beef farmer.  If I were to consider tillage to help out with the crisis, I would have to plough land from which I took silage in the previous year.  Therefore, while that might be providing grain to help the cause, I could and possibly would, leave myself with a fodder shortage, because of the silage I would no longer have.  Not many people would have land sitting by that did not have a purpose last year that was being used to meet their own feed requirements.</p> <p>I would also like to mention the Minister&rsquo;s results based environment agri pilot programme, REAP.  I do not know if he can revisit that at this stage.  However, many people signed up land to REAP last year.  One of the biggest conditions of the REAP scheme is low input.  As we have said when referring to the importance of fertiliser in achieving our targets in feed and fodder, a lower input will possibly mean a lower output.  People signed up to that scheme, myself included, last year with no idea of the position we would be in this year.  They budgeted for the same.  I achieved my own fodder targets.  However, if we now have to increase, and I might not have the possibility of being able to get grain next winter, this could in certain ways hinder me going forward. </p> <p>The biggest issue I have is with diesel costs.  The Minister and I have addressed this before and I will address it again.  If people who are not accustomed to doing tillage on a regular basis decide to do so, they will have to bring in farm contractors.  They do not have the equipment to plough, till, seed or harvest.  The farm contractors are crippled at the moment with diesel costs.  I welcome that there has been a small reduction in diesel prices, as well as the fact that there are ongoing negotiations to enhance that further through VAT.  However, farm contractors have to charge enormous prices at the moment just to break even.  This is because of their diesel costs.  They have been caught.  While farmers themselves can write off a part of their diesel costs in their tax returns, contractors are not in a position to do that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2464"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2464&amp;amp;pid=PaulDaly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Even at this late stage, I encourage the Minister to consult with the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance to see is support can be provided for farm contractors when it comes to the cost of diesel.  A scheme similar to, or better than, the one that has been introduced for hauliers may be possible.  There is going to be more demand on contractors if farmers who are not accustomed to doing so will try to do tillage.  Many of them do not have the necessary machinery.</p><p>The Minister, together with his colleagues in Europe, may have to reconsider the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, going forward.  Irrespective of the duration of the war, it will be a long time before everything come back to normal.  This crisis may be ongoing for the duration of the next CAP.  I do not know whether it would be possible to look at that.</p><p>He mentioned horticulture, fruit and vegetables.  We have had the debates, and I will not go over them again, about the importation of peat from the Baltic states.  That is also an issue.  Our horticulture sector, which has been depending on imported peat to meet its needs, will not have access to the same quantities.  We need to look for a solution on this island.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#LL00200"><p>The Minister is welcome to the House.  I think this is the first time I have spoken to him since he took up office.  It is a bit late to be congratulating him on his appointment.  I congratulate him on the speed at which he picked up the problems associated with where we are right now.  He has moved from one crisis into the next crisis.  He has done well and shown himself as somebody who is willing to get out there and speak to people on the ground.</p> <p>The picture we are painting here today is pretty frightening.  It is no secret I served in the military and I have seen what tracked vehicles do to agricultural land.  I can anticipate the damage that is going to be done to land in Ukraine and it will not be repaired easily.  Even if the war were to stop in the morning, it would be very difficult to get that land back up and producing quickly.  That is a serious concern.</p> <p>I am a city boy and have been all my life.  For me, milk came in cartons and bread came in wrappers.  I never had to think much more about it until now.  Every part of our agricultural and fisheries sectors is going to be severely impacted as we move forward.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, trawlers going to sea for several days at a time require thousands of litres of diesel, the cost of which is going through the roof.  The Government can only do so much.  There is a time when one can no longer provide subsidies, cut costs or whatever else, and we are rapidly heading to that position.  We are going to have to put a lot of thought into how we allocate resources in the coming months.</p> <p>We talk about the outrageous behaviour of Russia in the Ukrainian conflict as if it is going to pass in the near future.  We have no idea when it is going to stop.  We do not know if Putin's war will stop in Ukraine.  It may very well move into Macedonia or Poland.  Who knows where it is going?  Right now, we are in a state of flux and we have no idea where things are going.  Ukraine is the bread basket of Europe.  Ukraine and Russia produce approximately 30% of the cereal crops required in the world.  As we move through this time, the wealthy part of the globe will be able to meet the prices.  We will have to cut back on other items but we will be able to meet the prices that will be demanded for cereal crops.  My concern is particularly for Africa, which is going to suffer terribly.  There are ships off the ports in Ukraine that Putin and his war machine will not allow put to sea.  Those ships are loaded with grain in places such as Odessa and Mariupol and have nowhere to go.</p> <p>Where do we go from here?  How are we going to solve this problem?  I have no idea.  When we talk about agriculture, we talk about the need for fertiliser.  A lot of fertiliser over the years has come to Ireland through Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.  How are we going to solve that problem in the near future?  My colleague, Senator Paul Daly, spoke about putting what is, for all intents and purposes, beef land into tillage.  That is going to be a serious problem.  The Senator made the point that farmers are now being asked to move away from their area of competence into a new area where they will be involved in planting cereal.  The Minister has been good in putting forward supports for them.  Teagasc and various other organisations in the State are there to assist them in any way they need but, at the end of the day, we are talking about a major step forward.</p> <p>Whenever I think of agriculture, I think of my dad, who planted our garden every Good Friday.  He went out at 6 a.m. and did not go to bed until it was fully planted and there were enough vegetables to feed us for the best part of the winter.  The end of planting season is quite close.  We are running into serious trouble in that regard.</p> <p>I received an email, as did many others, from Growing Media Ireland.  It refers to our reliance on peat and its importation, as Senator Paul Daly mentioned.  That goes against the green agenda in this country.  We are prepared to take peat from somewhere else but we are not prepared to use our own.  I understand the problem.  I visited Iceland a couple of years ago and Taiwan in 2020.  In both those countries, I saw that there can be a very lucrative horticultural business without the use of peat but it requires massive inputs of energy.  It is easy in Iceland because the energy is flowing under the ground and it is easy to get to it.  We do not have access to energy like that in this country.  I am outraged about the closure of the generating system in Derrybrien, Galway.  We are in the middle of an international emergency and what are we doing?  We are taking apart a generating system in Derrybrien because it did not comply with planning.  I do not have a difficulty with the planning issue but there should be a moratorium put on it tomorrow to keep Derrybrien generating until such a time as this crisis has passed.  The last thing we need is energy shortages.  I believe the Government needs to move to preserve what energy production we have so we can reduce our reliance on other fuels and use them in the agricultural sector.</p> <p>The Minister has my support for what he is doing.  Fair play to him; he is out there on the ground.  I know he is very close to those the fisheries industry in his own constituency.  They will need massive support.</p></speech>

I sympathise with the Ukrainian people and, in particular, the Ukrainian farmers who are stuck on the horns of a dilemma at the moment.  When they should be out working the fields, they are in the middle of a war zone.  I do not know, and can only imagine, what they are going through.  I pass on my sympathies to them on what they are going through at the moment.  There are stuck with an unfortunate dilemma.</p> <p>Ukraine is the bread basket of Europe.  It is the second largest exporter of grain into the EU and it is also one of the largest exporters of grain into Asia and north Africa.  There will be a significant impact on world peace if we do not find a solution to the war.  If we do not find suitable solutions to the need for grain in Egypt and other countries, it will have a considerable impact on world security.  That will be a knock-on implication of this unfortunate war.</p> <p>The costs associated with this war have gone through the roof.  The costs of energy, fuel and grain have all increased dramatically.  Last year, I was buying fertiliser for &euro;208 per tonne.  This year, I paid &euro;1,027 for the same product.  That is an indication of how costs have gone through the roof.  Meal for cows has gone up by &euro;180 in the past four months.  There have been significant increases in the cost of farming.  Balancing that cost will mean price inflation at the other end and the consumer will, unfortunately, pay more for products on the back of this war.  There will be considerable issues in the short term with the cost of fertiliser and fuel.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As other colleagues have stated, fuel costs have gone through the roof.  I was speaking to one contractor yesterday who had paid &euro;1.28 per litre.  He was literally paying double what he paid last year.  That is going to have a huge impact.  There is going to be a massive issue with how we are going to look at our food policy going forward.  This is a sea change.  We are going to see price inflation and because of that we will see a huge issue with food security.</p><p>Today we had a protest by the pig industry.  It is one of the first casualties of this war when it comes to food security in Ireland.  Energy and transportation costs have gone through the roof but the price of meal has gone up by nearly 90% in the past four months.  It is quite possible the industry will go into significant decline and it is questionable that it is sustainable going forward.  It is a debate we are going to have at the agriculture committee but the Minister might give us his thoughts on how we are going to sustain that industry in future.</p><p>The tillage industry is going to play a major role in trying to ensure we have enough grain going forward.  This is not only for our cattle and sheep industries but also for the flour we need.  We have specialised grain farmers who are significant operators.  They can produce high-quality grain in volume but need support to do it.  The proposal from the Minister needs to be clarified with respect to how we can entice these competitive, capable operators to do more with what they have.  I mean no offence to Senator Paul Daly and beef farmers but having them come into that sector is questionable in many ways.  We need to try to promote the specialised people in that market.  The analogy I was given at the weekend was that is like telling grain farmers they need to go milking cows because we are going to be short of milk.  Growing grain is a specialised practice.  We need to find a policy where we can get these productive lads in the ring so they can deliver the tonnage we require by next September.  That is going to be a body of work that will, I hope, be solved in the next few weeks.</p><p>The real issue here is the European food policy as well as European policy on food security and energy.  All of these must be looked at again.  Our food policy and our food security policy has been shown to be very weak.  They depend on bringing in large volumes of fertiliser from third countries that we have no control over the volatility of.  As a result, we are now going to suffer a food crisis.  The same thing is said about the production of grain.  If we bring in large volumes of grain, again from a third-country source, how can we have food security on our own Continent?  A complete rethinking of our food security policy is needed.  When the CAP was originally set up it was about producing enough food that Europe would not starve.  We had moved away from that but we are now moving back to it.  That is because we are stuck in a scenario of increasing costs that will unfortunately mean we might not have enough going forward.  Other speakers are correct that we do not know where this is going to end.  Europe will survive but north Africa will be in exceptional chaos in 18 months if there is a shortage of grain.  That is a real problem for the world and for Europe especially.  What we do in Europe will have a knock-on impact on the north African economies and could destabilise them.  That will have massive implications for how we are going to ensure we have a safe and secure world in future.  This war is a game changer and we must now change policies we never previously thought we would have to change.  However, if we do not change them we could have a scenario where the unthinkable happens and we could have unrest in countries that have been stable for decades, due to a lack of food and energy security.</p></speech>

It is definitely not an easy time for farmers in Ireland.  The war has just highlighted the huge issue that has been there for a long time.  We cannot blame the Ukrainian war for our overdependence on a monoculture of dairy or beef and nothing else, because that is what has happened.  We have been siloing farmers into one of two options and we see very little food grown.  We must distinguish between food for people and feed for cattle.  We must also distinguish between food security and feed security because they are also two very different things.  We export much beef and dairy and they are not feeding the world; they are actually luxury items.</p> <p>This war has shown two very important things, namely, that we must become more resilient and self-sufficient as a country to feed the nation and everybody who is forced to come here and that the farming model we have siloed most farmers into, thanks to certain lobby groups and big parties, is not fit for purpose anymore.  That is what the Ukrainian war has really highlighted.  Farmers have become so reliant on external inputs, as they call them, to the farm and borrowing lots of money to expand exponentially and to bring in things from outside the farm that cost them more.  My experience, from many farmers I know locally who are not big dairy or beef farmers, which do not really exist in County Clare, is that the smaller farmer has also been forced to go down that road.  There is so much stress for farmers to continue with that model whereby we are so dependent on nitrates, building big slatted houses and borrowing more and more money from the banks.  I have seen suicides of good farmers around west Clare due to the financial pressures they were forced into because of the model of farming we have been practising in Ireland for far too long.  There is nothing positive about war but it has made us face the reality of how inappropriate that system is.  With or without the war we have always said fossil fuels and relying on fossil fuel products was never going to be sustainable in the long term because it is completely out of our control.  We see that now and Senator Lombard has highlighted the costs.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister's work on providing some financial incentives into tillage and the growing of other foodstuffs.  I have friends who are organic food growers and seem to be doing quite well.  Conventional vegetable and fruit growers seem to be struggling the most in some ways because their costs have gone up much more because they bring in so many other inputs.  I also have friends who are organic growers of fruit and they seem to be doing very well.  We see that with the organic dairy and beef sectors as well.  I have not met an organic dairy or beef farmer who is giving out because they have not got so reliant on outside inputs to the farm.</p> <p>For Senator Lombard and farmers like him who continue that practice, we cannot regress.  We have a climate emergency as well as a fossil fuel, which is needed by all the farmers, emergency.  The model does not work.  We have been misguiding farmer into this model for years.  I used to teach about Fairtrade bananas when I was a civics teacher and the smallest slice of the banana would go to the grower.  We now have the same thing with the Irish steak or litre of milk, that is, the smallest amount is going to the farmer.  It is not working and the Ukrainian crisis has shown why it is not working.  There is too much emphasis on spending money on bringing more inputs into the farm instead of having a closed circle, as many organic farmers manage to do, which brings down their costs.  It is time to face the reality and unfortunately we have been forced into that reality.  It will also help us deal with many of the issues with water quality, soil erosion, the lack of biodiversity and the increase in the flooding of farmland due to our butchering of all the stuff that used to hold all the water back, like the roots of the trees or hedges.</p> <p>We have been going down a very bad road that has not served farmers.  Maybe it has served a small percentage of really big farmers who are happy to push a model that only suits certain sizes.  The war in Ukraine has highlighted how inappropriate this two-sizes-fits-all model is.  It is dairy or beef and go big or go bust, yet we cannot feed ourselves.  We say we are feeding the world; we are not.  We are selling baby milk formula to people who should be encouraged to breastfeed rather than buy formula.  That is the reality of what is happening with much of the milk, unfortunately.</p></speech>

I know this from being involved in Genetic Concern and Nestl&eacute; campaigns.  We know for a fact the powdered milk we are selling is unfortunately being pushed into developing countries with poor water quality.  The companies know that.  They are using poor-quality water to mix formula to get women away from free breastfeeding in order to make money out of it.  There are huge issues there and we could talk about them all day.  Let us be realistic and have a proper, intelligent debate if we are going to talk about farming in Ireland.  It is not just because of the Ukrainian war.  We have failed.  This model of farming has failed farmers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They have been advised for years to keep spreading the 10-10-20 and to keep expanding.  They are struggling as a result, and that is the problem.  It is not necessarily the rise in the cost of fuel; it is the over-dependence on external factors being shoved onto farmers and the practices we have told them to follow for many years.</p><p>I hope that something good comes out of this.  It is not just about the need to grow more feed for cattle; we need to be growing more food.  We import 110,000 tonnes of potatoes from Scotland and England.  We cannot even grow our own potatoes.  Let us be realistic and talk about food, not just feed.  Do people know that you can grow 40 times more food for a person if you plant to feed them directly rather than if you try to grow food to feed dairy cows or beef cattle in order to feed that person?  It takes up so much energy because these animals are ruminants. There is a lot to think about here.  I am not vegan or a vegetarian, but big dairy and big beef have let everybody down.  They are not serving the small farmers, they are not serving our environment or nature and they are not serving people's mental health. They are serving the banks with all the money they are being forced to borrow to go with a system that is not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

I echo what others have said in condemning the completely outrageous actions by Russia.  The war on Ukraine has certainly shone a spotlight on food production, not just in this country but also internationally.  We are only at the tip of the iceberg of this food crisis.  I am aware that officials are insisting that food available availability is not at stake in the EU, but they are conceding that food affordability for low-income households is.  We are facing a situation where there will be enough food, but not everyone will be able to afford to eat.  This is within the EU.  When we look at the global south, food availability will become a much bigger issue.</p> <p>As others have stated, fertiliser price increases of up to 228% are happening in tandem with unsustainable increases in feed and energy prices.  The completely unsustainable costs for farmers who are operating in a distorted market where the dominance of retailers and processors mean that primary producers are not getting a fair price at the best of times.  While it seems apparent from the European Union Commission that market supports will be made available, including the possibility of the use of the &euro;500 million European Union crisis reserve fund - I am aware that the Government has announced a scheme for the pig sector - this will only amount to a few days feed for those farmers.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of the war, one thing is very clear: our agriculture and food systems are very exposed to shocks such as the price of gas and the increasing cost of fertilisers and animal feed.  Our food system is broken.  This is not a new phenomenon; it is something that agrarian movements have been raising for years.</p> <p>As Senator Garvey indicated, organic farming is one of the ways that we can absolutely reduce our vulnerability to spikes in the costs of inputs.  Organic farming has been neglected in the context of Government policy.  It shows that Ireland is almost bottom of the EU table.  Malta is the only country that has less agricultural land dedicated to organic farming than Ireland.  Our figure is 2%; I believe that the EU average is 8.5%.  There has been a complete lack of ambition for years, particularly during the ten years of Fine Gael in government.  There was a point at which one could not even enter the scheme. Even if someone wanted to be an organic farmer, they could not actually access the scheme because it was closed.  We now have a target for organic farming of 7.5% by 2030, but this will not even bring us to up to the EU average.  Meanwhile, we see the EU storming ahead in setting a target of 25% by 2030.</p> <p>We are always hearing the narrative that Irish agriculture thrives on a sustainable and green reputation.  The truth is that this is not true.  There is a complete lack of support for truly green and sustainable agriculture that is organic.  It undermines our reputation and it also does nothing to support farmers who want to go into organic.  One of the proposals from my colleague, Deputy Carthy, is for an additional &euro;15 million for organics in 2022.  There is a reason other countries are storming ahead when it comes to organics.  As we did with the dairy industry when we created a market and incentivised farmers to go down that road, Denmark did exactly the same with organics.  The authorities there promised farmers a market.  If farmers there go into organics, they will have a market.  The authorities in Denmark did this by ensuring that any supermarkets over a certain square footage in size were mandated by law to stock Danish organic products.  We could do exactly the same here if we had the same ambition when it comes to organics.  Teagasc and An Bord Bia should be resourced with ring-fenced funding to promote organics and create a market for them.  The Government knows it can do it because it was done with powdered milk and the dairy industry.  Make the market for organic products.</p> <p>I also want to raise issues relating to global considerations and sustainable agriculture and systems.  Before the war in Ukraine broke out, we were already facing the unprecedented challenge of pursuing human development and ensuring the right to adequate food for everyone on the planet.  We waste 30% of our food.  We have a distribution problem, not a food shortage problem.  We need to find a way to feed 9 billion people by 2050 in ways that do not break essential ecological and planetary boundaries, while also tackling poverty and extreme inequality.  We must rise to those challenges with restricted deliveries of important foods like wheat and agriculture-related commodities such as fertiliser.  More than enough food is produced but 811 million people go hungry.  Since 2015 that number has been on the rise.  Covid-19 aggravated it and now the war in Ukraine is going to make it even worse.  I have raised previously with the Minister one of the measures that Tr&oacute;caire has been calling for, namely, that there should be greater support for an enabling environment for sustainable food systems through its agricultural investments and that sectoral investments should be directed at the sustainable approaches that an increasing scientific and practitioner evidence base is pointing decision makers towards.  The policy recommendations - endorsed by Ireland - in Agroecological and other innovative approaches for sustainable agriculture and food systems that enhance food security and nutrition - which is the long title - recommends that governments redirect their policies, budgets and investments towards those agroecological approaches.  I call on the Government to follow through on its endorsement of the recommendations in that report and make sure that the necessary resources are put in place to allow us to pursue an agroecological future and address the food production crisis we have.  The war in Ukraine has brought this matter into focus, but it has been there for a very long time.  The way we produce food is unsustainable.</p></speech>

A number of points were made by colleagues that I would certainly agree with.  I agree with Senator Lombard about the implications for global food security.  We are seeing rising grain prices on international markets, particularly in Turkey and the Middle East.  I have concerns that half of the wheat used in Lebanon is imported from Ukraine, 22% of that used Yemen is imported from Ukraine, 43% of the wheat used in Libya comes from Ukraine and Egypt gets 14% of its wheat from Ukraine.  Much of what became the Arab spring was originally driven by an increase in food prices.  The challenge around global food security is significant in this volatile part of the world.  I would hope that at European Union level this issue is being discussed and that we are preparing to deal with it.  We are already facing a very significant refugee crisis with regard to Ukraine, but if we end up seeing similar problems in the Middle East and North Africa that arise from food scarcity or food shortages, that will again fall on Europe's doorstep.  I am hoping that preparations are being made at an EU level to address that.</p> <p>I also agree with comments that colleagues made about the fertiliser sector.  It has been very clear for a long time that there is a lack of competition in the fertiliser sector.  There is evidence that price gouging is going on.  I am aware that the US Department of Agriculture has now invited public comment on anti-competitive market practices in the fertiliser sector.  Now really is the time that the EU takes this on.  We have known for a long time that there is not sufficient competition.  There is an oligopoly within that sector.  I do not believe that the latter has been taken on sufficiently at EU level.  It should have been dealt with previously, but, very clearly, it needs to be addressed now.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I welcome the fact that the Minister has engaged closely with the farming organisations.  We know this is not simply a case of being able to transform the face of farming and food production in Ireland overnight.  He will be well aware, as colleagues have said, of some of the challenges the tillage sector has been facing.  I am certain that the farm organisations are more than willing to step up to the plate with the necessary supports and levels of engagement to ensure they too will play their part, in the short-term, in ensuring that we have sufficient levels of food and in addressing issues around food security in the long term as well.  This crisis is a humanitarian one but it has also brought to the fore those issues of food and energy security that this country has not dealt with realistically.  This crisis is forcing us to deal with that now.</p><p>I have mentioned commercial flour production to the Minister previously.  We continue to import more than 80% of our flour into this country.  Those of us who served on the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will be aware that there was an issue around rules of origin.  The wheat that was coming in through Canada and milled in the UK was hit because of the rules of origin and that led to price increases.  An average individual consumes 54 kg of bread and bread products every year and, therefore, we are quite significant consumers of bread and bread products.  It makes sense, therefore, that we look to ensure we can commercially mill flour in this country.  There are a number of mills that do it.  Some of them carry out specialised flour production but there is no commercial mill production in place.  More than 80% of the flour we import is coming through the UK and the events in Ukraine and Russia, even though we do not import a lot from those countries, will have an impact on the global markets.  We need to take this seriously.  The Kavanagh brothers have planning permission for a commercial flour mill in County Wexford and they are keen to go ahead with that.  They say they have received limited support from Enterprise Ireland to date.  I appreciate that the Minister cannot necessarily be seen to support one particular project but in the interests of our food security, particularly in respect of bread and bread products, we need to ensure we have a reliable supply of commercial flour.  In addition to talking to the farm organisations about the production of grain and so on, I ask the Minister to also engage with the bakers and those involved in the use of flour on how we can ensure we can commercially produce flour on the island of Ireland and be guaranteed that we have that supply going into the future.</p><p>There are a series of big challenges ahead and we have to act in concert with our European partners on all of this.  I know the Minister is doing that and I know he is also working closely with the farm organisations.  He has our full support in that.</p></speech>

Hindsight is wonderful and this time last year no one predicted a war in Ukraine and the situation we are in.  It has happened, despite the best intentions of the vast majority of decent people across the world.  As a result there has been an impact on lives and livelihoods and mass migration from Ukraine.  The impact this has had on families across the region is foremost in our minds.  We are also mindful of the impact of this on individual countries that are suffering and have concerns about food security because of the war.</p> <p>Food security was to the forefront of the CAP and it was almost a case that in recent times it was no longer an issue.  It is not an issue until it is and now it is an issue because of the war in Ukraine.  Two countries at the heart of that war were the major producers of wheat and other crops as well as being major producers of fertiliser.  We can talk, as other have done, about the path we have been on but we are a net exporter of food.  Food is important for employment and for net exports from this country, which is hugely important to our GDP.  We take pride in producing, predominantly, high-quality beef as well as milk exports in the form of cheese and baby formula.  We cannot judge the rest of the world on breastfeeding as it is a personal issue for many women.  We should not lecture other countries on choosing to use baby formula.</p></speech>

I also commend them on the &euro;12.2 million package to attract farmers to grow more grains this year to mitigate the events in Ukraine and their impact on important inputs for our milk, beef, poultry and pig sectors.  The supports that have been put in place will make a difference and all we can hope and pray for is that we have decent weather during the harvest, as well as for a decent summer with neither drought or flood.  I also acknowledge the setting up and establishment of the national food and fodder security committee and the expertise of Teagasc and the Department to consider initiatives that can impact quickly on the problems there are this year.</p> <p>The increases in the cost of fertiliser are having a significant impact on farmers as is the price of fuel.  While there was a small change in agricultural duty in the recent announcements it is a real concern to farmers.  Many farmers will make decisions not to buy extra cattle for the summer grazing period and not to keep as many cattle next winter.  The impact may already be evident in the marts and it will be seen in the weanling trade next autumn.  We need to consider initiatives for a temporary period such as supports to cull a certain number of dairy and suckler cows that are aged over seven or eight to try to reduce the volume of breeding stock for a short period.  We can also accept that, while pig and poultry farmers are struggling due to the high import costs, the slurry from their farms could be worth a lot this year.  Any supports that can be put in place to encourage the use of pig and poultry slurry on neighbouring dairy farms or elsewhere would assist with fertiliser costs.</p> <p>Other Members have commented on livestock but livestock are needed in uplands such as the Burren to protect the ecosystems we have.  Livestock produce organic manures, which are hugely important for the production of food.  We cannot be entirely down on the system that has developed in this country over a long number of years.  It is a system of high-quality food that is grown to the best standards in the world.  It is traceable and it supports rural communities up and down the country.  Some of those farmers are part time while others are full time but we need to keep generational farmers on the land.  It is an industry we can be proud of and one we need to protect and support going forward.</p></speech>

The Minister is welcome to the House to discuss this very important issue.  Several months ago, I highlighted the rising cost of fertiliser.  Unfortunately, in the intervening period, not only has the cost of fertiliser rocketed and its availability become such a challenge but energy costs have also soared across the board, so much so that we have a crisis on our hands in the farming sector.  Farmers, as the Minister will well know, are used to difficult times, but their current circumstances are totally unprecedented.</p><p>A poll published in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>at the weekend showed that one third of farmers have yet to purchase any fertiliser this year, while a further 70% said they would cut back on its use.  Given the prices being quoted, at up to &euro;1,200 per tonne of urea, it is easy to understand why that is the case.  I recently spoke to many farmers from different sectors of the farming community who have never experienced a time like this.  Pig farmers will today protest outside the Minister's offices in the city centre to highlight their circumstances.  I compliment him on intending to meet a delegation of those farmers later.</p><p>I also compliment the Minister on his sensitivity and on his understanding of the situation in which the farming community finds itself.  He outlined the measures he has taken and the various working groups and committees he has set up, all of which are vital.  Teagasc has an important role to play in advising farmers on what they can and should do during this period.  I spoke to an agricultural contractor at the weekend who referred to rising fuel prices.  He fears that much of his plant will not leave the yard this year because farmers simply cannot afford the prices he would have to charge them.  Like the pig farmers in town today, many farmers do not want handouts; all they want is a helping hand to guide them through this very difficult time.  I have no doubt they will bounce back and respond, but the fact people are cutting down on fertiliser will have a knock-on effect further down the line because crops will not yield the same volume due to that lack of coverage.</p><p>Farmers need help.  I have never seen matters as dire as they are at the moment.  I sincerely hope, and have every confidence, the Minister will rise to this challenge and ensure farmers can overcome these difficult circumstances in which they find themselves.</p></speech>

I greatly admire his approach of meeting farmers and speaking with them, which is vital.  For many years, we got it wrong and we spoke down to farmers.  In that context, the Minister's approach is very important.  I met about a dozen farmers for a chat a few evenings ago in a park near Ballinasloe in south County Roscommon.  They are all suckler-to-beef farmers, with 60 or 70 acres, some good land and some bad.  They rely on farm payments.  Every one of the 14 people I met gave me one clear message, namely, that they want to help out.  Some of them spoke about when their fathers before them grew small volumes of grain.  One issue that irritates them a great deal relates to the argument - I have noticed this myself - that we cannot grow grain because nobody will mill it.  I assure the House that if farmers start growing grain, there will be people to mill it because Irish people will rally to the cause and do what is necessary.  As has been reiterated numerous times during this debate, the war has taught us the value of self-sufficiency.  I have spoken to the Minister throughout my time in politics about the horrendous levels of importation of vegetables and fruit, some of which, of course, we cannot grow in this country.  I read recently that we import almost &euro;80 million worth of apples.  We have perhaps the greatest climate in the world.  Our Bramley apples are known throughout the world and are far nicer than any other apples.  There are many things that can be done.</p> <p>I, too, acknowledge the way the Minister has accepted that pig producers are in a lot of bother.  They have proposed a very good deal and they are not seeking a handout, as another Senator said.  Rather, they are looking for a helping hand and we need to pay back some of that money.  We should remember that through the years, when pig producers have got into bother, they have really come together, got themselves out of bother and traded well again.  I appreciate that this is a focus of the Minister's at the moment and that he will do his best for them.</p> <p>We have to grow more grain.  We cannot rely on places such as Russia and Ukraine.  I would love even to see beet production brought back.  That might not happen, or perhaps under the new CAP we will look at it differently from a European perspective.  The will is there.  People see this now as a crisis and they will produce food.  We can produce even more good food for other parts of the world.</p></speech>

He is here to speak about the impacts on farming arising from the war in Ukraine.  We have heard today and for recent weeks about millions in Ukraine starving, desperate for food and in dire straits.  They are starving in a country that is, as has been mentioned, the bread basket of Europe.  President Zelenskiy is asking those farmers to stay in the country and farm.  Farmers are trying to continue, in some cases in conflict areas, and are putting their lives at risk.  The average farm size in Ukraine is thousands of acres and exports have been banned because the country needs to feed its own population, so farmers cannot export grain.  Russia is now trying to take over the ports, which will mean there will be no possibility of export.  On Euronews, a Ukrainian farmer, Serhiy Vakhnyuk, talked about how life goes on.  Calves are being born and farmers and vets have been given an exemption by President Zelenskiy.  He spoke about how the soldiers have their battles and how farmers have their own battles to keep people fed.</p> <p>Ireland earlier expelled Russian diplomats - three other European countries have done the same - and made a clear statement, as did the Minister, that it was because they had breached international standards of diplomatic behaviour under the Vienna Convention.</p> <p>For farming in Ireland, too, we have to battle.  We have to battle for commodities that are now at prices that were way beyond anyone's conception prior to the war.  It is beyond control.  Farmers are having to focus on having enough feed for their cattle and fertiliser for their land to ensure they will be able to survive and we can look after animal welfare in the months ahead.  The Minister stated that Teagasc had carried out a survey in which tillage and dairy farmers had secured their fertiliser requirements for the moment, while drystock farmers, many of whom plan on spreading less fertiliser, are finding it difficult to secure their fertiliser requirements.  He went on to state that whatever farmers plan to breed, they must plan to feed.  Given everything that has happened through Covid, the lockdown and a war, when we do not know what will happen in the weeks ahead, how on earth will farmers be able to plan for five or six months when they do not know what the price of fertiliser or feed will be?  We are trying to give warnings to say this situation is volatile.  It is clear, even from the Minister's contribution, that certain sections of the industry are finding it difficult.  I welcome the investment he announced regarding the &euro;12 million for tillage farmers.  We are all broadly from the same part of the world, but how many limestone areas are there in the west?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is said that small parts of farms can be dedicated to this but how much fertiliser is going to be needed in some of those areas to be able to bring tillage on?  These are some of my main concerns. </p><p>I appreciate there is a rapid response unit within the Department and the Minister has been very focused in convening the national food and fodder security committee.  Teagasc has been looking at nutrient-rich areas and will be issuing guidance and advice to farmers.  </p><p>How will farming families be supported in the months ahead?  Farmers are under enormous stress and there are huge levels of anxiety among the farming community.  I would like to see the Department engaging with Macra na Feirme on the ground, as well as with Teagasc and farm advisers.</p><p>This is not an easy time and the Minister has a very difficult task in the months ahead.  We will support him in that.  As Senator Murphy said, his visits to the west and all around the country were very welcome.  I also wish to acknowledge the work of the officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They held a meeting in Ballinasloe recently, part of which I was able to attend and it was very important that they met people on the ground.  As the Minister has said, we have to plan ahead.  The CAP was originally designed to ensure food security for our nation.  Perhaps the Department's regional meetings could happen again in six or eight months' time, when we will have a better understanding of the situation.  In some cases, the regional meetings are not due to take place again until early next year. </p><p>I thank the Minister for his time.  The situation is extremely difficult and we all have to work together.  Farmers are trying to plan for first, second and third cuts, not knowing what fertiliser they will be able to get or whether they will have silage for the winter.  We have faced fodder crises in this country previously and farmers from different parts of the country delivered what they could to those who were short.  They gave to others when there were shortages of feed and fodder.  There must be a whole-of-government approach to this and a whole-of-country response to support farmers in different parts of the country.  I hope that will be part of our plans, going forward.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the Department is providing &euro;400 per ha to encourage Irish farmers to grow more cereals to offset the loss of Ukrainian and Russian grains.  The aim is to increase the amount of tilled land by 25,000 ha.  While I know farmers will be going out to sow the crops, my concern is whether we will have enough.  So many farmers are dependent on grain to feed their animals.  Pig farmers were protesting on the streets today and I thank the Minister for agreeing to meet them this evening.  We have been heavily reliant for so long on imported grain and animal feed.  Members of the Irish Grain &amp;amp; Feed Association are working hard to find and import grain and I urge the Government to support them in their endeavours.  It is a very worrying time for them.  The tillage scheme will significantly improve our capacity to grow grain.  Ireland imports two thirds of its grain annually, which is quite a high proportion.  In that context, I welcome the fact that the Minister is encouraging Irish farmers to grow their own.</p> <p>As one can see from the complaints, farmers are really concerned about sky-rocketing input costs, particularly fuel and fertiliser prices, both of which have been heavily affected by the war in Ukraine.  I condemn what is going on over there.  It is so sad for the people in Ukraine.  The scenes on our television screens every night are terrible.  The war is having an impact all over the world.</p> <p>I suggest farmers need cuts in excise duties and carbon taxes.  It is critical that sufficient agricultural diesel supplies are available during the key spring and summer months when planting and harvesting takes place.  Rather than receiving one blanket payment, farmers are asking that certain taxes and duties be cut and that diesel supplies be set aside for them.  I would also like to see that happening.  The Government should look at a temporary break in taxes and duties on vital inputs including fertiliser, green diesel and grain.  </p> <p>Irish dairy and beef farmers are being urged to start growing crops.  We have all been inundated with emails about the provision of peat.  The Minister is well aware of the issues in that regard.  It is crucially important that farmers have sufficient peat but the costs have increased significantly.  Senator Lombard drew our attention earlier to the cost increases in recent months and I support his call in that regard.  The horticultural sector, including nurseries and garden centres, is also heavily reliant on the provision of peat.  It is an issue that I would like the Minister to consider in the course of his deliberations.  </p> <p>I thank the Minister for all of his work and support his ongoing consultation with farmers.  They are on their knees and need all the support that the Government can give them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#QQ00500"><p>I thank all Senators for their comments and contributions to what was a very constructive debate.  We are all very aware of the challenging situation we are currently facing but I assure the House that my Government colleagues and I are sparing no effort to lessen the negative impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  It is not possible or desirable for the Government to respond to every unfavourable price move on global markets as the country does not have the resources to do so, especially given our current underlying levels of debt.  Furthermore, history teaches us that chasing inflationary pressures with ever more Government spending would, in fact, be counterproductive.  While the Government is responding, and will continue to respond, we have to be clear that it is not possible to cushion citizens and businesses from the full economic impact of the war in Ukraine and many of the factors driving up costs are outside our control.  Inflation is rising around the world with year-on-year inflation rates in the OECD at 7.2% in January and at 6.5% in the G20 area.  This compares to 5.6% here in Ireland in February.</p> <p>A large portion of the animal feed used on Irish farms is imported and about 30% of world wheat and maize exports originate in Russia and Ukraine.  In the past year, the price of key ingredients used to manufacture animal feed has doubled, as a number of Senators mentioned.  All of the chemical fertiliser used on Irish farms is imported and over 20% of that originates in Russia.  The cost of fertiliser for farmers has more than doubled this year compared to last year.  The combined impacts of these changes, especially the uncertainty around fertiliser price and availability, will affect fodder supply in the coming winter and next spring and could, in turn, potentially lead to animal welfare and food production issues if we do not act collaboratively to address it.  </p> <p>We have introduced a number of measures in recent weeks to reduce the impact of the international crises on the agrifood sector.  Given the seriousness and urgency of the situation, I have put in place a rapid response team in my Department, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agrifood supply chains, to design appropriate responses and mitigation measures and to contribute to the whole-of-government response to this crisis.  I have also established the national fodder and food security committee to examine how best to advise the sector to manage the disruptions.  I am grateful for the contribution of all stakeholders and representatives working together on that committee.</p> <p>Last week, I announced a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector worth over &euro;12 million with the aim of supporting the growing of additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multispecies swards.  This package is aimed at producing more native crops and crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser, which is limited in supply as a result of the invasion, while also reducing our dependency on imports.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These targeted measures will help build resilience against the expected impact of what is happening in Ukraine.  This three-pronged approach will contribute towards the expected deficit in tillage and protein crops.  It will also assist farmers to deal with the challenges related to both the availability and price of animal feed and fertilisers.<br/><br/>The tillage incentive scheme will incentivise farmers to grow additional crops such as barley, oats and wheat this year.  For an area of crops to be eligible, farmers must grow more tillage than they did last year.  In addition, the land must not have been tilled for grain in 2021.  The scheme is targeted at increasing the overall tillage area and making a real impact on increasing our supply.  A payment of &euro;400 per hectare is proposed.<br/><br/>The support for protein crops, which have been a success story in recent years, will encourage farmers to grow more protein crops and build on what we have achieved so far in areas being planted for peas, beans, lupins and combi-crops.  Some &euro;3 million is already provided under the protein aid scheme and a further &euro;1.2 million will be provided.  There is an appetite among farmers to grow more protein crops but under the current structure, the number of crops grown is divided by the amount available so the more farmers grow, the more that amount drops.  I wanted to provide certainty and I did not want any disincentive for farmers to do what we want them to do this year.  We have put a floor on that scheme, guaranteeing a payment of &euro;300 per hectare for all protein crops and &euro;150 per hectare for combi-crops.  We are providing this guaranteed payment rate to encourage farmers to grow those crops and give them certainty around that.<br/><br/>The multispecies sward scheme, including support for red clover, is aimed at reducing nitrogen fertiliser while maintaining forage yields.  Multispecies swards have been proven to reduce our dependency on chemical fertiliser while maintaining forage output.  I am very confident there will be strong farmer interest in this initiative.  I see lots of potential to progress this in the years ahead but we have to step that up as much as we can this year, given the backdrop.  I am particularly pleased with the co-operation received from our independent agri-retailers and co-operatives, which will play a vital role in the operation of this measure.  It will support the establishment of approximately 12,000 ha of multispecies swards and approximately 4,000 ha of red clover silage mix.<br/><br/>The total package is projected to cost in the region of &euro;12.2 million, with &euro;10 million for the tillage incentive scheme, &euro;1.2 million to guarantee the payment of &euro;300 per hectare of protein crops and an additional &euro;1 million for the multispecies sward scheme.  I take this opportunity to remind farmers to declare the relevant crops on their 2022 basic payment scheme, BPS, applications.  If farmers have submitted their BPS application for this year and they now want to take on additional land, they can log back in to <i>agfood.ie</i>to make any amendments, but they must make sure they do so before the deadline of 16 May 2022.<br/><br/>On the EU response, the European Commission announced on 23 March, via the communication, &quot;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&quot;, a range of actions to enhance global food security and support farmers and consumers across the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs.  The communication sets out actions in three areas.  First, it presents immediate actions to safeguard food security in Ukraine and around the world.  Second, it addresses the challenge of food stability in the EU's food system, with a range of measures to support our farmers and maintain affordability for our citizens.  Third, it confirms the EU agenda to make our food system sustainable and resilient in the years to come.  The package includes an allocation of &euro;15.8 million in exceptional aid for Ireland, which can be topped up by national funding.  We are examining how to best mobilise this support as soon as possible, taking account of the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to this exceptional aid provision.  The EU package also includes a new temporary crisis framework for state aid and plans to deploy market safety net measures to support specific markets, including private storage aid for pigmeat.<br/><br/>Pig farmers were experiencing a significant cost-price squeeze before this war crisis and very significant losses are likely to be incurred by the Irish pig sector over the next period.  Indeed, they already have been.  Feed price and availability is critical to the welfare of pigs on farm.  Earlier this month, I announced an emergency aid scheme for commercial pig farmers of &euro;7 million, which opened for applications on 7 March.  The maximum payment under this scheme is &euro;20,000 per undertaking, which is in line with <i>de minimis</i>state aid requirements.  The first payments to pig farmers under this scheme were issued last week and are arriving in bank accounts this week.  This is an urgent, short-term response to assist producers that would be viable but for the extreme current and urgent circumstances we are facing.  It will allow space for a more medium-term adjustment to market signals.  This scheme is augmented by intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality-assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets, with dedicated media advertising campaigns under way nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes in key export markets.  Teagasc has also intensified the dedicated, ongoing advisory supports it provides to pig farmers and is actively engaging with farmers to explore the options and supports available to them.<br/><br/>My Department is in ongoing contact with the main banks and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland regarding the current situation.  The advice remains that pig farmers should engage with their banks, and they have been doing so.  We know from the protests today the particular pressures farmers are under.  I met yesterday with the Irish Strategic Investment Fund on the possibility of developing a suitable instrument to manage market volatility, which is particularly acute for pig farmers at the moment.<br/><br/>I emphasise to pig farmers that help is available to them.  Animal welfare, and, indeed, human welfare, issues can arise quickly when people are under pressure.  Where farmers are feeling that pressure and anticipate animal welfare issues, I encourage them to seek husbandry and veterinary advice on the development of an action plan to manage and avoid this risk.  If a farmer is coming under pressure they should make contact with my Department's dedicated animal welfare helpline.  All contact details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Teagasc is engaged in supporting pig farmers at the moment as well.  I met with the farmers outside the Department earlier today and will meet them again this evening.  It is important that we bring clarity to them so they can plan for the time ahead.  I am very conscious of that and will seek to bring that clarity as soon as possible.<br/><br/>On 22 March, the Government approved the general scheme of the agricultural and food supply chain Bill 2022, which will provide for a new office called the office for fairness and transparency in the agrifood supply chain.  The events of recent weeks have reminded us all of the fragility of the agrifood supply chain, and it is now more important than ever to ensure that there is an independent voice to promote and, indeed, enforce the principles of fairness and transparency in that chain.  This new office will bring greater transparency all along the agricultural and food supply chain.  It will do this by performing a price and market analysis and reporting function, publishing reports on price and market information on all sectors in the chain.  It will engage with retailers, processors, wholesalers, farmers, fishers and others on matters affecting fairness and transparency in the chain.<br/><br/>I and my Government colleagues are acutely aware of the short-term challenges arising for farming households and businesses, and we have taken steps across the board at Government level to help address these.  These include the increase in the living alone allowance, the package of electricity cost measures and the package for supporting fuel costs.  As Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I am conscious of the real challenges for agriculture, farming and fishing at the moment.  We have taken a number of steps to try to address these to support farmers through the time ahead and back family farms.  We will continue to do that and will continue to assess the situation.  It is important that we work together because this is a challenge like we have not seen previously.  There is war on European soil for the first time in two generations.  That is the reality facing us and that changes things.  We have seen that already.  We are all feeling it in our daily lives.  Farmers and food producers are feeling it too, and we will all feel it and encounter these challenges over the remainder of the year.  It is important that we plan ahead and work together.  It is important that the Government, and I as Minister, back family farms and fishers.  We will do that.  We have been doing that and will continue to do so.  It will be more challenging than ever to produce food but it is more important than ever that we continue to do it.  That is why I have acted by putting together the fodder and food security committee, as well as the support packages.  The key message to farmers is to consider the situation.  They should have a 14-month horizon, looking from now up until the end of next April.  They must plan ahead and plan their breeding and their feeding.  It is important that this happens within each farm.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are moving into the grass growing season now.

As Minister, I will not be able to grow more grass at that stage, I may well not be able to do anything and may well have big challenges in the supply chain.  It is important now to plan in order that we are secure up until next April.  We must look at that horizon and work together in doing so.  That is what we are all working on.

I am compelled to comment, and I believe it is a wider discussion.  As the Acting Cathaoirleach may not be in a position to answer but it is something that is going to have to be examined.  I am concerned on the grounds on which some of the amendments have been ruled out of order.  It creates a very significant concern in regard to democracy.  For example, the idea of not being able to oppose a section is a concern, especially if that section is requesting that the Oireachtas transfers power in primary legislation to a Minister to make regulations in secondary legislation.  It is appropriate that we would be able to make amendments in respect of that.  I am also very concerned that the amendments relating to time, which we will come to later in amendment No. 11, is being made into a difficulty.  A sunset clause is a basic parameter of legislation.

The definition of "native tree area" relates to spaces of less than 1 ha is one part but also basically just relates to the width of the planting.  The concern in this regard is that long, narrow strips could fulfil the criteria of native tree area but cover an area larger than 1 ha and evade the criteria that would normally be applied to them under the forestry legislation.  The Minister might say that these will not be defined as "forestry" but I have been looking up the original forestry legislation and there is quite a strong opinion of many that in fact 20 m wide strips as currently planned do fall under the definition of "forestry" as land under trees with a minimum of 0.1 ha and a tree crown cover of more than 20% of the total area or the potential to achieve this cover at maturity.  Currently, strips of 20 m width fall under the forestry legislation and would be subject to it.  There is a danger that under the new native tree area people will be incentivised to avoid the Forestry Acts process by going for strips that are possibly separated in that regard rather than planting in contiguous forest areas.  When I spoke about this with the Minister of State, Deputy Hackett, she said that there are certain contexts in which such narrow 20 m wide strips might be appropriate.  She mentioned riparian planting, waterways and the importance of certain areas in which it is appropriate and desirable to have native tree planting in this stripped format.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The problem is that the Bill does not contain such caveats about how native tree areas are defined.  It simply leaves them open as strips of 20 m wide.  Effectively, the amendment proposes to give the Minister the power to specify additional criteria for strips of planting that may exceed 1 ha, but that may be only of certain width.  They will outline which will be defined as "native tree areas" and which will not.  This will be important when it comes to later issues, such as the issuing of grants.  It is much harder after the issuing of a grant for a native tree area to say that, &ldquo;Only this kind of strip area or this other kind of strip area".  This is where the Minister can clarify it.  That is why this is empowering the Minister to make sure that a hostage to fortune has not been inserted into the Bill in respect of potential strip planting.  This could create a perverse incentive that might encourage strip planting over proper large-scale forestry for those who are going to cover an area that is larger than 1 ha, but for those who do not necessarily want to come under the remit, as they properly should, of the Forestry Acts.</p><p>It is important to note at this point that this also would make the Bill more legally robust to an extent, although the problems will still apply.  It is not really the case in case law that screening or environmental responsibilities can be avoided by simply having a size limit that is tied to an area of planting.  However, it certainly should not be the case that we should have strip planting, which is, in fact, bad for the environment in most situations.  However, there are exceptions, such as along waterways and others.  A negative, less desirable form of planting would effectively become incentivised by the Bill.  </p></speech>

Obviously, the Bill has massive implications for their livelihoods and for the professions that they have built up over a couple of generations from the early 1960s with the support of the State.  A number of the amendments have been ruled out of order for further discussion.  They were discussed on different Stages earlier in the legislation process.  I have been clear throughout this process that I fully understand the responsibility on me as Minister to ensure that there is a fair outcome for the farmers and the families concerned that reflects what this legislation means for them.  They will no longer be able to continue what they do.  They will no longer be able to have that livelihood that they have built up and to which they have been so attentive.  They have complied with all regulations over the years.  Indeed, they have provided employment in their local communities and these are rural communities, at that.</p> <p>I was clear here in the Seanad when we spoke last on in the issue of repurposing buildings that I would deal with that in the regulations.  I will also deal with the issue of additional payments and financial allocations to the employees in regulations to recognise the impact on them.  I will also meet further with the farmers.  When I last met with them, I committed to meet with them once again.  As I said here on the previous occasion, as soon as this legislation is passed, I will sit down to meet with them further.  As I said, I am also willing to sit down with Senators to have further discussions on that issue.  The final negotiations cannot be dealt with here on the floor of the Seanad.  It is a responsibility on me as Minister to bring those to a conclusion.  I am cognisant of the responsibility that is on the Government and on me to ensure the impact on them is fair.</p> <p>They have not asked for this.  At all times they have conducted their business with ultimate professionalism and in line with the standards that have been asked of them.  They want simply to be able to continue their livelihood.  We as a State are deciding this, because we believe that this industry has outgrown its ability to be an industry anymore.  Yet, we as a State and as a Government are making that decision and we are ending their livelihoods.  That is a big thing for a Government, a Chamber or the Oireachtas to decide.  It is important that this is properly reflected in the way that the farmers are engaged with.  My clear commitment is to promptly sit down further with them, following on from the legislation.  </p> <p>I have no doubt that it will be frustrating for the farmers present this evening that the amendments will not discussed further because they technically cannot be facilitated on Report Stage.  It is no desire of mine to evade anything.  In fact, I want to get to the stage where I am sitting down to bring this to a conclusion.  I know that the farmers want to get to that stage as well.  They want to ensure that the conclusion is fair to them, as do I.  </p> <p>The amendment tabled by Senator Higgins proposes to insert provisions that additional criteria may be set out in the regulation to establish narrow native tree areas.  This provision exists in section 9(d) under which conditions for an exemption to an afforestation licence may be prescribed under a regulation and, therefore, the Bill already facilitates in its current form the application of additional criteria in relation to the width of native tree areas.  Furthermore, in advance of the introduction of any scheme, the Department will undertake a strategic environmental assessment, in which the public will be able to participate, as well as an appropriate assessment alongside that.</p> <p>Following the completion of that strategic environmental assessment and the appropriate assessment, and subject to the findings of those two assessments, the Department will finalise the design of the scheme and associated terms and conditions around that.  For that reason, I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

We accepted they would be draft regulations and could change, but we would at least get to have a look at them.  We are taking the Minister at his word.

To be helpful, and I want to be helpful to the Acting Chairperson, I ask that when an amendment is being ruled out of order - this is provided for and there is precedent for it - as we go through the remainder of the debate, the reason for its exclusion should be read into the record in order that we all understand why it happened.  Does the Acting Chairperson know where I am coming from?  There is a report before her on the amendments; I looked at it because I am chairing the next session.  It would be helpful to give reasons for amendments being ruled out of order for the sake of the people who have travelled from Kerry and Donegal.  It sets the record here.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#UU00900"><p>I regret that the Minister is not minded to accept this amendment because it is constructive.  With respect, the fact that regulations may be made regarding an exemption is referenced in section 9, which the Minister spoke about, and we looked at the issue in the context of section 9(d), but I was talking about the definition.  The problem is very different things are being bundled under a single definition and regulations will later be made as to how native tree areas, as defined here, may be exempted from the requirements of the Forestry Act.</p> <p>It is better to get things as correct as possible as early as possible.  In that regard, it is a concern if a new entity is being created that will have certain privileges in being able to bypass components of the Forestry Act.  That entity will be subject to certain privileges and, potentially, access to certain grants in respect of proactive supporting measures.  In that context, how the native tree area is defined is very important and really matters.  That is why, again, when I referenced the regulations that will come later, I wanted to put in the definitions a clarification, which will also save the State from further future challenges, that the definition of native tree area itself would be subject to caveats in the regulations, especially as it applied to strip areas and strip planting.</p> <p>The reason it is very important is strip planting, which is at risk of becoming strip farming, should be in native tree areas.  We know there is a requirement for it to be long term and permanent but strip planting is more likely than the other part of the native tree area.  We know the area of not less than 0.1 ha and not greater 1 ha is a certain kind of area, but these 20 m in width infinite-length components are far more likely to be in breach of EU laws and far more likely to create problems for this scheme.  We should consider not just the idea of appropriate assessment, Natura 2000 sites and so on, but all the directives, such as the habitats directive, and the impact non-contiguous planting and areas that may be in strips can have on that directive, in addition to the impacts on the water directive, especially if much of this planting is likely to take place along river areas.  That is why I said the Minister should make specifications that even certain kinds of river planting and repair planting be subject to particular constraints.  For example, one of my later amendments relates to the fact of biodiversity removal.  It is very important that we do not, in effect, say that here is a grant for planting a strip along a river that leads to existing biodiversity along a river bank and the existing habitats in respect of, for example, otters, freshwater pearl mussels and many other species, being damaged by planting that is being allowed to bypass normal screening by this Bill.  That is what I am talking about.</p> <p>If this is one of the hostages to fortune we are creating in the part of this Bill that relates to strip planting, we are more likely to end up in this situation.  I have made this point to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and will make it again to the Minister.  This is not about slowing things down.  A previous Minister for Agriculture had to come to the D&aacute;il to talk about the fact that Ireland had been dragged over the coals for failing to deliver proper environmental standards for forestry and was in trouble for not having applied proper screening and practices for forestry, which was before summer 2020.  We then had the forestry appeals legislation that autumn.  The past two years should have been used to boost and improve our environmental impact assessment capacity and to massively increase support for the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p> <p>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action and I am as keen on planting as anybody.  I want planting to happen, but in that committee we know that, for example, wind farm operators are saying to give more resources to better environmental thinking, and to having more people who are skilled and able to apply all the EU laws to projects quickly and effectively.  I worry that we have yet more legislation that is instead focused on getting around those laws rather than applying them quickly and effectively.  When that happens, there is a risk we will end up in situations that breach an EU directive.  I am very worried about the proposal relating to strip farming in the Bill.  It is something that may not be addressed in this legislation but I hope will be addressed in the regulations.  If we end up with a situation where habitats get dug up, and water gets damaged and polluted, in order for somebody to access a grant to plant new trees, that will be a problem.  We will have created an environmental problem rather than an environmental good.</p></speech>

On Senator Boylan's point, she was mistaken.  The Minister of State in question was not Deputy Peter Burke, but Deputy Heydon.  She was also mistaken as regards what he said.  The Minister of State said he would discuss the matter with me and bring it back to me, which he did.  As I said very clearly during the engagements I had previously in the Seanad, I will be sitting down with the farmers to bring the regulations to a conclusion.  Farmers have had a copy of the regulations, which are in draft form and not yet finalised.  It is now important that we bring those regulations to a conclusion.  It is my responsibility to engage with farmers on that.  The Minister of State followed through on what he committed to.</p> <p>As I said very clearly in the Chamber previously, I did not think it was appropriate that the Seanad would be in the middle of negotiations.  No doubt there is an onerous responsibility, as there is on all of us, but it ultimately rests with me as the Minister to bring those negotiations to a conclusion.  I will very promptly engage with farmers now that the legislative basis for me to do so has been provided by both Houses of the Oireachtas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charlie McConalogue:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2319"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2319&amp;amp;pid=CharlieMcConalogue&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I understand the points that Senator Higgins has made but the Bill provides the capacity to address those issues following on from both the strategic environmental assessment and an appropriate assessment, and then that to be accommodated in the regulation.

Some of the reasons are particularly concerning in terms of the amendments that have been ruled out of order.  Like others, I would have liked the opportunity to speak to some of those other aspects but I will focus on the amendments that are still in play.</p> <p>On amendment No. 10, I have combined the reasons for expediency but each of them could be their own amendment and debate.  I wish to note that the term "woodland area" should be "native tree area" but that is by the by because the core issues still apply.  These are an attempt to strengthen the regulations and regulatory mandate.  I am conscious that this Bill concerns his Ministry but I also spoke to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, about these regulations in order to strengthen her hand.  I used a similar principle when I spoke to the Minister about the regulations that he will make on the exit from fur farming and I highlighted the importance for us, as an Oireachtas, to strengthen the message that we give.  When a Minister seeks from the Oireachtas the power to make regulations, then we are saying that while primary legislation is how legislation is normally done, there is a request from the Minister to have power transferred to secondary legislation in the form of regulations.  That was why when we had those amendments that we said that in giving him the power to make regulations on the exit from fur farming, we wanted him to be clear that the regulations will include issues that address and strengthen employees' rights or address environmental concerns.  I acknowledge the Minister acknowledged my amendment on the repurposing of buildings.  In that sense, we are trying to strengthen and clarify the mandate that we give him, and even almost the conditions of the mandate that we give him, to write regulation.  That statement is important because it relates back to some of the amendments that were ruled out of order.  I will not talk about them but will simply state that they relate to the same issue.  It is one thing to say that there are grounds for refusing amendments, and they were refused already, but  some of them have been ruled out of order simply using the argument that the Government might not like it and are against the effects of the Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#VV01200"><p>I will utter a single sentence that will make things very clear.  Much as it is proper for us to add conditions in respect of regulations that we give the Minister, it should also be proper for us to say that we do not wish to transfer power to a Minister to make regulations in terms of excluding a particular section of the Bill.</p> <p>The amendment refers to the powers or elements that I ask for the Minister to include in the regulations that get made under section 9(d) and there are four key issues that must be addressed.  For me, these are essential issues in terms of addressing problems that will come up.  One is that there will be appropriate procedures to allow for the screening of projects regarding the environmental impact assessment and appropriate assessment.  The Minister mentioned the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, of the regulations that is going to happen.  That is the overall regulations and looks at their strategic environmental assessment.  My reference to an appropriate assessment relates to the impact on a Natura 2000 site.  It is very hard to see how an appropriate assessment of a scheme, which does not have a geographical specificity but applies to any area of planting of a certain size, potentially, anywhere, can satisfy the requirement for an appropriate assessment in terms of Natura 2000 sites.  In such an assessment, one needs to ask when we plant here whether it has an impact on a nearby or related Natura 2000 site.  Very blunt measures like simply the distance from a Natura 2000 site are not necessarily going to be sufficient to ensure that anything that gets planted under this provision will not need a further appropriate assessment.  That is why I want it, even if it be a streamlined measure, to be different from the Forestry Act, in that there would be a screening whereby each project would have some mechanism where it is considered.  The screening is not to do those things but is where there would be a consideration of whether this particular project needs an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment.  Somebody making that decision for each project is really important and needs to make it with clear criteria.</p> <p>The other parts of my amendment relate to a concern that I mentioned to the Minister before and I refer to the loophole clause.  It is more of an unravelled thread than a loophole in terms of the strip planting.  The amendment states that there would be "criteria and limitations that shall apply to where a woodland area is greater than one hectare", and by "woodland area" I mean a native forest area.  There is a concern that we end up with a situation whereby anything that happens to hit the 20 m width would end up falling into the native tree area.  One may have a situation where one almost incentivises people to keep and trim expanding native tree areas so that they do not expand beyond the 20 m area, which, I imagine, is a perverse incentive that we do not want.</p> <p>It is crucial to include "measures to protect existing biodiversity and ecosystems", which will be a core element of the scheme.  I am very concerned that the hawthorn tree was defined as a shrub in the last debate.  I say that because if we had a situation where hawthorn trees were dug up as one of the most core environmentally biodiverse pieces because they did not fit the criteria so that somebody could plant a willow tree then that is not good for nature or for biodiversity.  We really need measures to ensure that does not happen because at the moment, it is not clear why that would not happen.  It is crucial that we protect existing biodiversity and ecosystems.  We do not want to create a perverse incentive where we just have lines of trees but lose nature and ecosystems.  Even if those trees grow in ten or 15 years' time, then the actual pathways, pollinator pathways and wildlife corridors can be lost if there is a period of grubbing.  I remember that we have had great lengthy debates here.  I know that the Minister feels that this Bill has been here for ever but we had a lengthy debate on the Heritage Bill when we discussed hedgerows and how the impact of grubbing on biodiversity is very telling.</p> <p>Last, I wish to address two core concerns that came through in the last Committee Stage debate.  In fairness, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, has given me some traction on this matter but it is vital that it be addressed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It relates to concerns about this scheme being used for commercial planting.  The concern about willow planting or biofuel planting potentially coming indirectly under this scheme has been mentioned.  Moreover, there is concern about the grants being given in respect of long-term forestry projects only.  This part of the amendment is a reasonable compromise that addresses both these issues.  It addresses thinning, and while thinning can be problematic, there are to some extent certain cases in which thinning might be needed.</p><p>Second, the amendment addresses the requirement for continuous cover such that if, under the Bill, areas of native trees are to be planted, continuous cover will be a goal and requirement.  That is a little more than the 20% canopy requirement under the Forestry Act 2014.  If we are saying we will do something special with these areas, the idea of continuous cover is a good one, such that there will not be, for example, any clear-felling and it will not be the case that something that has been planted will be removed wholesale.  That is a core requirement.  It will give some greater credibility to this scheme in respect of its impact on nature.</p><p>My contribution has been lengthy but I tabled four separate amendments which, for the purposes of expediency, have been combined.  I hope the Minister will indicate how these issues are going to be addressed and, in particular, how he foresees the environmental impact assessment or other appropriate assessment unfolding.  Is there a promise of protection against biodiversity destruction?  What are his thoughts on the issue of continuous cover?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#WW00200"><p>I thank Senator Higgins for her significant work on the amendment.  It comprises, as she said, four subsets of ideas, all of which are reasonable.  Her argument is strong, good, robust and well founded and I am impressed by how she condensed her points in her contribution.  It resonates with me because the Irish Environmental Network made similar points and highlighted these issues.  I acknowledge that body for its close work with environmentalists in all parties and none.  Some people think they are advocates for organic farming only or other specific issues, but most of us are advocates for sustainable development, sustainable farming, respect for biodiversity and so on.  I am certainly one of them, and all my colleagues on this side of the House have firm records in respect of these matters.</p> <p>Senator Higgins spoke about the environmental impact assessment or other appropriate assessment and the impacts thereof, and the measures to protect the existing biodiversity and ecosystems.  We are legislators and, as we are told time and again, this is the Upper House.  We have the power to amend legislation and polish it up.  Of course, the problem is that there is in place a broad Government involving a tripartite regime, that is, a three-legged stool in the form of the coalition of the Green Party, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  Most Senators come to the House with a script they read into the record and, therefore, there is no leeway for real engagement and debate, although that might be different in the case of the Minister during this debate, as I hope it will be.  The amendment is logical, referring to the environmental impact assessment or other appropriate assessment, criteria in respect of woodlands and measures to protect the existing biodiversity and ecosystems.  How could the Minister, or anyone in this House, not agree with that?  It is worthy of support.</p> <p>I acknowledge the NGOs in the environmental sector, which daily grow more disillusioned by the political system because the people they helped to elect and thought were representing them do not seem to be doing so any more.  They have left them behind, whether for expediency or whatever other purpose, but that is another day's work.  I am constantly reminded by those NGOs, as are other people, of their involvement in and concerns about this area.  The amendment resonates very much with what they and others have championed.</p> <p>I thank Senator Higgins for taking a lead on this and for tabling the amendment, in respect of which she has my full support.  I hope the Minister will in some way address those key issues, even if he cannot accept the amendment.  He might give us some reassurance in respect of his commitment and that of his Department to this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.204" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1636" speakername="Paddy Burke" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#WW00300"><p>I did not agree with Senator Boyhan when he said that many Senators come to the Chamber with scripts.  I think he was referring, in particular, to the Government side.  Senators on all sides of the House have spoken for themselves and made their own points and their own cases.  The debate on this Bill is just one example of that happening.</p> <p>Likewise, I did not agree with Senator Higgins when she stated that the grants should be for long-term projects only.  There has to be a balance between long-term projects and the need for the harvesting of timber.  It is more than likely that modular housing will be coming downstream, and there will be a greater need for timber as a result.</p> <p>I raised the issue of planning permission with the other Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Heydon, during the previous debate on the Bill.  The system of applying for planning permission is very cumbersome.  People have to apply for many licences, including felling or harvesting licences, in order to remove timber.  This is an area the Minister might examine.  The process should be streamlined.  When a planning application is submitted, it should be dealt with all the way from the planning stage, through harvesting and on to extraction.  As he will be aware, there was recently a very difficult period in which people were seeking harvesting licences and there was a significant backlog.  He will know that better than anyone given the county he is from, Donegal, where a great deal of timber is produced.  His Department should consider issuing one pass, from planning all the way to harvesting and extraction.</p></speech>

I am keen to hear the Minister reassure Senators in respect of how we will protect the environment and environmental law with the regulations.  Part of my frustration and that of the Irish Environmental Network - I am sure Senator Higgins will agree - relates to the fact this provisions of the Bill have not undergone any pre-legislative scrutiny.  That is part of the problem.  This paragraph was introduced without that scrutiny, which is why we are raising these concerns.  For instance, the wording as drafted is such that the regulations "may" have regard to &ldquo;the requirements of the environmental and environmental law&rdquo;.  Surely that should state "shall have regard for" them.</p> <p>I am keen to hear the Minister's response to Senator Higgins's points in order to reassure us that the Bill will be robust and will not result in maladaptation, even if it is going to pass tonight.  He might reassure us that there will not be planting of native species in the wrong places because that would have an impact on the riparian environment and peatlands and would realise all the concerns we raised on Committee Stage.</p> <p>I will support the amendment.  I commend Senator Higgins on tabling it.  The Minister might reassure us in respect of what I outlined, given that the provision in question was rushed in without pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></speech>

Given what is happening throughout Ireland, whether through schools, community organisations or farming groups, this ethos of planting trees has taken root - pardon the pun - in the past five or six year in particular.  Co-operative societies have been giving perhaps 200 trees per year to farmers in order that they can plant on their hedgerows and build them up, which are a really positive part of the environment that has changed dramatically over the years.  This legislation will go a long way towards removing any anomaly that may exist whereby farmers might be deemed to be offside.  Even in the case of my community, which has started a campaign of planting trees including through our local school, I would be fearful that without this legislation, those elements of the community could be deemed to be offside.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must acknowledge that the idea of going out and planting trees of such nature, indigenous trees, in our urban and rural environment is something that should be promoted.  This legislation is a very important part of that.  I welcome it and I believe that the Minister is doing the right thing.  If there is any loophole it would be closed here tonight to ensure that community groups and farmers have done the right thing over the last few years.  It is a very positive step.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#XX00200"><p>It is important to remember that this legislation is born out of a passion for planting trees and for increasing the footprint of forestry across the country, and for ensuring that everyone can take part.  That is where it is coming from.  Sometimes, it is more appropriate to do things in regulations than in primary legislation.  It allows one to do the appropriate assessments.  I understand that this is where it is coming from.</p> <p>I agree with a lot of Senator Boylan's comments.  People are looking for assurances, and that is fair enough.  When this came before us on Committee Stage a lot of the ideas were welcome.  I would agree with a lot of what is being said and the ideas that are there.  We just want to make sure that this is in the regulations and that the proper consultation happens, which should happen under appropriate assessment so that all the ideas and expertise that people have will inform the regulations.  As I have said, and I go back to the very important point, without this legislation we would not have the idea of small-scale planting.  That is where we want to get to.  I thank all Members for their contributions and I thank the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#XX00300"><p>I thank all of the Senators for their very constructive suggestions on this.  I have an update on amendment No. 7.  There had been a request previously for a note to be sent from my Department to supply statistics on local electoral areas.  I can confirm that this had been forwarded on as part of the debate on that amendment.</p> <p>I thank Senator Higgins for the comprehensive explanation and description behind the rationale for putting forward this amendment.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly described very well the rationale behind this Bill and the objective to promote forestry and native woodland planting, and that it is very much born from the passion to improve and increase on that planting.</p> <p>Senator Higgins's amendment proposes to insert four additional categories of conditions that may be prescribed under a regulation.  It is asking that the legislation would prescribe specifically what should happen under the regulation.  I believe that the existing conditions in the Bill provide ample scope to include the points raised by the Senator in the proposed amendment.  In particular, the Bill references conditions having regard to the environment and to environmental law, which would be an integral component of any new scheme developed.  The Bill as it stands requires that this would have to be a key component of any new scheme that is developed by the Department under this legislation and under regulations.</p> <p>The requirements for conditions will be fully considered also during the strategic environmental assessment, in which, very importantly, the public will be able to participate.  The public will be able to feed in and contribute as part of that and the appropriate assessment.  Following on from the completion of both of those, and subject to their findings, the Department would then finalise the design of the scheme and associated qualifying criteria, which would then become conditions of the plantation scheme itself.</p> <p>As Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, there are things that are appropriate to regulation and there are matters that are appropriate to the actual scheme itself, and then there are the key overarching principles that are contained in primary legislation, which we are passing here.  I feel that the issues being raised, on which the Senators have very constructively contributed, can be included and considered as part of those assessments in advance of any scheme being put in place and, very importantly, it provides the opportunity for the public to participate in that formulation also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#XX00400"><p>I am certainly looking forward to the public engagement.  That is good and I hope there will also be - as has also been committed to previously - engagement directly with Members of the Oireachtas who have shown an interest in this area by the Department.  However, I do still have outstanding concerns which are not really addressed.  To build on what Senator Boylan has said, the context is that we did not have pre-legislative scrutiny, which would have been very important.  In something such as this, it is always a concern when the Bill has not been through pre-legislative scrutiny first of all.</p> <p>I appreciate that the Minister has indicated he is open to the kinds of points I have been raising, and I have no doubt that the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, is open to those points.  The problem is that there is no guarantee for us, as we hand over the power to regulate away from the hard powers in the Forestry Act into the secondary power area of regulations.  For example, it says that regulations "may" provide for different things.  I know this from debating the climate Bill.  We talked at length about what different language means.  "Have regard to" is not in fact very binding language.  Under this provision at the moment it is only requiring that they "have regard to" the requirements of the environment or environmental law.  It is not "comply with" or "be consistent with" the need for increased planting of native tree species, public safety and others.  Again, there is a concern there.  This is why I was trying to improve this section of the regulations.  There is also an overall concern that we do not know what will be in the regulations.  We do not know if they will address properly those issues of the environment and environmental law.</p> <p>The strategic environmental assessment and a public consultation is one thing, but I reiterate that it is not clear to me how a scheme can do an appropriate assessment with regard to Natura 2000 sites.  Natura 2000 sites are specific and real places.  The question then is, will what happens have an impact on them.  Given that we do not know where these native tree areas will be, again this would be a very nuanced issue.  Is it going to be a blunt measure of distance from a Natura 2000 site?  What will the criteria be for assessing whether or not there would be an impact?</p> <p>If it is simply about size, we have the case law that has come through.  Case law in the European courts, specifically cases C-392/96 in forestry and C-66/06 on size-space thresholds, is very clear that simply because a thing is small or of a particular size this does not exempt it from having to go through the proper environmental considerations.  How an appropriate assessment gets done on this scheme is the kind of detail we could have teased out if we had pre-legislative scrutiny.  Perhaps the Minister will understand that this is the context in which I had looked for something that strengthened the appropriate assessment in my amendment.  I really do not see how it is going to be done in a way that will be consistent with environmental law.</p> <p>I also want to pick up on another issue with these regulations and the intent.  I do not doubt the genuine passion of the Ministers who are putting it forward, but when one creates the power to make regulations they can change and they may or may not continue to serve the purposes as set out here.  For example, we heard an appeal for this to be used for forestry.  Then we would have crop planting being used and planted in a way that would bypass the forestry legislation, which is not something we should be aiming for.  Once we make these powers, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, or the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, or future Ministers, may use them.  This is why it is really unacceptable that attempts to insert a sunset clause, or even a review and renewal clause, in this legislation has been blocked.  This fundamentally undermines the democratic balance between Parliament, the Oireachtas and the Executive.  That is a serious issue and I will be raising it at the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would set an extraordinarily dangerous precedent in terms of the transfer of powers between Parliament and Government.  I wish to be clear on that.  The Minister is in the crossfire on that issue but it is a concern.</p><p>To conclude, as most of my other amendments have been ruled out of order, I will not be coming in on many amendments.  I wanted to come back to the biodiversity and ecosystem piece.  The Climate Change Advisory Council was very clear about planting the right tree in the right place.  The regulation does not specify exactly how we will determine, not the right size, but the right place when planting trees.  That is a core issue we need to get to.  Planting trees is good but not always.  Any tree is not necessarily the right tree in a particular localised biodiversity area or ecosystem.</p><p>The Minister did not answer the question on continuous cover.

The Bill provides the platform to enable that to happen.  It also sets key principles that will inform the regulation and the scheme.  The points the Senator has raised are points that can be accommodated and considered further.  There will be opportunities for involvement through the Oireachtas committee system, the wider public consultation system and environmental assessments, to ensure the scheme that is put in place is appropriate and achieves its objective, as well as being a balanced scheme.  I thank the Senator.  It has been useful to have this engagement but I believe the Bill, as it stands, will accommodate the points she has raised.  They will be further reflected on with much wider involvement and participation in regard to the framing of the final scheme.</p></speech>

I thought the other amendments in this area were going to go forward but they have not.  This amendment is about the Schedule of native tree species.  Perhaps this needs further consideration but I am sure the Acting Cathaoirleach will be very aware of this issue.  There was an assumption for many years that Ireland no longer had a native pine and that it had become extinct.  In recent years, good work has been done by local community activists and environmentalists in Clare, in particular, where they have found a native Irish pine, closely related to the Scots pine, in the Burren area, which is now being cultivated and recognised.  In the wording of this, it would be important in the place where a limit is put on the amount of Scots pine, that a similar limit be put on the amount of native Irish pine to ensure we do not have a tree planting area that is predominantly pine.  It is about acknowledging this and including it in the Schedule.  Whether or not it can be done now, I hope it will be done in the future.</p> <p>This relates to a number of concerns around the Schedule on native tree species.  I know Senator Boyhan has been clear on concerns about yew trees, about which the Minister might speak again.  When we talk about the right tree in the right place, there are many situations in which yew is the wrong tree.  It can be quite a dangerous tree when planted in certain areas.</p> <p>I am devastated that hawthorn is not included in the Schedule.  When one talks about a Bill in terms of what is rewarded, one must consider the laws of unintended consequences and perverse incentives.  I am concerned by having these trees recognised as native trees but not having a hawthorn recognised as a native tree.  According to the debate last week it was defined it as a shrub.  I have never heard anybody call a hawthorn tree a shrub.  There is a danger that we could incentivise people to dig up hawthorn trees in order to plant trees that will qualify under this Bill.  If there is a danger or jeopardy, and perhaps it needs to be set out specifically in the regulations on biodiversity, to a tree that does incredibly important ecosystem-work.  The hawthorn is not a tree that people who plant trees love because it is messy, spindly, and it literally protects nature.  It creates a dense part of the undergrowth system.  It is not as simple as the trees that can be easily thinned, the kinds of trees people might like to plant because they are easy to manage, plant and grow, as well as move around.  A hawthorn is a tree that works for nature and has been reflected in our culture for thousands of years in the protective role it plays in nature.</p> <p>I am concerned the hawthorn is not on the Schedule list.  I would also like the Burren pine included on the list, or at least a process to achieve that.  When the Minister responds to me on this amendment about the Burren pine, he might also indicate how the Schedule can be amended.  Would it be through new primary legislation or through other processes?  What if we find negative situations emerging through the planting of yew?  What if we see excessive planting of willow because it is easy?  What if we see hawthorn or other trees being removed in favour of trees on the Schedule, or any such perverse incentives?  This is why the review clause that was ruled out of order would have been so important.</p></speech>

The native Irish pine is one tree, but the question is the context in which it sits, which is the Schedule.  I would like to know what is the mechanism whereby the native Irish Pine, or other trees excluded such as the hawthorn, may be included in the Schedule in the future?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If it is the case that trees are included in the Schedule - perhaps that is where the native Irish pine should be - then they should be reviewed in terms of the impact they are having.

I say fair play to her for referring to the crataegus and to other trees.  I also say well done to her regarding her commitment in respect of this entire area.</p> <p>To go back to the native Irish pine, it is important that we acknowledge the tremendous work of the botany school and environmental faculty down the road in Trinity College Dublin.  They have done a great deal of collaborative work on this and a lot of research.  I hope the Acting Chair will indulge me for a moment, but when I was making some inquiries about trying to restrict Scots pine, I was somewhat surprised about the native Irish pine, the Burren pine.  Such a thing does exist, and I went down and had a look at some of the paperwork relating to it.  I ask the Minister and his officials to take stock of and look at that because it is exciting.  This is something that we should look at and seek to increase.</p> <p>I genuinely have concerns about pine trees, given the problems arising now due to pathogens and diseases with some pine trees in Ireland.  That has been well documented by Teagasc.  We are familiar with Dutch elm disease and ash dieback.  We must be very careful.  Let it be a marker to us all here today.  Teagasc has serious concerns about the pathogens relating to some pines and that is something on which we need to keep a watchful eye because we do not want it to get out of control.</p> <p>I am very happy to support the amendment.  I say well done to Senator Higgins for the imaginative way she got a number of trees into it.</p></speech>

Regarding the amendment the Senator has tabled, which is to insert the native Irish pine, the Burren pine, I understand that the reference relates to the small population of Scots pines in Rockforest, County Clare, which are said to be derived from the original native Scots pine trees.  While people refer to these trees as native Irish or Burren pine, these trees are still considered Scots pine and will therefore be eligible to be considered for inclusion in any future scheme aimed at planting native tree areas.</p> <p>As the existing provisions in the Bill already facilitate the planting of native Irish pine, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The good news is that it is covered and will be accommodated in the future.  The other good news is that because the hawthorn is categorised as a shrub and because the legislation facilitates within the regulation of the schemes the promotion of shrubs, it can also be included.  We are pretty well covered and, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

There is a valid point that we do not want to see all pines in any of the plantings, and that is the case with the restriction of 25% that is set out in section 9(a)(b).  There would not be more than 25% pines, so it is good that it is covered by that as well as it being good that it can be included.</p> <p>I am glad about what the Minister said about hawthorn but we will all be watching the regulations like hawks in relation to the question of biodiversity and the planting and ecosystem context, so it is not just about trees or particular trees.  The question of how shrubs get planted will be really important.  The devil will very much be in the detail of the regulations so that we do not have anything that incentivises the removal of existing biodiversity.  That will be crucial.  In that context, I will not press the amendment, but I will look with some interest at the regulations.</p></speech>

We spoke here at great length over quite a number of meetings with the Minister and two Ministers of State.  As has been said, this is new territory for the Minister and for everyone in circumstances where we are closing down a business.  There is no problem with that across the floor of the House, but there is a problem with the way people have been treated by the Department.  There is a lot of mistrust, which was spelled out by various Senators on all sides.  I hope that the assurances that were given to us by the Minister of State on the previous occasion and that the Minister will give to us again today that when it comes to compensation that the farmers and workers will be happy when it all comes to a conclusion.</p> <p>The appointment of an assessor will be very important.  Whoever the successful assessor will be, he or she should be acceptable to all sides.  The farmers should have a say in who the assessor is and find the person acceptable.  Previously, we saw in disputes with various Departments or local authorities that a former county manager or someone of that nature was appointed.  In this case, I hope there will be some input from the farmers when the person is appointed as assessor.  The person will be appointed by the Minister after a panel and interviews.  This is a big blow to the farmers and to their workers.  They are losing their livelihood and the farmers are losing very lucrative businesses that they have built up over many generations, as the Minister has outlined.  We must be very fair to them and to the workers.  The two week statutory redundancy is all that the farmers have to pay.  The Department, through the assessor, must make sure that four, five or six weeks are paid to the workers and that the farmers are recompensed for handing over that or making sure that the workers get it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There will also be problems with the disposal of asbestos.  That must be taken into account.  It seems the Grant Thornton report was not carried out on the ground at all but was done using Google, from what I am led to believe.  That does not give a fair reflection of what happens under the roofs of buildings.  It does not reflect what has been built and the amount of effort and cost that have gone into putting buildings in place.  I hope the assessor will carry out a thorough investigation of the three farms.  It is not a big ask to visit all three farms.</p><p>There was an issue about whether the compensation would be based on three years' income or five years' income, while the farmers were looking for ten years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, said that three years is the norm but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is going for five years.  Why should it not be ten years?  If a company takes over another company, the company being taken over will more than likely get a chance to build up and make itself profitable and to flush its sales or whatever else.  In this case, those farmers had no opportunity to do that.  Had they known this was coming down the tracks, they probably would have changed tack and may well have increased sales over the past five years, cut down on costs or made their farms more profitable.  I ask that the assessor looks at the ten-year proposal from the farmers.  I hope the Minister will look at all of those issues.</p><p>It is a sad day for the farmers and workers who are here.  It is the end of the line for some of them.  Some may never work again.  It is a sad day for me, as a Member of the House, to say we are closing businesses.  I have never before seen legislation that closes businesses pass through these Houses.  We know the reason those businesses are being closed and there have been no objections from anybody in this House.</p><p>I wish the Minister well with the legislation.  The appointment of the assessor will be important and I hope the Minister gives some say to the farmers on that appointment.</p></speech>

For the benefit of my colleague, I never read any statement I make in the House.  It is a gripe I have.  If a Member is reading a speech, who knows who wrote it?  I try to keep on top of my brief, come into the House and speak.  I will do that now.</p> <p>I compliment the Minister on being in the House this evening.  Since our respective appointments to our positions, this is the issue on which we have had most contact.  I have had contact with the Minister and his officials.  I feel for the people in the Gallery.  I have tried to represent them in consultations with the Minister as best I could.  The Minister has been a willing and able partner in those negotiations.  I fully get what he has been saying.  He cannot negotiate a compensation package on the floor of the Chamber.  That will be done through the regulations.  I, for one, have no reason to doubt the Minister's bona fides.  He has shared the draft regulations.  He will meet the farmers before the regulations are finalised.  He has also given a verbal commitment to do something about the workers' compensation.  I have no reason to doubt him.  However, despite the fact that the legislation will have passed when we leave this evening, I will not be going away.  I will still work for those farmers, workers and families to ensure the Minister delivers the best deal possible for them.  I thank him again for his co-operation during every stage of this matter.</p></speech>

We have debated it for ten or 12 hours.  It has been a significant debate.  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine also went through the Bill.  I am not going to rehash the arguments about just transition and how communities and families are going to be affected.  This is a significant moment.  We are closing an industry because of Government policy.  That is a heavy burden on us all tonight.</p> <p>We have spoken about compensation, whether the time concerned should be three, five or ten years, and where it will kick in.  The Minister and his office have given significant commitments during the last eight or ten hours of this debate.  The Minister is a man of his word and we will hold him to it.  I have confidence the Minister will deliver for these people and communities.  We in this Chamber are giving him exceptional powers on the back of the commitments he has given to us.  I am very aware of that and will watch with interest and an open brief to make sure these families will be protected, going forward.  Senator Burke was right when he said some of these people will never work again.  It is an unusual day for this Chamber when we are casting the die on someone's working career.  I am very much aware of that.</p> <p>There are issues around compensation and just transition for the communities.  The Minister has made good commitments in that regard and I look forward to seeing them being followed through upon.  Society needs to be protected.  While "big government" is a dangerous phrase, I am sure the Minister, having given his honourable word, will stand up for these farmers and ensure they get an honourable deal.</p></speech>

I am concerned specifically about the lack of guarantees around the workers' package.  The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, made the point that this is not the place to negotiate the package.  I get that and I was clear in that regard.  I was, last week, seeking a negotiation of the principles that would underpin a package and I was disappointed that those principles were not accepted.</p> <p>I agree entirely with Senator Burke when he said that we should be talking about compensation with regard to an enhanced redundancy package based on weeks per year of service.  We need to be talking about a significantly enhanced package.  I would suggest a minimum of six weeks' compensation per year of service.  </p> <p>A number of us, across parties, have become engaged with this process because we have heard at first hand the dramatic impact on the workers themselves.  We received correspondence from the farmers this week telling us just how anxious and stressed the workers are.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To be frank with the Minister, they do not have confidence in the way he is doing this.  If they had confidence, they would not have travelled from Kerry and various other parts of the country this evening.  It was frustrating not to be able to discuss their concerns here at length this evening.  The Minister has the scope to do more.  The decisions ultimately come down to him, not his Department.  He has power over the Department.  I have no qualms about calling on him to ensure a full and generous package is given to these workers to enable them to move forward with their lives.  It is shattering to see their livelihoods taken away, notwithstanding that all parties agree these farms have to close.</p><p>My last word is that in the event these people are not treated fairly and given a generous package, I assure the Minister I will bring the matter back into this Chamber.  I am sure I will not be the only one.  We will watch intently to see how the Minister keeps his word to these workers after their shabby treatment.  He could have done more, met with them and given them reassurances at any point over the last months.  He chose not to.  I went out of my way to try to give a formula of words last week that would give some assurance about the principles involved and fairness.  The Minister of State, acting on the Minister's behalf, chose not to.  The Minister has much to live up to.  He should not let these workers and their families down.</p></speech>

We are all in favour of the ending of mink farming, but we are concerned about the workers and how they will be treated.  As I have said repeatedly on all Stages of this Bill, there is a concern not just in the short term for the workers in mink farming who are directly affected, but also about the precedent it sets for workers with the just transition.</p> <p>In the medium to long term, we will watch how the forestry provisions of this Bill are implemented.  It goes back to the fact that there was no pre-legislative scrutiny and whether this legislation is coming from a good place, which I do not doubt.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, is committed to environmental issues, forestry and native woodlands, but we have to future-proof legislation because there might be a different Minister in the future.</p> <p>The concerns raised by the Irish Environmental Network are all legitimate.  I hope they will not be realised and that we will not see woodlands being planted on peatland or on riparian habitats.  We should not remove hunting grounds for birds of prey by planting all along motorways.  We have heard repeatedly that the provisions are for small-scale planting.  However, it could be 20 m wide and I have heard nothing to convince me that there will be no limit on the planting of native woodland under this exemption.  I hope the concerns raised will be addressed in the regulations.  We will be watching not just how the workers on mink farms are treated, but also to make sure that regulations for forestry address the legitimate concerns of the Irish Environmental Network.</p></speech>

It has been a difficult debate.  A cohort of Senators from all sides of the House have followed this through on all Stages.  I will put myself in a mink farmer's boots tonight.  I think I would be disappointed and disheartened.  They have come tonight from Donegal, the Minister's constituency, from Laois and from Kerry.  They have businesses.  The message that has to go out, loud and clear, is that all of these mink farmers are decent, upstanding people with the utmost integrity, who have operated legitimate businesses within the law, complied with tax and regulations, and have had previous engagement with the Department.  They are not an underhand operation.  There is no illegal activity in this operation in the State.  In my mind, they are entrepreneurs, farmers, businesspeople, and respectful people who have put their money on the table, toiled hard and reaped some rewards.  Suddenly, as a result of a decree by the Government, through legislation, it has been decided to wind the farmers' legitimate businesses down.  Next week, it could be someone involved in turkey production or something else.</p> <p>We heard much talk about sustainable farming, rural development and commitments to rural communities.  We have continuously heard that.  The Government prides itself on supporting town and village centres and rural people, communities and enterprise.  What message does this send to these people who wanted to continue their business?</p> <p>I have always opposed mink farming.  I do not think it is right.  It has passed.  It was supported and encouraged, as the Minister acknowledged, by his Department.  I take some comfort in his words.  He said he wants to be fair and equitable, and that he does not want to have a deal on the floor of the House, which I can understand.  This is not the place to be dealing.  We were left with no option, because these farmers had little or no leverage.  The only leverage they had is on us as elected politicians in this House.  We have the power and capacity, if we have the support, which I accept and respect, to change the legislation.  No amendment was accepted.  This is par for the course with all sorts of legislation under this coalition Government.  There will be a time, in a few years, when the parties will have to split up and go their own ways.  They will share the frustration that some of us in the Opposition have every day with all legislation.  It is clearly a numbers game.</p> <p>I do not doubt the Minister's commitment to rural communities or to the people of Donegal, including the mink farmers who reside and operate in his constituency.  In principle, there are many good aspects to this Bill.  It is the nature of politics that one comes in here to tease out issues and to make amendments.  That is the reality of politics, which I respect at all times.  I have hope from what the Minister said.  He recognised that farms are legal and compliant, and that the farmers are decent people.  He recognised that their livelihoods will suffer.  They will drive away to the north west or wherever else, dejected in some ways, as I would be.</p> <p>I am trying to get myself into the shoes of others.  At the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I, more than anyone, was rigorous and robust in my questioning of these farmers.  I think they will admit that themselves.  When I teased it out more, the concern was not animal welfare, because I am clear where I stand on that, but the livelihoods and businesses of compliant entrepreneurs.  I hope the Minister will keep in touch with us and them.  I hope he will set out to seek to support them and be conscious that, whatever deal we do with these farmers and their families, there will be impacts for them personally, their businesses, employees and communities.  I say to the people of Laois, Donegal and Kerry that we have done our best within the confines of the political system.  That is all we can do.  They will have their moment and opportunity to voice their concern and make their judgments about this legislation.  We have done our best within the parameters of the system.  It now rests with the Minister.  I am more than confident that he will be decent and fair, and that he will deliver for these people.  Hopefully he will keep Senators in the loop.</p></speech>

It is a positive Bill and a positive story.  We have known for a long time that mink farming had to end, as it has in other countries.  I would say it is a cruel practice, which is now recognised.  Only by ending it do we enable businesses to be compensated.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must pass the legislation in order for that part to happen.</p><p>In answer to issues around the ending of mink farming and small-scale farming, regulations are put in place.  That is the way legislation works.  The Minister has been consistent, as have all the Ministers, in that they truly care about the people behind this and getting it right for them.  It is difficult when people cannot see the regulations in front of them.  I appreciate that but each farm will have to be assessed individually.  That is just the reality of it.  I will return to the point that the Minister has consistently said he will be fair.  We have also consistently said that we want a small-scale planting scheme that increases our native woodland.  That is where we are trying to get to with this.  Our hearts are in the right place.  People being able to involve themselves in the consultation, as they can under an SEA and appropriate assessment, is the correct approach.</p><p>I understand the points that have been raised around people not knowing what the make-up of future governments will be but, let us be honest about it, primary legislation can be changed too.  We have to have some level of trust in the Ministers who are in place at the time to get the regulations right.  The best way to do that is to have appropriate assessments, which we do not have in legislation.  That can only be done when it is time to put the scheme in place.</p><p>I believe this is the correct approach.  I look forward to the consultation.  As I said, many of the issues raised were very valid.  </p></speech>

It will also make a real difference to how we can promote forestry nationally.</p> <p>There is no doubt that it is a very sombre day for the farmers here.  It is highly significant.  It is not something the State does lightly and not something it likes to do.  These farmers and their families have a long history and tradition in this profession.  As Minister, I understand that is significant, as we all do.  In bringing this to a conclusion, I will meet promptly with the farmers to finalise the regulations.</p> <p>I recognise the role my staff has played in this.  I know there is not agreement at this point, but people are coming to it with the right motives.  It is very important we reach a fair outcome that recognises what this means for farmers and their employees.  I am glad the legislation has now passed and we have concluded this so I can take that forward and finalise that stage.  I thank the Senators and the Acting Chairperson for their co-operation throughout the passage of this Bill.</p></speech>
