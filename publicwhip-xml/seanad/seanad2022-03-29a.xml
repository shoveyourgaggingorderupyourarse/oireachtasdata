Like many public representatives, I recognise the importance of the housing adaptation grant, the housing aid grant and the mobility aid grant for many constituents.  These grants can be, and for so many are, life-changing and they ensure many of our older population and those with a disability can continue to live in their homes in comfort, with the continued support of their loved ones.  Nevertheless, I have been getting an increasing number of worrying calls from applicants to all the grants indicating they cannot afford to proceed with these grants given the rising building costs and the current limits on the grants.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In many cases the 95% maximum of the &euro;8,000 housing aid grant is simply nowhere near what is needed to replace those ancient windows, those out of date electrics or that leaky roof.  The &euro;30,000 available under the housing adaptation grant will not ensure that a loved one can continue to live at home, supported and cared for by those who know him or her best.  I am sure I do not have to tell the Minister of State that in many cases I and other public representatives who I speak to are dealing with applicants who have no other option than to consider moving out of their homes or for a family to consider full or part-time care for their children or family members in nearby appropriate facilities.  The costs to these applicants and the State are worrying in the extreme.</p><p>I also want to raise the situation of tenants who are waiting for work to be done by their local authorities.  In many local authorities I know that a system is applied by the council with the A list being the highest priority and those who receive a C listing being the lowest priority.  In many local authorities the waiting list for those on the A priority list is growing.  I am informed that the allocations to tenant upgrades are far less than what the Government offered to private homes.  If a number of extensions are needed in local authority homes this will result in little or no other works being carried out, given the cost of the building of such extensions and the amount of funding allocated to these grants by the Government.  Many of us have asked why these are not rolling grants, which would allow local authorities to plan this work as opposed to waiting on a yearly announcement from the Department as is currently the case.  It must be difficult for councils to be waiting on word each year on how funding will be allocated in order to plan tenders and associated works, while at the same time, with growing building costs, having to return to the Department for approval for works over certain limits.</p><p>I want to thank the local authority officials who work on these apartments.  I have always appreciated their co-operation and assistance and they go above and beyond the call of duty for so many people on a daily basis.  When I raised these issues last year I was informed that the Department was carrying out a review of these grants.  I sincerely hope the Minister of State can bring us some good news today.  Building costs have dramatically increased in recent years and I am currently directing many applicants to the community welfare service to try to bridge the gap and allow as many applicants as possible to carry out the work they need to qualify for, and in so many cases, that they desperately need.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#C00200"><p>I will give a general outline and then I will come back to the Senator's specific points.  Our Department provides funding to local authorities under the suite of housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability, to assist people in private houses to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs, which also facilitates early return from hospital stays.  Our objective in this is to keep older people living at home and independently for as long as possible.  The grants include the housing adaptation grant for people with a disability, the mobility aids grant and the housing aid for older people grant, which are 80% funded by our Department, together with a 20% matching contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The detailed administration of these schemes, including assessment, approval, prioritisation and apportionment between the three schemes, is the responsibility of local authorities.  Funding of &euro;81.25 million is available nationally in 2022 for the housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability scheme.  The receipt and processing of housing grant applications has continued successfully throughout the pandemic and the carrying out of such works was specifically exempted from the construction restrictions under the public health regulations which were put in place.</p> <p>The Housing Options for our Ageing Population policy statement emphasised my Department's commitment to streamlining the application process and ensuring that grants were more accessible to applicants.  In this regard, my Department engaged with all 31 local authorities in 2019 to review the detailed administration of the grants.  My Department also engaged with key stakeholders, including the National Disability Authority, ALONE and Age Friendly Ireland, which helped to bring greater clarity to the development of a single application form and updated guidelines.  Subsequently, a revised single application form to cover the three grants, which was tested for plain English, issued to all local authorities together with revised guidelines for implementation.  My Department is working to ensure full implementation of the new process, which will make the grant application process more accessible as well as standardising the individual local authority approach.</p> <p>In addition to this improved streamlining of the grants scheme, Housing for All commits to undertaking a review of the range of housing grants available to assist with meeting specific housing needs, both for our ageing population and for people with a disability, which includes a review of the existing grant limits and income thresholds applicable to the grant schemes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This review is currently under way and it will be completed later this year.  It is important to highlight the increased allocations for 2022, which were issued earlier this week to each local authority.  The increase represents more than 8% of a national increase in allocations, continuing the overall year-on-year increases in the grants since 2014.  However, I acknowledge that construction costs have stayed ahead of this 8% figure.  This is a significant issue about which there is no doubt.  The Department is conscious of it and it will work with the local authorities to resolve it through the review process.</p><p>Again, I acknowledge the role of local authority staff.  The Senator is correct that they have been, and they continue to be, exemplary in the support they are giving to communities and to families who are trying to steer through this grant application process.  The issue of rolling grants might be included in the review and it is something I will take back to the Department as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1684" speakername="Mark Wall" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I am very much aware there is one form for the three different grants.  That has helped about which there is no doubt.  However, the problem at the moment is that I have to direct the majority of applicants with whom I am dealing to the community welfare service, which is another arm of Government, in order that they can complete their grants.  The &euro;8,000 limit is simply not good enough.  To take the &euro;30,000 limit as an example, the cheapest building costs the person could get amounted to &euro;70,000.  Yet, the grant only offers &euro;30,000.  The person is still in hospital and cannot leave.</p> <p>It is like what the Minister of State said in that we want people to return home and to live in the comfort and care of their loved ones.  That is what this is all about.  The reason I mention those grants is to see if those limits will be increased to reflect rising building costs.  I hope that is being looked at the moment.  It cannot happen quickly enough for those who need the grants.  Many of these grants are stalled at the moment because people simply cannot continue with them, because they do not have the money.  That is the problem here.  I hope the Minister of State will address this as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

This is, in itself, a testament to the success of the grant scheme.  There is significant uptake.  There is always a waiting list.  However, we have to give consideration to the rising building costs.  They are unfortunately affecting every sector of Housing for All, as well as all of our plans.  I hope the review will give consideration to all these issues and, in particular, the issue of which the Senator speaks about, namely, rolling grants.  The critical thing we are trying to achieve here is to keep older people living in their homes for as long as possible, with the support of carers and their loved ones.  That should be our ultimate goal.  That has always been the aim of this particular grant scheme.</p></speech>

I thank him for coming in to answer this matter.  I raise this matter because it has been brought to my attention by an Independent county councillor in Cork, Mr. Declan Hurley.  Much attention has been paid in recent weeks to the rising cost of living in Ireland.  We are not unique in that respect in the western hemisphere.  From cuts in excise duty to lump sum payments, the Government is engaging in a suite of measures to aid families and individuals in maintaining their standards of living in the face of inflation.  This is to be recognised and to be commended.</p> <p>One area that has proved particularly problematic is that of energy in its broadest sense, from home heating to petrol to home electricity to broadband.  Earlier this month, the once-off payment of &euro;125 to those who are in receipt of the fuel allowance was allocated.  This was a bonus to those who are feeling the pinch of rising costs in that area.  However, a key aspect of this kind of assistance is the threshold associated with it.  The cut off, which is usually based on income, decides exactly how many households can avail of it.  As important as it is to raise payments, lump sums or awards to react quickly to changing circumstances in the economy, it is equally important to examine and to appraise the threshold.  </p> <p>Many families find themselves having to pay close attention to their weekly earnings.  They are becoming wary of additional sources of income and raises as they may end up losing out on items of State assistance, resulting in a net loss of income.  While making this distinction between eligible and ineligible households is flawed, it remains the most efficient way of administering such schemes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, this only remains true if that threshold accurately reflects the reality of the experience of families in the country and is raised or lowered to maintain the balance of expenditure and need.</p><p>In light of the expenses faced by families in the area of fuel and energy, I ask the Minister for Social Protection to make the necessary arrangements with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to raise the qualifying income threshold for the fuel allowance.  The current income levels for receipt of the fuel allowance are as follows: &euro;373.30 for a single person aged under 80 years; &euro;542 for a couple where the qualified adult is aged under 66 years; and &euro;600.30 for a couple where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over.</p><p>My ask of the Government is that the fiscal examination of the effects of the inflation on fuel and heating costs take place and that this informs a raising of these income thresholds by an amount deemed proportionate to allow households with stretched budgets to avail of the support.  I ask that the Minister for Social Protection indicate whether this option is one she will investigate.  If not, what measures does she have in mind in order to further alleviate the burden of heating costs on the most vulnerable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#E00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am taking the question on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs through a combination of financial supports, energy efficiency awareness initiatives and investment in programmes to improve the energy efficiency of housing stock.  Much of the latter is being done through my own Department with regard to the local authority stock.</p> <p>On the fuel allowance payment, as part of budget 2022, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, announced a &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate of payment with immediate effect.  This brought the weekly rate up to &euro;33.  A number of expansions to the eligibility criteria for the fuel allowance payment were also announced at that time.  The weekly means threshold for the fuel allowance scheme was increased by &euro;20 to &euro;120 above the appropriate rate of contributory State pension.  This represented a 20% increase in the threshold and enables more people to qualify for this support.  With effect from the start of the next fuel season, the qualifying period for jobseekers and supplementary welfare allowance recipients to access the fuel allowance payment will be reduced from 15 months to 12 months.  The Government has, therefore, implemented significant expansions regarding the fuel allowance through budget 2022.</p> <p>Further Government measures were only recently announced to help mitigate the effects of rising energy costs caused by the war in Ukraine and wider international energy challenges.  As part of this package of measures totalling over &euro;500 million, an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to all households in receipt of the fuel allowance payment.  It is expected this additional lump sum will cost an estimated &euro;49 million in 2022.  This means low-income households will see an increase of 41% in fuel allowance support provided during this fuel allowance season compared with the previous one.  A recipient household that would have received &euro;735 in fuel season 2020-21 would see an increase of &euro;304 to &euro;1,039 in fuel allowance payments in fuel season 2021-2022.  When taken in conjunction with the electricity costs emergency benefit payment, due to be paid in April, this household would have received over &euro;500 in additional targeted Government supports over the course of this fuel season.</p> <p>The fuel allowance is not the only payment available from the Department of Social Protection to help people with their energy costs.  The household benefits package comprises the electricity or gas allowance and the free television licence.  In 2022, the estimated cost of the gas and electricity element of the package is &euro;203 million and will benefit over 476,000 households.  The gas and electricity element is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month for 12 months of the year.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Department of Social Protection operates both exceptional and urgent needs payments as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need that they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through the community welfare officers.  The provision of any further additional supports to those in receipt of the fuel allowance payment would have cost implications and could only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p> <p>It is important to note significant interventions have been made by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and across Government to try to tackle this current crisis around energy costs.  In the long term the strategy must be to deep-retrofit our homes, including both local authority stock and private housing stock.  The general incentives brought in by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for the local authority stock will, over time, make a significant impact.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, we are cognisant of the fact that the challenge remains for people now.

I appreciate his reply but it is not enough, judging by the way things are going with inflation at the moment.  While I know the green agenda means getting rid of coal eventually, the price of a bag of coal has gone up by 50% since last September and it will go up again in May with the increase in the carbon tax.  The price of 1,000 l of oil is almost &euro;1,500.  What the Government is giving at the moment is simply not enough in the context of current inflation rates.  The Government definitely needs to do more with regard to increasing the threshold for the fuel allowance.</p></speech>

That said, there is no doubt that the transition needs to be managed and that is something of which the Government is cognisant.  We are mindful of the fact that we need to support families through the crisis that has hit us all.</p> <p>The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and her Department have not been found wanting in terms of trying to ensure that supports are put in place to protect vulnerable households.  As part of budget 2022, the annual increase of &euro;5 per week in the fuel allowance had an immediate effect in bringing up the weekly rate to &euro;33.  This, coupled with the additional measures that the Minister introduced, is part of a broader suite of progressive measures that the Government is considering.  The Taoiseach was speaking about this in the D&aacute;il earlier.  We are continuing to review the situation to see what additional supports we can put in place to ensure that families can meet these challenges.  There is no doubt that this is a real challenge for Government.  Our capacity to address these issues is limited but we have been progressive to date.  We will continue to evaluate, monitor and support people in whatever ways we can.</p></speech>

A year ago I tabled a similar matter and the Minister of State was also kind enough to respond on that occasion.</p> <p>I am seeking an update from the Department of Education on the status of two school building projects in Ballinasloe in the context of capacity for children at primary level.  I am referring to Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa, with which the Minister of State is familiar and also to the site acquisition for St. Teresa's Special School.  The Minister of State has visited St. Teresa's Special School and is familiar with its location in Ballinasloe.  I am seeking a response today on the status of these projects.</p> <p>Since raising the project at Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa last year, there has been very positive engagement between the design team, the school's board of management, the principal, Ms Christine Connor, and Galway County Council.  There were challenges related to access roads for the new school building and Galway County Council was to engage with the Department of Education to reach an agreement on how this would be managed going forward.  The design team also had to add three additional classrooms to the plans, which have now gone back to the Department for review.</p> <p>We need to move this on.  I want to see this school building included in the Department's capital infrastructure plans for this year, as a priority project.  We need to move this along so that it can be considered in June or July for the 2023 budget.  Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa caters for close to 300 children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The children have to cross roads to get to the school, which was created in 1996.  We are all aware of this.  The families have gone through the school.  There are parents - mums and dads - who were promised a school and who now have their own children going to the school.  I would appreciate any update the Minister of State can give me on the issue.</p><p>Second, I am asking about the site acquisition for St. Teresa's Special School, which is dedicated to the education of children with moderate, severe and profound special needs and autism.  We are very fortunate to have the school.  The 11 students have now increased to 36.  In the past week we have also seen an announcement for two extra classrooms for additional accommodation, which was very welcome, because the children there were in the canteen.  They now have a space.  I got to visit it last week with the Minister of State and the principal, Anita O'Reilly, and it was phenomenal to see the space that is there for children.  As well as that, the Minister of State will be delighted to know that they held their own St. Patrick's Day parade a day before St. Patrick's Day.  All the children came out festooned with decorations and were walking or in wheelchairs with their carers.  It was pure joy for families and children in that school.  We need to deliver a proper school and adequate space for the children.  The Department of Education indicated that a 4-acre site had been secured with the HSE.  Could I request an update on what stage this is at?  Has the property been secured and is the process finalised?  Is it at stage 1 preliminary design or has it moved to stage 2 design?  Who is the contact for the board of management and the principal in the school?</p><p>I appreciate the Minister of State's time and her consideration of these questions.  I acknowledge the work of the board of management with the special educational needs organisers, SENOs, who put forward the case to justify the need for the space in Ballinasloe.  We want to welcome and support families coming to our area from Ukraine in our schools but how are we going to do that when we cannot even accommodate the children who are there at the moment?  The schools are already over capacity.</p></speech>

It is a major building project that is planned for Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa, and there is also the major building project for St Teresa's Special School.  I will deal with Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa first.</p> <p>As the Senator is aware, it is included in the Department's construction programme, which is being delivered under the national development plan.  The brief is to provide for the demolition of the existing school building and the construction of a new school building to include 16 general classrooms, with 13 special resource rooms, two speech and language resource rooms and a two-room special educational needs, SEN, unit.  Senator Dolan mentioned that there has been considerable delay.  I agree that has been the case.  There has been back and forth between the local authority and many different stakeholders regarding the matter, which has been less than satisfactory.  However, some of the questions were legitimate and had to be answered.  I note that there is a review of the specifications for the provision of the extra three classrooms currently with the Department.  Once the review is complete, comments will issue to the board of management and its design team in order that we can bring the project forward.  It is unfortunate sometimes that with the best will in the world these things can be delayed.  It is going to take everybody to come together to try to resolve all of the issues.</p> <p>The Department is in communication with the school authorities and its design team and is committed to assisting the school in every way it possibly can.  We want to make sure that children have access to a proper building in order that they can learn the various curriculums they need to learn in a satisfactory way.  I understand that the design team has been asked to review all of the plans it has been given.  Until planning permission is secured, it will not be possible to give a timeline for the project proceeding to tender stage.  The planning and building unit is under the remit of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, but she will be aware of the fact that this issue has been raised in the Seanad today.  The Department will be aware that Senator Dolan has tabled this matter for discussion in a Commencement debate.  That will concentrate minds in terms of delivering on this project.</p> <p>I visited St. Teresa's Special School with Senator Dolan.  It is a wonderful school environment with a wonderful principal in Anita O'Reilly and her incredible team.  It was a very special day when we were able to announce the fact that the school would be moving.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Josepha Madigan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will be a brand new, eight classroom special school with significant ancillary accommodation on a greenfield site.  At the moment it is providing for 36 pupils.  It will probably be in a position to expand.  At present it is in temporary accommodation in two temporary classrooms to deal with immediate needs.  The Department is in communication with school authorities around the appointment of a design team and a progression of the project into architectural planning.  I understand it is at an advanced stage of the conveyancing process, which is positive.  It is moving, albeit that it sounds slowly, but there is always a process when talking about conveyancing.  The i's need to be dotted and the t's crossed.  It is happening incrementally.  As Minister of State with responsibility for special education I have asked the building and planning unit to make sure that this is expedited as soon as possible because obviously our children with additional needs who are most vulnerable are in less than satisfactory conditions at the moment and we want to make sure that they are rehoused in a more satisfactory way.</p></speech>

I know there are always reasons for these delays but it is so frustrating because, what do we say to these parents?  What do we say to these children when it goes on year after year?  What I would ask is that the Department with the design team, having worked with Galway County Council - and again to acknowledge there has been very positive engagement over the past 12 months - submit the application for planning.  As the Minister of State said, until it goes through to planning, until we get the statutory approvals through planning permission from Galway County Council, we cannot move to the next stage.  I want to see that happen.  That has to happen.  Last year I believed that was going to happen in April or June.  I thought we would be at a different stage right now with this school.</p> <p>I understand there has been accommodation for extra students and all of this has to happen.  However, I am asking for the Department to prioritise this project in particular, that we would support them every step of the way, be it supporting the board of management and the design team which is engaging proactively with Galway County Council.  Meetings have been set up on this issue.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for the information on St. Teresa's Special School.  It is absolutely crucial that we see that project move and I understand that it is now at stage 2, the design stage.  Is that correct?  The lands comprising a 4-acre site have been transferred from the HSE to the Department of Education.</p></speech>

As I said I am doing all I can to make sure that is expedited because they are children with additional needs.  I know the school, the incredible team and staff there and indeed the children.  It was wonderful to hear about their St. Patrick's Day festival.  I hope that will be expedited as soon as possible.</p> <p>In regard to Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa, Galway County Council has had issues with the planning permission but both sides need to resolve the conditions there.  The most important aspect of this is communication and that there is ongoing engagement and collaboration to move it forward so that they can get planning permission as soon as possible.  There were a number of delays due to the Department having a new team of engineers.  For example, there were requests from the local authorities and there were access and planning issues.  I think the majority of those have been resolved so now it is a matter of the Department communicating with the school authorities and the design team, and committing to assist the school in every way it possibly can.  We are trying to oversee that as best we can.</p></speech>

I am sure that, like me, he agrees that for our researchers it is essential that there is a very strong and clear career path for them and that as part of that, their pension entitlements are clarified and indeed that they are entitled to pensions.  One of the things that we have invested a great deal of time in recently is around enhancing the research capacity of the technological sector.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Unfortunately, we still do not have a resolution on the pension entitlements of those researchers working in the technological sector.  The Minister of State will be aware of the impact on the former Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, as part of the new Shannon university, of not getting clarity on the pension issues for research there and the concern that is causing.</p><p>If a person is to be employed as a researcher in one of the traditional universities as opposed to the new technological universities, he or she is treated in broadly the same way.  The same terms and conditions apply across the board with perhaps one significant exception relating to pension entitlements.  The pension entitlements of those in the traditional universities, for the most part, have been clarified.  It is clear they are treated as public servants for pensionable purposes.  Those in the technological university sector are not.  Those in other State agencies, such as the Marine Institute or Teagasc, are treated in the same way as the traditional universities for pensionable purposes.  </p><p>There is an equity question with respect to researchers.  There is also the question of allowing our technological universities in a very competitive market to be able to build their research capacity.  They must be able to ensure their research staff are treated in the exactly the same way.  I understand, because of some of the historical questions, why this issue has not been resolved until now but this has been on the desk of the current Department and the previous Department, the Department of Education and Skills, for quite a number of years.  There have been individual queries and the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, has raised this on a regular basis.  I do not know why it cannot be solved.</p><p>Even in situations where those researchers are funded by some of our State agencies, if they receive their funding from Science Foundation Ireland, the Irish Research Council or the Health Research Board, part of the funding or grant allocation includes allowing for pension coverage.  This is a question of equity and of allowing higher education institutions to be able to compete on a level playing field in respect of researchers but, most importantly, it is about giving those researchers who have been impacted some level of certainty.  THEA has estimated that approximately 450 people are impacted by this.  This issue has been doing the rounds for years.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could give us some clarity and certainty with regard to the final decision that will be made on these pension entitlements.</p></speech>

The question relates to the fact that researcher grades such as postdoctoral researchers, for example, have access to public service pensions in some higher education institutions but this access is not universal across the sector.  My Department is currently working to support that standardisation of researchers&rsquo; pensions access in the higher education sector and has been engaging with the management bodies in the higher education institutes affected on the issue for some time.</p> <p>Researchers in the institutes of technology and technological university sector do not have access to public service pension schemes.  Researcher grades in traditional universities and other public sector bodies do have access to these schemes, as the Senator outlined.</p> <p>My Department has been engaging positively with the management bodies in the higher education sector, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Education to establish the requirements of a business case to support access to the single public service pension scheme for this group.  Significant data have been sought by my Department in order to make a comprehensive and supportive case to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which will made a final determination in this case.  Most recently, further engagement with the sector took place with a view to establishing forecast data for future researcher numbers in the institutes of technology and the technological universities.  These data will be incorporated into the overall business case, which is advancing well at this stage, and I expect it to be finalised shortly.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Niall Collins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2205"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2205&amp;amp;pid=NiallCollins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The enablement of greater research capacity in the technological sector is a key factor in the technological university agenda, as Senators will know, along with other critical issues my Department is working on, such as the OECD review of academic contracts.</p><p>The Technological University Act was enacted in 2018.  Since then, we have seen huge growth in the sector.  We are soon to have five technological universities with the establishment of Atlantic Technological University on 1 April.  That will followed soon after by the establishment of South East Technological University on 1 May 2022, about which Senator Malcolm Byrne knows very much.</p><p>Previously, the focus of the former institutes of technology was on teaching and regional engagement.  The need for research in the sector is now more prominent.  The Technological Universities Research Network, TURN, report was published in 2019.  The report made 12 recommendations that will provide the technological universities with a solid foundation for their development.  These recommendations fall within three thematic areas that the report has identified as being key building blocks for successful technological universities.  One of these thematic areas relates to building research capacity.  The report identified that research capacity would be enhanced through increased funding in human capital development, such as staff development and recruitment among other areas, for human capital growth.  I am satisfied that this will be key in achieving strategic objectives for the sector under the Technological Universities Act 2018.  The business case that my Department is working on will support this development.</p></speech>

There is very little I would disagree with, except that the answer that has been prepared for him does not respond directly to my question other than to say that his Department is continuing to work on this matter and that there will be an answer shortly.  The researchers who are impacted by this situation are concerned because many of them have heard that the issue will be resolved shortly for quite a long time.  The institutions that are impacted also have a difficulty.  The Minister of State will be very familiar with one of them because it is on his doorstep.  To localise this matter, what is happening means that the University of Limerick, UL, and Shannon can offer researcher posts with the same job description.  However, UL can provide certain guarantees regarding pension entitlements for the researcher that Shannon cannot.  That is unfair, and the situation is replicated right across the country.  The Minister of State indicated that the matter will be resolved shortly, but a timeframe would be very much appreciated.</p></speech>

The Department and I fully get that pension entitlements are fundamental to people taking up jobs.

Today, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, announced a series of welcome reforms to the leaving certificate.  I ask for a debate on those reforms in the very near future, which I am sure can be facilitated.  I particularly welcome the introduction of two new subjects, one in the area of drama, film and theatre studies, and the second in the area of climate action and sustainable development.  The latter subject is the critical global issue of our time and many students will be interested in it.  The greater emphasis that will be placed on the arts in our school system is also welcome.  The introduction of a new subject in the form of drama, film and theatre is very welcome.</p> <p>Any passenger who has travelled through Dublin Airport recently, and I know several, will have complained of the long delays at security.  These are not just long but completely unacceptable delays.  When people ask if they turn up two hours in advance of their flights, and short-haul flights at that, whether they will be guaranteed to get through security and catch those flights, and Dublin Airport authorities cannot guarantee it, that is not acceptable.  In a progressive country such as ours, to send out a message that Dublin Airport is incapable of ensuring there is a sufficient number of security staff to be able to process the large number of passengers that can be expected is just not acceptable.  We know we are coming towards the Easter holidays when we will see an increase in the numbers and will be moving into the much busier summer season.  I ask the Acting Leader to raise this with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, as a matter of urgency, and that he receives guarantees from the authorities at Dublin Airport that they can ensure passengers who are there do not have to wait an unreasonable length of time to go through security.</p> <p>I will raise the matter of the census.  I encourage everyone to fill it in this coming weekend.  I ask that we consider, for the next census in 2026 and beyond, moving it onto blockchain, and that we look at having a dynamic blockchain-enabled census and new ways for the State to gather and utilise data.</p> <p>In addition, I wish all the census enumerators the very best of luck as they knock on doors and try to gather census forms.  I am aware of a small minority of muppets who are trying to cite some nonsense that the census does not apply to them.  One of the things we need to remember in this State is that we have many rights as citizens, but we also have responsibilities.  It is an individual's responsibility to fill in his or her census form.  I ask that we stand in solidarity with those small number of census enumerators who have received abuse on the doorsteps and that the full rigours of the law will be faced by those who refuse to fill in their census forms.</p></speech>

I was education spokesperson in the previous Seanad and have a keen interest in the area.  I support Senator Malcolm Byrne's call.</p> <p>The main reason I rise is to raise a matter relating to the Revenue Commissioners.  I have been inundated with calls from people who cannot get through to Revenue.  There is a helpline open.  Revenue closed its offices to the public at the start of the pandemic in March 2020 and its offices are still not open for in-person meetings.  Every other public and private sector organisation is open.  It is fine going online but it is not everybody's cup of tea to manage their affairs online.  Some people find that if they have a technical issue, they are not able to resolve it through the online service.</p> <p>I visited the office of the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin today.  I visited the office in Limerick on Friday.  Neither of the offices was open.  Revenue is taking calls in the morning but trying to get an appointment online or a place in the queue is very difficult.  It is a difficult situation.  It is not easy for older people or for people in general.  I am looking for the support of this House.  We should write to Revenue and call on it to go back to in-person meetings.  This has happened in every other private and public sector organisation.  It is time for Revenue to reopen its doors.</p></speech>

Today is the day of his funeral.  He was educated at St. Conleth's College, approximately a mile from the House.  He discharged his function has a journalist with great bravery until he was murdered by Russian soldiers as part of Vladimir Putin's murderous, illegal and criminal invasion of Ukraine.  It is important this House notes the occasion.  An Irish citizen was murdered by the Russians.  We should never forget who was responsible for this and who took the decision to unleash that savagery on the people of Ukraine.  To all of Mr. Zakrzewki's friends in Ireland, I express my deepest sympathy and condolence.</p> <p>I raise the need for a debate in this House on the provision of private rented dwellings.  A foolish decision was made last year when it was decided that all tenancies which last more than six months should become tenancy contracts of indefinite duration.  This came from a Department that is blighted by making stupid decisions.  The same Department wiped out bedsits with a four-year delayed proposal when then Minister, former Deputy John Gormley, was in charge.  That was a so-called reform in the interests of improving the standards of tenancy accommodation.  We now have shared accommodation, which reverses the entire thrust of that initiative.</p> <p>The point I want to make is that if anyone wants to know why private landlords are now deserting the rental market in droves, it is because we have stupidly and at the behest of the same Department introduced a law to the effect that all tenancies which last more than six months cannot be terminated except on one of four statutory grounds.  The consequence of that is that people who simply wanted to let a house for five years with no questions asked and no reasons given, one way or another, cannot do so anymore.  They must have one of the statutory grounds for evicting their tenant in the long run, whether their relationship with the tenant is good or bad, or antagonistic, no matter whose fault the antagonism is.  Those landlords are stuck with those tenants forever unless one of the four statutory grounds exists.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I am not a slave to market ideology, but we intervene in markets at our peril.  We did this with bedsits and we saw the consequences when 10,000 to 15,000 dwellings for the most vulnerable of people were annihilated.  Now, we are doing the same again.  We are driving private landlords out on the presupposition that they are all in the same category as real estate investment trusts investing billions of euro in Ireland and that they can take tenancies of unlimited duration in their stride.  They will not.  As a consequence, a very serious mistake has been made.  I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister to come back to the House to explain why it is necessary to have contracts of indefinite duration and what the consequences of that have been for the supply of private rented dwellings owned by private landlords.</p></speech>

The theme is dismantling Israeli apartheid and developing Ireland's strategy.  The keynote speaker was Michael Lynk, who is the UN special rapporteur on human rights for the occupied territories.  He has written six reports and he was absolutely clear today that Israel is an apartheid state.  In making that statement, he joined not only Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch but 450 human rights organisations across the world.  He set out very clearly the legal case proving the statement to be true.  As part of his presentation, he shared some quotes from Israeli politicians.  I thought it would be good to share them with colleagues here today.  I will start with the current Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett.  He says: "I oppose a Palestinian state, and I am making it impossible to conduct diplomatic negotiations that might lead to a Palestinian state."  Israel's current Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yair Lapid, is due to take over as Prime Minister in 18 months.  This is an interesting quote from him: "My principle says maximum Jews on maximum land with maximum security and with minimum Palestinians".  That is pretty clear, is it not?  I should not even need to bother with this quote from Benjamin Netanyahu.</p></speech>

I will not divide Jerusalem, I will not evacuate any [settlements] </blockquote> <p>The one disappointing part of the engagement with Sadaka today was the fact that every political party was invited to send representatives.  Just two parties did not bother.  It will not surprise anyone to learn those two parties were Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  I commend Senator Martin, who did attend and spoke very ably on the issue.  I want to say very directly to the Acting Leader that both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are standing on the wrong side of history when it comes to this issue.  Thanks to Senator Black, we have the occupied territories Bill.  It needs to be passed because otherwise the record will show that this Government did not take the steps required to challenge apartheid as it exists today.</p><p>One of the other things Michael Lynk said was that, when looked at in detail, apartheid as applied in Israel is much worse than the apartheid regime in South Africa.  For example, in South Africa they did not say only these people could walk on particular roads but they do that in occupied Palestine.  I appeal to the Deputy Leader for a further discussion on this issue.  I would also like an explanation as to why neither Fianna F&aacute;il nor Fine Gael bothered to send a representative to that conference today.  It was appalling and it went down like a lead balloon.  It is time we all took a stand for justice.  We should remember how we tackled apartheid in South Africa back in the 1980s.  We came together to apply sanctions.  We have a route to do that via the occupied territories Bill and we should do it.  There are no excuses for the Government not to act on this issue.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of talk in the past number of weeks about our Defence Forces and what future they should or might have within Europe and on the world stage.  The desperate and unjustified attack by Russia on the sovereign state of Ukraine has concentrated many minds on this subject.  I read yesterday that Cabinet is discussing increasing our defence budget to &euro;2 billion from the current expenditure of approximately &euro;1 billion.  In any conversation about the future of our Defence Forces, serving members and their representative associations must be to the forefront.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A number of public representatives have called for those representative associations to be allowed to affiliate to ICTU and many of us have been doing so for a number of years.  Indeed, the recent report by the Commission on the Defence Forces recommended such an affiliation.  The Minister could immediately allow the Permanent Defence Force Other Rank Representatives Association, PDFORRA, and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, to affiliate and to position themselves for forthcoming public pay talks.  I appreciate that a debate on this issue has previously been requested.  I chaired a Commencement matter in the House recently in response to which the Minister indicated he would return to the House for a discussion on the report on the future of the Defence Forces.  It is beyond time that debate took place and I ask the Acting Leader to request that debate as soon as possible.</p><p>Separately, I welcome a report published yesterday by Kildare County Council entitled Local Just Transition Plan for West Kildare and recognise the importance of it to so many people who live in that part of my home county.  The plan sets out to identify projects to support and advance sustainable social, economic and environmental development in the transition to a low carbon future in west County Kildare.  Given the historical dependence of this region of Kildare on Bord na M&oacute;na and given the many great bogs in the area, this report and the way in which its recommendations will be supported and implemented will be crucial to all those who live there.  The economic and social indices of this region need the urgent supports outlined the report.  I look forward to working with Kildare County Council and the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly on the needs of this region.  The many great communities of west County Kildare, including Kilberry, Kildangan, Monasterevin, Rathangan, Ballyteigh, Milltown and Carbury, need the support of this report.  They need investment urgently and I look forward to working with the House and Kildare County Council in that regard.</p><p>Finally, I again raise the issue of secretarial pay.  The Acting Leader, as a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, has spoken about this previously.  We had a debate in the House a number of months ago about the urgent need to justify the pay of our secretarial assistants.  I have not heard much recently, other than having read about it in national newspapers.  Will the Acting Leader or the Cathaoirleach update us on the issue?</p></speech>

It was hosted by Sadaka, the Ireland Palestine Alliance.  As my colleague, Senator Gavan, said, Michael Lynk, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Palestine, presented some stark findings from his latest and final report on Palestine.  His assessment is damning.  He concludes, in agreement with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other organisations, that Israel is an apartheid state subjugating the Palestinian people and denying them dignity and the right to self-determination.</p> <p>Crucial to this assessment is Israel's construction of 300 illegal, Jewish-only settlements in occupied-territory housing for more than 700,000 people.  Not only does this expose Palestinians to daily acts of violence from settler extremists, who represent the most radicalised section of Israeli society, but it precludes the formation of any spatially and demographically coherent Palestinian state, which is a key part of the peace process.  For the Palestinians living under Israeli apartheid, life is fraught with physical violence and state oppression.  Checkpoints are erected in a random and arbitrary fashion, which impedes Palestinians&rsquo; movement and leaves them subject to aggressive colonial policing by Israel Defense Forces, IDF, soldiers.  Israeli citizens, including settlers in the occupied territories, enjoy the protection of a civil court system, with fair procedures for those accused of a crime; Palestinians are subject to an alternative justice system comprising military tribunals, with a 99% conviction rate.</p> <p>For the Palestinians living in Gaza, conditions are even worse.  Israel restricts the entry of food and the supply of electricity and medicine.  The former UK Prime Minister David Cameron, hardly a radical, has described Gaza as an open-air prison.  Indeed, it is an open-air prison that is periodically carpet-bombed by the Israeli military in an unjustifiable, disproportionate response to rocket fire from Palestinian militants.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I believe they call it "mowing the lawn", and that is in an open-air prison.  That is what they are doing.  It is half the size of County Louth and what is happening is horrendous.</p><p>It is not only Amnesty International but Human Rights Watch and the UN special rapporteur also used the term "apartheid", as did a former Shin Bet director, Ami Ayalon, a former Attorney General of Israel, Michael Ben-Yair, former Secretary General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, and, most importantly, people who have lived through and defeated apartheid in South Africa, including, the Nobel laureate, Desmond Tutu, and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor.  In diplomacy and international law, language matters.  If a Member of the Oireachtas referred to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a "skirmish", we would rightly rebuke him or her for failing to capture the gravity and magnitude of the crimes being committed.  We cannot be coy about this.  I feel frustrated, as the Deputy Leader can imagine, and I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, come in and discuss these findings by Michael Lynk.  I am happy to hear that the Minister will be meeting Michael Lynk tomorrow, but I would like it if a representative from Fianna F&aacute;il would also meet him.  I call on somebody from Fianna F&aacute;il to have a meeting with Michael Lynk in order to hear about his report.</p></speech>

With the collapse of the aviation sector during the pandemic, we all accepted that there would be some recovery time needed but what passengers at Dublin Airport experienced last weekend was unacceptable.  I appreciate that the Dublin Airport Authority is taking necessary steps in hiring and training the necessary staff but it is unbelievable that we have airlines asking passengers to come to the airport three and a half hours before their appointed departure times, even for short-haul European flights.  Something has gone dramatically wrong.  I ask that the Minister would come to the House to provide an update on the situation.  I encourage people to use Cork Airport as a means of flying to Europe and the United Kingdom because it is a passenger-friendly facility and the queues there are much smaller than those at Dublin Airport.  Notwithstanding that, it is important that the Minister come to the House.</p> <p>I ask that the Minister for Education would also come to the House to debate leaving certificate reform.  All of us who have been involved in education, as the Acting Chairman has, welcome the changes announced today.  We welcome the fact that the written examination will be worth no more than 60% of a student's exam results at the end and the fact that some students will be able to sit a particular exam in fifth year.  The initiation of change is one part but clarity, engagement, consultation and delivery of the final piece of the leaving certificate reform are why the Minister should come to the House.  I ask the Acting Chairman and the Deputy Leader to ask her to come to the House as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

We will never know the true extent of the efforts of volunteers around the country but they are at work everywhere and I thank all of them.  We are sorely aware, however, that injustice and suffering continue the world over.  In Afghanistan last week, the Taliban reneged on a promise to allow girls to attend secondary school, with thousands of girls turned away from school gates.  One girl, who spoke to the Afghan news outlet TOLOnews, burst into tears as she described being "turned away after waiting 186 days - she had counted - for school to resume.  She asked: "What is our crime?  That we are girls?"</p> <p>On the other side of the world, a so-called liberal democracy shows similar signs of authoritarian leanings.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau received a wake-up call in the European Parliament last week when he addressed it on the topic of growing threats to democracy and failed to count himself among those threats.  Last month, I spoke about Mr. Trudeau being the first Prime Minister in Canada's history to invoke the powers of the Emergencies Act, which were used to violently quell a legitimate protest.  At the European Parliament session, it was stated that the world had watched how, under the quasi-liberal boot of Trudeau, women were trampled underfoot by horses and how the bank accounts of single parents were frozen so they could not pay for their children's education and medicine, for utilities or make mortgage repayments.  I received, as I am sure many colleagues have, correspondence from an Irish citizen living in Canada.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This one is from Paraic, who is originally from Connemara.  It states:</p><blockquote>	I cannot board a plane in Canada to fly to Ireland because I am not vaccinated.  The Government of Canada has set a mandate that states that no unvaccinated person shall board a plane, train or bus, whether to travel domestically or internationally.  I believe it is the only country in the western world that has imposed this sanction on the unvaccinated population.  Although I was able to be medically exempt from this by my doctor because of a PCR test, the parameters that the Canadian Federal Government set out to the no-travel rule does not allow me, and likely does not include most people.  The Canadian Government has set the following terms as to what is not an emergency and urgent travel.  These are: travel to visit family, attending weddings, funerals and attending to personal matters, such as buying a house, seeing or caring or sick family members, discretionary travel, such as for a vacation or recreation and situations where activity can be held virtually. </blockquote><p>These are our citizens who are locked up in another country and who cannot travel back to their own native homes.  This requires immediate intervention by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  I ask the Acting Chair to bear with me as I am nearly finished.  </p></speech>

The two big main players in this country at the moment are the ESB and Coillte.  We should know their plans going forward.  This behoves the Minister to come into the House to outline that to us.</p> <p>The other issue I would like to raise is on the tariffs that are being paid to domestic customers.  I feel that that tariff should be raised.  This is because the ESB is enjoying free electricity from people who are putting some energy into the network and no tariff is being paid at the moment.  They have raised the price of the charges that they are charging for the ESB.  The gas companies have, too.  Yet, the tariff does not seem to have gone up.  The tariff that has been set, or that has been proposed to be set by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is 10 cent per unit.  That tariff should be raised.  It should be paid to the domestic customers immediately, because they are supplying into the grid as it is.  </p> <p>I would also like to raise the issue of battery packs.  There is some ambiguity about whether you need a battery when you have a smart meter.  Some people are saying you do need a battery.  We need the Minister to come in here as a matter of urgency to deal with all of those issues.  We are in a great position here to produce energy.  We will have long days from now until September.  The domestic input can be quite sizable, as well as the main production, whether it is onshore or offshore, or whether it is the ESB or Coillte, or the ESB and Coillte working hand in hand to produce a resource that we have in abundance in this country.   We should be tackling this on all fronts.  </p></speech>

Nobody has ever accused pensions of being sexy, but there is the reality in the demographics in Ireland and in the changes in the population that mean that we have to prepare for a pensions crisis that is coming down the road.  It is entirely appropriate therefore that the Government would put this scheme in place.  I welcome the fact that employees will benefit both from contributions from their employers and from the State.  It is perhaps the most effective way that we can prepare people for retirement and we can prepare the State coffers to deal with the fact there will be a huge number of people who will be pensioners and who will essentially be paid for by people who are working.</p> <p>The question I have, and this is why I think we should ask the Minister to come into the House for a debate on this, is on how this will function for self-employed persons.  People who are self-employed do not have the benefit of an employer paying into their pension.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is no auto-enrolment for them and yet we have said so many times self-employed people are the backbone of the economy.  They are the backbone of employment within this economy.  Small businesses and people who take the initiative to set up businesses and take on the burden, risk and responsibility of being an employer will apparently not benefit from this auto-enrolment scheme.  May we therefore have a debate whereby we talk about how this scheme is also going to work for small business owners, self-employed persons and sole traders?  How is it going to work for them?  What is the State going to contribute to their pensions so they are not left behind when the time comes?</p></speech>

As the Acting Leader may know, the new four-month deferral policy is now in effect but it seems that, contrary to assurances from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service during a Newstalk interview on 22 December of last year, the service has suddenly decided to continue to include oral sex between men as grounds for deferral.  Women who have had sex with bisexual men will also continue to be deferred for four months instead of the previous 12 but again, the man in this scenario may be free to donate during that period while the woman is prevented from doing so.  No explanation has really been given for these and saying it aloud it all seems a little topsy-turvy and does not follow logical sense.</p> <p>Due to a freedom of information request from a member of the public, my understanding is the initial plan was to move to a three-month deferral for gay and bisexual men.  However, during one of the meetings, one of the attendees suggested a four-month deferral and it seems this was just accepted.  No scientific or other kind of basis for this suggestion was given during the meeting, beyond simply that France was implementing a four-month deferral at the time.  In the meantime, Ireland was importing blood from England despite the latter never having a four-month deferral.  It has instead moved from 12 months to three months and is now at an individualised assessment for all donors.  It seems this four-month period was plucked out of thin air to mimic France and even France has moved away from it.  It seems every piece of evidence shows this new deferral policy has zero basis in science or medicine and is instead purely ideological.  That is no way to run a national blood service, especially when the scientific alternative, namely, individualised risk assessment for all donors, is available and easily implementable.  It is in use in Northern Ireland and Britain, from which we are currently importing blood.  They do not have this deferral system.</p> <p>This is not the first time the issue of blood donation has been raised in the House.  It is not good enough we are running our blood donation service based not on scientific reasoning but instead on a seemingly ideological basis.  I wanted to raise it in the House because doing the above is not good enough.  Blood is a vital service.  It literally saves lives.  Our blood service still seems to be using this unscientific method despite assurances year after year and I believed, from the programme for Government, that this was going to change.</p></speech>

Since last September, the industry has seen huge losses on a continuing basis.  I was talking to pig producers in Barryroe on Friday evening.  They have been losing up to &euro;50 per pig on a continuous basis since last September.  These are multimillion euro losses.  It is affecting both the milling companies and the manufacturing of the product itself at the other end.  It is a high-input product where a low value is put on the meat itself at the end of the process, which is disappointing.  The real issue is that this is our third biggest sale of product going out of Ireland from the agricultural industry.  It is third behind milk and beef.</p> <p>It is a very important entity in west Cork, in particular.  We have Staunton Foods and we have 40 pig farmers there.  That is 40 families attached to this industry for decades.  They do it to the very best of their ability and are renowned throughout the world for what they do.  This industry is on the brink at the moment.  Unless we have really significant investment by the Government, we could lose our pig industry, which is one of our most important entities.  We are looking at a scenario where the cost of feed has gone up by 90% since last September.  The costs of energy and transportation have increased dramatically.  We are looking at 10,000 jobs and &euro;1.8 billion in sales to the economy.  We could lose one of our real prime cuts, which is what our pork and pig industry means to our economy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Unless we step into the market now and support it, we will lose these people.  Just today I was told by pig farmers protesting outside Leinster House that they will have to stop breeding their next lot of young pigs.  If farmers start culling sows now, as is being proposed at the moment, they will not have the breeding stock to bounce back when the market returns.  In that situation, we will lose vast numbers of pig farmers.  They are literally going into liquidation.  It is appropriate for this House to have a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine as soon as possible because we are facing a scenario in which the Irish pig industry is lost forever.</p></speech>

I agree that we must have a science-based policy approach.  Last week I asked the Minister for Health to give confirmation of when we will move to the individual assessment approach but was just told that it would be by the end of this year.  The Minister also needs to justify the use of a four-month rather than a three-month delay period and to explain the basis for same.</p> <p>I also want to raise another issue related to the health service, that is, the excessive waiting times in accident and emergency departments and the number of people on trolleys.  Yesterday there were 583 people on trolleys across the country.  We are heading back to the pre-pandemic days of overcrowded emergency departments due to the failure of the Government to properly resource hospital capacity expansion.  We can only increase capacity if we properly resource enough beds and the staff to safely manage them.</p> <p>Earlier this month a full-time carer spoke of his ordeal in Tallaght Hospital where he waited for 24 hours to be seen with his son who had suspected appendicitis.  While he waited in the accident and emergency department with is sick son, he had no choice but to leave his disabled wife and their daughter with autism home alone.  As he said himself, every nurse and doctor he met was fantastic.  They were caring, deeply apologetic and fed up to their back teeth with the systemic issues and working conditions.  He spoke of how there were not enough seats for people to sit on.  Even well people accompanying others cannot be expected to stand for 24 hours.  With another Covid surge upon us which will inevitably increase pressure on the already exhausted healthcare workforce, the Minister for Health needs to outline how he intends to increase capacity in our emergency departments.  I would also like the Minister to explain the four-month delay and to confirm the date for moving to the individual assessment process for blood donations.</p></speech>

Like many of my colleagues, I have received emails as part of a campaign expressing concern with regard to the front-loading model of SNA allocation.</p> <p>I have discussed this with officials in the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and believe it is a really good idea.  It is right to have SNAs in place when a child comes into a school, with the school given discretion with regard to the allocation of hours in response to the need.  There is an equality of access that comes with that which is very important.  It means that every child, regardless of whether he or she has a diagnosis, can be allocated a certain number of hours if his or her parents express a need for same.</p> <p>However, I also appreciate the concern that with this model a lot depends on the competence, efficiency and effectiveness of the special needs co-ordinator in a school, whether he or she is communicating well with parents, is in receipt of the education passport and has spoken to either the pre-school, in the case of children starting primary school, or the primary school in the case of children transitioning to secondary school.  The latter is important to ensure the proper passing over of information.  There was a time when SNAs in post-primary schools went back to visit SNAs in primary schools but again, that comes down to the effectiveness, passion and willingness of the special needs co-ordinator in a school and whether he or she is thorough and comprehensive.  </p> <p>There is a concern out there and I am sure many in this House would like to have the opportunity to contribute to a debate on these matters and to express some of the concerns of those who are emailing us.  I ask that we invite the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to the House for a debate on this matter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In this regard, I support this front-loading model.

Sadly, it is only four.  We are not following the example of other countries across Europe.  That leaves somewhere in the region of 28 or 29 still here.  Why we need that many in this country I do not know.</p> <p>It is not unknown that I am pretty active on social media.  This weekend somebody decided to attack, using my wife's name and my children's names.  That, to me, is totally unacceptable.  I contacted Twitter and told them what had happened.  Twitter came back to me and told me no rule was broken.  I am used to people attacking me on a regular basis because I am a former member of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Irish Rangers.  I served with more than 1,000 Irishmen.  They were all proud Irishmen - Catholic, Protestant from North, South, east and west.  All of us were proud of what we did.  I will never be anything but proud of it.  The day I got elected to this House the first people to welcome me were from Sinn F&eacute;in.  Deputy McDonald was asked how she felt about a former Brit being elected by members of Sinn F&eacute;in and she said the world had moved on, which it has.  Every day of the week somebody has a go at the fact that I am a former Brit.  Here we are in this House.  I am a former Brit.  I served in the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Irish Rangers and I am damn proud of it.  I was a bloody good soldier when I was in it, but I will not stand over the likes of Twitter allowing my family to be used as a weapon to try to beat me.  My wife and my children are private citizens.  They never ever come into the public domain.  They never speak publicly on anything, and nobody has the right to use their names.  It is time that we curtailed these social media platforms with respect to being able to identify who it is that is speaking.  My colleague, Senator Ward, mentioned this only the other day.  I have no difficulty with somebody having a pseudonym, but I must be able to identify who they are, where they are and what they are about.  I deeply resent the fact that this clown decided to use my family.  People can attack me any day they want.  They can meet me outside the gate and talk to me if they want, but they must never use my family.</p></speech>

We have seen that over the past year.  We have seen the Irish Second-Level Students' Union being part of the process to decide how we do accredited grades the year before last and how we manage the leaving certificate.  Today, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, announced measures to support students with this reform.  I also acknowledge the former Minister for Education, Deputy Bruton, who initiated this review, and officials from the Department of Education and the State Examinations Commission, along with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  There has been a body of work around this, including at the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, which has been working on a report on leaving certificate reform.  The first major change is 40% of exams will be by continuous assessment.  That means only 60% of all subjects will be by written exam.  It will support many students.  It will be fantastic for students who do not feel at their best on the day of their exam to know that not 100% of their grade is riding on it.  It also allows for a wider review of student skills to excel.  There will be easier access to third level because if students are able to explore and do more practical assessments through continuous review, it means that there will be a lower level of drop out.  Students will know more about the choices they want to make in terms of their career.  Second, new curricula and subjects have been added to develop the arts and culture area as well as the climate crisis.  Drama, film and theatre studies are being added to the curriculum.  Another addition is climate action and sustainable development, which again will help to prepare students to deal with the climate change challenges ahead.  New qualifications have also been added.  There will be a new exam at junior cycle level for students with special educational needs.  Even better, we will see a revised transition year programme and greater access for transition year students.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is important.  I might highlight that at the Department of Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Minister, Deputy Harris, is currently running six pilots in secondary schools that are looking at doing pilots of apprenticeships.  In other words, students are getting an opportunity in transition year to try out some of these apprenticeship programmes.  We currently have about 64 apprenticeship programmes ongoing.  This will be a fantastic way for students to get an opportunity to test these out. </p></speech>

Senator Malcolm Byrne, supported by Senators Maria Byrne, Dolan and Buttimer, talked about leaving certificate reform and the welcome introduction of two new subjects, namely, climate action and sustainable development and drama, film and theatre, from 2024.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, has set out a vision and a work programme that encompasses a range of areas including a new curriculum, new subjects, changing the final assessment procedure to significantly reduce reliance on final examinations and the introduction of a teacher-based assessment component.  There is much very welcome reform and I acknowledge the work of the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and all its members, in their engagement with the Minister.  We also will ask her to come in and debate what I believe to be a welcome and good news story.</p> <p>Senators Malcolm Byrne and Buttimer also spoke about the long delays in Dublin Airport.  We have discussed the collapse in aviation over the past two years because of Covid-19.  Now that the industry is back up and running, it is absolutely not acceptable that people are suffering the delays that they are suffering in Dublin Airport.  While Senator Buttimer is right to welcome people to Cork Airport, as I am sure many people would, and indeed to Ireland West Airport Knock and Shannon Airport as well, it is not a laughing matter for anybody who was caught up in the unacceptable delays at Dublin Airport.  I will certainly invite the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan and Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, in to discuss this matter.</p> <p>The census is a hugely important time.  Going back to the time of Herod, we heard about the census.  It is important that people are counted.  The data are used for each district electoral division for the country to plan in regard to healthcare, education and all aspects of society.  Nobody should be abusing any public servant and census enumerators who are doing their job should not be abused.  Certainly next year, as I understand it they are moving to an online system.  I am sure there will still need to be a follow-up system as well in certain cases.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne talked about the offices of the Revenue Commissioners being continuously closed.  That is not acceptable.  It is important that the Revenue gets back to pre-Covid-19 days, notwithstanding the present increasing numbers of cases, and that there are in-person meetings with people who need to engage with the Revenue.  I will ask the office of the Leader to write to the Revenue Commissioners to ask them to expedite the reopening of offices of the Revenue Commissioners throughout the country.</p> <p>Senator McDowell rightly discussed the funeral today of Pierre Zakrzewski, an Irishman who was educated in Ireland and whose family live in the locality in Dublin, who was a journalist and biographer.  He is just one example of the savagery of the unjust war within the Ukraine.  We remember Pierre this afternoon.  Senator McDowell also asked for a debate and I will request a debate in relation to issues on the housing matter, housing and renting.  We have all come across landlords who are getting out of the industry or are planning to so do because they consider it is not worth it.  Certainly that would have knock-on effects, exacerbating the crisis that we have within the rental sector and of homelessness.  I accept that bedsits were fine for a certain cohort of people and once you remove those, you remove valuable accommodation.  They had to be of a proper standard and up to scratch but removing those was a mistake.  I will invite the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.</p> <p>Senators Black and Gavan talked about the Sadaka conference in regard to Palestine and Israel.  I will invite the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to come in to debate the issue of Palestine.  I am not aware of who exactly was invited to the conference or where that letter or email went to.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Normally it would go to Government.  I am not sure to whom it was sent, if it was the Minister.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to come into the House to provide an update on ongoing issues regarding Palestine.<br/><br/>Senator Wall spoke about PDFORRA and RACO and their ability to affiliate to engage in collective bargaining.  I have previously urged the Minister to come in to discuss all defence matters as with the review of the Defence Forces, the substantial body of work done by the independent Commission on the Defence Forces and all that goes with it, there is enough material to have a large-scale debate on the future of our Defence Forces, having regard to all that has gone on, whether it be pre-conflict with respect to the manoeuvres off the south-east coast and all that has gone on since then regarding the provision of aid to Ukraine, our neutrality, NATO and associate membership and all that goes with it.  There is much to discuss in that very important sector.  I will ask for a debate on it.  <br/><br/>Senator Keogan raised the situation of girls in Afghanistan.  Education is such a fundamental right.  Afghanistan, to be best of my knowledge, is still a member of the United Nations.  We will contact the Minister and the ambassador to engage on this matter.It is extremely important.<br/><br/>The Senator also mentioned Canada.  It is very much a democratic country.  It had an election last September and Prime Minister Trudeau was re-elected.  We have had debates in this House on our Covid-19 laws and not everyone was happy with them.  I am sure not everybody in Canada was happy with their Covid laws but it is a democratic country.  It is very welcoming to Irish and other immigrants from around the world.  If there are specific genuine issues the Senator has, and she mentioned a man from Connemara which sparked my interest, I suggest she raises those concerns with the ambassador to Canada in the first instance and take it from there.<br/><br/>Senator Burke raised the energy issue and Coillte and asked that we invite the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to discuss the energy issues we have had.  We recognise the major impact that rising energy prices are having for Irish people.  There were announcements two weeks ago on fuel, excise and VAT and it is important those be kept under review.  The Council of Ministers meeting last week that the Taoiseach attended considered the whole area of VAT on fuel.  That is extremely important.  Under the present rules, any temporary reduction would result in that VAT going back up to 23% thereafter when the change was reversed.  That would be a major change.  It is important to examine the changes that can made.<br/><br/>Senator Ward spoke about the auto enrolment scheme for pensions.  We know the pensions issue is a major concern for people.  Often people leave it too late in life to think about or engage in providing for a pension.  It is important we consider auto-enrolment.  The Senator is right to say there are areas where that might not happen under the system.  I will invite the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to come into the House to debate the issue of auto-enrolment and the overall pension plans.  She has asked the sectoral committee to examine the issue.  I will certainly invite her to come to the House to discuss that scheme.  The Minister has said participation in the new scheme will be voluntary and workers will have the ability to opt out.  The scheme includes a matching employer contributions and State top-ups.  For  every &euro;3 saved by a worker, a further &euro;4 will be credited to their pension savings account.  When fully established, a worker earning &euro;35,000 per annum will accumulate a fund of &euro;293,000 over his or her working life.  This is an important area but certainly we need to ensure people are aware of it and that any issues are ironed out in advance.<br/><br/>Senators Hoey and Boylan raised the blood donation policy.  I understood there were positive announcements on this a number of months ago.  Perhaps if they tabled a Commencement matter they would get an early definitive response and if they tabled it jointly, the issue might be more likely to be selected by the good offices of the Cathaoirleach.  Other than that, we can request the Minister to come into the House to discuss the issue.  This is an important area.  Blood is often in short supply .  There is no reason we would have different policy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other parts of the island, the UK or mainland Europe.  It should be based on science.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Lombard talked about the crisis in the pig industry.  The IFA highlighted the issue outside the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Senator is right that the pig sector is intensive.  It is a high input cost sector due to the use of energy, feed and transportation so is particularly prone to the higher energy, fuel and feed costs that we have seen over the last period.  I will ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine to come to the House to discuss this very important issue.</p><p>Farmers taking decisions to stop putting sows back into pig would have further long-term impacts on the sector and a possible culling of the sector.  While there is always what is called a pig cycle in terms of prices, the industry is in a very difficult situation.  If an industry like this one collapsed entirely then it would be very difficult to gear it back up again, which we have seen before in certain areas like sugar beet.  The pig industry is worth protecting in terms of the number of jobs involved and the product so I will ask for a debate. </p><p>Senator Boylan raised the issue of blood donations, and the waiting times in accident and emergency departments.  The Joint Committee on Health is doing a body of work on this issue.  Recently the committee had before it representatives of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU to discuss overcrowding.  I know that we are to invite in representatives of some of the hospital groups as well.  The issue must be continuously kept on the agenda.  If there is a specific issue of an individual hospital or group then I urge the Senator to table a Commencement debate.</p><p>Senator Seery Kearney talked about the modelling of SNAs.  There is no perfect model because the work is demand-led.  Sometimes when a school has an SNA and suddenly does not have the children then the school loses the SNA, which is a matter of great concern to that school.  Certainly there were issues with the existing model.  I will invite the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, in to speak on the issue.  </p><p>Senator Craughwell welcomed the expulsion of a number of officials from the Russian Embassy, and I am sure the matter will be kept under review.  He also talked about the scurrilous attack on his wife and children of which I was unaware and my sympathies go to them.  As he rightly said, they are private citizens as are all of our family members.  The cut and thrust of politics is one thing and we are all subject to attack.  Some of it is unjust and some perhaps just, but that goes with the job.  Nobody forces us into these jobs but family members should be out of bounds in terms of any sort of attacks.  It has become too easy and prevalent for anybody to type something anonymously.  This matter has been raised within the Houses of the Oireachtas and meetings have taken place with Twitter, Facebook and a number of companies.  They have all said that they are private companies that are there to make money.  However, at the same time, they too easily allow people to run fake accounts to say whatever they like.  The worrying thing is that the individuals who receive comments do not know the identity of the sender.  It could be somebody that they know who uses a fake account.  The recipient could be quite familiar to these people yet they are not brave enough to say who they are or show who they are.</p><p>I think that I have covered all of the contributions made by Senators.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-29a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032900002#DD01000"><p>I will be very brief.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  This Bill is primarily about the transfer of functions from one Department to another in an area we all know about and that is important.  There have been no amendments other than two tabled by me, which were ruled out of order.  I will take this opportunity to say that no matter how apparently normal and necessary the provisions of a particular Bill are, it should not be the case that a Bill like this is rushed through the House like a dose of salts without an opportunity being given to table amendments properly, to have them considered and, arising out of whatever discussion might take place, to give people an opportunity to consider again the bringing forward of amendments on Report Stage.</p> <p>I indicated to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, last week that, in my view, there is a need to provide for better corporate governance in the context of the making available of moneys in the charitable and voluntary sector.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I made the point that such moneys should not be made available to organisations that were not providing proper audited accounts.  I previously raised the specific example of Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, which received moneys from the State in circumstances where it had not supplied audited accounts.  That arrangement has at least been suspended for the moment.  I also made the point that it does not matter what organisation is involved or what cause it is promoting.  It is simply not good governance for money to be made available from the public purse, funded by the taxpayer, to organisations in circumstances where they have not supplied properly audited accounts.  I gave the example of the requirement on us, as politicians, and on funding for political parties.  Where there is not appropriate accounting, the payment of moneys from the Exchequer stops.<br/><br/>The amendments I had tabled have been ruled out of order but they are, in my view, sufficiently related to the subject matter of the Bill because the Long Title clearly provides that the Bill provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the corporate governance arrangements of the HSE.  I accept the ruling of the Cathaoirleach that my amendments are out of order.  The amendments would have provided that no payments would be made by the Executive to a service provider which is a body corporate in respect on arrangement under section 34 until the service provider was in compliance with its obligations under section 343 of the Companies Act.  That is a reasonable and responsible amendment to propose.  It is sufficiently related to the subject matter of a health Bill that is described as containing miscellaneous provisions.<br/><br/>The section of the principal Act I was proposing to amend is among those being amended in this Bill.  I find myself in the situation that not only have my amendments not been accepted for consideration but there is no opportunity or break allowed for me to consider bringing forward those amendments on Report Stage and to ask for further and better consideration by the Cathaoirleach of their relevance to the subject matter of the Bill.  It is not good for our democracy when we have cursory, and sometimes apparently arbitrary, consideration of the relevance of certain amendments to the subject matter of Bills.  It seems to me that the procedural resources available to these House to prevent willy-nilly introduction of extraneous matters into legislation, including the guillotine and other procedural arrangements, are already ample to prevent abuse of the parliamentary process.  I am concerned by the all-too-frequent rulings that rule amendments out of order in circumstances where we are rushing legislation.  There surely must be time available to consider sincere and well-intentioned amendments to Bills that are proposed by Senators.<br/><br/>It is clear that the amendments I tabled would have restricted funding to organisations, such as TENI or any other charitable or voluntary organisation, unless they provide audited accounts.  That is just responsible legislation.  It is what the public would expect.  There is widespread public concern about the waste of taxpayers' money.  It seems that when it comes to considering if that sufficiently relates to the subject matter of the Bill, it is clearly not related to some of the specifics that the Bill contains but is certainly relevant in general terms to the Long Title.  The Long Title makes reference to the provisions in this Bill for revised corporate governance and accountability arrangements of the HSE.  It seems to me there is scope for a more inclusive approach to serious amendments that are being proposed to legislation.  That should be even more applicable in circumstances where mine were the only amendments tabled.</p></speech>
