They are very welcome.</p><p>Tomorrow marks Irish AIDS Day created to raise awareness of HIV and the resulting AIDS epidemic.  Since the beginning of the epidemic more than 70 million people have acquired the infection and about 35 million people have died.  Today around 37 million worldwide live with HIV, of whom 22 million people are on treatment.  It is 40 years since the first reports of HIV and AIDS in Ireland in 1982 and much has changed since then.  People are now living with HIV and cannot pass the virus on to their sexual partners.  </p><p>I am mindful since I last spoke in this Chamber about HIV that the Channel 4 series &quot;It's a Sin&quot; has put a spotlight on the pandemic in the early 1980s and 1990s and it got everyone talking about it.  Crucially, it was an opportunity for professionals in sexual health and well-being, people like Adam Shanley and the MPOWER programme and people in HIV Ireland, to get talking about sexual health strategies and about HIV prevention and sexually transmitted infection prevention right now.  That is what we need to be doing with a memorial.  The Government announced through the Department of the Taoiseach and the Office of Public Works, OPW, there will be a HIV and AIDS national monument and I welcome that announcement.</p><p>I acknowledge the work of individuals such as Tonie Walsh, who have been calling for and encouraging a conversation about having an Irish AIDS memorial for many years.  In an address to the National University of Ireland, NUI, Maynooth to mark World AIDS Day in 2016, Mr. Walsh said:</p> <blockquote> 	What is remembered, lives.  Not just the names of our deceased, but their voices, their bright faces are refocused.  Lives lived in adversity and often despair are recalibrated, not only for those of us mourning our dearly departed friends and lovers, but for successive generations.<br /><br />These hidden histories of how we lived, how some died and other survived, yearn to be heard. &hellip; We are in huge need of inter-generational dialogue. </blockquote> <p>He concluded his speech by saying:</p> <blockquote> 	It&rsquo;s time.  Time to dry away our tears and build from them a monument to the destruction and loss from AIDS in Ireland.  Please join me as we make this a reality. </blockquote> <p>I commend all those who have been part of that process who have brought us to a place where the Government is now committed to having a national HIV and AIDS monument.  I offer the Government an opportunity to make a statement here in the Houses of the Oireachtas on what that monument would look like and what process will take place.  I will have some questions about that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that, as opposed to just being a monument, it be a memorial that ties the past with the present and gives us an opportunity to talk about why some people are still getting AIDS, why there were 404 new cases of HIV last year, why our sexual health education system is not up to scratch and why our sexual health services are underfunded.</p></speech>

It is great to see all the schools back in action.  It is only a matter of time before some of those students will be replacing us in the Houses.</p> <p>I thank Senator Warfield for raising this very important issue.  The conversation about the issue is very important also because it is not just about a monument but about framing that conversation with our plans and efforts in this area, which are ongoing.</p> <p>It has been 40 years since the first clinical diagnosis of AIDS in Ireland and its impact here was no less than devastating to the lives of individuals, their families and communities.  The initial outbreak of HIV and the corresponding AIDS crisis was marked by fear, isolation, misinformation and stigmatisation.  In those early years, much of the fear and stigmatisation arose from a lack of information and myths about transmission.  It is a legacy that many communities still struggle with today.  To serve as a reminder that this terrible period has not been forgotten, it was proposed that a monument be commissioned.  Many strides have been made in the treatment and prevention of HIV, meaning people with HIV today can live full and enriched lives.  The monument will also serve as a tribute to those friends, families, support groups, doctors, nurses, and carers who dedicated so much of their lives and work to the treatment of HIV and to improving care.</p> <p>A committee chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach was established to oversee the design and commissioning of an HIV and AIDS national monument.  The remit of the committee is to consider the views of relevant parties on the nature of the monument to be commissioned, to make recommendations on the location and nature of the monument and projected timelines, to oversee the commissioning and delivery by the Office of Public Works, OPW, through competition, of the design and commissioning of the monument and to assist with the official unveiling and launch of the monument.</p> <p>The purpose of the competition is to commission a monument that appropriately and respectfully remembers those who have died and to mark their lives and contribution to society, while also showing solidarity with those living with and affected by HIV today.  The monument will be commissioned through a competition organised and administered on behalf of the committee by the OPW.  The oversight committee includes representation from HIV Ireland, Fast-Track Cities, the Irish Haemophilia Society, members of the LGBTQI+ community and the Ana Liffey Drug Project, along with representatives from the Arts Council and the OPW.  The site proposed for the monument is the People&rsquo;s Gardens in the Phoenix Park, which will be its permanent location.  The monument will be the focal point within the site location and must be in sympathy with the People&rsquo;s Gardens and their green-space environs.</p> <p>The competition seeks to elicit the most ambitious, creative, inclusive, and exceptional proposal for the monument.  The monument must take a physical form but there are no preconceived ideas regarding its design.  Applicants are free to choose any artistic medium for the expression of the monument.  It should seek to represent hope out of sadness, drawing from the different phases of the epidemic, from the devastation it brought individuals and their families in the early years to the transition from terminal illness to a life lived fully with HIV, as well as the challenge of ending the stigma associated with living with HIV and the hope for a time when HIV will be a thing of the past.  The monument should seek to create a better understanding and awareness of HIV and AIDS and their impact on communities.  It should also be representative of individuals, families, and communities impacted by HIV and AIDS including members of the LGBTQI+ community, people who use drugs intravenously, people who have acquired HIV through contaminated blood products and people from migrant backgrounds.</p> <p>The expression of interest for the HIV and AIDS national monument competition was first advertised on 1 June 2022.  It will be a two-stage open competition, with a closing date for first-stage entries of 8 July 2022.  The first stage comprises the call for expressions of interest to outline the artistic concept and approach to be taken by applicants.  The nature of the monument and the medium and format through which it is to be delivered are open to the choice of the applicant.  The competition is open to individuals and project teams and professional and non-professional applicants.  The jury will select a maximum of ten applicants in the first stage, to be shortlisted to proceed to the second stage.</p> <p>I congratulate all those who have been involved in the process so far.</p></speech>

As some of it was not included in the initial announcement, I will further analyse that.  I will need to write to the Taoiseach and the OPW.  I find it a bit unusual there is not a public consultation process but the statement indicated the committee will be engaging in that work.</p> <p>Ultimately, I want to know what the legacy of the project will be.  Will we have a monument that is well signposted and well delivered, that will historicise the past, that will acknowledge loss and mistakes made and that will reflect on our present and further education?  I am conscious there was a group, I think from transition year, here as well.  What will the involvement in the education system be?</p> <p>Finally, on consultation, in the early stages of the project there were consultations held in Dublin, Cork and Belfast.  If we are going to call this a national monument and it is to be truly national, we must engage with citizens in the North.  Their voices must be included.  When we are talking about figures they must be included as well.  Everyone must be acknowledged.  It cannot be a national monument if it does not include all the communities affected on this island.</p></speech>

There is probably enough time to accommodate all the issues of concern there.  The competition is under way but as there are two stages, it will be interesting to see what comes back in.  I have no doubt the Senator will engage with some of the artists when they are bringing forward their design concepts as well.  I hope we will be able to deal with all the issues raised.  I will certainly bring it back to the Department of the Taoiseach, especially the extra bits about our colleagues in Northern Ireland as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1658" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#D00400"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach seo inniu.  I am again calling for the extension of opening hours and indeed opening days for the minor injury unit at Monaghan Hospital.</p> <p>Including Monaghan, there are ten minor injury units located throughout the country.  Minor injuries are unlikely to lead to hospital admission.  A super service is provided in Monaghan.  I have experience of it myself.  People can walk in or their GP can refer them and there is no charge if the patient attending has a medical card or a referral letter from their local GP.  The injuries unit at Monaghan has been in operation since 2009 with patients aged five years and over able to attend.  As the Minister of State probably is aware, these units deal with a wide range of minor injuries, including for example suspected broken bones to arms - from collarbones to fingertips, strains and sprains, facial and eye injuries, minor scalds and burns, wounds, bites, cuts and splinters, as well as suspected foreign bodies in the eyes, ears, nose and mouth and minor chest injuries.  People also can get X-rays there, if required.  The unit in Monaghan has provided a valuable and important service to the public while simultaneously reducing the pressure on the accident and emergency unit in Cavan.</p> <p>However, while all the other injury units in the country are open seven days a week, the unit in Monaghan has the shortest opening times and that is what this debate is about this morning.  Most units around the country operate from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week, but Monaghan is limited to 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days a week.  These are the shortest opening hours of any of the ten minor injury units in the country and Monaghan's is the only such unit not operating on a seven-day-per-week basis.  Turning to the figures for those attending, Monaghan's figures are almost at the same level as those for the minor injury unit in Bantry, which is open seven days a week.  It could well be argued that were Monaghan open for the same hours and number of days as Bantry, its figures would be higher.</p> <p>Over the past number of years I have tried to raise awareness of the injuries unit in Monaghan.  The HSE itself has recently done a fantastic campaign informing the public of the wide range of services available there.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many people do not realise the types of conditions that can be treated at the unit.  Since the awareness campaign, and I compliment the staff on their work, the figures are again on the increase.</p><p>I am sure the Minister of State will agree that there is a genuine case for extending the hours at the centre.  People ask why County Monaghan has been treated differently from other parts of the country.  I mean that there are ten injury units and the unit in Monaghan is the only one that is confined to operating five days a week from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Unfortunately, the figure for the number of people attending the accident and emergency unit at Cavan General Hospital is on the increase.  Many of them could be treated in Monaghan if people were made aware of the unit and if the hours were extended, especially at weekends when people participate in sports and, therefore, as a result there is a higher volume of injuries.  In 2021, the average waiting time in the Monaghan injuries unit was one hour while a high number of 401 patients waited for more than 24 hours to be treated at Cavan accident and emergency unit.  That proves a case can be made in favour of the injuries unit.</p><p>I respectfully ask that consideration is given to extending the days and hours of opening at the unit in Monaghan.  I hope that the Minister for Health can facilitate a discussion along those lines.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to update the House on this important service.  As the Senator has said, the unit assists thousands of people every year, which is great to see.</p> <p>Monaghan Hospital operates as a single hospital with Cavan General Hospital.  Together they share an integrated managerial and clinical governance system, as well as integrated patient care pathways and support functions.  This integrated framework provides a stronger role for smaller hospitals, such as Monaghan Hospital, in delivering a higher volume of less complex care which is often closer to a patient's home.  It also ensures that patients who require emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in a larger hospital environment.</p> <p>The emergency department is located at Cavan General Hospital.  It provides 24-hour emergency critical care to adults and children.  Facilities at Monaghan Hospital focus on elective care and the appropriate streaming of patients to the minor injuries unit.  As well as the unit, other services provided at Monaghan Hospital include day services, theatre, diagnostic services, ambulatory care and a wide range of outpatient services.</p> <p>Minor injuries services, such as those at Monaghan, are specifically designed for the treatment of broken bones, dislocations, minor burns and other injuries that are unlikely to need admission to hospital.  In cases where an injury is more serious than originally thought, the patient is transferred to the hub emergency department linked to the clinic for further assessment and treatment.</p> <p>The opening hours for the minor injuries unit at Monaghan Hospital is within the overall framework for the delivery of care, as part of the integrated operations and governance system for Cavan and Monaghan hospitals.  The opening hours for the unit is a matter for the HSE and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, Hospitals Group.  However, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who could not take this debate today so asked me to take it for him, has assured me that he is willing to engage with the HSE and the hospital group on any request for additional opening hours.  I see that as a positive.  The Minister is willing to work and engage with the Senator and others.</p> <p>Last year, we saw a number of new initiatives at Monaghan Hospital, including 18 new step-down beds, a second endoscopy room, centralisation of haemochromatosis services for patients in the Cavan-Monaghan hospital catchment area and the provision of a third ultrasound room.  Since 2019, bed capacity at Monaghan Hospital has increased from 31 to 54 beds.  Over the last ten years, the minor injuries unit has treated thousands of patients each year, with over 4,200 attendances in 2020 and nearly 5,400 in 2021.</p> <p>The minor injuries unit at Monaghan Hospital plays a vital role in providing valuable services to the local community.  It helps to alleviate the pressures on emergency departments. </p></speech>

I welcome the positive response from the Minister for Health in that he is willing to engage with the RCSI Hospitals Group and the HSE with a view to extending the opening hours and the days of opening in terms of the minor injuries unit.</p> <p>I compliment the staff at the hospital on the fantastic service they provide in this area and throughout the hospital.  I also compliment management on its information campaign that has resulted in an increase in the number of people attending the injuries unit.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Health is now willing to engage in that regard and look forward to such engagement.  I ask that the Minister of State conveys to the Minister that we would like that engagement to commence as soon as possible and to confirm same.</p></speech>

I confirm that the Minister will assist and engage with those who want to increase the hours, the hospital group and the HSE.  The success of the minor injuries units can be seen in Monaghan and many other places.  I am happy to make sure that we maximise the use of that service.  The Senator makes a good point in that there are similar numbers in other parts of the country and units in those areas are open for longer hours.  Like the Senator, I compliment the service.  There has been great feedback from the more than 5,000 people who are using it every year.  The Senator made a point with regard to an information campaign.  That is a conversation we are having with regard to our services in County Meath and it is also being had in other parts of the country.  It is vital that the HSE and the hospital groups give very clear information and detailed advice and guidance as to where people should go for different types of treatment.  That is how we can maximise the use of all of our health assets.  It should be explained to people where the best place to get services at a given time is and they should be directed to those services.  That seems to be done quite well in Monaghan.  Hats off to those involved.  I will reaffirm with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, that the Senator wants to see that engagement as soon as possible.</p></speech>

This Commencement matter relates to the LEADER programme, which the Minister of State will be very aware of.  He knows of its enormous benefits.  I am asking some questions and seeking clarification on the next round of LEADER funding.  The local development companies under the LEADER programme were initially set up in response to the multidimensional nature of social inclusion throughout local areas.  This was to be a responsive, innovative and integrated approach to building the partnership model, with which the Minister of State will be very familiar, based on local ownership.  This arose from the OECD's 2005 recommendations.  Today, the LEADER programme offers best-placed local solutions to the challenges for urban and rural development across Ireland.  These companies have worked very successfully.  There has been great partnership and buy-in to the LEADER programme.  The programme has a great future and potential to expand, given the right supports and appropriate resources.</p> <p>There are 14 urban and 35 rural local development companies covering the entire Twenty-six Counties of the State.  More could be done if there were more resources.  The implementation of their plans is really important, which raises the issue of the next phase of the LEADER programme.  All of us, including the Minister of State, know the significance and importance of the programme so I will not give a history lesson on the success of LEADER.  I will say that I know the Government is committed to it, that there are limited resources and that there is always pressure on central government resources and finances.  However, this programme has worked really well.  I am very familiar with a number of these companies and I will mention a few that I have been in touch with: the Ballyfermot Chapelizod Partnership, the Bray Area Partnership, Cavan County Local Development and Galway Rural Development.  Where are we with regard to the next round of funding for the LEADER programme?  The organisers and the people involved need to know in order to plan for the future.</p></speech>

Like him, I am a big supporter of the work of LEADER groups.  They have achieved quite a lot over recent years and I look forward to their future success.  I am happy to recognise and confirm that I support their work, as do many people in these Houses because they have achieved quite a lot in working directly with our communities, both urban and rural.  We want to build on their success.  I look forward to continuing to work with them and to supporting their work.  I am glad the Senator has raised this issue on behalf of all the LEADER groups.</p> <p>The LEADER programme is a key intervention of Our Rural Future, the Government&rsquo;s policy for rural development launched last year, which aims to deliver a range of actions to rural communities over its lifetime.  As the Senator mentioned, LEADER is a multi-annual programme for rural development co-funded by the EU through the Common Agricultural Policy.  The programme is based on a community-led approach to rural development and plays an important role in supporting communities and enterprises in rural areas and certain urban areas in progressing job creation, social inclusion and environmental projects at local level.</p> <p>Local action groups, LAGs, which administer the programme at local level, have approved more than 5,200 projects to the value of &euro;220 million nationally since the 2014-2020 LEADER programme began in the middle of 2016.  The type of projects supported include construction projects, biodiversity and renewable energy projects, analysis and development-type projects and marketing and training projects.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These projects bring much-needed assistance to small businesses at this time, as well as supporting job retention and new employment opportunities.</p><p>As we look to the future and the next LEADER programme, in April 2021, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, launched a two-year transitional LEADER programme for 2021 and 2022, which ensured for the first time that there was no funding gap between this programming period and the next programme, which will begin in 2023.  Some &euro;250 million has been made available for LEADER for the period 2021 to 2027 maintaining the level of funding provided for the current programming period.  This funding comprises &euro;70 million for the transitional period 2021 to 2022 and an additional &euro;180 million from 2023 to 2027.  This level of funding is evidence of the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the LEADER programme.</p><p>Preparations for the design and delivery of the next LEADER programme from 2023 to 2027 are well under way.  There is ongoing engagement between the Department of Rural and Community Development officials and stakeholders in this regard.  Decisions relating to all aspects of the programme will be considered as part of the ongoing programme design phase.  It is proposed to hold the local development strategy  and LAG selection process over two stages.  The selection of the LAGs cannot commence until the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan, CSP, is approved by the EU Commission, which is expected to happen later in the year.  However, the first stage, which is an expression of interest by eligible groups, could commence in advance of the CSP approval in order to be ready to launch the second stage once that approval is forthcoming.</p><p>The ongoing engagement and consultation with stakeholders, combined with the funding allocation of &euro;250 million indicated, will ensure that the LEADER programme from 2023 will continue to support and further develop our rural communities and businesses, and certain urban areas as well.</p></speech>

His reply, while welcome, involved some uncertainty and vagueness.  There were references to what will, could and may happen with the programme.  I would like something a bit stronger than that.  I know this does not relate directly to the Minister of State's Department but he might bring back to the officials in the Department some greater certainty.</p> <p>We are very familiar with the CSP and LAGs, as is the Minister of State.  I welcome the fact that he has confirmed there is engagement.  However, we need something more solid.  I am hearing from people engaged in LEADER who prompted my submission of this matter.  I am acting on behalf of people involved in the programme who say there is a certain degree of uncertainty involved.  The Minister of State's reply has confirmed that sense of uncertainty because it contained references to what could, may, shall and will happen with LEADER.  It referred to what is hoped will happen.  I do not doubt anyone's commitment to the programme but it is important that we continue the communication because 2023 remains a while away.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and for his positive response.  We need communication with all the people involved in the LEADER programme.  I wish the programme continued success.</p></speech>

I am sorry that the Minister could not be here to take the debate herself.  She is committed.  I will certainly bring back to her the Senator's message that we need to strengthen the commitment and the language involved.  I will again point to the budget that is set aside and approved by the Government as well as to the targets to have the engagement completed this year and plans rolled out in good time.  I will bring those points to the Minister in the hope those concerns can be dealt with.</p> <p>I am meeting representatives of the Meath Partnership this week, along with our MEPs, to analyse and discuss their work.  Every time we meet, the partnership is doing more work and providing more services.  I know the story is similar throughout the country.  There are great interventions happening as we work with communities and bring them together in many areas.  We are committed to that.  I have heard the Senator's concerns about the length of time involved and the commitments in that regard.  The commitments are strong.  It does take time but we need to speed it up.  I will bring that back to the Minister.  As the Senator knows, she is a can-do Minister.  She will drive these matters on and ensure they are done in time.</p></speech>

It is great to see him here.</p> <p>I wish to raise the plight of a school that is perhaps the school furthest away from this complex, namely, the Beara Community School in Castletownbere.  Its location is very peripheral.  It is right on the coast.  Its catchment includes not only the town of Castletownbere but also the surrounding villages from Eyries to Ardgroom and Adrigole.  It is the centre of secondary education on the Beara Peninsula.</p> <p>The school has a major plight.  It is trying to supply special education on the school complex.  I acknowledge that an application has been lodged by the Beara Community School for an important single-storey special education unit and associated works.  That application has been submitted.  It is important.  We are concerned with the timeline involved.  The pre-planning proposals with regard to this project dragged on for years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Now it has gone for planning permission.  I spoke to parents over the weekend and last night when I was in Glengarriff.  They are genuinely concerned about the length of time it will take to deliver the proposal.  A significant number of steps have to be taken.  Design detail, specifications and a bill of quantities have to be set out.  Tender documents have to be produced and a tender process has to be completed.  Following that, the unit has to be constructed and fitted out.  That will take a considerable period of time.  There is a need for the facilities in September when children will be going to Beara Community School without a dedicated unit for special needs.  That is not good enough in this day and age.  What we need to see here is a two-pronged approach.  First, a special needs unit must be put in place on a temporary basis immediately.  The school needs the support of the Department to deliver it.  It is most important that happens between now and September for the children who will be going to the school.  The school does phenomenally well.  It is a wonderful organisation and it is coping really well but, unfortunately, it does not have the building it requires.  Second, we must see the proposals in respect of the construction, tendering process and the bill of quantities fast-tracked.  Otherwise, given the length of time the pre-planning stage took, it could take years for the unit to be built.  I must stress that geographically, Castletownbere and the Beara peninsula are as far away as one can possibly get from Dublin.  A special approach needs to be taken for this school.  The children in the area have no other option.  They cannot go to the next nearest school.  The next nearest school is probably in Kenmare in County Kerry or towards Bantry on the other side.  We are not talking about a distance of 3 or 4 miles.  We are talking about a distance of 50, 60 or 70 miles.  The geographical issue here cannot be underestimated.  A different approach must be taken to ensure this educational needs unit is delivered in a very short space of time.  I ask the Government to seriously rethink how these strategic units are planned going forward so that children are not left in a situation, such as the one I am fearful they will face in September, whereby they are going to a school with no dedicated special needs unit.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#H00200"><p>I am glad the Senator has raised this most important issue of special needs education provision for Beara Community School.  The Senator made a passionate case in highlighting the geographical location of the school and in stressing why it is so important that we fast-track a solution as soon as we can.  There is no easy option for children to travel to attend units elsewhere.  That has been made clear by the Senator.  I will certainly bring that to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister for Education.  The Minister of State would like to be here today to take the Commencement matter, but is unable to do so.  I will also engage with the Senator directly on the issue.  We are keen to fast-track a solution as soon as possible to ensure the needs of the children are met.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter today.  At the outset, I want to stress that enabling students with additional needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs, and as close to home as possible, ideally in their own local school, is an ongoing priority for this Government.  As the Senator said, that is most important.  This year, the Department of Education will invest in excess of &euro;2 billion, or more than 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget, in the area of special educational needs support.  As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels, and rightly so.  For the 2021 to 2022 school year, the number of special classes in mainstream schools stands at a current total of 2,148.  Of these, almost 1,900 special classes cater for students with autism.  Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements, over the last two years the Department of Education and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year.  Overall, this intensive intervention has seen an additional 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places, already opened nationwide for the 2021 to 2022 school year.  For the 2022 to 2023 school year, an additional 315 classes, providing 1,800 additional places, will become available in September. </p> <p>The NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs nationwide.  It has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. The NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I assure Senator Lombard that the Department continues to prioritise and support this work.  The Department also recognises that where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for their children, particularly a child with additional needs, it can be a stressful experience.  The Department is working hard to ensure there are sufficient school places appropriate to the needs of all children available on a timely basis nationwide.</p><p>As matters stand, I can confirm on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, that there are two special classes in Beara Community School which cater for children with multiple disabilities and autism.  While the Department has already approved funding for two permanent special educational units under the additional school accommodation scheme, it is open to the school to request further funding for interim accommodation under this scheme pending delivery of the permanent building project.</p><p>The Department is engaging with the school on the issue in terms of identifying the most appropriate solution.  While the Senator is correct that we need to fast-track the system of delivery after the initial allocation of funding through planning and all the different phases, sometimes there is also the need for a temporary solution.  That option is open here and there is engagement.  I am happy that we will try to continue with that engagement in order that we have solutions for this coming September.</p><p>The Department and the NCSE are always grateful to schools that express a willingness to open a special class to meet the educational needs of students in their local communities.  There are special educational needs organisers located across the country and they have a specific remit in helping and supporting parents in accessing the education necessary for their children, including in identifying suitable school placements.</p><p>The NCSE is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022-23 school year and beyond.  The NCSE is looking at local information with regard to projected demand for future special education places, particularly to cater for students with autism who have associated complex needs.  It will continue to work in Cork for a number of years to identify the needs for the county and the various areas.</p></speech>

This issue is about trying to make sure we have this dedicated unit put in place.   The amount of work that is being done by the Beara Community School to make sure that it is managing very capably with what it has at the moment is appropriate, but it really needs to get this dedicated unit on the ground.  It needs for this process to be fast-tracked.  I cannot understate that.  It really is important.  The geographical location of the school means it has no other option and because of that, there must be a special approach here.  I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Department to ensure that when planning permission is granted in the next few weeks, we can move ahead with speed to deliver this project.</p></speech>

The Department will work with the school and the Senator in order to try to find a timely solution.  Naturally, it is important that the planning is granted and the hopefully we be able to fast-track all the other stages.</p> <p>It is also important that we have access to temporary accommodation if that is deemed appropriate.  I think the school is happy to go down that route as well.  This would, however, be a twin-track approach to have some temporary immediate accommodation as well as a full commitment to fast-tracking and delivering the permanent accommodation as quickly as possible.  Again, I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  I will bring his concerns back to the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and Minister, Deputy Foley, directly.</p></speech>

The EU position has been clear and the role played by Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi has been quite noble.  It has always been the case that this country and the EU have said that if there are ways we can improve the operation of the protocol then that can be done through dialogue and engagement but not through the whiplash diplomacy that is being practised by the Johnson Government.  Trade must be done on the basis of trust and respect for international law.  I am sure the Leader would agree with me that the support of all parties and none in this House is for the position of the Government and the EU that international law must be recognised.</p> <p>I want to raise the Future of Media Commission report, which was provided to the Government last October.  The Leader will know that we have already had extensive debate on the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill in the absence of the publication of this report, and we know about some of the challenges that are faced by our local media, including newspapers and radio.  My colleague, Senator Cassells, has regularly raised this issue.  There are also concerns on the part of RT&Eacute; and TG4 on their future models of funding and we continue to have a debate on trusted media, fake news and disinformation.  The Government has had this report since last October.  Brian Mac Craith and his team did the necessary work and provided the work to the Government.  In spite of many requests from this House and from the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, it has not been published.  I am asking the Leader to schedule a debate on the future of local and national media in Ireland before the recess.  We should have that debate whether or not that report is finally published.  It is far too important an issue to allow it to go on.  The delay has been unacceptable so I ask that we have that debate.</p> <p>I want to acknowledge that around this time every year a number of new cathaoirligh and mayors are elected in local authorities all around the country.  It is an enormous honour to hold one of those roles and I want to pay tribute to those who have carried out that work over the past year and to wish those who are about to don the chains the best of luck for the year ahead.   We need a debate on the powers of local government in this country and I ask again that this would be facilitated.</p></speech>

We learned last night of the death of the Independent Councillor Noel Collins from Cork County Council.  He was a wonderful man who represented east Cork first and was elected over 54 years ago.  Many may not know but he started off as a Fine Gael councillor for a short period of time and he remained a poll topper.  He was a true and remarkable gentleman and I valued him as one of my greatest friends in politics.</p> <p>Councillor Noel Collins was one of the longest serving councillors representing this State and I visited him two weeks ago, which was the last time I spoke to him, at Oaklodge Nursing Home.  One of the abiding memories of that was that he took my hand, held on to it and asked me if I was going home.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I took that as a sort of a prompt to wonder whether I had overstayed my time or talked too much.  Our entire conversation was about politics.  Indeed, he welcomed by thanking me, as the "county clerk", for coming to see him, and I said, "I ain't the county clerk."  He said, "I know you're not; you're Victor.  I'm only joking."  We had a chat and, interestingly, he spoke about the former Labour Party Councillor Jane Dillon Byrne, so he could think far back.  He asked me to take him home, and he said there was nothing better than being at home in one's own home, belonging to a community that values one.</p><p>There is a message in all that for us as politicians.  As those who knew him will recall, he was a politician who had no mobile phone, no car and no computer, yet he connected with his people.  He had little handwritten cards, recycled from the back of, invariably, Weetabix or Ready Brek cardboard boxes, and he stood at the church wall between his house, St. Jude's on St. Mary's Road, and the church, and he asked people who wanted to see him to make an appointment with him.  He was a generous man, full of charitable deeds and work, and he worked behind the scenes, especially for the homeless and the vulnerable.  Noel Collins was a tireless and fearless public servant, afraid of nothing and respected by all.</p><p>I met the parish priest in Midleton with him before Covid.  The priest called him over and said, "Collins, I hear you're always down with the Protestants", to which Collins replied, "Yes, and this is one", pointing at me.  He then said, "Father, you're missing one thing: God is everywhere and I'm following Him."  That, in a way, summed up who Collins was.  He was a man of great passion.  He found a passion and a vocation.  Indeed, he had always wanted to study for the priesthood, and when I asked him why he had not done that, he said he had taken another journey and another route.  That shows the similarities between the roles of parish priest and politician.  He was a truly wonderful councillor.  He earned a devoted base of voters through his work.  He walked with his people and broke bread at people's tables.  He shared with people and cared for them.  He was independent of mind and of spirit, and that made him best placed to be an Independent councillor.</p><p>We will miss him, as will local government, Cork County Council and the Association of Irish Local Government.  We will truly never see his like again.  May he rest in peace.</p></speech>

I spoke in the Chamber less than three weeks ago when he stood down from Cork County Council after 54 years of dedicated, unbroken service.  He was a great friend of mine for a long time.  The last time I was in his home, he sat back and sang "The Stone Outside Dan Murphy's Door", which was quite amazing given the fact his house was called "St. Jude's".  He did not have a mobile phone or a computer, he did not use social media, and his greatest challenge was trying to find a ribbon for his typewriter.  I got regular correspondence from him on behalf of the people of Cork, particularly Midleton, and it was always about the poor man or poor lady or the person who was not well.  Towards the end, he signed the letters he sent to me as "The Pest" because he considered himself a pest, but a pest for the right reasons because he wanted to look after his people.</p> <p>I think there is a lesson in that.  In the most recent local elections, in 2019, in the world of social media, emails and all the modern technology, he still topped the poll.  Politicians, therefore, do not have to completely sell their souls to social media and so on to serve the people.  His clinics were at the wall outside the church in Midleton, and I have to say, he was close to God in every sense of the word.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I sincerely hope, and know, that he will find his true reward in heaven.  Ar dheis D&eacute;.  When one talks about Noel Collins and then one thinks of the 40 Catholics in Nigeria who lost their lives in a massacre it is appropriate we should think of them and send our solidarity to their families and the Catholics in Nigeria following what was an atrocious massacre.</p><p>On other matters, I welcome that County Clare has been included in the mica redress scheme.  The decision by Cabinet today was the correct one.  We know of almost 1,000 homes in Country Clare that have been directly impacted by mica.  Those people deserve to be in the scheme the same as people in other counties deserve to be in it.  I fear this problem is only going to get worse as people identify mica as a problem in their homes.  The Cabinet decision is a welcome one.  We look forward to the legislation, which I am sure there will be much debate around, because this is going to be a very costly exercise reflective of terribly poor regulatory oversight in the decades passed.  We must welcome that there is proper and much more robust regulatory oversight and inspection of properties in today's world.  I hope history will not repeat itself and we will have learned from the mistakes of the past.</p></speech>

For the month that is in it, I want to talk about Pride in 2022.  I recall having an overwhelming sense of pride in my country when Ireland passed the same-sex marriage referendum.  After all, love is love.  However, seven years on I am prompted to reassess.  It is my wedding anniversary today.  I have had 21 happy years with Mark.  Never once in those years, or the time preceding them, have I or we ever considered our safety while expressing our affection in public.  It might even be something like holding hands, which is such a natural human gesture.  However, recent EU Agency for Fundamental Rights data tell us a quarter of members of the LGBT+ community in Ireland always avoid holding hands in public for fear of being assaulted, threatened or harassed.  Most will assess their environment before even taking such a decision.  That puts me and my husband, and the majority of us, in a very privileged position.</p> <p>Scrolling through the excellent Cork LGBT Archive, I found the report of Ireland's first National Gay Conference in 1981, which was a precursor to Pride in Ireland.  It refers to a certain David Norris as a speaker and reports "David hoped that the positive note of the Conference theme would be reflected in a commitment to move forward with a strong sense of unity".  I thank my colleague for his 50 plus years of advocacy for LGBT+ rights in Ireland and helping to repeal Victorian-era laws.</p> <p>I am also proud of the legacy and the current role my party, the Green Party, has played in this area.  There is a bright rainbow within the green and a bright green in the middle of that rainbow.  I am proud to be part of a Government that will publish a scheme to disregard convictions prior to decriminalisation in 1993.  Pride is clearly as relevant today as it was 50 years ago.  I am excited that in my own area there is now a Laois Pride that was created in partnership with the Midlands LGBT+ Project.  Yesterday, an exhibition was launched in Abbeyleix on the changes to the laws on LGBT+ people from 1860 up to today.  I am also thankful that in Offaly, a sub-group of the joint policing committee is launching an online survey on gender-based violence and harassment in public amenities.  We need these conversations; we cannot be complacent.  Pride is an opportunity for LGBT+ people to celebrate who they are but it is so much more than a party.  It is a reminder to the rest of us of what we take for granted.</p></speech>

In 1921, Edward Carson said:</p> <blockquote> 	What a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster, and so was Ireland, in the political game that was to get the Conservative Party into power. </blockquote> <p>Replace 1921 with 2022 and replace the words &quot;to get the Conservative Party into power&quot; with &quot;to keep the Conservative Party and, probably in particular, Boris Johnson in power&quot; and we can see the very dangerous and retrograde antics play out in London.  I refer to knowingly breaching international law.  That has been done, with eyes wide open, by the British Prime Minister and his Government, which jeopardises the peace process, the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions and, indeed, the economies of this island both North and South.</p><p><font color="#1A1A1B">  As I am sure colleagues will know and agree with me, the reality is that the protocol, which was agreed to and negotiated by the British Government </font>and the EU Commission, works for the benefit of people, businesses and the economies here on this island.  It is by no means the perfect solution nor is it the solution that we wanted here given that no one in Ireland - North or South - consented to Brexit.</p><p>I wish to express my very real concern and, indeed, that of my party, about the direction of travel by the British Government and not just this breach of international law with its protocol Bill but coupled with moves around issues like legacy and other matters of deep concern.  We need to be alert to what is happening in Britain and Westminster.  We need to ensure that here in this House we remain, as we have consistently done, united in our support for the protocol and for its proper effective implementation, and above all else our resolute unity and support for the Good Friday Agreement and its institution.</p><p>I do not believe anyone is under any illusions about the machinations that are playing out in the Tory Party, and how willingly they put Ireland and our peace and progress under threat to suit their own agenda.  They also operate to give political cover to a section of political unionism which, ironically, do not support the Good Friday Agreement, never did support it and opposed same yet sees people day-to-day continuing to suffer without institutions in the North as we face ever more into a cost-of-living crisis.  I appreciate that this is playing out before us.  Therefore, it would be right and proper, and certainly before the summer recess, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs updates us on this issue and outlines the measures and moves the Irish Government will pursue to oppose this direction and to garner and mobilise international solidarity and diplomatic support in opposition to it.</p></speech>

I refer to the need to extend the short-hop zone to Newbridge train station, other train stations in south Kildare and to Portarlington in County Laois.</p> <p>I welcome the creation of a focus group by Newbridge Community Development within the last number of days to advocate for an extension.  On my way here this morning I listened to my local radio station, Kfm, and heard Jennifer Caffrey, who represented the focus group, eloquently state the reasons for the extension.  Over the last number of years the local Labour Party in Newbridge has run a campaign to change the pricing structure.  We met Ms Anne Graham, CEO, National Transport Authority, and handed her 8,500 signatures of local commuters in County Kildare who demand such a change.  Since then we have continued to raise the issue at every opportunity.  We have continuously raised this matter with each Minister for Transport and, indeed, the NTA.</p> <p>Quite simply, hard pressed commuters bypass Newbridge and other Kildare stations and drive to Sallins station in Naas to avail of the short-hop fares but who can blame them?  Many people save up to &euro;200 per month by choosing to drive past their local station in favour of stopping at Sallins station.  The result is that the N7 has become a car park as other commuters make the hard choice to drive all of the way into the capital to attend work.  Time and again I am contacted by commuters from every corner of County Kildare asking for an update on our campaign.  Recently those queries have come from students, as I have previously stated in this House.  Students simply cannot afford the cost of accommodation in Dublin or avail of student accommodation in the city.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The youth travel card has helped but we still have problems with students paying considerable amounts of cash that they work hard to earn to avail of transport.  The solution is to extend the short hop zone or even to create a medium or intermediate zone.  This must allow for the use of the Leap card and the privileges it has given to commuters within the existing short hop zone.  I recently made a submission to the greater Dublin transport strategy on this matter asking for such an outcome.  In all of my recent conversations with the National Transport Authority, NTA, I have been told that a review of the short hop zone pricing structure as against the structure for other stations and how these differences are impacting commuters is under way.  However, the CEO of the NTA is also on record as stating that, if public service obligation, PSO, funding was provided by the Government and the Minister, the NTA would change the pricing structure in the shorter term.  This is what needs to happen.  Government must provide such funding to alleviate pressures on those hard-pressed commuters who have no choice but to use their cars.  Funding would alleviate pressure on the car park that the N7 and its feeder roads have become.  The most fundamental point is that we are in the middle of a climate crisis.  That alone should concentrate minds on the urgent need to address this issue in the shorter term.  Once again, I ask the Leader to organise a debate on rural transport with the Minister for Transport.  I would appreciate that.</p></speech>

At this time yesterday, a meeting that took place down the road in the Department of Health between the Oireachtas Members from Meath and 18 of the lead clinicians in the country to discuss the clinical concerns of the HSE about the accident and emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, as those clinicians saw them.  It was a frank and robust meeting between everybody in the room.  Discussion was led by Meath man and director of operations, Gerry McEntee, who set out his concerns about dealing clinically with things in Navan.  However, at the end of the meeting, the HSE handed out a document, which I am holding right now, saying that the final stages of the implementation of this process of changing to a medical assessment unit is to begin on 30 June, in two weeks' time.  The last time I checked, the HSE did not run this country.  The Cabinet, the Government, is responsible for the running of the country.  The HSE was reminded of that fact very forcefully by the Minister for Health last night and again this morning.  He reminded it who runs the health service.  Ultimately, responsibility rests with the Minister for Health.  These people who think they are a law unto themselves and can bypass Cabinet and elected Members got a reminder today.  I will read exactly what the Minister for Health said in his statement.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	I have heard clearly the concerns of clinicians in Navan as to the ongoing safety concerns [...] I have also heard the concerns of clinicians at other hospitals that would be impacted at a time when all health services are under such pressure. </blockquote> <p>He also stated &quot;No decision regarding the HSE&rsquo;s proposal for the transition of the Emergency Department at ... Navan ... has been agreed by this government.&quot;  I am glad the Minister has clarified that.  There are serious issues that need to be discussed.  The HSE should remember that, if it wants to have an honest and frank discussion with the political leaders of the country, it must start by showing respect for those leaders and not with what was attempted yesterday.</p></speech>

While the settlement was welcome, there remains unfinished business that must be dealt with.  I hope it will be dealt with and not legislated away.</p><p>Everybody in this House will have received a number of emails from me with respect to search and rescue.  Yesterday's email laid out 44 safety recommendations that arose as a result of the crash of Rescue 116 in which four brave people lost their lives.  Some of those involved in search and rescue have been reckless in respect of the way they have handled things such as staff complaints, staff concerns with respect to safety, etc.  It absolutely baffles me that the Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard, which have no aviation expertise whatsoever, will tender for aviation search and rescue for the next ten years.  A wonderful document was put together by the Irish Air Corps and was scrapped by a three-page document which would not stand up to the scrutiny of a national school child.  That is how seriously I feel about this issue.  There are 44 recommendations.  Two of them deal with the lack of aviation expertise in the Irish Coast Guard and in the Department of Transport, yet we are allowing those two organisations to come together and tender for the next search and rescue service.  The current operator was found to be reckless.  Will that operator be one of those tendering?  I sincerely hope not.  We also find that some of those who were involved in the business case for the next search and rescue service are themselves attached to potential bidders.  The system is rotten to the core and needs to be stopped and examined by an independent organisation that can look at who did not make it into the business case.</p></speech>

The first relates to childcare and is becoming a major issue in the community childcare facilities with which I work in Longford.  I am sure the situation is replicated across the country.  Some facilities are at a point where they are struggling to get staff in order to provide services and are turning away parents who are looking to get their children into childcare for the September coming.  We need the relevant Minister to attend the Chamber because the issue needs to be dealt with immediately.  We need to put proper pay structures in place for our childcare sector or we are going to face a crisis whereby people will not be able to go to work because they cannot access childcare.  We must compliment the staff in the childcare sector for the work they do.  They need proper supports and pay.  Parents need childcare to be able to go to work.  I would like a debate on that matter, if possible before the summer recess, because it is going to be a major issue come September.</p> <p>I also raise the Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill, which is at the stage of pre-legislative scrutiny.  I sincerely hope it will come before one of the Houses before the recess.  We have a major issue on our hands in the area of vaping and e-cigarettes.  There are children as young as ten or 11 years of age addicted to vaping because controls are not in place at present with regard to the sale of those products.  I know the Bill is in process but we need to make sure it comes before the Houses.  This addiction is going to lead to follow-on crime, etc., if youngsters are addicted.  I have heard of shops that are delivering vaping products to children in their homes.  Kids as young as ten or 11 years of age are addicted to vaping.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I wish to raise a few points regarding the Bill.  We need to look at the issue of small retailers.  There is a growing market in the sale of larger packs of cigarettes, which now account for 30% of cigarette sales.  The larger packs are sold at discounted prices to get more people to buy more cigarettes.  We are allowing that.  That needs to be addressed and we must stop the practice.  In some other countries, retailers are only allowed to sell packs of 20.  We should follow suit.  It is important that we address the matter.  We must look at the whole issue of identification requirements in the sale of tobacco.  Retailers must ensure that they know whether a child is over or under the age of 18.  The issue must be addressed.  </p></speech>

I reiterate the important point that it has been 31 years since Georgia regained its independence and 26 years since diplomatic relations between Ireland and Georgia were established.  It is worth bearing in mind that on 8 November 2008 Russia invaded a democratic and independent state and still occupies 20% of that territory.  That has tended to be forgotten by the international community over the years.  It is important that the goodwill of the European Union is offered to Georgia on this occasion.  I know that Georgia has been working hard to fulfil all of the obligations required of it in this regard.  I look forward to the motion receiving the full support of the House.  The Irish Government fully supports Georgia's candidacy for membership of the EU.</p> <p>Briefly, I agree with Senator Carrigy on the issue of vaping shops.  I have tabled a Commencement matter on the issue for later this week or next week.  It is an important issue.  The late former Deputy Nicky McFadden and I fought for years to get legislation implemented on the issue of head shops.  That took a long time to be put in place.  I hope we do not make the same mistake in respect of vaping shops.  They are very dangerous.  The must be regulated as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>Finally, I note the Leas-Chathaoirleach and I attended the memorial launch and plaque-unveiling for the late Inspector Samuel Donegan, who was killed while on duty in the Border area by a booby-trap bomb on 8 June 1972.  I might need some assistance shortly from Senator Carrigy on the pronunciation but Inspector Donegan was a native of Ballintempen, County Longford.  He served in County Cavan and other places with distinction for many years.  It is important that the inspector is recognised.  It took 50 years for the memorial to be put in place, which is far too long.  In this year, the 100th anniversary of the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, memorials should be erected for every member of the organisation who was killed while on active duty in the State.</p></speech>

Some 87 others were also injured.  It can sometimes be the case that when these atrocities are committed far away, the impact on us is dismissed.  It is felt that we cannot identify with the victims.  Therefore, the scale of the horror is not appreciated.  No doubt, for many, the Ukrainian war feels closer to home than events in south-west Nigeria.  However, people of faith are a body.  An attack against us is felt keenly by many as an attack on our spiritual family.  As of yesterday, local authorities suspect that the responsibility for the terrorist attack lies with the Islamic State in West Africa Province, ISWAP, a militant insurgent group which operates in the region, although no official claim has been made by the group.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In recent years, the militant Islamic group, Boko Haram, has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in Nigeria.  Globally, there has been a clear rise in recorded instances targeting Christians since 2019.  According to the data collected by the armed conflict location and event data, ACLED, project, there have already been 23 separate attacks on church premises and people linked to them so far this year.  For the whole of 2021, there were 31 attacks and in 2020, there were 18.  This is not the result of climate change.  This is violent extremism.</p><p>The Bishop of Ondo, where the attack occurred, stated that "to suggest or make a connection between victims of terror and consequences of climate change is not only misleading but also exactly rubbing salt to the injuries of all who have suffered terrorism in Nigeria".  To date, I do not think we have seen a mention of this from either the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste; not so much as a tweet.</p><p>Ireland needs to have a hard look at what supports we give to persecuted Christians around the world, including people in many areas whose exposure to the faith came from missionaries from our own shores.  Those who want to help can donate to Aid to the Church in Need, which spans 195 countries and works tirelessly to end persecutions of Christians.</p></speech>

He certainly was a gentleman.  I know he will be missed by many and especially the people he represented over a long period.  May he rest in peace.</p> <p>I rise today because 700 is a number that is lucky for some in County Limerick and not lucky for others.  More than 700 people were accepted into the mica scheme today.  It is something in which I have been involved down through the years.  I originally worked with people in relation to pyrite in County Limerick.  I am very glad to say that Limerick was accepted into the pyrite scheme and has today been accepted into the mica scheme.  More than 700 families will benefit from that, which is most welcome.</p> <p>On the other hand, however, we are not even halfway through the month of June.  There are 30 days in June; it is now 14 June and more than 700 people are on waiting lists for new beds in University Hospital Limerick, UHL.  That is halfway through the month.  We are not even in the winter season; this is summer.  It is still at crisis point.  I want to put that back on the agenda of this House.</p> <p>Finally, tomorrow evening in St. Mary's Park in Limerick, the community centre is having its third jobs fair, which is being organised in the regeneration areas.  I was in a community yesterday where I heard a very positive story whereby seven people who had never worked in their lives started employment ten days ago.  They went to a jobs fair in Our Lady of Lourdes community centre and met with employers who were able to talk to them about the different jobs they were offering.  Approximately 30 different organisations came forward offering jobs.</p> <p>It is a great compliment to the Government that so many people are in employment.  I believe unemployment figures are the lowest we have had since prior to the pandemic.  It is a good news story when we see people who have never worked going back into the workforce and it is to be complimented.</p></speech>

Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of domestic violence and violence against women and children, as was reported today in the annual report from Women's Aid for 2021.  The report describes things like hammers, hurls, golf clubs and ordinary household items being used in the hands of abusers who are perpetrating real violence on women and children in their own homes.  The report from 2021 said there were 33,000 disclosures of domestic abuse, 5,000 of which came from children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The victims were thumped, strangled, slapped and headbutted, often while holding their child or children and trying to protect them.  There were almost 1,000 disclosures of sexual abuse and almost 500 disclosures of rape.  Seven women were murdered in one year alone - 2021.  The Women's Aid report states that the duration of calls and contacts from victims has extended and it attributes that to the increasing intensity of the abuse, the complexity of the abuse and the absolute desperation of the victims looking for support.  The report details how abuse goes beyond the physical to the psychological, financial and emotional.  The report is very hard to read, but I commend all of the staff and the volunteers at Women's Aid who respond to those calls.  I commend them on the publication of the annual report.</p><p>I know the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is working on the third national domestic, sexual and gender-based violence strategy.  I urge her to complete the strategy and to come back to this House, as she did previously, and engage with us on the strategy so we can support it and make it real.</p></speech>

Noel was an extraordinary character and a dedicated public representative.  I pay tribute to him today.  I smile as I recall that he always finished his conversations with me by asking: "And how is your daddy?"  That was his final parting comment every time I met him.  He was an extraordinary man.</p> <p>I support Senator Craughwell's motion on Georgia and I wish to be associated with the remarks of Senator Wilson regarding the need for the motion to be progressed today.</p> <p>On foot of the announcement by the Cabinet earlier on the plans to introduce a living wage to replace the minimum wage, I propose that we would have a debate in this House on two issues, the first of which would be a debate on the world of work and what it means in 2022.  In such a debate, it is important that we recognise that our world has changed.  Fundamentally, there needs to be a voice within this Chamber, in the Houses of the Oireachtas and within the Government, for those in the workforce who get up early in the morning and those who work late at night.  We must make work pay.  Whether that is through a combination of the living wage, tax breaks, childcare or whatever, there is an incumbency on us to ensure that the world of work pays and that those who go out to work are able to live in a comfortable manner.  I hope that debate will take place in advance of the budget.</p> <p>My second request, even though we do not have a direct say as a House in the budget, is that as we are now in the pre-budget submission season, it is important that we as a House debate the framework of the budget and what we would like to see as part of the budget in October of this year.  I hope that the Leader will facilitate those requests.</p> <p>Today is a very sad day.  A man who was a tremendous public representative for 55 years has passed to his eternal reward.  He was a man who loved life, who loved people and who believed in the decency of everybody.  He changed his views on many social issues and was very supportive of many of us.

I never had the privilege of meeting Noel, but I do have a wonderful letter at home that was written on his typewriter.  As Senator Boyhan said, Noel did not have a mobile phone or computer.  It is a testament to the strength of his work, therefore, that he was elected every term and for so many years.  As Senator Buttimer stated, it was because he was so embedded in his community.</p> <p>Yesterday, I joined the artists in Richmond Road studios in Dublin 3 in a protest outside the Dublin City Council offices.  It was a wonderful celebration of music, dance and art, but it was also a day of protest to say that they should not be yet another name in the long list of artists' studios that have closed in Dublin over the past 20 years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That list includes: Blackpitts Studios, Mill Street, Dublin 8; New Art Studios, Mary Street, Dublin 1; Steambox Gallery and Studios, the Liberties, Dublin 8; Red Stables Studios, Dublin 3; Commonplace Studios, Dublin 2; Millstreet Studios, Dublin 8; Exchange Dublin, Dublin 1; She-d, Gardiner Lane, Dublin 1; Abbey Artist Studios, Marlborough Street, Dublin 1; Broadstone Studios, Dublin 7; Print Block Studios, Dublin 8; Moxie Studios, Lad Lane, Dublin 2; Mabos, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin 2; The Joinery, Stoneybatter, Dublin 7; Monster Truck Gallery and Studios, Francis Street, Dublin 8; South Studios, Dublin 8; Littlesalt, Hendron Building, Dublin 7; Market Studios, Halston Street, Dublin 7; and Brunswick Mill Studios, Dublin 7.</p><p>They are just some of studios, arts and culture places that have closed in the city over the past decade and a half.

Such a debate already took place in the D&aacute;il and I hope that the Seanad will also have the opportunity to discuss that very important and welcome review.  We have a very poor track record in protecting wildlife and biodiversity in this country.  There are areas of concern with the report and I hope the Leader can facilitate that debate.</p> <p>On World Blood Donor Day, I remind anybody who is eligible to give blood to do so.  Stocks are again running low, particularly for anybody who has type A+ blood.  Only two days stock are left in the country.  If we are forced to have amber alerts, it means the cancellation of medical procedures in hospitals.  It is vital that we have the stocks in place.  I also welcome plans to move to the individual screening model that we have seen in Britain and Canada where everybody is assessed on their own individual risk.  People who may have thought they would not have been eligible to give blood in the past may now be eligible to do so.  I encourage them to come forward and donate blood.</p></speech>

For the British Government to claim its motivation for the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill is to protect the Good Friday Agreement is deplorable.  It has twisted the Good Friday Agreement and the achievements of our collective peace process to suit its own selfish party-political needs, the antithesis of what the agreement is about, which is partnership and compromise.</p> <p>The British Foreign Secretary, Ms Truss, has said the EU does not understand the unique context of Northern Ireland or the principle of consent even though the majority of people in Northern Ireland rejected Brexit.  The majority of MLAs who reject this legislation are pro-protocol, pro-power sharing and understand when people destabilise the Good Friday Agreement, dialogue brings stability back.  The British Government is jeopardising Northern Ireland's economic progress and the stability it desperately needs as does everyone on this island.  The British Foreign Secretary said the people in Northern Ireland will not be treated differently from those in the rest of the UK anymore.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Does that mean they will not have that effective dual access, which has helped Northern Ireland weather the post-Brexit realities and the soaring cost of living better than anywhere else in the UK, and increased interest in inward investment?  She says this Bill will protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  In recent months the British Government has talked up an imminent threat to peace but there have been no mass movement protests despite the best efforts of a minority of a minority.  MI5 has reduced the security terrorism threat level from severe to substantial.  The Good Friday Agreement always sought to bring stability, partnership and shared opportunities and to alleviate suffering in Northern Ireland.  Where are those priorities now?  When it comes to breaking international law, the British Government states that the doctrine of necessity provides a clear basis to justify the non-performance of international obligations based on the strain on Northern Ireland's institutions and sociopolitical conditions.  Those conditions have not been met.  The DUP is fuelling this nonsense.  Shame on the DUP and shame on the British Government.</p></speech>

I knew him a long time.  He was one of the last of that generation of hard-working councillors who did all their work with a pencil and notebook and delivered a great service to their constituents.  He was a very hard man to canvass because he was never at home.  He was always out working for the people.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh s&eacute;.</p> <p>I join with Senator Keogan in expressing my horror at the shootings in the Catholic church in Nigeria.  It was one of the worst atrocities we have seen in a long time.  It is a country we have had a lot of association with over the decades because of our Catholic missionaries.  There is hardly a parish in Ireland where someone does not have a relative, either a priest or a nun, who toiled in the mission fields of Nigeria.  In fact, the church in question was built by Irish priests and brothers.  I was disappointed with the general reporting on the issue in our media and politically.  It seems we reserve our horror for things that involve Israel or the Americans.  It amazes me.  It was very unfortunate that the bishop was upset by the comments made by President Higgins.  I will not criticise our President because that is not my function but it is sad that the Catholic bishop and some of his colleagues were upset by the comments that were made.  Everyone in Ireland stands in solidarity with the people of Nigeria.</p> <p>The Good Friday Agreement is coming under threat from all sides because of the duplicity and bloody-mindedness of the British, but also because of intransigence from loyalists and opportunism from the extreme republicans who will continue to use the North as their political football to game both sides, North and South.  It is very fitting at this time that the Taoiseach unveiled the bust of the great John Hume in Strasbourg only last week.  If one had to single out one person, John Hume was more responsible than anyone else for the Good Friday Agreement.  He proved that one can earn a place at the negotiating table without shooting people, bombing people or killing innocent women and children.  He delivered more than anybody else.</p></speech>

What we are hearing from the UK today is atrocious.  Naomi Long, head of the Alliance Party, spoke on Radio 1 this morning.  She was very clear that the majority of people in Northern Ireland, and the majority of MLAs, who are the representatives of Northern Ireland, wish to see an operational Northern Ireland protocol.  She spoke very clearly about the importance for the communities in Northern Ireland and how it is about quality of life in Northern Ireland and their economy.  The economies of two regions in the UK are flying and Northern Ireland is one of them.  That is because of the access to the Single Market, as well as access to the UK market.  This protocol has been agreed and signed up to.  What is happening now is absolutely shocking.  It is great to see the leadership we are seeing from some of the Northern Ireland representatives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to see more, though.

The only comment I can make, other than to accept Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's request to arrange a debate with, and receive an update from, the Minister as soon as possible, is that this is singularly the most partisan and self-serving manoeuvre that we have seen from Boris Johnson in his very coloured career to date.</p></speech>

I will try to get that update from the Minister as soon as I can.</p> <p>Senators O'Sullivan and Keogan spoke about the atrocity that occurred in Nigeria recently.  I wish to put on record our condolences to the families of the 40 people who passed away and our good wishes to the 87 who were injured in that horrific attack.</p> <p>Senator Boylan spoke about Pride month.  She also sought a debate on the national wildlife review, which I will try to organise as quickly as I can.  The Senator referred to the blood donation crisis.  I thank her for raising that issue.</p> <p>Senator Sherlock discussed the long list of artisan studios that had closed.  She is right in that Dublin City Council, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage need to work together, examine what is wrong and determine what supports are needed to ensure that we foster creativity, not just in Dublin, but around all of the country.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter.</p> <p>Senators Buttimer, Wilson and Craughwell asked for an amendment to the Order of Business to discuss No. 113 before everything else.  I would be happy to do so.  Unfortunately, I cannot take it without debate because that would not be fair to colleagues.  Instead, I will try to arrange a debate of 60 minutes as soon as we can next week, after which we can pass it as a House, if that is okay with everyone.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer also sought a debate on budget preparations, the world of work and how we ensure that work pays better.  I will organise that as quickly as possible, although I will point to Fine Gael's Private Members' business tomorrow, which is connected with this matter.</p> <p>Senator Fitzpatrick discussed Women's Aid's annual report, which was issued today.  I have taken a particular interest in these reports since my election 11 years ago.  Every year, the statistics grow more shocking.  They do not appear to be receding in any way, shape or form.  I look forward to the implementation of the third strategy by the Minister for Justice and to a debate on that strategy in the House as soon as it is published.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne referred to this morning's welcome move by the Government to include Limerick and Clare in the mica redress scheme.  She correlated the 700 mica-affected families waiting in Limerick with the 700 people waiting to access beds in University Hospital Limerick.  She has been raising the issue of the hospital week in, week out for the past two years.  It is time that we put in place an independent review to find out what is, or is not, happening in the hospital to cause it to be such a constant concern.</p> <p>Senator Wilson supported the call for a debate on the motion on Georgia.</p> <p>Senator Carrigy sought a debate on childcare in the community and the staffing of same, which is an issue around the country.  He also sought a debate on vaping and e-cigarettes.  That legislation is at pre-legislative scrutiny stage and we will get it as soon as the report is finished.  I will keep the Senator updated.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about Rescue 116 and the lack of in-house aviation expertise in the Department and the Irish Coast Guard, which seems striking.  He is right, in that, of the 44 recommendations, 16 of which were made to the Minister, two related specifically to the lack of expertise.  Once Mr. Jurgen Whyte's report is released, it will be interesting to see whether those recommendations have been taken on board.  We will watch closely.</p> <p>Senator Cassells passionately shared his feelings regarding the debacle of yesterday's meeting in respect of the accident and emergency department in Navan.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am pleased to hear the Minster is in charge and will make decisions and not anybody else.</p><p>Senator Wall of the Labour Party asked for a debate on rural transport and particularly on the NTA funding for the public service obligation levy with regard to the short hop zone in Newbridge.  I will organise that debate as quickly as I can.</p><p>Senator Hackett spoke about Pride and I want to wish her and her husband, Mark, a happy anniversary.  Twenty-one years is a great milestone and Senator Hackett paid tribute to our colleague, Senator Norris.</p><p>While Senator Conway also spoke about him, Senator Boyhan set out the sad loss of Councillor Noel Collins from Cork.  We only spoke about him a couple of weeks ago on his retirement and people were regaled of the stories of his particular style of politics, which went down incredibly well and was well received in Cork because of his repeated re-election for 54 years.  He was a remarkable man and an enormous loss, not just to his family but to the entire community he served in Cork.  They will be very big boots to fill.  I extend all of our condolences to his family, constituents and supporters on his sad passing today.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne opened today by talking about the UK's unilateral legislative move and he looked for a debate on the future work of local and national media arising from the delay in the publication of the report on the models of funding we should have for our local and national media.  I will arrange that debate as soon as I can, as well as arranging a debate on local government.</p></speech>

Today's throwaway take-make-waste culture is neither economically or environmentally sustainable.  A circular economy would produce less waste and retain more value in our economy for longer.</p><p>What does the circular economy mean in practice?  It is easy to say we want a less wasteful economy but what steps do we need to take to make the transition from a wasteful linear economy to a circular economy a reality?  Those next steps are the substance of this Bill, which provides a legislative framework within which we can make that transition.  Firstly, the Bill provides the legislative basis to place the circular economy strategy, circular economy programme and the national food waste prevention roadmap on a statutory footing.  This will ensure the transition to the circular economy remains a national policy priority.  Under this Bill, the Minister with responsibility for the environment will have the power to introduce new environmental levies on a range of single-use packaging and on food containers.  The initial focus here will be on the introduction of a levy on disposable hot drink cups later this year.  The precise details of that levy will be set out in secondary legislation.  All the proceeds from these new environmental levies will be ring-fenced in a circular economy fund for projects relating to environmental and climate action objectives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The objective of the new levies is not to raise revenue but to encourage the use of reusable alternatives so that the consumer never incurs the levy in the first place.  This use of economic instruments to incentivise sustainable behaviour works because we have seen it work with the plastic bag and landfill levies.</p><p>Since inception in 2001, the environment fund has provided ring-fenced funding to a range of environmental initiatives.  The Bill replaces the environment fund with a new circular economy fund, which will continue to support those environmental initiatives but with a greater focus on promoting the circular economy.</p><p>Last January, we had a very thorough debate in this House on the use of CCTV and other technologies by local authorities for waste enforcement.  That debate was taken in the context of a Bill, sponsored by Senator Malcolm Byrne, entitled the Local Government (Surveillance powers in Relation to Certain Offences) Bill, and followed a similar Bill from Senator Wall.  I thank Senators Byrne and Wall for their long-standing commitment to seeking progress on this issue.  This Bill provides for the use of recording technologies for waste enforcement purposes in a way that is fully in compliance with national and EU data protection law.</p><p>Littering and illegal dumping are issues that cause huge upset for rural and urban communities.  They spoil local beauty spots and undermine the work of Tidy Towns committees, and other volunteer groups, all around the country.  Therefore, this Bill provides for the general data protection regulation, GDPR-compliant use of CCTV and other recording devices for the purpose of waste and litter enforcement.  In terms of data privacy, I am satisfied the approach provided for in the Bill ensures that the processing of personal data may be carried out by local authorities tasked with enforcing litter and waste laws in an appropriate, necessary and proportionate manner.</p><p>Further provisions in the Bill will help drive better segregation of waste in the commercial sector, where the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, statistics indicate that 70% of the material that is placed in the general waste bin should be in recycling or organic bins.  Providing for better segregation of commercial waste should ultimately save businesses money through lower collection costs.</p><p>The Bill also provides for the introduction of a new waste recovery levy.  This will apply to waste sent for recovery, whether that is for incineration or landfill backfilling here in Ireland or waste that is exported for those purposes.  The new landfill recovery levy will complement the existing landfill levy and will further incentive recycling or re-use over other disposal methods.  In common with the landfill levy, revenue from the waste recovery levy will be ring-fenced in the new circular economy fund.</p><p>End of waste and by-product applications are EPA regulatory processes that provide a means whereby material, which would otherwise be disposed of as waste, can be safely reused in the form of secondary raw materials.  The Bill provides for streamlining these processes which will help drive higher quality applications, and tailor the level of regulatory scrutiny applied to applications relative to their environmental risk.</p><p>Finally, the Bill will end the issuing of new licences for the exploration and mining of coal, lignite and oil shale.  This will consolidate our policy of reducing our reliance on fossil fuel.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the widespread constructive engagement with this Bill so far.  I do not think that it is wrong to say that there is general cross-party support for the Bill's objectives.  The Bill's pre-legislative scrutiny process was comprehensive and informative.  I thank the Senators who were involved in that process for their contributions.</p><p>I introduced amendments to the Bill on D&aacute;il Committee Stage.  Those amendments provided for additional fixed penalty notices and for the establishment of a GDPR-compliant register of households that do not have a waste collection service.  Deputies from all sides of the House tabled some very constructive Committee Stage amendments and I was able to take on board a significant number of them as Government amendments on Report Stage.  The amendments we accepted included the following: an expanded definition of circular economy, and provision for increased reporting and consultation requirements regarding the circular economy strategy; an amendment that added the definition of single-use packaging and expanded that to not just be for food and drink but for all packaging; we accepted an amendment that introduced a requirement to set out targets in the circular economy strategy for specified sectors; and annual reviews of the circular economy strategy and the food waste roadmap were also provided for, together with a requirement to publish a report on reducing single-use packaging for fruit and vegetables within 12 months.</p><p>I intend to bring a number of essential amendments on Committee Stage in this House to address some urgent matters concerning energy capacity.  First, I intend to amend the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 to allow the EPA to consider applications for integrated pollution control and industrial emissions licences that are subject to the provisions of section 181 of the Planning Act 2000.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In addition, I will introduce an amendment to the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 for the purpose of transposing the requirement in Article 59.1(b) of the internal market in electricity directive 2019 to allow the Commission for Regulation of Utilities to ensure compliance by market participants with their obligations under the directive.</p><p>The Bill provides a pathway for Ireland to achieve a circular economy.  It has been characterised by a successful collaborative approach as it has proceeded through the Oireachtas and to this House.  I look forward to bringing it through this House in the same spirit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#EE00200"><p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  It is good to see him here again.  What is the number one thing we hear on the door as members of the Green Party?  We hear about plastic pollution and about litter in general.  Dumping is probably the number one thing anyone hears when going to the doors, particularly in rural areas.  Where does that come from?  It comes from the fact that we have overconsumption.  A circular economy is about ensuring that we are not only consuming, but also putting things back into the system.  If there was a 100% perfect circular economy, nothing would be destroyed or thrown away and everything would be reused.  I am no under illusions that we will reach that point but this issue is part of what this Bill is trying to address.</p> <p>The Minister of State is correct that it generally has cross-party support, although suggestions have been made, most of which the Minister of State has taken on board.  As the Minister of State mentioned, the Bill has also been subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  What was interesting in that pre-legislative scrutiny and the contributions of the witnesses who came before the committee was how much industry wants the support of regulations.  Everyone knows that consumers expect a greener product, but how do you get to that greener product if it will cost you more money to produce than a competitor's product?  It is incredibly difficult to ask somebody to do that.  It is why social enterprises find it quite difficult to compete with others on the open market.  They are doing something to an ethical standard above those of their competitors.  When it comes down to it, if you look at the Companies Acts, you will see that every company is supposed to make a profit.  That is ultimately their obligation to their shareholders.  What we are doing with this Bill is supporting industry.  We are putting in place regulations so that there will be a level playing field and everybody will be operating on the same basis.  It will also bring in the ethical and environmental standards that all of us know all of the citizens and all of the people who live in Ireland want.  We want to see a cleaner, greener island and that is what this Bill will bring about.</p> <p>It is not long since the Minister of State was in Galway to launch the 2GoCup scheme.  This has been really successful and nine cafes are now involved.  The scheme means that you do not have to have your own reusable cup to go into a cafe.  You can go into one, give a &euro;1 deposit, take one of its cups, use it and then drop it back to another participating cafe.  I would love to see that rolled out everywhere.  I have seen it in theatres in Galway.  You are not using paper or plastic cups and you are not expected to bring your own.  It is very realistic about the fact that people do not always have a cup in their handbag.  When you bring a cup back, it will be washed and is then ready for another person to use.  That is what we need to get to.  That is the perfect vision of a circular economy.</p> <p>There have been quite a lot of conversations at the joint committee and outside of these Houses with regard to compostable cups and the suggestion that they may be better for the environment.  The evidence is clear; they simply are not.  The reality is that they are just not composted because it is actually quite difficult to do.  It puts an onus on businesses to provide the kind of facilities required to compost these cups.</p> <p>One of the cafes we visited in Galway is purchasing an enormous number of cups at 18 cent a cup.  It is purchasing 80,000 at a time and having to find somewhere to store them.  It wanted a solution.  That solution was a reusable cup that it did not have to rely on their customers to bring in so that it would not have to be concerned that it would lose business if a customer did not bring one and if it provided no alternative.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is now providing an alternative.  That just shows the kind of innovation that can happen when a circular economy is put at the core of a nation's values.  This Bill would see Ireland become the first country in the world to eliminate this kind of use of disposable coffee cups.  That is where we need to get to.  It was a big jump politically when we imposed the plastic bag levy but look at what a success that initiative has been.  I know from speaking to officials in the Minister of State's Department that there were exemptions for plastic bags.  Nobody is suggesting that there may not be instances where disposal cups might need to be used.  There may well be such instances and that is what stakeholder engagement is about.  It is about engaging with people and asking what are the challenges and how can we address them.</p><p>Out of this Bill will come regulations.  It is not about setting in stone what will happen from now on but it is about setting down the principle as to where we want to get.  We do not believe that disposable cups are the answer.</p><p>There is another significant issue I would like to address and which comes up for any politician, that is, dumping.  I know that particularly deprived estates near where I live are seeing the results of illegal dumping.  People drive into those estates and dump there without any regard for the residents and their standard of living.  I did a clean-up in an estate around the corner from where I live.  I have done several clean-ups in that particular estate, in fact, because the dumping is non-stop.  One could find all the equipment needed to kit-out a kitchen in that one estate of 75 houses.  That is because there is a long driveway into the estate and there are no CCTV cameras.  Law and order has gone out the window.  People need support.  They want to do the right thing.  They do not want to having to clean up the same patch of ground over and over again.  That is why I was delighted to see that CCTV would be allowed under this Bill because one is always told by local authorities that there are general data protection regulation, GDPR, issues.  Those issues are finally going to be addressed and I thank the Minister of State for that.</p><p>I look forward to full engagement on these issues.  I have no doubt on the basis of past experience in the Seanad that there will be full engagement on this Bill.  This is only a Second Stage debate.  I commend the Minister of State and his staff on the considerable engagement they have undertaken to get the Bill to this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1664" speakername="Sharon Keogan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#FF00200"><p>The Minister of State is welcome to the Chamber.  The circular economy Bill is in keeping with the Green Party's approach to policy in that it is ineffective and targets ordinary people who are already struggling with existing charges.  In theory, this Bill aims to support Ireland's transition to a circular economy but the methodology of the studies it is based on is very flawed.  In practice, the coffee cup levy is just another imposition on small businesses and people who are already struggling to cope.  Not only that but it will also be ineffective.</p><p>The Bill is wide in scope and has many unintended consequences.  It is based on a flawed methodology, life-cycle thinking, which aims to assess the impacts of the generation and the management of waste but fails to consider certain environmental, economic and risk management factors.  Reusables produce 2.8 times more carbon dioxide and consume 3.4 times more fresh water than single-use-based products.  Studies show that a reusable coffee cup, if washed four times a day, is discarded after nine to 12 days.  I do not know how many reusable coffee cups I have had but I certainly do not know where any of them are today.  Reusable coffee cups also have very short life cycles.</p><p>It is also likely that many environmentally conscious people will be unable to use reusable cups.  In the UK, only 6% of traders use reusables due to the fact that they are legally liable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In Ireland, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, has previously stated that coffee shops are legally liable for any illness, injury or safety issues that arise.  It is likely that many outlets will not accept reusable coffee cups due to the legal risk as our country becomes increasingly litigious.  In many cases, people will not be able to avoid the levies and choose what is perceived to be the more environmental option.  Whether it is carbon taxes or an attempt to ban the use of turf, the Green Party seems determined to make everyday necessities more difficult for ordinary people to use.</p><p>The provisions on the GDPR-compliant use of CCTV is also concerning.  I have been an advocate for CCTV in Duleek, Donore and other areas in County Meath.  CCTV plays a very important role in helping keep our communities safe and in ensuring that people do not dump large amounts of waste.  However, the imposition of fines on any person who does not dispose of coffee cups in the right way is too harsh.  A fine for littering may not be very costly to the people in this Chamber, but the measure will affect many people who are simply living pay cheque to pay cheque.  It has the potential to cause major upheaval, particularly at a time when so many of our citizens are struggling to pay.  As a Senator and a former county councillor, I volunteer every Saturday in my town for Tidy Towns.  I am regularly seen picking up rubbish, sometimes in my high heels.  I see very few coffee cups.  The focus on coffee cups is misguided.  I see more plastic bottles on the ground than any other item.  A tax should be placed on such bottles.  Takeaway boxes are also one of the main causes of litter.  They also pose a threat and a hazard to local residents because they attract wildlife.  By all means, the Government should put a tax on takeaway boxes.  Based on my own experience of looking after the community, these two waste objects should be our main focus.  </p><p>Granted, some sensible amendments to the Bill have been proposed.  An amendment was proposed to introduce a fixed penalty notice in relation to breaches of the waste facility permit.  An amendment was also proposed to provide for the establishment of a GDPR-compliant register of households without a waste collection service.  I am not opposed to any of these proposed amendments.  I recognise the need for proper waste management.  However, I urge the Government to explore other measures and to avoid squeezing ordinary people further at a time when a significant percentage of our population is already struggling with energy poverty.  I apologise for the fact that I will not be here to hear to the Minister of State's reply, but I will listen attentively to the recording.</p></speech>

I welcome this legislation.  I slightly disagree with Senator Pauline O'Reilly who stated that the top issue on the doorsteps is dumping.  The top issue on the doorsteps is the cost of living.  This legislation will actually contribute towards saving people money.  In fact, it is estimated that if we can boost Ireland's circularity by eliminating wasteful practices and making better use of the resources that we have, we can save up to &euro;2.3 billion per year.  Thinking about the amount of food and packaging waste that is out there, if we can reduce that, it will represent a significant saving.  I disagree with Senator Keogan's contribution in many ways.  The legislation is not just about coffee cups.  It applies to other areas.  The legislation is about the safe and effective use of containers and packaging.  I know that a lot of focus is being placed on single-use cups.  The legislation is about ensuring that we manage and use the resources that we have efficiently, and that we try to minimise or indeed eliminate wasteful practices in any way possible.</p> <p>I am quite happy that there is a clear commitment, within this legislation, to achieving a number of the sustainable development goals which were adopted by the UN in September 2015.  We have until 2030 to try to reach some of these goals.  This legislation goes significantly towards that.  As the Minister of State outlined, it will also contribute towards reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is essential that it is about more than just legislation and regulation.  This must be accompanied by measures in respect of education.  There is talk of this in the context of the environmental fund.  There must be emphasis from a very early stage in life on why we need to adopt these practices.  There is, obviously, the very welcome new second level subject on climate and sustainability, but this is something on which I see major advertising campaigns to inform people as to how this will operate in practice, as was mentioned earlier, much the same as way the plastic bag levy was adopted.</p><p>I mentioned that under the circular economy strategy that has been drawn up, regard will be given under section 7 to a number of bodies and reports, including the UN sustainable development goals, which I very much welcome.  However, a concern I have is that there is no mention of engagement with local government during that period.  In fact, the first time within the legislation we see mention of local government is when we come to the piece concerning CCTV and detection of illegal dumping.  In section 8(14) it is proposed there would be a committee to advise the Minister on his or her functions.  In that context, I ask the either elected local government representatives or executive officials would have a role in this, particularly in terms of the roll-out of some of the measures, something that will be facilitated most effectively at a local level.  I also ask that we ensure that in advising on those functions for that committee, there would be guarantees of representation for young people or youth organisations representing young people.  I would certainly look at considering amendments on that at Committee Stage.</p><p>I note the establishment of the circular economy fund.  Many of the powers with regard to that are vested in the Minister.  Again, I hope that consideration could be given to a greater role for local authorities in terms of specific local initiatives and that could in some way be tied into how the fund would be administered on the ground.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the Minister of State referenced both my Bill and that of Senator Wall, the moves to allow local authorities to use CCTV and other technologies to be able to catch illegal dumpers.  This is a curse in all of our communities, urban and rural.  I disagree again with Senator Keogan with regard to believing that people should not be subject to a fine if they engage in dumping because they are not financially well off.  I do not care who somebody is, no matter how wealthy or disadvantaged they are.  If they are involved in dumping, they deserve to be punished.  The Minister of State will find general agreement from virtually all sections of the community that this should be the case.  It is a scourge on all our communities and for the Tidy Towns groups and development associations that do wonderful, good work, which is undone by those who are involved in dumping.</p><p>I welcome the provisions in the legislation.  I am glad to say that many of them echo those of the Bill I proposed and that we debated a number of months ago.  I am obviously keen to ensure that in as far as possible, it will be general data protection regulation, GDPR, compliant but I am also keen that the legislation will be technology neutral as new technologies are developed.  We spoke previously around areas like drone technology and so on, which can be rolled out in a GDPR-compliant fashion and which can be used to catch those responsible for damaging our communities.  We know again that this will represent a significant saving.  I surveyed local authorities and we are talking about something in the order of &euro;90 million to &euro;100 million per year being spent on dealing with illegal dumping and littering.  If that money can be saved by local authorities to be invested in other areas, that is a significant development.</p><p>I ask that when this legislation is enacted, immediate supports be made available to local authorities in order that they can roll out the necessary CCTV.  If the Minister of State talks to local councils, he will discover that they are more than willing to deploy the necessary technologies.  Elected representatives and council officials want to catch these illegal dumpers and ensure they are prosecuted.  They will need the resources initially to do that, though.  I ask that when the legislation is enacted, we follow through on this as a priority.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What the legislation provides for is a levy and a potential ban on one-use items.  I am supportive of the broad principle of that.  It is what we want to achieve.  What I do want to ensure though is that we do not essentially replace one-off items with cheap plastic, and that it becomes an excuse for doing so.  We should not say that we are not going to use the one-off items so let us just use lots of cheap plastic.  The key to this is about limiting the percentage of plastic that we are going to use.  This is a concern that is being expressed by paper cup manufacturers and it is a legitimate concern that needs to be heard.  Effectively, the fear is that paper cups will be banned and we will end up with plastic cups that will involve cheap plastic and in the long run will not be good for the environment.  We have got to be careful of unintended consequences.</p><p>If Senator Keogan cannot find a KeepCup, I will quite happily supply her with one.  I have a KeepCup that I use and a number of others.  This is a very welcome piece of legislation, which is attempting to ensure that we properly manage the valuable resources we have.  The Minister of State should expect broad cross-party support on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#JJ00200"><p>The Minister of State is welcome.  It is great to be here.  We are fully in support of this important piece of legislation that has been talked about for a long time.</p> <p>When talking about the circular economy, education is a major issue in terms of explaining it, especially from the younger generation to the older generation.  I was at a meeting a few weeks ago and the circular economy came up.  A man put up his hand and said he had no idea what we were talking about.  We need education on the entire terminology relating to the circular economy - what it is about, what we are trying to achieve and where the information is available.  The amount of education that is required is phenomenal.  It is not just at primary school but through all the generations.  In many ways, that will probably be the biggest task for the Minister of State.  I honestly believe that the generations are struggling with the terminology and what we are trying to achieve.  We need to break it down so we can get a clear understanding of the message we are trying to get out.  That is one of the key points I would like to make.</p> <p>The proposed levy on single-use plastics is a positive step.  I do not want to mention the names of particular shops, but if one goes to any shop tomorrow morning one will see a line of cups to the left-hand side of the coffee machine.  It is a significant issue.  I often wonder how we are going to change.  I remember that 20 years ago we introduced the plastic bag levy overnight and we moved on to more appropriate ways of doing our shopping.  This is about trying to change the way we shop and the culture of society.  That will take a little bit of work as well in terms of education, support and a bit of a stick to make sure that we get there.</p> <p>The key issue will be to make sure that we get the big changes that are going to be so valuable in society going forward.  Again, there is a generational issue.  We are going to have to bring people with us.  That will require a good body of work that needs to be thought through.  I will be straight with the Minister of State: I do not have the solutions.  I do not know how he is going to bring the generations with him without saying: "Oh my God, this is another tax."  This is going to be a body of work that we will just have to work on.</p> <p>One of the key issues I have identified in the legislation is the national food waste prevention strategy.  The Minister of State might elaborate on that.  I might be wrong in my figures, but I think that 30% of all food that is purchased is wasted, whether it is yoghurts, potatoes or other produce.  Consumers are probably buying too much in one go.  Again, this will involve a major change in how we alter how society purchases and stores products.  We need to learn what dates on yoghurt, for example, mean.  Some people believe that a yoghurt cannot be eaten after the date on the container while others believe the date does not matter until something is wrong with the product.  It will take significant training and information to educate people.  The point I make is about how we are going to get the information out there to all sections of society so that people can change their practices.  I look forward to seeing how the Minister of State will ensure we get these important strategies across to the public and what means he will adopt to get the information out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Online will only work with certain generations.  How we get that change out there would be totally different in some scenarios.</p><p>The proposed changes to GDPR for CCTV regarding dumping are very positive.  I ask the Minister of State to elaborate on how that will work with historical cases and whether the legislation will apply retrospectively.  Will we look back at other cases with GDPR issues?  How will other cases be looked upon regarding this new legislation?</p><p>Section 4 seems to mention the chief executive.  I presume that is the chief executive of the local authority.  Like other Senators, I am concerned about giving all the powers to local authority management.  We have elected members who do exceptional work.  The Bill makes no mention of local authorities but states that the chief executive will appoint.  While I am open to correction, the Minister of State is giving an executive function to the local authority management.  Local authority members should have a greater role on issues regarding CCTV and dumping.  Motions have come before local authorities.  It is really important for the local authorities to have a real angle regarding matters on which the members have good knowledge.  It is important that we be frank.  Some local authority managements are absolutely brilliant while some local authority managements might not have the same respect for elected members.  That interaction as it applies to this legislation might be improved.  I did not count how many times chief executive was mentioned, but it is certainly more than ten times.  We need to find a balance to ensure we can get everyone on the same field.</p><p>I believe the legislation is important and is well drafted.  Those are my initial thoughts.  Hopefully, we can work together to get the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas and enacted as soon as we can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#KK00200"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I echo others in welcoming the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill which is long overdue.  For too long we have developed a global economic system which is extractive, linear and based on hyper consumption.  The Bill will not address the bigger issue relating to the growth model we live within, but it is a welcome step.  We know we are using raw materials unsustainably and this at least puts in place a framework whereby we value the materials within a product and can ensure that they are long lived, and that they can be repaired, reused, repurposed and only as a last resort recycled.</p> <p>While I welcome the Bill, I wish to raise the number of issues with the Minister of State.  The first relates to construction and demolition waste.  Throughout the country we have enormous levels of dereliction.  We are also seeing young buildings only 30 or 40 years old being demolished.  It is widely believed - the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action heard from experts on this - that construction and demolition waste is the fastest growing waste stream in the country and could be producing 10 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually.</p> <p>Like everything, the most carbon-efficient building is the one that is already built.  How does the Minister of State plan to address unnecessary demolition?  Will we see legislation to limit unnecessary demolition?  We do not need to go too far from this building to see the site that was once the Kevin Street Institute of Technology, a building which was important for its architectural value but also for the fact that it had embodied carbon.  It has now been completely flattened instead of seeing how that building could be repurposed and redeveloped into housing and apartments.  If a building cannot be repurposed and the only option is to demolish it, will we see the proper segregation of waste and the reuse of as much of the materials as possible following demolition?</p> <p>Others have already mentioned food waste.  I understand that on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il it was agreed that the Minister would prepare an annual report on the implementation of the food waste prevention strategy.  If that is the case, it is very welcome.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are a few points I would like to raise.  The first relates to the terminology used.  Will the language align with the revised EU waste framework directive 2018, which would ensure the reduction of food waste at each stage of the food supply chain?  We have to capture food loss as well as food waste and many people are not aware of the distinction.  Food waste is the food we buy in the shop that then goes to waste, whereas food loss is when crops die in the ground, for example, because it is not financially viable for the farmer to take them up or due to pests.  We have to capture the whole food industry if we really want to address the emissions and the waste.</p><p>Under the provisions of the Bill and the strategy, there is a target to reduce food waste by 50% by 2030.  Would the Minister of State be open to considering annual food waste targets?  We have passed the climate Act and have our annual targets and sectoral targets.  An annual target of a 7% reduction, alongside mandatory reporting by food businesses on the amount of waste they generate, would allow us to track whether we are meeting those targets.  We can set targets all we want but if we are not actually on track to meet them, they will not make a difference.  Having those annual targets would allow us to monitor that and make sure we are in fact reducing both food waste and food loss.  I would also like assurances that when food redistribution is required to reduce food waste, business will prioritise human consumption over animal feed or reprocessing into non-food products.</p><p>Moving on to the matter of single-use items, particularly plastics, I was fortunate enough in my time as an MEP to negotiate the single-use plastics directive for my political group.  I saw at first hand the power of the business lobby during those negotiations.  It was desperately trying to water down measures.  Ireland&rsquo;s own Repak played a very negative role in the single-use plastics directive.  Through a freedom of information request, we were able to show just how much these lobbyists pushed back against targets and were successful in delaying the introduction of deposit return schemes in Ireland.  It is great that we are finally going to get a deposit return scheme in Ireland but I again echo the calls from my colleagues in the D&aacute;il to expand that scheme to include glass.  Glass is particularly suitable for reuse.  We could work with small and medium enterprises on this, as has been done in other jurisdictions, including in the United States, where they have encouraged craft beer companies or dairy farmers to go back to using glass.</p><p>I would also like catering businesses to be supported to move away from disposable products to reusable ones.  During the debate on the single-use plastics directive, when the issue of plastics was having its moment in the sun, we hailed as a huge achievement the fact that biodegradable food containers were being used on the Leinster House campus.  I had to laugh because the European Parliament in Strasbourg had already moved to the reusable model, where people gave a &euro;2 deposit and got their salad, soup or whatever in a glass container and then brought it back and got their &euro;2 back.</p><p>The problem with lauding biodegradable containers as positive is that most people are not aware that they have to be disposed of properly.  They have to go into a bin that will be diverted to an industrial composter.  On this campus, we deposit the biodegradable containers in which we get our salads or soups or dinners in the regular bin.  That completely defeats the purpose of being biodegradable.  Likewise, there are concerns around the linings of the food bowls used both on this campus and in general, particularly for salads.  The food containers in the Leinster House facilities were found to have 12 times the permitted amount of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS, on them.  If we want to bring people along on this journey and get them to buy into it we should be leading by example.  We should abandon the single-use items in this building and bring in that model of reusable deposit return schemes.</p><p>I would also raise the so-called latte levy.  Nobody would disagree that discarded coffee cups are a blight, particularly in cities and towns.  Actually, I will take that back as somebody does disagree.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We also see them on roadsides and in hedgerows, discarded through car windows.</p><p>Has the Minister of State considered the Italian levy model?  It uses a graduated levy on containers, determined by the amount of plastic in the containers.  Those who are producing the worst forms of single-use items incur the highest levies, incentivising businesses to buy the best forms.  However, I would prefer it if we moved to a reuse model.</p><p>What precautionary measures are being taken to ensure that we do not get the cheap products about which we are being warned, that is, those that are marketed as reusable but will realistically only be used once or twice or, at festivals, will be discarded?</p><p>I am running out of time.  There is so much in this Bill that I hope to get to on Committee Stage.  I wish to reiterate my support for legislating for the provision of refill products in supermarkets of a certain size.  Detergents, dry foods and cosmetics lend themselves to refillable containers.  There is an issue regarding insurance and repairs.  I encourage the Minister of State to consider Italy's laws on obsolescence because we cannot afford to wait for the EU to act.  Thanks to the influence of business, we have seen how long the EU has taken to agree a standard charger for mobile phones.  I commend Italy on the moves it has taken on obsolescence.</p></speech>

It is vital that we as a country move to a fairer, more sustainable and equitable economic waste system.  The importance of this is now being felt acutely by ordinary working people across the country who are struggling as a result of the rising cost of living and high levels of inflation.  It is hard to understate the importance of reducing waste, and the corresponding levels of pollution that arise because of how it affects our landscape, air quality and waters.</p> <p>As we know, in a circular economy, waste and resource used are minimised by the use of products and materials that are maintained for as long as possible so that when a product reaches the end of its life, its parts are used again and again to create further useful and productive products instead of being discarded.  The amount of waste that is produced all over the world is too much to comprehend, and we in Ireland must play our part in reducing waste and tackling climate change.</p> <p>The efforts of this Bill support the transition to a circular economy, including encouraging greater levels of recycling.  I, therefore, welcome the Bill.  I am pleased the Government has taken on the issues my colleague, Senator Wall, has worked hard on, specifically in relation to addressing the difficulty local authorities have with illegal dumping.  We welcome that the Government is providing in this Bill for the use of CCTV to deter littering and dumping.  Senator Wall has estimated that across 31 local authorities in the country, the cost of clearing up litter and illegally dumped materials may be as much as &euro;90 million per year, which is enormous.  This is without considering the voluntary effort put in by community clean-up groups, which operate nationwide, and particular litter black spots we have in Dublin city, including in my area in the inner city in Dublin 8.</p> <p>Following on from what Senator Boylan said, one of the big issues to tackle is embodied carbon and the use of waste that is involved in building materials in house building.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What we see at the moment are large numbers of buildings being demolished to build new buildings for housing that can be reused and brought back into life, or at the very least, the materials that are involved initially in rebuilding, such as the steel and brickwork, are able to be reused.  That is an essential part of a circular economy.</p><p>Another issue we believe is worth raising and relegislating for is the right to repair.  We need to shift the balance of power from manufacturers and corporations back to citizens and ordinary people to be able to repair consumer goods.  It would make a huge difference in reducing waste while also addressing a power imbalance between consumers and manufacturers, and putting money more in people's pockets.  When I was a young girl, every single village had a cobbler where one was able to go and get one's shoes fixed and redone.  Indeed, I used to have one cobbler at one stage to whom I brought my shoes, for which I paid approximately &euro;15, so many times that he said I had to let go of them.  It is very difficult to be able to find somewhere that does that now.</p><p>I repair a lot of clothes, leather and bags.  I had to buy stuff online and teach myself how to do it and be able to sew.  Not everybody has that time and luxury, and it requires an awful lot of intensive effort.  Supporting the right to repair regarding our everyday consumer goods is very important.  Being able to break down consumer goods into a list of component parts, seeing what they are made of and actually improve them is also very important.  We should be doing things like teaching upcycling in schools, be it clothes or furniture.</p><p>Interiors are one of the next exploding areas of fast fashion.  We see fast fashion come into clothing and bad standards of living where people are buying stuff to go out on Saturday night and not using it again.  We are seeing it now when it comes into interiors and home goods.  We need to be able to teach people how to repair to facilitate a circular economy and allow that to happen.  My colleague, Deputy Bacik, drafted a Bill to legislate for this, which will include measures to stop waste and tackle the cost of living by requiring manufacturers, particularly of digital and electronic equipment, to make repair information available to consumers and break the monopoly on repair by the manufacturer.</p><p>Finally, we need to help people reduce the amount of clothing waste by encouraging them to mend and reduce the prevalence of fast fashion.  Indeed, there is also the treatment of garment workers and other workers employed and exploited in a fast fashion single-use economy we have built up around us.  The Labour Party welcomes the efforts in this Bill in making a move towards a circular economy.  We ask the Government to ensure that climate is at the heart of Government policy in the coming years across Departments and be able to support the right to repair to facilitate the circular economy in the years to come.</p></speech>

I also thank him for referencing the Bill I brought forward on behalf of the Labour Party.  Indeed, my colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne, brought forward a similar Bill on behalf on Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is very important that those two Bills were brought forward because the problem has not gone away, unfortunately.  We are still getting calls.  This morning, I got two telephone calls from people who were reporting illegal dumping in south Kildare and that problem continues day in, day out.</p><p>It is also opportune to thank, as other colleagues have done, the Tidy Towns groups.  We need to go out and use every opportunity to thank them for the enormous work they do.  We need to support them in every way.  The fund the Minister of State will create through this Bill should be targeted towards those volunteers who go out of their way each week - each day, in some cases - to make sure their local areas are clean and cleaned up.</p><p>My colleague, Senator Moynihan, raised the issue, which was also raised by Senator Malcolm Byrne, regarding the &euro;90 million.  As I said before, the Minister of State can just imagine what we can do with that type of money if it was actually saved and put back into local authorities.  We, as public representatives, are always asked about playgrounds etc. and the sort of money we could save in relation to that &euro;90 million should be put back into those sorts of facilities.  Unfortunately, I recently learned of a clean-up that cost Kildare County Council in the region of &euro;48,000 within the last two months.  That is totally and utterly unacceptable for it to add<b></b>and grow into that figure.</p><p>I also want to mention the local projects that are mentioned in the Bill.  We need to support those local projects.  I want to mention the green kilometre scheme.  I am not sure whether the Minister of State is familiar with that but it is a magnificent local project in County Kildare where locals are encouraged to look after the 1 km outside their home.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It has seen great take-up.  The environmental officer in Kildare County Council, Dara Wyer, has long supported this project.  It has seen great take-up in south Kildare and in north Kildare.  As other colleagues have mentioned, a lot of people go out, day in and day out, to ensure that the 1 km is clean.  That helps in the overall assistance to Tidy Towns and community groups.  Something like that will inform the education other colleagues have spoken about as well, because that is the piece we need to get right.  It is education through schools but also through community groups.  We need to support community groups.  My local community group has a yearly clean-up.  This year we collected almost 1,000 bags and it is a similar amount every year.  That is the sort of basis on which we need to educate and support communities.  We welcome the Bill.  I look forward to speaking more to the Minister of State about it as we work through the Bill.</p></speech>

I will be coming back on Committee Stage.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, to the House.  The legislation is part of a wider set of proposals in Ireland and at EU level to address the climate and biodiversity crisis.  This Bill is focused on the economy and how it fits within the planetary boundaries and our fair share of them in terms not just of emissions but of resources, and effective and appropriate resource management.</p> <p>As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Climate Action, we engaged very extensively in a period of pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  I am pleased to see that some of the recommendations are reflected in the legislation before us.  However, unfortunately, a number are not.  This is a moment to try to be a bit more ambitious and to get it right.  This comes in a context where a significant amount of legislation relating to the circular economy is coming through at EU level and where we have due diligence legislation that is looking at supply chains internationally.  This is the context, and a fundamental point is that a piece of legislation on the circular economy should not solely focus on consumption but should also focus much more strongly on production and a radical transformation of the production end of things.  I feel that is a part of the legislation that could be strengthened still.</p> <p>I will briefly highlight a couple of the areas that I will come back to on Committee Stage.  One aspect not reflected adequately in the Bill is recommendation 62, which focused on extraction and the global dimension.  I mentioned the fact that environmental and human rights considerations should be part of the global economy action plan, as this is in tune with the thinking on due diligence that is happening at EU level.  The sustainable development goals, SDG, have a number of very specific provisions in terms of responsible consumption and production.  This was a chance to integrate some of the SDG targets more strongly.  I mentioned the human rights pieces, which I will leave aside for now, but I note my intention to strengthen in particular some of the areas around extraction of precious minerals and re-use and recapture of minerals.  One thing we know is that, for example, more gold can be mined from mining tech waste in some cases than from direct mining.  The fund is welcome, but it is not enough.</p> <p>Something the committee recommended is that public procurement policy is one of the key tools and that specific measures on green public procurement should be part of a circular economy strategy.  The Minister of State will be aware of my passion on this issue.  I notice that there are levies and other measures, which are harder, that apply on the consumption end but the circular economy strategy, which has possibly a more important role to play, relies on voluntary measures in engagement with the sectors.  I am concerned that on the production side we are going for voluntary measures and codes of practice.  We are past that in terms of the crisis we are in, whereas we are going with quite hard tools on the consumption end.  I feel the powers of levies should be extended.</p> <p>Recommendations 58 and 59 have not been addressed either.  They are measures relating to the right to repair.  This legislation should contain measures in line with the right to repair and to protect against built-in obsolescence.  Simply capturing that on the shop floor does not do.  We need to capture that.</p> <p>Something we also looked at, for example, was levies on virgin plastic in production versus direct levies.  Because other speakers have points, I will finish even though I have a lot of points to make.  I hope I will have the chance to engage with them on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#RR00100"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, who has responsibility for communications and the circular economy.  This is all about tackling challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste and pollution.  As the Minister of State is fully aware, it is based on three principles: eliminating waste and pollution; circulating products and materials; and regenerating nature as well.  Design is so important here.  We all talk about products and the end user and how when we design a product the end user has to be part of that to make sure the product is used.  For example, women were never considered when safety belts were being designed.  Perhaps what we need here is to build such an approach to product design by all designers into the principles underlying the strategy and fund for the circular economy.</p> <p>I pay tribute to some of the local groups in the areas in Roscommon and east Galway that I represent.  For example, the Roscommon Women's Network has its CycleUp store and it also facilitates training for women on how to reuse materials.  They have made owls out of pre-loved materials.  These are fantastic creations.  They are well known and have been given to Ministers and Ministers of State as well.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, will also receive one from the Roscommon Women's Network.</p> <p>Like Senator Moynihan, I pay tribute to the many places that do shoe repairs.  It is very simple.  We have amazing shoe repair shops in many towns, such as Willie Burke's in the Ballinasloe area.</p> <p>Local authorities need funding for general operatives on the ground.  That is crucial.  There must be engagement between the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communications and Public Expenditure and Reform and local authorities to make sure there is funding for general operatives to tackle littering in bogland areas and towns.  Galway County Council is down on the number of general operatives in my municipal district.  We need such operatives because they can tackle litter, build awareness, facilitate incentives relating to signage and draw up the policies and strategies we all want to implement.  We do not have people on the ground to do that, however.</p> <p>I will address some of the key elements of the Bill.  I am very supportive of the single-use levy.  We saw what happened with plastic bags under the previous Government.  It is vital to have CCTV tackling litter.  This is a significant issue.  The most recent report of Irish Business Against Litter came out in recent days.  It states that the two main issues in Ballinasloe are disposable cups and the fact that we cannot get CCTV to tackle some of the problem areas.</p></speech>

I will not do justice to their contributions in the seven minutes allocated to me.  I will have more time on Committee Stage to discuss issues, and I can also discuss them in the meantime with Senators.  I welcome the general tone of the contributions from everybody.  They were very constructive.  People were genuinely trying to think of ways to make the Bill better.  Although the Bill is progressive, it also harks back to a time when society was less wasteful.</p> <p>The point was made that the circular economy is a jargon term, and it is difficult to communicate it.  What we are really trying to get away from is a throwaway culture.  As Senator Boylan said, the idea that, in the context of modern, hyper-consumer capitalism, we just use things rather than reuse or look after anything goes against the culture and principles of our parents and grandparents.</p> <p>Regarding the new environmental levies, I want to emphasise once more that the introduction of these levies is to change behaviour and not to raise money.  I will have succeeded if the behaviour changes and I do not raise any money at the end.  My expectation is that money raised from the new levies will fall off steeply over the years as consumers switch to more sustainable alternative products and avoid paying the money.  It saves money for the consumer because they no longer have to pay for the cup.  As Senator Pauline O'Reilly stated, the cup costs 18 cent.  That is built into the price of the product we buy.  If we do not have to pay that, it is an advantage to the individual and to the business as well.  We do not pay the levy because we have chosen not to.  A lot of Irish people are quite rebellious against regulations, and they might say they are not going to pay the levy.  That is what happened with the plastic bag levy.  They did not pay it because they bought their own bags.  That is a good way to rebel.  Any levy introduced will only come in after public consultation.  We are not doing a consultation on disposable cups for hot drinks at this point.  We are providing legislation that allows for any type of packaging - for food, drink or anything else - to have a levy on it only where there is a reusable alternative.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In that case then we will have a real consultation and not only one to go through the motions.  We want to find out what are the cases where it is not possible to switch.  We do not want to impose a levy in those cases.  If we reflect on the plastic bag levy, which was very successful, the reason it worked was that we were practical in its implementation.  We said, for example, that butchers or fishmongers did not a plastic bag levy because they could not reuse the bag fish and meat had been in and so on.  Therefore, we will take a practical approach to this one, as we did in the past, and we expect it to be successful in the way the previous levy was massively successful.  </p><p>There are difficulties both recycling and composting compostable cups.  Most of them end up as litter, get incinerated or are put into landfill.  That is why we will not exempt compostable cuts from the levy.  Members will have noticed during the week that Irish Business Against Litter found that while there has been a sharp fall in the number of litter blackspots across the country the prevalence of coffee cups on our streets warrants actions to disincentivise the use of paper cups, even compostable or recyclable cups.  I have spoken to many cafes.  Senator Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly spoke about the experience in Galway where nine cafes have just gone completely disposable cup free.  There have a deposit refund scheme, as there is at many festivals. When one goes to a music festival one pays &euro;1 or &euro;2 for a cup and gets it back when one hands it back.  It is the same idea and that can work.  We are not forcing people to adopt this or to pay the levy.  It will always be avoidable.</p><p>Many cafes stopped taking reusable cups during Covid but there was no obligation on them to do this.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland confirmed its Covid guidance is and always was that it is permissible to accept reusable cups.  Some cafes unilaterally decided they would exercise an abundance of caution and would not accept them but there is no public health reason not to accept cups.  We should remember in any caf&eacute; people are handling dirty cups and plates on the table and also money.  Therefore, they are used to handling items that are not absolutely perfectly clean. Nothing in this Bill obliges a vendor to accept a reusable cup, irrespective of whether it is dirty.  If one wants to be a vendor who just charges money on cups, one can do that and that will be an option.</p><p>The awareness campaign that will precede the levy will stress the need for customers to make sure their cup is clean when they hand it over to the vendor.  That should be a matter of culture and politeness.  Revenue from the levies will be used in part to support the use of reusables in ways that minimise costs to consumers and businesses.  It should be noted the use of reusable cups should result in savings for businesses as they will not have to supply so many disposable cups.  As Senator Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly said, one caf&eacute; in Galway told her they had bought 80,000 at 18 c each just the other month, which is a significant amount of money.</p><p>I thank members of the Oireachtas joint committee for their constructive engagement with the Bill through the pre-legislative scrutiny process and for their comprehensive report.  The Bill, as amended in committee in the D&aacute;il, reflects the fundamental recommendations of the joint committee, in particular regarding the definition of a circular economy and the mandatory setting of sectoral targets in the circular economy strategy.  Other recommendations of the joint committee will remain under active consideration by my Department for potential inclusion in future legislation.  As with the environmental levies, I anticipate the yield from the waste recovery levy will decrease over time as wasteholders make greater use of recycling or reuse.  The recovery levy will not initially be applied to construction and demolition waste in order to avoid any short-term increases in the cost of construction as we tackle the housing crisis and it will not apply to any recycling activity.  Mandatory incentivised pricing for commercial waste will operate on the same basis as currently applies to household waste and I am convinced it will ultimately safe businesses money.</p><p>Regarding the use of CCTV and other recording technologies, which can include drones, bodycams and so on but only to catch people for illegal dumping, it does not warrant having a drone to follow somebody for littering.  A CCTV camera under very limited circumstances will be set up but there will have to be a code of conduct.  It will continue to be the role of elected councillors to set waste policy but the code of conduct will be set by the chief executive.  It will be an executive function.  For those concerned that data protection safeguards might hamper the deployment of these technologies, I assure Senators my Department has engaged with the local government sector in detail regarding these provisions and I think they are fit for purpose.  For those who still have concerns about data privacy, I draw attention to proposal to use mandatory codes of practice, the fact that CCTV and other footage can only be accessed by authorised local authority personnel and the data collected can only be used to convict for litter and dumping offences and not for broader offences.  I do not want to see these technologies misused and I am satisfied the Bill provides a robust legal basis for their appropriate needs.</p><p>Significantly improving the repairability and ease of maintenance of consumer goods is an essential component of the circular economy.  Meaningful changes in this regard can be effectively implemented by way of comprehensive EU legislation rather than through piecemeal national measures.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Earlier this year, the European Commission announced such comprehensive measures for the right to repair in the form of a proposal for a regulation on ecodesign for sustainable products and a proposal for a directive to empower consumers for the green transition through better protection against unfair practices and better information.</p><p>I agree with Senator Dolan that it is key that these changes happen at the design stage.  This will be the second ecodesign directive.  The first focused on energy efficiency.  Now we are going to be looking at durability of products and repairability, which will be addressed by means of a consumer information labelling system.  When a person buys a product, he or she will see that it lasts for so many years and that will influence his or her decision on whether to take a long-lived or short-lived product.  This is to move people towards products that are either more repairable or more durable.  The directive will also provide for the mandatory provision of spare parts and provision of manuals.  Members can see that is moving towards allowing things to be repaired.</p><p>I look forward to further progressing the Bill on Committee Stage.  Once again, I thank all Senators for their contributions.  I have made extensive notes on their comments.  I will either come back to them directly or address them on Committee Stage.  I thank everybody very much.</p></speech>

When your President addressed the joint sitting of our Houses of Parliament a number of months ago, in my response to his passionate speech, I asked Deputies and Senators to join me in welcoming five-year-old Anastasia and her mother, Yana, whose husband, and Anastasia&rsquo;s dad, like thousands of others, is in a defence unit in Ukraine, fighting to keep it free and independent for Anastasiia&rsquo;s future.  They have travelled 4,000 km from Kyiv to be in Dublin, having had to leave their home under Russian artillery fire.  I ask Members to join me in welcoming five-year-old Anastasiia and Yana to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.</p></speech>

When the Ceann Comhairle and I were invited to Kyiv by the Speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament, we met with President Zelenskyy, who signed a note for Anastasiia which said "Be strong, be brave".  She has certainly been that.  We cannot imagine what she and her fellow Ukrainian refugees have gone through, having to leave their country and seek asylum and safety in other European countries.  We cannot imagine what it must feel like to have one's future become so uncertain so quickly.  Anastasiia, Yana, the ambassador and our friends who have been recently externally displaced from Ukraine have joined us for the Ukrainian Members' address to our Parliament, the first address in person by Members of the Ukrainian Parliament to a chamber of another national parliament anywhere in the world since the war began.  I thank them for this great honour.  We welcome them as guests of our Parliament in the same way as thousands of Irish people have welcomed people from Ukraine to our country.</p> <p>On the spring morning when the President addressed that historic sitting of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, we were aware that, thousands of miles away, bombs and missiles were descending on his fellow countrymen, citizens, family, friends and neighbours, innocent Ukrainian men, women and children.  War crimes have been committed by the Russian forces in Bucha and elsewhere and this has been shown to the world.  We are facing a regime led by a war criminal and he must face justice like any other war criminal.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann recognised the invasion of Ukraine as an act of genocide.  President Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine have shown by their words and actions their bravery in the face of this Russian invasion.</p> <p>Our T&aacute;naiste, deputy Prime Minister, responded to the address by the Ukrainian President to our Parliament when he said: "In the long history of our own country we have never invaded another, but we know what it is like to have been invaded and to have the very existence of our national identity questioned."  President John F. Kennedy spoke on the same theme when he addressed our Parliament over 50 years ago.  He spoke of Ireland's condemnation of Russian aggression and oppression of its neighbours, saying: "For knowing the meaning of foreign domination, Ireland is the example and inspiration to [others] enduring endless years of oppression."  President Zelenskyy in his historic address to that joint sitting of our D&aacute;il and Seanad referred to Ireland's military neutrality: "Ireland is a neutral country but it has not remained neutral to the disasters and to the mishaps that Russia has brought to Ukraine."  In that previous address by President Kennedy to our Parliament, he acknowledged Irish neutrality but also acknowledged, like President Zelenskyy, that Ireland "is not neutral between liberty and tyranny and never will be."  That is as true today as it was over half a century ago.</p> <p>As an international community, we must never be neutral in the face of tyranny.  We also work better when we work together.  That is why Ireland has supported Ukraine's membership of the European Union.  Our Prime Minister or Taoiseach spoke of Ireland's support for Ukraine and its membership of the EU.  When President Zelenskyy addressed the Parliament, the Taoiseach said: "I welcome and support Ukraine's application for EU membership."  I reiterate support for that application.  It is the democratic right of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine to determine its political future.  </p> <p>We can and must do more.  We in Ireland, Europe and the wider world must be relentless in our support for Ukraine, not just today and tomorrow but until the war is won.  </p></speech>

I thank the Chair for this opportunity, which our delegation appreciates wholeheartedly as unique but also much needed in this difficult time for Ukraine.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> This address would not have been possible without the dedication and work of two people in this room, Senators Ahearn and Ward.  I thank them for having the courage to come to Ukraine a while back, witnessing with their own eyes what Russia has done to our country and the scars it has left on our people.  I thank them for not being quiet on the topic of Ukraine ever since and for the support they have provided.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> Today the cities they visited - Irpin, Brjanka, Bucha - are slowly healing.  They are coming back to normal, with summer greenery masking the bombarded buildings and people slowly coming back.  In Kyiv, life sometimes seems more than normal, until it is not and the air sirens remind you several times a night that you are still living the nightmare of all-out war, which started on that morning, 5 a.m. on 24 February this year, when Russia escalated its eight-year aggression against Ukraine to unprecedented levels, to an all-out war in the middle of Europe in the middle of the 21st Century.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> Today, 20% of Ukraine is occupied.  That is three times more than just under four months ago and equates to 125,000 sq. km.  That is almost twice the size of Ireland.  Those thousands of kilometres are not just empty fields and cliffs or whatever one might imagine as empty spaces.  Rather, 125,000 sq. km. is 2,500 municipalities, including villages, towns and cities where millions of Ukrainians are forced to live under the Russian flag and  thousands are forced to die for the Ukrainian flag and for the right to be Ukrainian. </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> Can you imagine going through the content of your phones, deleting pictures and messages that might signify you are Irish every time you want to visit a corner store in your own country?  Ukrainians in occupied Kherson do that every time before leaving the house, lest Russian soldiers find anything incriminatingly Ukrainian during checks at checkpoints.  Can you imagine queuing up for water rations in 30&deg; heat and fainting or watching excavators clear up the rubble of what was your home, only to see limbs of those who were once your neighbours but are no more?  Imagine not being able to bury your family or loved ones, or not even knowing where they are.  This is what Ukrainians in occupied Mariupol live every day.  Imagine being a mother saying goodbye to your baby who has not lived even five months.  Imagine being a father having to live the rest of your life with the image of the body of your son, killed, but you survived and have to live the rest of your life.  This is the reality of hundreds of Ukrainian parents from east to west.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> That is a reality that I could not imagine so I chose the other difficult reality Ukrainian parents face.  On 1 March I made the decision to send my children away.  I am a mother of three.  The youngest turned one on 1 June.  Three months of her first year was spent without her mother.  My other daughter is seven and got used to seeing me twice a month on weekends when I get the time to visit.  Every time before I go back to Ukraine my son comes to me with the same question: why can he not go back with me?  My answer is always the same: I gave you life to live.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> A total of 288 Ukrainian children have been killed by Russian soldiers, while 527 lie wounded in hospitals, sometimes disabled for life.  Today Putin is stealing the childhood of Ukrainian children.  Russia is taking away their right to education.  Instead of learning maths and science, our children are learning the difference between hiding places in case of an artillery attack or an air raid.</font><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Ms Lesia Vasylenko:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Instead of pick<font color="#2F2F2F">ing out prom dresses, partying because it is the last hours of school and celebrating graduation, our high-school children are taking photos on the ruins of their schools.  As many as 184 schools have been razed to the ground by Russian forces and almost 2,000 school buildings have been damaged.  Russia is stealing Ukraine's future and that is not a figure of speech.  As many as 250,000 Ukrainian children have been forcefully removed from Ukraine, and from the care of their families from their homes and into Russia.  That is 234,000 deported Ukrainian children to be converted into Russians.  These are not just stories.  All of this is evidence of an international crime - the crime of genocide - that Russia is committing right now in Ukraine against Ukrainians.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> The Irish nation today is doing more than its fair share in the international efforts to prevent and stop the crime of crimes - the crime of genocide.  The people of Ireland have opened their doors from the first days of war, the visas were cancelled as easy as that and people opened up their homes.  To date, 35,000 Ukrainians, comprised mostly of women and children, have found refuge here in Ireland.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> At the beginning of this month in this very room this House voted to recognise Russia's actions against Ukraine as genocide.  We wholeheartedly thank you for this.  Today, we humbly ask this House to go a step further and recognise another of Russia's acts against Ukraine as genocide.  From 1932 to 1933, Russia created a man-made famine that led to the death of between 4 million and 7 million Ukrainians but Russia was not punished as it is not being punished now.  As a result the Russians were inspired to do more evil.  Ninety years on it is about time to restore the historic justice and send a message that the free world has no room for appeasing criminals and tyrants.  The Holodomor must be called what it is - a genocide of the Ukrainian nation.  Ireland can lead by example on this issue by passing, and recognising, the act and urging that other nations follow suit by recognising the Holodomor, which is the Ukrainian famine of 1932, as genocide.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> We must all have no doubt that the only reason Russia is doing what it is doing now is just because it can.  It is because Russia was allowed to do this.  For centuries Russia has been allowed to get away with aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide but not once has Russia been punished or stopped.  As a consequence of appeasement, Russia developed into the empire of evil that it is today thinking itself more sovereign than other nations, and thinking that it is okay to attack other countries and invade.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> As an international community, we all have the responsibility, and moral duty, to firmly stop all of the crimes that Russia is committing.  How do we do this?  By securing a victory for Ukraine, which is a process that requires several steps.  In the next few weeks, Ukraine's bid for candidate status in the EU will be considered.  We are grateful for Ireland's unwavering support in this matter but we must ask for help to minimise any doubts in the EU member states that still have them.  In the next few months we will also need victory on the battlefield.  When I say we I do not mean just Ukraine.  I mean all of us, Ireland, the EU and the global community.  Protracted conflict leads only to more death and more wars.  Russia is good at protracted conflicts.  This is the game it played in 2014.  Russia was allowed to get away with it and so it is trying this again in 2022.  Russia's utmost aim is to decompose Ukraine and with that to decompose the very concept of sovereignty in the world.  While strengthening Ukraine we ask also for efforts to be exerted and mobilised to weaken Russia.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> We are grateful for the leadership that the Irish Government and both Houses have shown in pushing for sanctions against Russia, and are grateful for the non-lethal aid provided for the defence efforts in Ukraine.  Like no one else, Ireland understands the need for Ukraine to be victorious and for this war to end as quickly as possible for the sake of freedom, and democracy.  In the years to come Ukraine will need more help to restore and rebuild.</font><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Ms Lesia Vasylenko:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ireland is leading discussions on this front too.  It should not be Ireland, the EU or any other country paying because it was not Ireland, the EU or any other country in the world that has caused damage and losses in the Ukraine.  It is Russia, and Russia must pay.  Every euro invested in the rebuilding of Ukraine must be returned by Russia.  For that to happen, Putin and his war criminals must be brought to justice.</p></speech>

Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn a bheith anseo inniu.  Now the hard part of my speech is truly over.  It is an honour for us to be here today, and we recognise that this is an honour that is rarely given to a visitor or foreigner.  Please believe me when I say that we greatly appreciate this honour.  Our visit is yet another reaffirmation of the support that we have received from Irish people, Senators and everybody whom we have met in Ireland during the last horrible 111 days of war.  Today, it is the 111th day, but believe me when I say that for Ukrainians all over the world, the war has felt like one horrible never-ending nightmarish day.  Each morning when we read the news, no matter where we are, we feel like that nightmare continues.  Last night, three more civilians were killed by Russian forces.  One of the fatalities was a boy aged six who was killed while he slept in his bed by a Russian missile that hit Donbas.  Last night, while I was in Dublin, the region of Dnipro, which in the eastern part of my country, was shelled by Russians using an artillery system called Hurricane.  This is the region where my grandmother lives.  She refused to evacuate and, fortunately, she is well and her house is okay.  This is a horrible reality that I could never imagine would ever exist.</p> <p>At 4 a.m. on 21 February, or 111 days ago, the war and Russian aggression started.  I was in my apartment in the centre of Kyiv.  What gave me the most fear was not that there were explosions going off over my head.  This feeling was horribly familiar with what I heard my grandmother say when she talked to me when I was child about the beginning of the Second World War.  My grandmother was five years old when the Second World War broke out.  I can honestly say that I never really listened to her stories back then because I thought her stories about the atrocities that were committed during the Second World War had no place in my world, in my future or in a modern sanctuary in the middle of Europe.  I did not really listen.  I could not imagine that in our modern age of Geneva Conventions, international humanitarian law, the Budapest Memorandum, drones, cyberwarfare and satellites that we would actually have a dictator giving orders to kill and specifically target civilians in Europe, target children and bomb hospitals, kindergartens and normal residential areas.  Psychologically, I was not ready for this.</p> <p>Even though we knew that a war could happen, we were not ready to see that.  I am still not psychologically ready to understand that 30 km from my apartment in which I live in the centre of Kyiv, in Bucha and Borodyanka - because it is only 30 minutes' drive away - we have found mass graves containing children and women who were raped and tortured by Russian soldiers, then burned and finally buried.  This is a reality I still have trouble understanding in our modern world.  I think that the politics of appeasement failed when the first missile hit the wing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol.  We cannot understand that happening.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Ms Alyona Shkrum:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Now Putin is going even further because he is planning to starve to death people on a number of continents in the world in order to re-establish his so-called Russian empire.  We are not going to allow that to happen.  This is something that takes the politics of imperialism and colonialism to a whole new level that we have never seen before because Putin and his soldiers are right now mining the Black Sea and blocking Ukraine's ability to take our exports of grain and food to countries all over the world, including countries in Africa, the Middle East and the EU.  The UN has told us the politics of starvation and the possible food crisis and famine could affect more than 1 billion people in the world.  When food is used as a weapon, I have almost no words to describe it.  Unfortunately, Irish people know very well food can be used as a weapon.  Unfortunately, Ukrainian people know too well food can be used as a weapon because this autumn we will commemorate 90 years since the man-made hunger that killed almost 1 million Ukrainians back in the 1930s.  We should ensure together that this is absolutely the last time any dictator in the world and any country in the world uses food as a weapon.  We cannot allow that to happen.<br/><br/>Putin made a mistake.  He completely misjudged Ukrainians because while you can take a lot from us, you cannot take from us the right to govern ourselves.  We are a stubborn nation, just as much as the Irish nation is.<br/><br/>The Cathaoirleach quoted the famous speech President Kennedy made in Ireland a long time ago.  I will quote the poet he quoted, John Boyle O'Reilly, who said: &quot;The world is large ... But the world is small when your enemy is loose on the other side&quot;.  The Ukrainian world had become very small over the last 111 days.  The world has shrunk for every mother who had to spend a night in a basement with her child when there were bombings in Bucha, Borodianka and Mariupol.  The world appears to have shrunk for every woman who kissed goodbye to a soldier going to war at every railway station in Ukraine.  It appears the world has shrunk for every family who fled Ukraine with just one bag of clothes to go abroad, perhaps to Ireland, not knowing when they will be able to come back.<br/><br/>It feels like the world has become very small to Ukraine but it also feels like the world has opened up a little bit.  It has opened up, together with Ireland's help, with love, kindness, and solidarity which, honestly, we have never seen during the history of Ukraine.  It is incredibly inspirational to see that.  We are inspired by the way people in Ireland opened up their hearts and their doors to every refugee, to everybody who needed help.  Ireland abolished visas for Ukrainians in the first week of the war and, believe us, Ukrainians know that.<br/><br/>We are very much inspired by Ireland's history, its strength and how it remained so humane during all those dark times because this is difficult for us to do at times.  We are very inspired by this ability and the combination in the Irish character of hope, bravery and optimism.  It gives us a lot of strength.  Ireland's friendship and generosity will never be forgotten in Ukraine, believe us.<br/><br/>Ireland has literally set an example of a very high standard of moral leadership for every other country in the world, in particular for every other country in Europe, to follow.  We ask Ireland to push even further.  We hope Europe and the EU follows Ireland's high standard of moral leadership and example and we hope the EU gives us candidate status in the next number of days because it is our opinion that the future of a strong EU really depends on this vital decision.  Ukraine will win this war.<br/><br/>Together with you I am sure we will win this fight for freedom against slavery, light against darkness and for our common democratic future.  In Ukraine we say<i>Slava Ukraini </i>but today I really want to say &Eacute;ire ab&uacute;.</p></speech>

For seven centuries the war against Russian imperialism and Ukraine's European choice has raged.  Ukrainians created their state, Rus, far back in the ninth century.  The powerful Christian state impressed everyone with its rich culture and strength.  The majestic St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, built by Yaroslav the Wise in 1011-1018, has been the symbol of the Orthodox Church for centuries.  Far back in the 15th century, Yurii Kotermak, who was born in Drohobych in western Ukraine and was a professor and later the rector of the oldest university in Europe at Bologna, used to teach astronomy to Nikolai Kopernik, who was a prominent astronomer.  The military might of Cossacks was well-known across Europe.  It was they who protected Europe from the horde and Muscovian troops for centuries.  The first European constitution was created by Pylyp Orlyk, the Ukrainian hetman, in 1710.  There is so much to be proud of.  We have contributed so much to the free world and the future of Europe.<br/><br/>For nine centuries the love of freedom, laboriousness and wisdom of the Ukrainian people have disturbed the Muscovian horde.  They are incapable of creating their own free future; they are only capable of oppressing others and ruining everything that is connected with Ukraine.  Today, Putin compares himself with Peter the First, the Russian tsar who issued the Valuev Circular, which was the order that forbade the Ukrainian language, as it is the language which secures for us Ukrainians our national identity.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the 20th century Bolsheviks destroyed the young Ukrainian state that emerged from the ruins of the Russian empire.  In January 1918, 300 Ukrainian students stood against the Bolshevik army of 4,000 soldiers.  All were killed, with 27 kept in captivity and shot shortly after.  In March 1919 the Ukrainian Socialist Republic was imposed by the Bolsheviks.  Is that what Putin wants to repeat in 2022?  Bolsheviks occupied our country in 1919 but failed to break the resistance and faith of the Ukrainian people.  That is exactly why the horrible <i>Holodomor </i>- the genocide of the Ukrainian nation &ndash; was criminally organised.  Millions of Ukrainians died of artificially created hunger.  It is a terrible page in the history of Ukraine.  This is exactly the experience that the successors of those Bolsheviks is attempting to use again today.  They are ready to take away every grain from the Ukrainians and are threatening to doom the whole world to hunger.<br/><br/>Since day one of the invasion, 24 February, Ireland has been on our side, which is the side of freedom and justice.  Ireland never hesitated about whether to support us.  As a representative of Ukraine and the Parliament of Ukraine, I am sure every Ukrainian hugely appreciates Ireland's aid, its support and its standing with Ukraine in the times of grief and suffering when the Russian murderers came to our homes.  We are grateful for the support that people in Ireland provided to those Ukrainians who were looking for shelter and found safety in this country.<br/><br/>However, the war is still raging.  For 111 days Russia has been attacking our land.  The Russists have not given up on their invasion plans and they are still terrorising our cities with their missiles and the whole world with the food crisis by blocking the sea ports in order to cause hunger, just as they did in the previous century.  Hundreds of Ukrainian heroes are dying daily protecting their native country and dozens of civilians are killed daily by the Russian artillery.  Thousands of Ukrainian families are destroyed and children are deprived of their parents.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Rostyslav Tistyk:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Today, the whole world saw the picture of a toddler, a little Ukrainian girl on her first birthday, at the grave of her heroic father who fell protecting Ukraine.  This is what grief looks like.  This is the pain of the whole Ukrainian people today, which is the wound that will never heal.</p><p>Still, we stand for the future, our future and the future that will inevitably come in Ukraine.  We all have to do the utmost for the sake of it, demonstrate more leadership in the coming anti-war coalition and show the whole world that Ireland and Ukraine are capable of creating much more than the biggest state on the globe intends to ruin.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  Glory to Ireland and glory to Ukraine.</p></speech>

In fact, this is my second time in Ireland.  Your outstanding hospitality makes me feel more and more the time wasted that is not spent in Ireland, as Lady Gregory said.  To waste time is the last thing I would like us to do, when we talk about the war Russia is waging today against the civilised world, against rules-based societies, against democracies, against freedom, against diversity and everything else that is so dear to us, to the people of Ireland and to the people of Ukraine.</p> <p>We have even more things in common.  We are a very proud nation, just like Ireland, and a rather stubborn one.  Members might have noticed this in the past couple of months of war between a country of 140 million against a country of 40 million.  In fact, a friend of mine who died defending Mariupol was ready to eat dog food and drink dirty water from puddles for months but was not ready to give up his freedom even for a second.  He never did.  He never betrayed the aspiration of true freedom, which is a shared European value.  However, if Ukrainians are good enough to die as Europeans, we would like to live as Europeans as well.  For this very reason, we would like to take this stubbornness of ours from the battlefields into economics.  We intend to be as stubborn as possible in rebuilding our country in such a manner that the wildest dreams and aspirations of those who have sacrificed their lives will be realised. </p> <p>What the deceased want is not revenge - our revenge will be the laughter of our children, as Bobby Sands put it - but a country of happy people living with dignity among equals, a country that is a true member of the European family, a country that is an embodiment of the triumph of western values and principles, and a demonstration that Euro-Atlantic unity and solidarity is as strong as ever.  For this reason, we do not consider talks about reconstruction of Ukraine before the war ends a waste of time.  We need to start immediately.</p> <p>It is a separate pleasure to say this in Ireland, a country whose company Kingspan, from County Cavan, will probably be the first western enterprise to invest &euro;200 million in Ukraine even before the war is over.  It will invest and not donate.  This is critical as we do not want to be a nation of beggars.  We want to be a nation of partners.  For this very reason, I am here to tell Members that we see the reconstruction of Ukraine as a joint venture and not as a charity project.  We want to be fair and kind to everyone who has been fair and kind to us.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Dmytro Natalukha:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will finish by re-phrasing Hannah Sheehy-Skeffington, an outstanding Irish woman and true patriot of her country, with the following: </p><blockquote>	I recognise no [concessions].  I recognise it as no crime to be in my own country.  I would be ashamed of my own name and my murdered [friends'] name[s] if I did. </blockquote><p>Long live Ukraine and long live Ireland.</p></speech>

I extend a very warm welcome to our friends from Ukraine.  I congratulate them on making the journey because what we have learned from them over the past few days has been so important.  As the Cathaoirleach knows, Senator Ahearn and I left Ireland to visit Ukraine on 4 May.  It is a process getting to Ukraine at present.  I learned a great deal on that trip.  It was not my first time to visit Ukraine but I discovered a very much changed country, a much quieter country, and a much less vivacious country than the one I visited on a number of occasions.</p> <p>As a small country, in the same way Ukraine is a small country relative to Russia, we have an emotional response to what we see happening in Ukraine and an emotional response when we see a larger country picking on a smaller one.  That is natural.  It was not until I got to Ukraine, however, that I saw the strength, depth, preparedness and determination of the Ukrainian people.  It was not until I got there that I was convinced they can win this war.  I believe the Ukrainian Members when they say this.  I believe it will come to pass that Russia will be defeated in its campaign in Ukraine and will be repelled.  I praise the generosity, bravery and steadfastness of the Ukrainian people in that regard.</p> <p>Although most of us have that emotional reaction and most of us see what is happening for what it is, the terrible thing is there are still politicians who insist on peddling Kremlin propaganda, including Irish politicians, who just last week described the first 100 days of the war as 100 days of hysteria.  They bring nothing but shame upon the polity of Ireland and we reject them.  It does not require a great deal of insight to spot the aggressor and the aggressed.  It is never Ukraine's fault that it has been invaded by a larger and more aggressive power.  It is never Ukraine's fault that it is the victim in this war.  It is not Ukraine's fault that its ports in the Black Sea have been blockaded and the food that sits in ships in ports such as Odessa is being taken away from communities in Africa and throughout the world, creating hunger and future famines by using food, as was said, as a weapon of war.  That is not Ukraine's fault.</p> <p>Let there be no mistake about whose fault it is.  It is Russia's fault.  It is Russia's manipulation and abuse of its power to use food as a war tool against countries that have nothing to do with the war.  These are countries in Africa that have no ability to respond and where citizens will go hungry and die from famine as a result of this.  That is no one's fault but Russia's.  It is very important to state this is victim blaming in a way we would reject anywhere in Ireland.  It is victim blaming in respect of Ukraine as well.  The Ukrainians are the victims.  They are the aggressed and not the people who need to account for it.  I support Ukrainians and Ireland supports them.  They have our full support in every respect we can give it.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1629" speakername="Garret Ahearn" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#HHH00400"><p>There is a phrase used quite often in Ukrainian politics that states this is not how they normally do things.  This is not how we normally do things and this is not how this normally comes about.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing it to happen.  I thank Ms Bridget Doody, the Seanad team and Ms Sheila Ryan in protocol.  How this came about was unusual and I acknowledge on the record what they have done to make it happen.</p> <p>Ms Vasylenko spoke about genocide in her contribution.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The definition of genocide is displacing of families.  This is how we see it given what we have heard from eastern Ukraine about parents being murdered, children being taken away and brought to Russia, and their identity taken away.<br/><br/>Ms Lesia Vasylenko has touched on her own situation where on 1 March she had to make a decision to send her own three children to the UK, who are now being cared for by a UK MP.  Lesia's youngest girl was nine months old and celebrated her first birthday on 1 June.  That is a good story and a happy story because they are alive, they are being looked after and Lesia knows that they are well.  No nine-month-old child should be displaced from his or her mother.  That is the reality of the world they are living in.  I look around this Chamber and I see our new friends who are living in Ireland.  They are so welcome to our country, but we can see pain on their faces and we see the struggles they have gone through to get here.  Lesia has her own story.  Ms Alyona Shkrum has a story.  Mr. Rostyslav Tistyk has a story.  Mr. Dmytro Natalukha has a story.  Every Ukrainian citizen who has come into this country has his or her own unique story, just like Lesia.  We make decisions as a Parliament and it is amazing that this is the first time Ukrainian MPs have spoken to a parliament, anywhere in the world, in person.  It is incredible that they are doing so in a Parliament where we as parliamentarians called out what Russia did as genocide.  I acknowledge the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the Government in general for doing that.<br/><br/>The message here, and certainly the message that our friends from Ukraine want to get across, is an acknowledgement of what we have done and the recognition that it needs to continue.  As parliamentarians, we need to reinforce why we are doing this.  The messages of people's personal lives and what they are going through is nothing in comparison to the challenges we have, and we do have challenges.<br/><br/>With regard to Ireland's future and how we are viewed around the world - we are very lucky in how we are viewed around the world; people love us - the decisions we make today will reflect on the future of our children.  We need to continue supporting Ukraine until this war is won.  I ask that as parliamentarians we would continue to support Ukraine and continue to emphasise why it is we are supporting them and why it is we are putting money into it, while acknowledging all of the time the sacrifices people are making to make sure freedom comes to Ukraine.  We should do that until the very end.  <i>Slava Ukraini</i>.</p></speech>

I also welcome all of our distinguished visitors and friends.  I acknowledge in particular that we have with us here today the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland, H.E. Larysa Gerasko, who has been a wonderful friend to those of us in the Seanad.  The ambassador has done enormously positive work in Ireland and she has been an extraordinary ambassador for her country.  We are very appreciative of her work and that of her team.  I have visited Kyiv.  Ukraine is a beautiful country and I can be quite certain that we will take up the invitation to return to Ukraine and to help in the rebuilding of that beautiful country.</p> <p>"Solidarity" is a word that carries enormous importance.  When we consider European history, "solidarity" is a word that really speaks to our European values.  Our history teaches us that we need to look out for each other and that we need to stand up when our brothers and sisters across Europe are being oppressed.  We must stand up for those values that we share and regard as important, such values as democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law.  I assure our guests, that among all the parties here they have our full support, our full solidarity and our full friendship at this time.  I thank our guests for sharing their personal stories with us.  Yes they are politicians, but they are also parents, sons, daughters and friends.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That personal struggle does impact on their work.  We are very grateful to them for sharing that.  We can only imagine the kind of suffering they have experienced, including the story that Senator Ahearn has shared, and the difficulties that many families continue to experience in Ukraine.  We are really appreciative that our guests have shared those stories with us.</p><p>I would hope that on their visit to Ireland, and all of those who are now living in Ireland, Ukrainians have found a very warm welcome.  Across Europe we have realised the importance of extending that welcome and the importance of brotherhood and sisterhood being shared with our European neighbours.  I reiterate the points made by Senator Ward about that small fringe minority that continues to echo Putin's speaking points at a European level.  They do not speak for the politicians of Ireland and they do not speak for the people of Ireland.</p><p>We are very proud to have welcomed so many people from Ukraine.  There were many people from Ukraine living here prior to now and contributing in an enormous way to society, but that number has obviously increased significantly.  We are very proud to have welcomed all of those people.  We know that many will want to return as soon as possible but we hope they will find as happy a time as possible here in Ireland, given the difficult circumstances.  We are really appreciative of the contribution made to our country, to our communities and to our economy by those who have come here from Ukraine.  Into the future, when Putin is beaten, we want to continue to ensure that this friendship will continue.  We urge Ukrainians here to get involved with Irish community groups and organisations during their time here.  We want to build up that friendship in the long term.</p><p>Half a century ago Ireland joined what was then the European Economic Community, which then became the European Union.  We are celebrating 50 years of membership.  Ireland was a very different country 50 years ago.  In many ways EU membership allowed us to step out of the shadow of our nearest big neighbour.  EU membership allowed us to grow in many ways, particularly economically but also socially.  It allowed us to take our place among the nations of the world.  It allowed us to punch above our weight since that time 50 years ago.</p><p>I remember as a teenager and as a student seeing some of the big changes in Europe: we saw the collapse of the Soviet Union, we saw the Berlin Wall coming down, and we saw a victory for people and the rise of democracies across central and eastern Europe.  This is something that Ireland has always been very proud of recognising.  When Ireland held the EU presidency in 1990 we strongly supported German reunification.  We realised the importance of this for the German people and that they wanted freedom and democracy in a new Germany.  We supported this in 1990.</p><p>When Ireland held the EU presidency in 2004, we welcomed ten new countries into the European Union, eight of which were countries from central and eastern Europe that were formerly under communist domination.  Those are proud elements of our history as members of the European Union.  I assure our visitors today that Ireland will continue to do whatever it can to support Ukraine's candidate status and Ukraine becoming a full member of the European Union.  Specific to Ukraine's request, it is incumbent on all of us here within our own European political families and also at diplomatic level, to do everything we can to persuade the other member states of Europe to welcome our brothers and sisters from the Ukraine into full EU membership status.</p></speech>

The ambassador is welcome.  The Hague Convention defines neutrality.  I trust that the Cathaoirleach will forgive me for challenging neutrality at this point in time.  Ireland only ever once defined neutrality, which was in Ireland's White Paper on foreign policy in 1995, Challenges and Opportunities Abroad, in chapter 4 on international security.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Paragraph 4.5 states:</p><blockquote>	In the strict sense of international law and practice, neutrality and its attendant rights and duties do not exist in peacetime; they arise only during a state of war.  Neutrality represents an attitude of impartiality adopted by a state towards the participants in a conflict and recognised as such by the belligerents.  Such an attitude creates certain rights and duties between the neutral state and the belligerents, which commence at the outbreak of war and end with its cessation. </blockquote><p>Why did I read that into the record?  Ireland has never been a neutral state.  The only time we have been tested before now was between 1939 and 1945, during the Second World War, when we openly repatriated members of the Allied forces who landed on our island - in our Republic - across the Border so that they could get back into the war.  We are being tested now.  We are facing autocracy versus democracy in Ukraine.  The question is: where do we stand?  We have provided medical aid, financial support, helmets and flak jackets.  Sitting in a building not so far away from us right now are a substantial number of Javelin rockets that can be used to take out tanks, a substantial number of Gustaf 84 mm anti-tank weapons that can be used to take out tanks, a substantial number of AT4 anti-tank missiles that can be used to be take out tanks and other weapons.  We also have a substantial number of artillery weapons that we could supply.<br/><br/>Failing to give the weapons to the Ukrainians to defend themselves is akin to me offering to hold someone's jacket while they fight someone else with a gun.  I know that many people in Ireland feel we should not provide weapons.  However, asking Ukrainians to defend themselves against a vicious and unwarranted attack and offering them nothing but money and stating that our hands tied with respect to weapons is not good enough.  I am a military man.  Those of us in this House and the Lower House who come from a military background believe that the only way to support a military force is by providing weapons that can be used to fight off the enemy.  I make a plea here and now among my colleagues.  Real support comes through providing Ukrainians with the tools to save their lives, to save the lives of their children, to maintain their cities and to stop the Russians in their tracks.<br/><br/>Let me turn to the issue of food.

As has been rightly pointed, famine is another tool being used by one of the belligerents in this war, namely, Russia.  Introducing famine into places like north Africa destabilises the entire geopolitical system.</p> <p>Ireland is a member of the United Nations Security Council.  I am on record as having no faith in the United Nations Security Council and very little faith in the United Nations.  However, if we are truly there to protect the individuals of this world and ensure that men, women and children have access to food, then we must put in place a peace-enforcement unit in the Black Sea to open the port of Odesa and allow food to be transferred out of Ukraine to the rest of the world.  We cannot sit on our hands and say we will give the Ukrainians everything they need to fight but not provide them with access to the world market and allow them to transfer food to those who need it around the world.  Grain sitting in silos in Ukraine today will rot if it is not brought out.  Worse still, there will be nowhere to put this year's harvest if we do not empty those silos.  The United Nations must prove itself to be an organisation that represents the downtrodden and those who would be oppressed by tyrants.  It must provide the necessary tools and equipment to open the ports in Ukraine and allow the food and grain sitting there to be transferred.</p> <p>Across Europe we have not closed the gas and oil pipelines.  We have threatened to do it and we will do it in time.  We must open the ports in Ukraine.  We must allow the Ukrainian people to transfer what they have which is needed by the rest of the world.  When members of the delegation speak to our Ministers and when their ministers speak to our Government and other European governments, two things are needed.  We need Ukrainians to be armed in order that they can defend themselves.  We need Ukrainian ports open and if that takes a massive naval flotilla to go and open the port in Odesa, that is what we must do.  Talk is cheap; let us see action from the United Nations and let us see it now.</p></speech>

It is very important that they are here to provide the testimony of their own people on the floor of the Seanad.  What better way to show that we are all in this together than to watch parliamentarians from our two nations here on the floor of the Seanad.  From the bottom of my heart, I thank all four members of the delegation for putting on the record of this House their testimony regarding the atrocities against their people.  We have heard first-hand testimony of what is happening to their friends and families as a result of this illegal invasion.  Let us not minimise that, because it is really important.  It is not something that any of us could do because it is not our families.  However, we are deeply impacted by that as are all Irish people.  It is really uncomfortable for us to hear stories of rape, murder and illegal extraction of children, but it is the only way to get to the bottom of it and to ensure we take the steps necessary.</p> <p>I had the honour of speaking to the four members of the delegation earlier.  I thank Senators Ward and Ahearn for facilitating this trip for them.  I also thank the Senators for travelling to Ukraine.  Having spoken to both groups, I have no doubt about the importance of the Senators going to Ukraine and of our guests coming here.  This is a really important thing to do because let us not forget that they will go to the UK tomorrow.  They will spread the word of what is happening in Ireland and what Ireland is doing right, and then bring that to other nations in order that they can be shamed and that we can also hear stories of what others are doing and step up to the mark.  We should not underestimate the importance of diplomacy.  There may be a complete failure of diplomacy when it comes to Russia but let us make sure that diplomacy works when it comes to Europe so that we can really tackle this.</p> <p>Sanctions have been imposed repeatedly by the European Union.  We need to see action in respect of all those sanctions at this stage.  Words are not good enough.  Let us make no mistake about it, those sanctions are incredibly painful for the people of Ireland and throughout the world.  However, they are the only way to stop what is going on.  As many of the delegation have said, the protracted aggression against Ukraine is much more painful.  It means that death will continue and it means low-level pain for us as well.</p> <p>We tend to talk about the difficulties and atrocities as we should.  However, it is also important to speak about what Ukrainian people have given to us in Ireland and the benefits that the 35,000 people who have come to our country have provided for us in terms of a feeling of solidarity and the joy that I know my children have when they meet Ukrainians in their schools.  There is a shared sense of humanity and what it really means to care for other people who are not part of our families and who, perhaps, were not part of our communities a month ago but who now are.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have seen some of the photographs the Ukrainian Members of Parliament have shown me of artwork done by Irish children and I have artwork done by my own children.  That love and connection among children is what it is all about.  That is why I am so deeply impacted by the stories they have to share about the impact of the conflict on children still living in Ukraine and those who are being moved to Russia.  Let us not forget there is a deep long-lasting impact on Ukrainian children who come to Ireland.  We have done a good job but there is a lot more work to do.  That work must extend beyond the Department of the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, which is where much of the work had been done up to now.  It must move across all the Departments in terms of housing and education because some Ukrainian people will stay here and we are more than happy for them to stay here if that is what they want to do.  We must also ensure we have long-term supports in place.  </p><p>Regarding the requests of the Ukrainian Members of Parliament, in particular Ukraine's application for membership of the European Union, we stand with them on that, of that there is no doubt.  With regard to their request for recognition of genocide, as they have already seen, we stand with them on that.  With regard to their request for Russia to pay, we absolutely stand with them on that and I believe I speak for people across the country when I say that.  I thank them again from the bottom of my heart for coming here and sharing with us and for leaving their families to do that.  I thank the Senators for facilitating that.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im iontach s&aacute;sta agus br&oacute;d&uacute;il go bhfuil seal agam &aacute;r ndl&uacute;thph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht agus taca&iacute;ocht a l&eacute;iri&uacute; d&oacute;ibh agus do mhuintir na h&Uacute;cr&aacute;ine.</p><p>I welcome our Ukrainian visitors to the Seanad and thank them, in particular, for all their respectful and impressive use of our own language.  Senator Clifford-Lee and I said we suspected the hand of Senator Ward in that regard but we certainly thank them for acknowledging and using their c&uacute;pla focal.</p><p>I know our visitors are here on a very short mission but I would like them to take a message home to their beleaguered people fighting the cruel aggression of the Russian Government led by Vladimir Putin.  That message is a very simple one; it is a message of thanks to the Ukrainian people for their bravery, their heroic resistance and determination to oppose Russian tyranny.  The people of Ireland cannot thank the people of Ukraine enough for that stance.  They are in the front line of defending the democratic rights of small nations to have their nation and its national boundaries accepted and recognised, and are doing so against a much more powerful nation next to them.  The Ukrainian people are teaching the Russian imperialists a lesson, which the British, the Americans and other imperialist powers around the world have been taught by those who occupied them in their time.  In Ireland, we are still dealing with the consequences of British interference in Irish affairs, as I speak, but that, colleagues, is a story for another day. </p><p>Today in the Seanad, it is a day for the Ukrainian people to feel our thanks to, and solidarity with, them.  Their stance, which has cost them dearly in terms of loss of life and the destruction of many of their cities, is not only protecting the Ukrainian people it is protecting the people of Ireland and the rest of Europe.  Their struggle is a democratic one and it is one that the people of Ireland support and identify with.  It has been Ireland&rsquo;s and Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s privilege to support the people of Ukraine since the Russian invasion.  The people of Ireland have shown to thousands of Ukrainians, who are making their home here, a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  In that regard, Ireland should act.  We should reopen our embassy in Kyiv not just in terms of practical work and assistance but as an important symbol of our solidarity to the Ukrainian people and Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to democracy, peace building and justice.  May I say, if O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Irish pub in Kyiv can reopen, then so too should our embassy.  </p><p>We give full support to Ukraine's application for membership of the EU and look forward soon, we hope, to greeting them as fully fledged members of the European family.  We continue to support sanctions against Russia.  We also support the International Criminal Court, ICC, investigation into human rights abuses during the invasion and the war.  It is my understanding there are currently 16,000 cases in front of the ICC relating to crimes carried out in Ukraine.  I know from speaking to my colleague, Deputy John Brady, earlier that our Ukrainian colleagues made a number of asks of Ireland in terms of those investigations.  They would like more women investigators and specialist psychologists to be involved.  Before coming to the Seanad Chamber this afternoon, we heard from representatives of the UN Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund regarding their response to the war in Ukraine and the key role women play not only in defence of their nation but, crucially, in peace building, conflict resolution and in the aftermath of conflict.  It is vital and crucial we support those efforts as we go forward.</p><p>Guilty parties must be brought to justice for crimes against humanity and violation of people&rsquo;s human rights.  Ireland and the EU must continue to do what they can to support the resistance of the Ukrainian people at home and abroad.  This means increasing support to Romania and Moldova.  The invasion by Russia has also raised issues of concern around energy and food sources and that has been referenced heavily by colleagues today.  We have seen the impact of Russia&rsquo;s monopoly on energy sources such as gas and oil and how millions of people throughout Africa are facing food shortages brought about as a result of the Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports.  Russia has weaponised hunger.  The war and the abuse of energy sources and food by the Russian Government is a stark reminder that the world needs to develop alternative energy and food sources capable of dealing with the crisis caused by climate change, Covid and conflict but the immediate crisis is the war of occupation in Ukraine.  </p><p>I hope the Ukrainian Members of Parliament return home from Ireland in the full knowledge they have our full support and thanks.  We share with them the deep desire that the war ends soon and that Russia withdraws all its forces from all of Ukraine, which will allow the people to rebuild their country and, in the fullness of time, establish peaceful, respectful relations with Russia.  The heroic resistance of Ukrainian people has not only inspired the people of Ireland but the people of Europe and the rest of the world.  </p><p>I am particularly keen to hear colleagues' views on how Ireland can use our position on the UN Security Council, and I am not as cynical as Senator Craughwell in that regard, and from our own lessons in Ireland of peace-building and conflict resolution to support humanitarian and justice efforts in Ukraine.  </p><p>I thank our Ukrainian colleagues again for being here and outlining their case so eloquently, so well and so forcefully on behalf of the Ukrainian people.  I welcome and thank all our visitors in the Gallery and the Ukrainian ambassador who is here with us today.  I wish them all the very best, every success, good wish and good fortune but, above all else, I wish for peace, justice, for stability for their country and for their people.  Go n-eir&iacute; go geal libh.  <i>Slava Ukraini</i>. </p></speech>

I am pleased and honoured to welcome them to the Seanad on behalf of the Labour Party.  I pay tribute to the bravery of all of our Ukrainian colleagues and the Ukrainian people and their dedication to a free, fair and independent democracy.</p> <p>In recent weeks I have had occasion to reread a book I read in 2018 by Philippe Sands, an international scholar of human rights law.  His grandfather, Leon, came from the city of Lviv.  He wrote a book about two people who were the founders and key architects of human rights law, both crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity.  Raphael Lemkin and Hersch Lauterpacht both came from that great city and lectured at the University of Kyiv.  As our Ukrainian colleagues sit here and call for Russian troops to be recognised in an international court for their crimes against humanity and the use of items such as food as a weapon of war against the Ukrainian people, it is ironic for them to know that those two men who came from that Ukrainian city they come from were the architects post the Second World War of those international crimes against humanity.</p> <p>With every day that goes by and every moment the abhorrent Russian invasion of Ukraine continues, the people of Ukraine suffer immense brutality, unlike anything most people in the world will ever know.  There can be no doubt the acts of Putin and Russian forces are to destroy Ukraine, its history, lands, people and proud culture.  The UN has reported that about 10,000 civilians have been killed to date at only 111 days into a war.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a conservative estimate of what is happening on the lands of Ukraine.  It is clear that no matter how many buildings are broken down and bombed, the spirit of the Ukrainian people is not dampened and will not be broken.   The international community has offered strong solidarity to Ukraine but the current measures are not sufficient and need to go further.   We in Ireland and in the broader international community must do more, particularly when it comes to food security and holding people to account for using food and rape as weapons of war, as they are doing in Ukraine.  We must do all we can to stand in solidarity with Ukraine.</p><p>We continue to call on the Government and the European Union to strengthen sanctions against Russia, including, from Ireland, the expulsion of the Russian ambassador, strong support for the accession of the Ukraine to the EU and the enactment of Deputy Howlin's Magnitsky Bill, which will target Russian oligarchs and their ill-gotten gains. </p><p>Nearly 5 million Ukrainian refugees have spread throughout Europe from home.  Across Ireland, we have welcomed Ukrainian refugees into towns, villages and cities.  While I am sure many hope they will have the opportunity to safely return, as Philippe Sands's grandfather understands, often that does not happen in the case of refugees and they have to build their lives elsewhere.  We need to make sure Ukrainians who have come here have safety and security in creating a home, whether temporary or permanent, in the coming years.  We must put in place supports, educational, medical, residential and otherwise, so that Ireland is a safe, stable home for all refugees, including those from Ukraine.  It has been 111 days since the brutal, illegal invasion of Ukraine began.  That is 111 days of war crimes against humanity, unbelievable suffering and equally unbelievable strength demonstrated by the Ukrainian Members and their people.  We stand with the people of Ukraine and will stand with them into the future to rebuild Ukraine as a free, independent and democratic nation.</p></speech>

The proof of sovereignty is when the representatives of the state speak as they have and are strong in their voice, as they have been today.</p> <p>It is right and proper that a few months ago this House passed a motion that unequivocally expressed our solidarity with Ukraine and condemned the Russian invasion as a breach of international law and the UN Charter.  It was an imperialist act which breached the UN Charter, particularly the right to self-determination of nations.  That charter is a fundamental document that came not out of wishful thinking but out of a moment of full understanding of the horrors of war following Second World War, much as the European Union structures came into place at that time.  It has as its first line the commitment to do all we can to protect future generations from the scourge of war.  Fundamental for Ireland and the reason Ireland has a strong voice and can achieve things that other countries might not be able to is that Ireland is a voice on international law and the principles thereof.  That was put in place because of knowledge of what war can do in its worst face.  Ireland being a neutral nation is not an apathetic thing.  It is an active role Ireland has had as a champion of international law which engages on issues of principle and pushes, as I have experienced as somebody who engages internationally as a parliamentarian.</p> <p>In prior years, some aspects of the Russian Government have worked to undermine international multilateral spaces, international negotiations and those common languages.  There are those in Russia who would be comfortable with us moving back to a world of big powers and might.  That is why we must use every instrument of international diplomacy and of our multilateral structures, including the United Nations.  It is not just about the Security Council, where we are hitting blocks; the UN General Assembly and the European Union are all parts.  We need to use every diplomatic and international legal tool we have, including the International Criminal Court, and diplomatic measures such as sanctions, which are an effective hard diplomacy tool that could and should be used with more strength.   This is somewhere Ireland can push and contribute. </p> <p>I note two of the Ukrainian Members present are members of economic and finance committees and will be aware of the importance thereof.  Our finance committee in Ireland is looking at section 110 companies and at the financial structures in Ireland and many countries which may allow oligarchs to hide their assets and indirectly contribute to the funding of war and the machines of war.</p> <p>Regarding the arms industry, a strong action we could take would be to stop funding arms in the Russian state.  That is important and significant.  Ireland has had a role.  We saw horrifying reports last week from Amnesty International on cluster munitions.  They breach international law and must be prosecuted in international courts.  Ireland, as an example of where our neutrality has been tested, was the country that negotiated a global ban on cluster bombs.  Only a handful of countries, including Russia, have not signed up to that ban.  The fact that such horrific tools that target civilians are an exception rather than the rule is thanks to the power Ireland was able to exert.</p> <p>It is especially important now when we see blockages at the UN Security Council that we have General Assembly motions on humanitarian corridors.  Ms Shkrum's past is in working with refugees and she has worked with displaced people around the world.  The importance of that humanitarian work is fundamental, especially now when we face the humanitarian crisis of refugees and that being visited by the immoral use of food as a weapon of war.  That is never acceptable, whether in Yemen, Eritrea, Ukraine or in those countries Senator Ward described as being held hostage to this war and the manoeuvres of big powers.  It must be condemned and acted on.  These are things we can do.</p> <p>I will finish with a comment on the future.  That quote on the laughter of the children is very powerful.  Ireland should, can and must accelerate the accession of Ukraine to the European Union but there is other work of peace, including the role of women in peace negotiations and the 13-25 principle.  We know that is what makes peace negotiations work   They must be strongly in it.  President Zelenskyy mentioned community development when he addressed the Oireachtas.  That long work of peacebuilding is there.  We will be there to support Ukraine in all of that and look forward to a future where children will be laughing and there will be a strong, independent sovereign Ukraine, fully part of every aspect of the European Union and our shared world.  </p></speech>

I am privileged, as we all are, to be here.  Senator Higgins mentioned cluster bombs.  There are also phosphorus bombs.  The Senator who has military experience is, unfortunately, not here any more.  Those present probably do not know the way to protect oneself from cluster or phosphorus bombs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Dmytro Natalukha:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is no way.  If such a bomb falls on you, it burns everything to the ground.  Even if you are in a car or covered by a roof, it will literally not stop burning.</p><p>These things are what is called unsolicited knowledge.  We never wanted to know them, just as our children never wanted to know how to distinguish the sound of different arms and weapons.  Unfortunately, this is the brutal and ugly reality we have to face, even today.  The good news in all of this is that, while the war has clearly and very frankly shown who our main enemies are, it has also shown who our main friends are.  My heart is warmed to be in this room full of friends and people who care and who show that care not just in their words, but in their actions, their courage in coming to Ukraine and Kyiv, their incredible hospitality and the actions they have undertaken through different platforms including the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and all other institutions and bodies.  We do not doubt who our true friends are for a second.  It is truly an honour and a privilege for me to be here today in this great House among friends.  I thank the House again.  Glory to Ireland.</p></speech>

We are very grateful.  We really feel that they are thinking about us.  Despite Ireland's own problems, its situation and so on, which we understand, its people think about Ukraine all of the time.  I want to thank them one more time.  I understand that it is tiring and that Ireland has tried to give us every last thing but it will help people, including children, into the future.  They can say that Ireland made the biggest effort at this time.  In the near future, Ireland will be considered the first among our friends because it has been our real friend despite the distance between us.  We will win this war and we will be the best of friends in our near future.</p></speech>

To be honest, it was not an easy decision for us to come here.  It is never an easy decision to leave Ukraine.  You feel an amount of guilt when you are somewhere safe abroad.  You receive a lot of messages from soldiers, volunteers and others and you miss some of them.  It is not only us who feel this guilt.  Every Ukrainian feels it sometimes when they are in a safe environment abroad.  However, moments and discussions like this and being beside friends like this make every minute of this trip, which is not easy, worth it.  This is incredibly important for us.  We will bring with us the new strength, inspiration and power to fight and to do as much as we can back to Kyiv and to Ukraine.<br/><br/>I am still a big believer in international law even though it completely failed me and my country at the beginning of the war.  I studied international law at Kyiv University and Cambridge University.  I worked with refugees through the UN Refugee Agency, UNCHR.  I was a big believer and an idealist.  When Putin sacrificed everything that had been done in international law over the past 70 years, I felt that I had done something wrong.  I felt that I had taken the wrong job and that nothing worked.  However, since then, there has been a domino effect of bravery starting from small things in Ukraine such as President Zelenskyy not leaving the capital.  He was almost forced to leave at the time but refused.  At 5 a.m. on 21 February, we were together near the centre of President Zelenskyy's Administration and where our committee meets.  It was still very cold and quite dark and bombs were exploding.  We were waiting for the Parliament to open.  We made a decision to vote in the Parliament in the centre of Kyiv rather than to go somewhere else that was more secure, despite having a secure shelter where there would be no bombing.  However, the decision was made unanimously by all parties to be in Kyiv, at the centre and near the President's offices because we had to show our people and our army that we were not afraid to be there.  Since the beginning of the war, we have had more than ten open sessions of our Parliament like that in the centre of Kyiv.  We never moved the Parliament anywhere else.  This was also part of the domino effect of bravery we received from the army and from volunteers.<br/><br/>This effect spread to many different countries all over the world.  I am sure it was not an easy decision for Ireland to abolish the requirement for Ukrainians to hold a visa and to just let everybody come.  It was a brave decision and it is still moving.  This effect is still going all over the world.  It is incredibly inspirational to see.  It restores my faith in international law and international humanitarian rules.  I pray that all of us, as rules-based societies, and international humanitarian law all over the world will emerge stronger from this horrible war.<br/><br/>The first time I was in the theatre, I was probably 11 or 12 years old.  It was a theatre in the centre of Kyiv, near the Parliament, called the Ivan Franko Theatre.  It is named for one of our famous writers.  The play was George Bernard Shaw's <i>Pygmalion</i>.  I did not understand anything, but it was a very funny play.  It was great.  I kept going back to it because all of our most famous actors, who are now on television, were performing in this play in the theatre.  Through some very hard times, such as when I broke up with a boyfriend, I would come back to the theatre to see this play.  It was a great tradition.  I cannot do it right now.  The theatre is not functioning and some of the actors, including some very famous ones, are volunteering on the front line.  I just got a message that the theatre will reopen.  It will start to put on plays again.  It would be wonderful to see many of the Senators there in the centre of Kyiv after the victory watching George Bernard Shaw's play <i>Pygmalion</i>or any other play in summer.  We invite all of the Senators to join us and thank them for their friendship.</p></speech>

We will definitely take back the confidence Ireland has in the victory of Ukraine.  We know we will win.  We have no other choice.  It is the only way forward for Ukraine and for Ukrainians.  However, it means a great deal to know that we have a friend who has our back and who is willing to speak up for us, to root for us and to cheer for us.  Ireland is that friend.  We will take that confidence Ireland has in the victory of Ukraine back to our constituencies and our people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Ms Lesia Vasylenko:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will help us to fight.  It will give us the strength.  We will continue to fight; believe me.  We have done this for the past 111 days.  We have done it for eight years.  We have done it for centuries.  Today is yet another battle that Ukraine is fighting.  It is a battle between right and wrong, autocracy and democracy, empire and freedom.  We all know what must win.  Right, freedom and democracy must win.  We fight, and by &quot;we&quot; I mean all of us here together, for these universal values.  Each of us does our bit.<br/><br/>Ukraine is fighting on its land with its own human resources.  We are sacrificing a lot.  What Ireland and the other freedom-loving countries of this world can do is to give the instruments with which Ukrainians can fight and defeat Russia.  Although it may seem that sanctions cost a lot, that weapons are expensive or impossible, all of us are deciding what the world of tomorrow will look like, what legacy we will leave to the generations of the future and what kind of world order our children will live in.  That is not expensive.  That is an investment we are asking the rest of world to make with us now for the world of the future.  What the world of the future really cannot afford, as well as the world of the now, is to live with an aggressive and terrorist Russia in it.  To allow for freedom to win and to allow for victory, each of us has our own task.  We owe this victory to each other.<br/><br/>Glory to Ireland and glory to Ukraine.  <i>Slava Ukraini</i>.</p></speech>

It is one we will remember for many a day.  The memory of it will stay with us.  I welcome Ms Vasylenko, Ms Shkrum, Mr. Tistyk and Mr. Natalukha.  They are exceptional ambassadors for their country and do their country proud.  Their presentations were moving and filled any deficit of information anyone here might have had.</p><p>I welcome the new Ukrainian Irish to the Gallery.  They were accompanied earlier by Councillor Grainger, who put through a major motion in her council yesterday in favour of Ukraine.</p><p>I salute the Cathaoirleach and Senators Ward, Ahearn and Dooley for travelling to Ukraine.  That was an important initiative.  They displayed courage, empathy and solidarity in doing that.  I congratulate them.</p><p>I will reference a point made by Mr. Natalukha with regard to investment by Kingspan in Ukraine.  My colleague, Senator Wilson from Cavan, and I have strongly supported that initiative by Kingspan.  We have urged Kingspan to publish it so that it may encourage other investment in Ukraine.</p><p>Ukraine is the victim of an illegal and barbaric war.  That has been manifest on many fronts.  There has been genocide.  There have been sexual crimes of horrific proportions.  Children have been kidnapped.  Those are aspects of a dreadful, illegal and barbaric war.  In the face of that war, Ukrainians have displayed an indomitable spirit and extraordinary courage.  We stand in awe of them.  They are a resourceful and resilient people.</p><p>I had the privilege of being the first Irish person to speak at a debate at the Council of Europe on the expulsion of Russia.  I opened with a phrase that said it all: Russia has expelled itself.  That is effectively what Russia has done.  Russia has expelled itself from European values, Christian norms, objective morality, international law and international bodies.</p><p>I have had the privilege in the past of visiting beautiful Kyiv and spending a few very happy days in Kharkiv.  It is shocking to witness what is happening now in those places.</p><p>There is something in our DNA in Ireland that makes us understand the people of Ukraine.  We suffered, as did the Ukrainians, a shocking famine.  We lost 1 million of our people in the period of the Famine, from 1840 to 1850.  During that time, 1.4 million people left our shores.  There were 1.4 million displaced persons and another 1 million were the subject of a genocide.  It is in our DNA.  We empathise, we get it and we understand.  We salute the people of Ukraine and are in solidarity with them.</p><p>We in Ireland strongly support the sanctions on Russia, which must be implemented to the letter of the law.  They must be stepped up.  We in Ireland must be willing to make sacrifices.  There are clear sacrifices for us in the implementation of the sanctions.  We must support Ukraine's candidate status and its accession to the EU.  It must get candidate status immediately.  As a country, we strongly support that.  As I said earlier, we must support the rebuilding of our guests' wonderful country.  There must be international support for the investment in that rebuilding.</p><p>I consider this one of the most unique, wonderful and moving occasions there has been in our Seanad.  I salute my two colleagues who were at the forefront of organising this session, with the support of the Cathaoirleach.  All I can say is <i>Slava Ukraini</i>.</p></speech>

Another wise quote states that it is not the scorn of my enemies but the silence of my friends that hurts the most.  In Ireland, our guests will not hear any silence with respect to Ukraine.

My amendment suggesting definitions has not been successful.  Ahead of Report Stage, I urge the Government to define the term further or to recognise the points I have raised.  In European Court of Justice rulings, exceptional circumstances were clearly intended to exclude anything that could create an incentive, reward, encouragement or new practice as regards planning.  Exceptional circumstances are meant to be rare.</p> <p>This legislation has not been justified.  We already have mechanisms for substitute consent in exceptional circumstances, but the Bill makes it easier for developers to access the process for seeking substitute consent, as all the power to initiate it will go to them.  It will no longer be something that, for example, local authorities can initiate.  There will also be rewards for those who have failed to apply planning processes properly, in that a developer who has not applied for planning permission for a development in the proper way and consequently needs to seek substitute consent will be allowed to attach a new application for a brand new development, not only on that site, but on adjoining sites without having to go through the original process or without the adjoining sites being materially linked to the development for which the substitute consent is being sought.  A brand new development of a different kind on an adjoining site will be able to go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, effectively skipping planning processes at local authority level.  By contrast, someone developing a site who has previously had a development that did not have proper consents will have to go through a longer process than those who are seeking substitute consent.  By this I mean that the process for a new development by a developer who did not get proper consent at the time and now needs substitute consent is shorter than that for a developer starting from scratch on a site.  This is perverse incentive.  In a series of bad dissections of our planning system, this might be the moment where we jump the shark into something that is so ludicrous that we are directly rewarding those who have breached practices.  This provision is at high risk of not meeting the requirements set out in the European Court of Justice ruling, which made it explicitly clear that there should be nothing that creates any kind of encouragement of these practices.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have sought to bring amendments on this, which I will discuss here if I have the opportunity, but will also bring more on Report Stage.  We should be monitoring to ensure these cases do become exceptional.  What will be exceptional?  Would that be one, two or three decisions a year?  Could it be 20 decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  If more applications go through this route than previously or there is an increase in people attaching their planning applications alongside other applications for substitute consent, that would be a new trend rather than exceptional circumstances.</p><p>This is not in line with EU law.  It is not in line with the rulings.  It is a massive overreach.  The fact that this is being done right now, and that we would make An Bord Plean&aacute;la the first point of arbitration for planning decisions from applicants who, by the very nature of it, have failed to apply proper processes in the past, at a time when An Bord Plean&aacute;la is under examination due to a number of its practices, is incredible.  It is not only bad legislation but a very bad time to bring this bad legislation through.</p></speech>

The whole point of substitute consent is to seek regularisation and to protect the environment.  It is a key point that the developer in a parallel application must show bona fides.  The substitute consent application is assessed as per the section 177K criteria for exceptionality.  I hope that clarifies the matter.  The Senator mentioned she might bring some other elements on Report Stage so I wanted to give that clarification.</p></speech>

The section is quite clear.  Senator Higgins spoke about exceptionality.  If I am reading it right, this would put the onus on the planning authority or the board to consider both the past and present requirements applicable to a development.  Our language must be judicious in how we speak about matters of planning.  How do we know this is in breach of EU law?  Who is to say that?  Let us be clear in what we are trying to do here.  There is an obligation on developers to fulfil or adhere to this regulation.  The board is independent in its decision-making.  The Senator may look at me but An Bord Plean&aacute;la is independent of all of us, whether we like it or not.  She may well laugh at me but I have not yet, in my 18 years as a public representative dealing with appeals, submissions or objections to An Bord Plean&aacute;la or dealing with the planners in Cork city or county councils, questioned its bona fides.  It is very independent and extremely fair in how it handles its business.  There may be examples in the public domain at the moment but that is a different matter.  In the main, we have to be fair about the independence of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the way in which it does its business.</p></speech>

There were specific rulings relating to previous regimes.  I believe we are not satisfying those and that we are at risk.  That is why I referenced those other components because those have been attached in this legislation.  To be clear, we had a regime for substitute consent already.  This legislation is not bringing that in.  Of course there should be mechanisms for regularisation.  However, this legislation will mean local authorities will no longer be able to require developers to seek substitute consent and developers who wish to seek substitute consent will no longer have to seek High Court leave to do so.  This short-circuits the process so it will be a direct choice following a meeting with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is a direct choice at that point for the developer if it wishes to seek substitute consent.  There is a shift of the power.  This is not about whether there should be processes for substitute consent.  Of course there should.  There are many very reasonable instances where people do not realise something and they make mistakes and there should be mechanisms to regularise that.  The question is what the process for substitute consent will be.  I do not believe this is an appropriate process.  It is a step backwards from the process we currently have.</p></speech>

In January 1998, two applications for wind farm developments from two separate developers, Saorgus Energy Limited and B9 Energy Services Limited, were made to Galway County Council, seeking permission to erect 46 wind turbines on three sites in the locality of Derrybrien.  Permission was granted to Saorgus for 46 turbines in March 1998.  In the same month, B9 was granted permission to erect 23 turbines.  In all, 69 turbines were to be erected in the area of Derrybrien.  Local residents appealed the decisions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but the local authority's decision was upheld by the board.</p><p>In 2000, Saorgus applied to Galway County Council for a further 25 turbines, which would bring its total to 71.  Initially, Galway County Council refused permission but on appeal the developers were granted planning permission for these developments.  In consequence, Saorgus leased an 850 acre site at Derrybrien and construction commenced in October 2003.  There was then a landslide of peat causing environmental damage to the site at Derrybrien when the contractors were constructing the wind farm.  Huge amounts of peat were dislodged and slid across the site, polluting a local river and resulting in the death of 50,000 fish.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The landslide meant that 450,000 tonnes of peat, which is a lot of peat, was spread over an area of 25 ha which is more than 50 acres.  That resulted in an enormous movement of 250,000 tonnes of material in a downwards direction.  That disaster led to An Bord Plean&aacute;la refusing substitute consent to the ESB subsidiary.  The wind farm capacity that was affected by that refusal of substitute consent was 59.5 MW which is a substantial development especially when we consider that the island overall has a generating capacity of 5,600 MW.  It was not some small-pocket development but a substantial one.</p><p>In October 2004, ESB International and Ascon, a construction company, were prosecuted and fined at Gort District Court for allowing polluting matter to enter the head waters of the river and derisory fines of &euro;1,250 were imposed on each company.  In 2005, the following year, the European Commission announced it would prosecute Ireland in the European Court of Justice in respect of these issues.  This was probably as a result of a direct intervention by environmentalist volunteers at European level.</p><p>In 2019, the State was fined &euro;5 million over its failure to comply with EU legislation that might have prevented the landslides linked to the construction of a wind farm in 2003.  This fine has since been increased to &euro;17 million.  The fine in question was largely due to the State's failure to carry out an environmental impact assessment on the site, as was required by European law for a development of that kind.  The ESB then lodged a substitute consent application under the amended planning law through a remedial environmental impact assessment report in June 2020 to regularise the project's planning status.  Later, An Bord Plean&aacute;la decided not to grant substitute consent for the development.</p><p>The situation now is that 70 turbines in the Slieve Aughty Mountains must be removed after 20 years of controversy.  The site has already cost the Irish taxpayer &euro;17 million in fines and now this badly needed infrastructure must be removed in its entirety.  The rather futile obligation is being cast on the ESB and the developers to try to reinstate the site to the state it was in prior to the landslide.  In other words, the matter is to be remedied.  The reason that substitute consent was not granted was because it was effectively impossible to do so in the circumstances that I have described.</p><p>I would like to place a number of reflections on the record.  First, our planning laws were grossly inadequate insofar as polluting the river ended up with &euro;1,250 fines - virtually equivalent to the fine for not paying for a television licence or for a motoring offence.  Second, the Irish State has had to pony up &euro;17 million to the European Union by way of penalties instead of having a statutory regime which could have approached the matter on the basis of redress consisting of the developers having to share the cost of the fines in question.  There should also be an estimate as to whether the actual demolition of the wind farm and the reinstatement of the site is environmentally justified.  We now have what I and the movers of this amendment consider to be a wholly unjustified situation where more damage will be done to the environment, valuable resources will be wasted and badly needed wind energy infrastructure will be decommissioned and destroyed,all to make a point that at the very beginning an environmental impact assessment should have been carried out.</p><p>I wonder whether Ireland is unique in this and whether this would happen in any other European state.  I wonder whether the powers that be would not have found some solution to impose upon the people - who made the original mistake of not seeking an environmental impact assessment - the burden of remediation while retaining the development.  I wonder about the absence of proportionality that 20 years after all this was done - we are now in 2022 and the work was carried out in 2003 - somebody would actually ask where the common sense in all this is.  Is the environmental tail wagging the environmental dog in the sense that a purist view of this is being allowed to produce a result which flies in the face of what most people would consider to be proportionate and common sense?  </p><p>Our amendment proposes to amend section 13 to provide that as part of the process of consideration of a substitute consent application, there should be "an independent review of the environmental, financial and community impact of the existing development or the decommissioning of the existing development on the lands under consideration."  It is not very much to ask that in addition to the retrospective look-back aspect which is currently enshrined in law, somebody should actually consider the practicalities, proportionality and reasonableness of requiring a development to be nullified and reinstatement of the site - insofar as that could ever be done.</p><p>I understand that the Minister of State and his departmental officials are in the sad position of having been advised that there is nothing we can do at this point.  We cannot go to Europe on our knees and say, "Look we've paid our fines.  This won't happen again.  We've amended the law."  There is a positive environmental advantage in keeping this wind generation facility in place especially in a country which is making - I hope the Minister of State does not take this as a barbed political point - slow enough progress in substituting renewable energy generation for non-renewable fossil fuel sources of energy at a time when according to all the prognostications we will fail to meet our 2030 targets.  We are trying to electrify the country and to drive a revolution in our energy requirements.  However, as a result of a failure to carry out an environmental impact assessment between 1999 and 2003, we are actually destroying alternative energy facilities at great cost.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Nobody has yet put a figure on the cost there will be in demolishing this facility.  I am not competent to say whether the turbines can be re-erected anywhere else.  Nobody has come out clearly and said they can be shifted somewhere else or even that the mechanical infrastructure can be saved.  I am deeply sceptical, however, about the environmental sense of attempting to wipe out this facility on the basis of a historic error of this kind.  I will put on the record I do not believe there was <i>mala fides</i>at any point in the whole process.  I do not believe people said, &quot;We have an obligation to do that but Europe can get lost.  We are going to cut a corner here.&quot;  I do not believe the ESB and the planning authority would do that or that An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the time, when it approved these additional facilities, consciously decided to breach European law.<br/><br/>Senator Higgins talked about the necessity of preventing people from riding roughshod over European law and then benefiting from it, but if it all comes down to two fines of &euro;1,250 and the obligation now cast, in effect, on nationally owned entities to spend more money on demolishing all of this structure, where is the common sense in all this?  What are we trying to achieve?  Is Europe trying to say to us we were very naughty in 2003, An Bord Plean&aacute;la should have insisted on an EIA then, should not have done X, Y and Z, and should not have granted the appeals in question?  There comes a time in virtually every aspect of human affairs when we cannot put the toothpaste back in the tube.  That is what this decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the fact we cannot go to Europe to ask it to just take a common sense view of the matter means.  We are now stuck with a statutory outcome from An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the destruction of very valuable infrastructure in an utterly futile effort to remediate that which is irremediable in any event. <br/><br/>To go back to the matter of the landslide, or turf slide or bog slide, that took place, presumably the developers did not foresee that was likely to happen.  Presumably, if they had foreseen the risk of that happening, they would have taken steps to prevent it.  I do not know what the engineering steps would have had to be, but presumably they would have done earthworks, earth removal works, or installation works in a different way, or taken precautions to insert pilings or whatever, to prevent an event of this kind from happening.  We are now in the utterly ridiculous situation, having spent &euro;17 million paying penalties to the European Union, of destroying extremely valuable infrastructure and pretending we will remediate that site at whatever cost will eventually fall on the community.<br/><br/>I fully accept the need for EIAs.  In this case, I do not believe there was ever a conscious decision to circumvent the requirement for an EIA or that An Bord Plean&aacute;la was party to such circumvention.  It seems to me, therefore, that in circumstances such as these in future, we should not merely take a look at the wrong that was done but also look at the extent to which it is proportionate and in conformity with common sense, the good of the environment and the good of the community to take a different course rather than refusal of a substitute consent.  Whatever steps have to be taken to ensure that, in this case, the significant cost to the Exchequer, and the cost that will be borne by whoever has to pay the bill for attempting to remove all this, should not be borne by the community but should somehow be levied on the profits that would arise from Derrybrien, if the wind farms were left intact.

I do not intend to go back over what my colleague has so eloquently put together regarding Derrybrien.  I visited the site, was driven around it and walked part of it.  Even with the best will in the world, there is absolutely no way of returning Derrybrien to what it was pre-development.  There is just no possibility of that.  There are 25 km of roads there, fibre optic cables are running from turbine to turbine, and there is an entire information technology system that manages each one of the turbines.  Indeed, those who manage the turbines and the engineers who look after them can activate a turbine from their homes.  They do not have to be on site but can monitor those turbines from home.  As my colleague, Senator McDowell pointed out, there are 70 turbines producing 1% of the entire electricity needs of the country.  The site itself is now in pristine condition.  The area where the mudslide took place is totally overgrown and nature has recaptured it.  Incidentally, it is not the first bog slide there ever was in this country and, in some cases, no development had taken place so it is a bit of a nonsense to totally blame the development in Derrybrien.</p> <p>At present, two turbines per day are allowed to be turned on for a short period to ensure they do not seize.  I understand there is interest from as far away as Africa, Denmark and Finland in these turbines, which will ultimately be sold for scrap because that is all they are.  Yet, these turbines are almost 99% efficient when they run.  The area they are in makes an ideal nature reserve.  It is the sort of place where there could be a greenway, while the turbines are active.  We could have a nature reserve there.  To prevent turf cutting there in future, what should happen is those who own bogs on the site should be paid an annual sum of &euro;1,000, &euro;1,500 or &euro;2,000 a year for the next ten or 20 years to compensate them for the loss of their turf.</p> <p>The people I spoke to locally have no problem with Derrybrien.  I started to think about how we got to where we are.  The analogy I will give concerns the bus stop for Corrandulla village, which was identified by Transport for Ireland.  It made perfect sense.  A bus stop was going to be put at a certain spot on the map until somebody actually drove the distance.  It was 10 km form Corrandulla.  No pensioner was going to walk 10 km to get the bus into Galway.  What happened was that a decision was made at a desk.  Nobody on the ground went to see what was happening.  Similarly, in Derrybrien, one officer from the planning authorities went on site and was supportive of it.  Nobody else has gone there.  None of the people in Europe who put on the pressure to have this mattered considered by the European Court of Justice visited the site and none of them has  seen the site.  No one from the European Court of Justice has come to the site so nobody knows what is going on there.</p> <p>We talk about planning laws.  That is what this is all about.  If there is an attempt to dismantle Derrybrien, I will be the first person to put in an objection under planning laws because we cannot remediate.  The foundations for individual turbines have to go through bog down to hard ground.  In some cases, that is several metres.  How do we pull out several metres of concrete and replace it with turf?  How do we do that?  How do we take out 25 km of road and replace it with the turf that used to be there?  How do we take out the fibre optic cables?  The national grid that is feeding into that site has to be taken out of it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

The resident wondered why, surely to God, Derrybrien could not be used to generate the electricity and give it to the hospital and nursing homes for nothing.  I think the amendment that we have put forward addresses some of those issues.  I have spent a lot of time on the Committee on European Union Affairs over the last seven or eight years.  There was a lot of talk in Europe about subsidiarity and trying to bring decision-making back to the individual member states.  Then we get decisions like this.  Is it any wonder that people are turned off the European idea when there are bureaucrats in Brussels, Strasbourg or wherever making decisions about something they have never seen, based on one environmental incident?  My colleague is right to state that the fines that were imposed on the contractors at the time were ludicrous.  They were absolutely ridiculous.  The State picked up &euro;17 million of the cost.</p><p>This amendment makes perfect sense.  My real plea today, in seconding the amendment, is for the Government to take a step back and think about what we are doing.  As my colleague stated, we cannot put the toothpaste back in the tube.  There is no way on God's earth that Derrybrien can ever be returned to where it was.  Why not turn it into a benefit to the nation?  We are going through an international energy crisis and there are 70 turbines in Derrybrien that are switched off, sitting and waiting to rust away.  It is absolute insanity.  That is why we are moving this amendment.  I hope the Minister of State will accept it.  It makes perfect sense.  It will allow situations like this to be appraised in a much better way.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#UUU00200"><p>I will speak briefly on the amendment.  While there are aspects of amendment No. 11 that are constructive, I suggest it is important that there is like with like such that there is an independent review of the environmental impact, rather than just an assessment of the environmental, financial and community impact.  A situation can be created whereby a good financial case outweighs concerns around the environmental impact.  A compelling environmental case has been put and we should consider looking at one environmental impact alongside another environmental impact.  However, when financial impacts are added in, there is the creation of a situation where like is not compared with like.  There is a financial benefit, which is probably a financial benefit to companies generally speaking.  As we have heard, they pay the small fines and the State pays the large fines when we fail to deliver on our environmental obligations.  That financial benefit could be outweighing the environmental considerations.  While the idea of having a wider frame on the environmental considerations, including the impact of decommissioning and rehabilitation and how that works, has some merit, I note that in this amendment the financial impact is placed alongside that.</p><p>Unfortunately, what makes this frustrating is that the EU was not suddenly being unreasonable.  It signalled earlier that this was coming and it should have been acted upon.  Ireland would make a more convincing case if we had shown that we have learned from the incident.  Sadly, the message over the past few years, as I have seen, is that Ireland does not seem to have learned from it.  Despite this case and despite the absolute waste of energy, time, infrastructure and everything that goes into a project wrongly situated or not planned properly, we have continued to say that perhaps we could save a bit of time by getting through the stages quickly, when we know that it makes for a longer and more expensive journey in the long run.  A sign that we have not learned from the experience is that we are reading in the newspapers today that An Bord Plean&aacute;la - which, under this legislation, will be dealing with it all on its own - has one ecologist among their 60 inspectors.  Of the 60 inspectors, whose advice is not always listened to, only one of them is an ecologist.  How could Ireland be paying fines of millions of euro over the last few years and not be thinking that perhaps we could do with having a lot more ecologists and staff who can conduct environmental impact assessments in order that we do not dig ourselves into these holes in the future?  Ireland had to be pushed by the European Court of Justice about not doing environmental impact assessments on peat extraction properly.  In an 18-month period over the last few years, 1.5 million tonnes of horticultural peat were exported from Ireland.  We know that large-scale industrial peat extraction simply was not being properly planned or subjected to environmental impact assessments.  The EU gave out to us about forestry and how we were failing to complete environmental impact assessments for large forestry projects.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, has increased slightly the number of ecologists in that area.  It is important.  That is the solution, rather than hoping that fewer people will take appeals.</p><p>I sympathise with the idea of specific projects being looked at and the environmental impact and the environmental piece being looked at in the round.  There is some merit in the kind of idea being put forward, as indicated by the language in amendment No. 11, as one of the considerations that might be taken into account.  However, sadly, Ireland has not demonstrated and is not demonstrating in this legislation that it has learned from the experience and it will not repeat its mistakes.  Another example of how we have not learned from it is apparent in the case law that I referenced.  Senator Buttimer asked me about that.  Specifically, in paragraphs 57 to 58 of the Commission <i>v.</i>Ireland, C-215/06, the original Derrybrien case, the Court stated that: &quot;While Community law cannot preclude the applicable national rules from allowing, in certain cases, the regularisation of operations or measures which are unlawful in the light of Community law, such a possibility should be subject to the conditions that it does not offer the persons concerned the opportunity to circumvent the Community rules or to dispense with applying them, and that it should remain the exception.&quot;  The Court highlighted, in paragraph 58, that a system of regularisation, such as that in force in Ireland at the time, &quot;may have the effect of encouraging developers to forgo ascertaining whether intended projects satisfy the criteria&quot; for prior assessment.  That is why having like with like in the current proposals is important.  If the Government wants to bring that in, the public consultation element and the rights of the public, under the Aarhus Convention, to be part of environmental decision-making are important.  I am sure there are many members of the public, who, like Senator Craughwell, may make a very strong case from an environmental decision-making perspective that they believe something should be retained rather than removed and started again.  The key is that there must a conversation about the environment and environmental decision-making.  This legislation actually truncates the public involvement in that by skipping the local authority stage in respect of associated new developments.  In that sense, it reduces the opportunities for public engagement in environmental decision-making.  The approach of looking at the mistakes of the past to see how we can find the best possible way forward would be more convincing if it was actually accompanied by really strong measures that show a sea change and strong public involvement in an environmental discussion around issues like Derrybrien and many others.  It is by strengthening and widening the environmental discussion that we can actually do more, rather than by truncating it again or trying to find ways to smooth out the process retrospectively and into the future.  </p></speech>

I think it is particularly apt that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is here, given his strong credentials in relation to the environment.  I too recognise what Senator Higgins has spoken about in respect of the Aarhus Convention and the right of citizens to engage on environmental issues.  I am always talking about it in the House.  However, and I do not like using the expression, but we are where we are.  Senators Craughwell and McDowell made the point that Derrybrien has been constructed and it is there.  It is questionable but its removal may cause even more environmental damage.  At the same time, there is an energy crisis, and there is potential for it to be used.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I am mindful that I went to see the site myself and I want to acknowledge the enormous work that Councillor Geraldine Donohue and her colleagues on Galway County Council have done.  They are deeply concerned and have had extensive debate on this issue.  I always like to apply subsidiarity, go to the ground and meet the people there and the public representatives on Galway County Council.  You hear another story that way and you hear rational and reasonable explanations of the potential of it.  It has been a difficult issue and people and their opinions and views on Derrybrien have evolved over time  The common theme is that, regrettably, we are where we are.  Mistakes have been made that should not have happened and it is important that we acknowledge that but we are where we are.  It has the potential for an amazing set of biodiversity.  It has fauna, plants and life and things have started to develop and grow there and it is an amazing space.  I do not know if the Minister of State has been to Derrybrien but I would recommend anyone to go there and see how the land has a great ability to rehabilitate and revegetate itself, which has happened down there.</p><p>I signed up to this with my colleagues and we are fiercely committed to it.  It is not unreasonable for us to talk about an independent review and I do not see why the Minister of State would have a difficulty with that.  It is independent of us and of politics and would be conducted by experts in the various fields on the environmental, financial and community impacts, which is really important, to see what we can do.  Ludicrous and crazy fines have been paid and there has been long and protracted litigation with all sorts of expenses.  If we were to start all over again we would say it should not have happened but we are where we are.  The right course of action is to look at an independent assessment of the environmental impact as well as the financial impact.  Whether we like it or not there have to be financial implications to these things too and they have been a huge part of the problem already.  More importantly, there has been a community impact and that independent review and assessment of audit can be carried out in some sort of meaningful engagement with people because that is critically important and I am constantly arguing in here for the need for public participation in planning and the environment.</p><p>I know the Minister of State is fiercely committed to that too but I am also aware of his enormous commitment to alternative energy and to meeting our targets by 2030.  We have the potential and - dare I say - the seed of something great.  Maybe it came about in the wrong way but let us stand back and let us not make crazy, mad decisions.  The people of Galway do not want that, and the more people learn and understand what Derrybrien is, the more they believe this is the right thing to do.  For that reason I join with my colleagues in proposing this amendment because it is the right thing to do and it is not something we jumped into lightly.  I want to again acknowledge the councillors on Galway County Council who engaged with and communicated with us and who expressed their views on Derrybrien.</p></speech>

Senator Higgins made the point that sometimes people are not listened to.  My understanding is that the planning officer who visited Derrybrien was highly supportive of the project.  I did not speak to the lady myself so I cannot be 1000% certain of that but my understanding is that she was supportive, that she brought that view back to her bosses but that nobody was listening and nobody wanted to listen.  The message came back that the environmental impact assessment had not been carried out, that was it, it was bad news and let us not touch it.  The ESB gave the same message that it was bad news and let us not touch it.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Boyhan, is correct and Councillor Donohue invited me to come and look at the site.  I went there and spoke to business people; people in Loughrea; and people in the surrounding area.  I could only find two people who want this shut down.  When we shut it down, I do not think they know what they want to do with it.  It cannot be brought back to where it was; it is not possible.  Bureaucrats somewhere have looked at the paperwork behind this project but none of them have visited it.  If we are going to find ourselves subjected to massive fines, out of the &euro;17 million we paid in fines surely to God they could have transported a few of them over to have a look at the site before they made a final decision on it.  We are being caught in bureaucratic bind here.</p> <p>It is not always the case that environmental and financial concerns are mutually exclusive.  Sometimes they run hand in hand together and I do not accept the fact that by putting finance in there in some way we diminish what we are trying to do.  It is about making sure that steps are taken, that they are taken in the correct manner and the entire perspective must be taken on board.  We must not only look at the micro level but we must look at the macro level as well and see what is there.  I can find nobody in the west of Ireland who wants anything to happen to Derrybrien other than for it to produce electricity, which is what it was built for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#VVV00300"><p>I want to briefly respond to what Senator Higgins quoted from the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  I fully accept that you cannot have a situation where people benefit from ignoring the law and they get a slap on the wrists and that is it.  However, there has been a poverty of imagination as to how we should deal with the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  It was possible for us to enact special legislation to deprive the developers of the benefit, to take it into community or national ownership and to somehow extract any benefit whatsoever from the people who breached the law.  By the same token we could compensate the community for the absence of compliance with the law by depriving those people of the benefit of it.  I wonder whether anybody has asked if we can bring in a special Derrybrien Bill and state that this wind farm will be vested in X or Y, that the original developers will be deprived of the value of their investment and that the State, the community or Galway County Council will be the beneficiary of the commercial value of what has happened.  The destruction of the wind farm could be avoided in this way.</p> <p>Let us be clear about another matter.  The Minister of State's party, the Green Party, is a champion of wind energy and there are ambitious programmes for offshore and onshore wind energy.  Prior to the last election, every Member of this House was bombarded with what I consider to be misconceived propaganda against wind farms across the country.  The propaganda purported that wind farms caused everything, from every disease and psychological trauma you could imagine to every damage to flying birds and all the rest that you could imagine.  Looking at my in tray on my emails, I got tired of this constant bombardment from what I considered to be misconceived hostility to wind energy.  Most of us would prefer to see all the turbines placed 40 miles out in the Atlantic, where we cannot see them, and most of us would prefer to have them on somebody else's mountains, hills or bogs but let us remember that the transformation that is envisaged by 2030 and 2050 is a process.  I have mentioned toothpaste and tubes and there will be some damage to the environment.  I have no doubt that in the next five or ten years somebody will come out and say that valuable migratory routes for this whale or that whale may or may not be endangered by offshore wind installations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have no doubt that this is going to happen, and I have no doubt that there are people who will find snails and all sorts of lichens and things like that on the sites of virtually anything that is done.<br/><br/>One must break eggs to make an omelette.  In the context of the radical revolution to which the State has committed itself in the context of energy generation, the transformation in the kinds of energy we use, and the way in which it is generated, all of that is going to have some environmental consequences.  One cannot, therefore, have the purist ideological view and say that because a breach of European law took place, there is absolutely nothing that the State can do about it.  If this had happened somewhere in Spain, Denmark or elsewhere in Europe, I fancy that the relevant legislature would have responded by saying &quot;Right, this is a real mess&quot;.  We have had to pony up &euro;17 million in fines.  The courts have fined the perpetrators a total of &euro;2,500, which is ridiculous.  In these circumstances, rather than remediation and a refusal of substitute consent, there is a legislative route to deprive the developers of what they have done and, at the same time, not to just simply fly in the face of common sense by ordering the destruction of turbines and the entirely futile project of trying to return this bogland to the state it was in before.  The bog slide happened before the development took place.  I hope that somebody is listening to this.<br/><br/>Legislation could be drafted and passed now to say that we are not going to knock this down, that we are going to dispossess the developers of the benefit of it, and that we are going to nationalise or communalise the facilities there in order to minimise the disruption of the environment that would be involved with further works at the site.  This would help the much bigger, broader and more noble cause of reaching our energy targets in a sensible way.<br/><br/>I take on board what Senator Higgins said to the effect that we cannot reward people, that we cannot give people a slap on the wrist and that we cannot allow people to have the benefit of what they have done.  However, we are the community and we are still a sovereign State.  I do not believe that the European Court of Justice would rule it unlawful for Ireland to say that the community at large wants to dispossess the developers of their wind turbines and to preserve those turbines <i>in situ</i>on the basis that this is the best way to remedy the damage that has already been done to the environment and the damage that was done to the community by the circumvention, albeit innocent, I believe, by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and others by their failure to demand an environmental impact assessment.<br/><br/>In that spirit, I really believe there is a way out of this mess.  There is a European Court of Justice decision and we cannot reverse that.  There is the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision from which there is no appeal unless somebody could bring a judicial review.  I do not believe, however, that this is possible.  There is the alternative route.  While I may not be the Attorney General anymore, if I were, I would put my thinking cap on and I could draft legislation that would not impose an Alice in Wonderland piece of nonsense on us that would destroy infrastructure, which, as my colleagues have said, nearly everybody thinks should be there and generating electricity, simply to show that we should take European law seriously.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the Minister of State is aware of EnergyCloud, which is operating in the north east at the moment, with the assistance of SSE Airtricity and a number of other electricity suppliers.  EnergyCloud operates on the basis that wind turbines produce energy even when it is not required.  In the north east, they have come together to provide free hot water by way of a retrofit to the water heating system of local authority houses.  The people who get this are all living in social housing.  They get a credit on their ESB bills of some &euro;30 per month for consuming the electricity that has nowhere to go in the middle of the night.</p> <p>What Senator McDowell said makes absolutely perfect sense to me.  We have the capacity to generate electricity for 50,000 houses in Derrybrien.  As a nation, we are strapped at the moment because of the rising cost of energy.  We have a European energy crisis on our hands.  Could we not, as Senator McDowell asked, put legislation in place that would allow these turbines to be taken into State ownership and provide free electricity to those who need it?  We threw out &euro;200 each off our ESB bills to me and everybody else who did not need it.  Could we not use the energy coming to the 50,000 houses to provide free electricity to those living in social housing in the greater Galway area?  Would it not make more sense to do this than to tear down something that is working perfectly, that is operating at about 90% or 99% efficiency all of the time and that has an extraordinary crew of engineers that look after it?  Not one of those I met tried to save Derrybrien, because they had other areas they were looking at also.  They just gave me the cold hard facts as to what was being produced there.</p> <p>Senator McDowell has hit the nail on the head by suggesting that we step back from this, see if we can put legislation together and get it through this House as quickly as possible, not destroy a perfectly good generating system and not damage further what is already damaged by trying to put the toothpaste back into the tube.</p> <p>I implore the Minister of State to take on board our amendment, and to take what has just occurred in this House back to the Cabinet to say, "Guys, can we sit down and take another look at this?"  I ask the Minister of State to do that.</p></speech>

Senator McDowell's proposals are certainly very interesting and imaginative.  If there was the prospect of nationalisation and community ownership of badly planned developments, it would be an example of a disincentive to poorly planned developments.  It would probably be far more effective than accompanying fast-tracking of development as set out in the Bill.  The proposal would be an example of the kind of imaginative solution that would create the context, we would hope, where it is an absolute exception that environmental standards are not set, and where they are not set the risk would not be carried by the environment or the public.  The risk would be carried by the developers in that context, rather than there being the risk of benefit and the risk of perverse incentive.  It is a very interesting example, and it is certainly the kind of thing that would encourage many developers to get ecologists in and environmental impact assessments done as early as possible.  It is a very interesting proposal in that regard.</p> <p>One does not have to wait until the future, I am saying it now: the migratory patterns of whales do matter.  However, this does not mean that we do not do these things.  It is a matter of how they are done.  A whale's migratory pattern, by its nature, is time bound.  In that context, there are issues as to what time of year you are leading off on building activity, seismic activity and sonar activity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I say this as a member of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  Advocates from Wind Energy Ireland recently appeared before the committee and spoke extremely passionately about their desire for there to be more ecologists and environmental impact officers, as well as collected State data regarding the marine environment, in particular, so we do not have every single company going out and having to do a new data set but that we actually have useful national data in terms of our marine habitats that is available and reliable and can be used.</p><p>They also very interestingly, and this was not prompted by anyone in the committee, this is what they brought to us, wanted environmental NGOs to be better resourced in order that there was feedback and things came in early, and so that they had projects they could be confident would work because they are making huge investments.  Again, that was the message from them.</p><p>I think there are some signs that industry has learned from Derrybrien in that regard.  It would be better for the State to start offering the industry what it is actually looking for, which is more resources around the environmental impact assessment and more access to appropriate data, rather than the kinds of fixes we have become too used to in Ireland.  I am not speaking specifically to the Derrybrien project now.  I am talking about the possibilities under this legislation whereby instead of having two chances to catch a problem at local authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la level, we may have a risk now that new projects on adjoining sites attached to any previous projects may only get one chance really to be caught.  This is at An Bord Plean&aacute;la level which, again, is a board that has one ecologist among its 60 inspectors.  We should actually listen to what the big wind energy producers told us in the committee what they want to see, which is a better process into the future - not just a quicker process but a better process because that is quicker in the long run.</p></speech>

I appeal to the Minister of State to actually listen to Senator McDowell.  He has significant experience in Cabinet having been Attorney General.  When he speaks about these things, he tends to know what he is talking about.  What he is saying makes absolute sense and perhaps the Minister of State might reflect on it.  That is the idea behind this Chamber, which has successfully amended many pieces of legislation over the years.</p> <p>I have been here more than 11 years now.  I remember even in my first Seanad, when the Government had a whopping majority, Senator Sean Barrett at the time tabled many amendments that the Government accepted because they made absolute sense.  Therefore, listening to Senator McDowell and, indeed, Senators Boyhan and Craughwell, speaking on this issue, I think they make much sense.  I would appeal to the Minister of State to maybe reflect and take on board what they are saying and buy into the ethos of what the Seanad Chamber is, which is a Chamber that improves legislation and often results in clouds of common sense coming down to situations that may not have been shrouded in common sense before.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#XXX00300"><p>Before I come back in on the scripted response, I will raise a couple of quick points.  Senator McDowell is always a rock of sense and he always makes sensible points.  Specifically, I will not make any reference to the Derrybrien case particularly.  It is subject to an ongoing planning enforcement and I am not going to give any feedback specifically in relation to it.  I will just say that the Irish State is engaging separately on it with the European Commission regarding the fines.  I think we had somewhat conflicting approaches from Senators Higgins and McDowell around the issue.  This proposed legislation is being designed to comply with the legal cases referred to by Senator Higgins.  Separately, I think site remediation on projects like that is also an enforcement matter on which I cannot comment.</p> <p>Comments were made by Senator Higgins regarding other elements that could impact negatively on the environment such as peat extraction and forestry.  As an aside to this, the Attorney General is involved in a review of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has initiated a review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la separately, so those are important processes.</p> <p>I will note too that any relevant planning authority in a substitute consent case provides a report on a proposal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The planning authority's views are taken into consideration along with the public's views, and exceptionality is at the heart of the substitute consent process.  The public are, therefore, fully involved.  Senators Boyhan and Higgins both raised the issue of the Aarhus Convention and public participation, and I would agree.  It is something about which I feel very strongly and that is something we should cherish.  The ability of the public to be involved in such processes is critically important.  The public are fully involved in the substitute consent process as per the Aarhus Convention.</p> <p>The last point I will make is specifically in relation to the points that were made around offshore energy and the impact potentially on biodiversity.  Development, be it wind energy or whatever it is, cannot be at the expense of biodiversity.  That is why we have a Maritime Area Planning Bill and why we are bringing in marine protected areas.  It is critically important that one cannot be at the expense of the other.  Again, I welcome the contributions of all the Senators in relation to this.</p> <p>Specifically then with regard to amendments Nos. 10 and 11 as tabled by Senators McDowell, Craughwell, Mullen, Boyhan and Keogan, which form part of the same suggested change to the operation of the Act, these proposed amendments to section 177E concern the application process for substitute consent and seek to include an additional clause to the effect that all applications for substitute consent must be accompanied by an independent review of the environmental, financial and community impact of the existing development, or the decommissioning of the existing development on lands under consideration.  While I understand the reasoning behind the proposed amendments, I am opposing them.  The suggested clause is superfluous with sufficient evidence already included as part of the independent planning process administered by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and of the various environmental impact reports that already form part of the substitute consent application.</p></speech>

There is also a measure, which is a key change, where there would no longer be a need to apply for leave to seek substitute consent before entering the process.  Again, we go from a situation whereby one has the courts as a filter in terms of whether applications met extraordinary criteria and so forth in terms of being allowed to apply for substitute consent.  Instead, one now has a situation whereby developers can meet the board before having to take a risk.  When the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage spoke to us he mentioned this huge risk that developers take in seeking substitute consent.  In fact, developers do not have to take that risk because before doing so they get to have a pre-application consultation with the board, although that is at the discretion of the board, on the proposed application.  Developers get a sense of what might happen before taking the step to seek substitute consent.  This is all in the context of another mechanism whereby local authorities could require an application for substitute consent.  Again, the option whereby the substitute consent process could be initiated by a local authority has been removed.  The initiation for the substitute consent process now sits with the developer but the developer can have a pre-meeting to get a sense of how things might be before taking a risk.  I am unclear about the following.  If we have situations where there are improper developments whereby a developer does not seek substitute consent, for example, if there is a pre-meeting with the board following which a developer chooses not to seek substitute consent, then it is not clear what mechanisms kick into place.  What is the process in those situations?  Do we move towards removal or demolition at that point if we are not trying to find a way forward in terms of substitute consent?</p> <p>I am concerned about the amendments to section 177E in section 13.  I am also concerned about the gaps in the process in terms of a lack of public mechanisms to initiate requirements for substitute consent.  I do not know whether the Minister of State can inform me about what will be addressed or whether this will be addressed elsewhere.  It is in that context that I oppose section 13.</p></speech>

I have been informed by a text, which is an amazing thing, that Galway County Council, on 25 April 2022 passed a resolution on the following terms: "Galway County Council calls on the Government to direct the ESB to recommence operation of the Derrybrien wind farm and in doing so, provide whatever legislative requirements that are necessary to ensure it may not be legally contested.&rdquo;  That motion was proposed by Councillor Geraldine Donohue and seconded by Councillor Joe Sheridan.  The idea of taking a legislative initiative is not just mine but also that of the local authorities involved.  They share my view of the matter.</p> <p>Obviously on Report Stage I cannot table the same amendment that we have just deal with.  However, it is my intention to table an amendment that makes provision, as part of the whole structure of how we respond to a situation, where substitute consent would be required as matter of European law but has regard to the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union on this matter.  Provision should be made by legislative initiative in the form of legislation where that legislation recites that undoing the development, so to speak, is disproportionate and would cause further damage, and where it is possible to deprive, by legislation, the wrongdoing developer of the benefit of non-compliance with European law some avenue must be opened so that instead of going through the process of simply demolishing, or attempting to demolish, the development that has occurred.  I am not talking about giving the Minister the power to override it, but for the Oireachtas to deprive the developer of the benefit of the development but also to remove the possibility that the community and the environment will further suffer as a consequence of withholding a substitute consent so a different approach should be taken.  I am putting it on the record that I intend, arising out of the debate, to table amendments along those lines to try to bring some reasonableness to all of this.</p> <p>I appreciate very much the kind words that the Minister spoke.  We are in a little paddle boat that is sailing towards the Niagara Falls on this matter and something will happen.  Either this is going to be demolished or not.  I fully appreciate what the Minister said, that there are enforcement proceedings either in being or that could be in being and there is a planning process that may or may not be required and he feels constrained in what he can say about these matters.  However, common sense must have something to do with what we do in this country and in our Legislature.  We must, if we can at all, prevent another environmental and financial disaster, and prevent further damage being done to the environment, because we had not the breadth of imagination to think of different legislative responses to the situation that has arisen in Derrybrien.  </p></speech>

Currently, the Bill only applies to people whose births were illegally registered before 31 December 1980.  It is a deeply flawed decision to insert a date limit, as there is no evidence to suggest that illegal registrations ceased on 31 December 1980.  Any person illegally adopted outside this date limit might not be able to access his or her rights under the Bill.  The Bill should be amended to ensure that all affected persons subject to illegal birth registrations are included.  This has to do with the core principle that, if we are trying to move forward and make redress, we need to ensure that we are not piecemeal in our approach and that all relevant adopted persons are able to access their rights under the legislation, including those who were adopted overseas and those who were illegally adopted or whose adoptions involved illegal birth registrations after 1980.</p></speech>

Our amendment No. 2 seeks to address that concern by referring to someone who was "subject to an illegal birth registration".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That addresses one of the concerns the Minister raised on Committee Stage.</p><p>The Minister will be aware that at multiple points in the legislation "incorrect" is referred to.  We have not sought to amend each instance of this but to address these amendments in the most efficient way, which is by doing so within the definition of "incorrect".  Previously, at every point where "incorrect" was mentioned, we sought to add "or illegal".  I still think that would be a good practice but we have instead sought to specify "illegal" under the definition of "incorrect".  The Minister mentioned false information and so forth sitting under the definition of "incorrect" and the idea of illegal birth registration sitting under that definition would be a similarly efficient way to achieve that necessary goal.  </p><p>Amendment No. 2 puts "illegal birth registration" within the definition of "incorrect".  Amendment No. 25 is another attempt to do this.  I am conscious of how long and arduous this process is so these amendments have all sought to find the most efficient possible way to achieve the desired change.  Amendment No. 25 simply suggests that everywhere "incorrect birth registration" is referenced in the Bill, it shall be construed to also include "illegal birth registration".  That might be an efficient way in a single amendment to address a concern which the Minister will be aware that many across the House had in relation to the apology the Minister began this Bill with in this House.  He spoke about the illegality that people had been subjected to.  The desire of all of us in this House is that the illegality be acknowledged and we do not end up in legislation smoothing it into something like "incorrect", which does not carry the same weight or heft.  These would be simple ways to ensure the commitment to acknowledging and regretting illegality reflected in the legislation by the naming of illegality in relation to all provisions which relevant persons might access under this Bill.</p></speech>

I will speak to Nos. 1 and 2 first, then to Nos. 24 and 25.  Amendment No. 1 seeks to include illegal adoption in the definition of "adoption".  The insertion of these words is not necessary.  In any case where an adoption order issued, a person is considered to be an adopted person and therefore a relevant person under the Bill.  Amendment No. 2 proposes to include a person whose birth was illegally registered in the definition of "adoption".  This is unnecessary as such a person is already captured in the definition of a relevant person and can avail of all the services in the Bill.</p> <p>Senators may be aware that I brought an amendment to the definition of an "adopted person" on Report Stage to ensure clarity that any child born in Ireland and adopted abroad is included in the legislation.  I hope this clarification is reassuring to the Senators.  The definition of "adopted person" is drafted more broadly to ensure inclusivity.</p> <p>On amendments Nos. 24 and 25, we have had this discussion on Committee Stage.  Since taking office, I have been committed to addressing the issues that arise for people who have been the subject of illegal birth registrations and I have been leading the Government effort in that regard.  It has been a cross-Government effort.  There is input to the legislation from the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice to try to address the wide range of serious issues that persons subject to an illegal birth registration have faced.  We have brought forward some innovative and bespoke mechanisms to deal with that.  I have always wanted to deal with the situation that those subject to illegal birth registration have faced but I have been clear in recognising the illegality of what they faced and I did so in the apology speech.</p> <p>This Bill contains ground-breaking measures to ensure the release of comprehensive information, including details of persons involved in an illegal birth registration.  It provides assurance on contracts entered into by affected persons and addresses inheritance and succession issues which arise for such persons.  It provides for an accurate birth registration and ensures choice and certainty in terms of the identity by which an affected person chooses to live.</p> <p>There is a good reason that I cannot accept these amendments which seek to alter the definition of "incorrect birth registration" to include the reference to "illegal".  I understand the thinking behind the amendment and accept the Senators, in a similar approach to Deputies, have tried to work with the language in the Bill to find a way to include the term "illegal".  It is a genuine attempt to reflect the experience of those impacted by illegal birth registrations and, in some cases, their expressed wishes.  I asked my officials to engage with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on this issue but it has not been possible to achieve it in a legally sound and accurate way that would not require the State to set the standard of illegality and the burden of proof, even when we use the phrase "incorrect or illegal".</p> <p>In my efforts to address these issues and concerns, I brought forward two changes in the D&aacute;il to section 2, the definitions section, and section 54(11)(a).  That was the insertion of the phrase "as a result of the giving of information that was false or misleading".  I have made an effort to recognise the falsity and duplicity behind the provision of information in these cases.  I do not believe we are smoothing over anything.  We have looked at the issue of using the terms the Senators suggested and it has not proved possible.  With all due respect and recognising what the Senators are doing, I am not in a position to accept amendments Nos. 24 and 25.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 9 deals with it in the interpretation section of the Bill.  This relates to medical information more widely and the crucial issue of vaccine trials.  We had extensive discussion of this on Committee Stage, including engagement from Senator Boyhan and others.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Amendment No. 9 would amend the definition of medical information in the interpretation of the Act by specifying that "medical information" means all of the medical records and any information which relates to one's medical history.  Again, medical information in this amendment is relating to a person's medical history but it is a little bit ambiguous.  I am trying to look at strengthening it to make sure people are entitled to all their medical information and so that you do not get a piecemeal or selected piece of medical information coming through.</p><p>One place where this is important is addressed in amendments Nos. 10 to 13, inclusive, in specific cases of information as to whether a person was the subject of a vaccine trial.  In the Bill there are references to whether one is vaccinated but it is quite a different thing to know whether one was vaccinated versus knowing whether one was part of a vaccine trial.  That is different information.  Vaccines are important and it is important to know what vaccines you have and what vulnerabilities you have but knowing you were part of a vaccine trial is an important part of knowing your story, what has happened to you and what you may have been subjected to.  When we discussed this the Minister mentioned that he had concerns that other information cannot be shared which may be sensitive, including information on vaccine trials.</p><p>I was highlighting a particular point then and I want to highlight that again in these amendments, including in Nos. 11 and 13 in the way I have worded them.  No. 11 is a material alternative to No. 10 and No. 13 is an alternative to No. 12.  In the cases of both Nos. 11 and 13 I have added the phrasing of "relevant information in respect of any such trial".  I am not saying that every single private record to do with a trial will be made available to every person who was subject to such a trial but it is relevant that you know, not just that you were vaccinated but that you were vaccinated as part of a trial.  There could be key and relevant information.  For example, if the institution in which you were resident formed a contract with a particular pharmaceutical company in its access to you and your peers for the purposes of a trial and if a particular medication was developed off the back of that, then that is relevant information.  That information should be part of what is covered in letting people know their medical information.  It is their human rights and personal story information.</p><p>The Minister will see that in good faith I have sought, in Nos. 11 and 12, to insert a phrase that makes this clear: "relevant information in respect of any such trial".  If, in the case of No. 11, the Minister feels that including "relevant information in respect of any such trial" still proves to be an obstacle, then No. 10 simply states: "whether he or she was the subject of any vaccine trials".  Amendment No. 10 will simply tell people if they were part of a trial and No. 11 will tell them, in more detail, the relevant information around that trial.  Amendment No. 12 is on a medical or medicinal trial and it widens the scope from vaccine trials alone if other trials are issues.  Amendment No. 13 is similar to No. 12.  Amendment No. 4 states: "including records of those administered for the purposes of a medical or medicinal trial".  In those amendments I am trying to widen the Bill so that we might capture things that might emerge that are not solely to do with vaccine trials but with other forms of trials that may have taken place.  That seeks to provide the widest possible scope.</p><p>I hope the Minister can consider these amendments.  I have listened carefully to the concerns he raised on Committee Stage and I have sought to alleviate them in these amendments.  I again remind the Minister of the strong support that many in this House had for the desire to ensure there would be clarity and that persons would know if they had been part of a trial.  I hope the Minister can find some of these amendments acceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#EEEE00200"><p>I have spoken at great length over many years on these vaccine trials and it would be remiss of me not to do so today.  I shared with the Seanad in recent weeks that I have done an extensive interview with the BBC covering this issue that will be broadcast.  There has been some update on it in the last two weeks and I understand it will be broadcast in early July, which the BBC has confirmed to me and I am conscious that the footage of these Seanad deliberations will form part of that.</p><p>I want to reiterate that where children were in State care and where the State or its agents were <i>in loco parentis</i>they had obligations.  We know of extensive investigations and litigation, to which I am party, on these alleged drug trials.  We know that the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Health, commissioned Dr. Kiely, the then Chief Medical Officer, to do a preliminary investigation.  We subsequently have sourced some additional information and a number of universities in Dublin were involved in that.  We have no doubt that these drug trials took place; we are 100% satisfied of that and we have evidence to this effect.  The <i>British Medical Journal</i>published the results of these vaccine trials so it is not news to the Department of Health or the Taoiseach, who was Minister for Health for some of the period when the investigations were ongoing, not when the trials were ongoing.</p><p>There has to be some mechanism where the State or its agents or institutions were aware and had on record that the vaccine trials took place on children, not necessarily because they were unwell but because there were many of them on the same diet in the same conditions in the same institution.  In some cases many of them did not go out to school either so they had no access to the community.  Where that happened it is imperative that there should be some record.  Where records are held - and the Minister said before that there may not be records in certain places - that should form part of the information that is made available to those individuals or their families.  It is critical that we do that.  We do not know to what extent they may or may not have been damaged by these vaccine trials but we know for sure that they were commercial trials and that their results have been published extensively.</p><p>That is all I am prepared to say at this point and I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to that.  I do not see why the Minister would be opposed to these amendments.  There may be technicalities and good reasons why it cannot happen in this legislation and I am open to listening to that.  I could not sit here in honesty and not raise the issue.  We know and the Minister and his officials know that vaccine trials took place in institutions.  Therefore, where the records clearly state that, I would like to see a situation where people, when they are accessing this information, can have sight of as much information as possible.</p></speech>

There is no disagreement on that and it is for that reason that I cannot accept these amendments.  They are unnecessary because the legislation before us provides comprehensively for the full release of medical records to an applicant.  I note that amendments Nos. 9 to 13 all seek to add the specific term "vaccine trials" into the definition of "medical information".</p> <p>We debated this important matter on Committee Stage and I am happy to do so again.  Where someone was part of a vaccine trial, any information on that should and will, without doubt, be given to them under the existing draft legislation.  This is an essential fact that people need to know and it is a matter of great importance to the people who have been impacted by it.  I wish to put on record again that vaccine trials and vaccinations given are fully provided for under the definition of "early life" and are comprised in the definition of "medical information".  Vaccinations are a person's medical history.  These areas are captured under two headings: early life information; and medical information.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These areas are captured.<br/><br/>Some of the amendments also seek to include the word &quot;records&quot; in the definition of medical information.  On Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, I brought an amendment to the original Bill to ensure it is the record containing medical information that will be released to a relevant person.  Section 15 is the substantive section for the release of medical information.  Section 15(2)(a) states:</p><blockquote>	... a relevant body, on application to it<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />shall, to the extent that it is practicable to do so, provide the relevant person with a copy of the records ... that it holds that contain the medical information to which the application relates ... </blockquote><p>Similarly, I cannot support amendment No. 4, which would amend the definition of early life information.  The legislation already fully provides for the release of records related to medical treatment or procedure.  Paragraph (f) of the definition of early life information ensures that records on any medical treatments and procedures are provided to the person.  This will include medical or medicinal trials, which are the words this amendment seeks to insert into the definition.  I would again draw the Senator's attention to paragraph (f), which refers to &quot;information on any medical treatments, procedures or vaccinations administered to him or her&quot;.  I hope Senators are reassured that the Bill already achieves a full release of medical records and that such records will include records of vaccinations, vaccination trials and any medical trials.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#FFFF00200"><p>I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity on this, and I believe that release of information is certainly his intention.  However, we have to look at legislation and imagine how someone else might interpret it.  The paragraph (f) the Minister mentioned references vaccinations but it says "information on any medical treatments, procedures or vaccinations administered to him or her".  There is a distinction between someone receiving a vaccine and being part of a vaccine trial.  Many of the vaccines that were trialled went on to become successful vaccines that every child might benefit from but there is a difference between receiving a vaccination and being part of a vaccine trial.  I do not doubt the Minister's intention as to how "vaccinations" should be interpreted.  It is possible to interpret paragraph (f) to include information in respect of vaccine trials but I am concerned that it is also possible to interpret it in a way that would not include the information that that vaccination was received as part of a vaccine trial.</p> <p>The Minister may not be able to accept this amendment today but when we come to the regulatory phase and putting the Bill into practice, this is the kind of thing that will need to be monitored.  Perhaps greater clarity could be given through supplementary regulations or statutory instruments and so forth.  At the moment, while paragraph (f) allows for the interpretation the Minister wants, and which I and everyone else expect and want, it also allows for a narrower interpretation where people would simply be informed they had been given a vaccination for a particular condition and would not be told that it was part of a trial or some of the other relevant information in respect of the trials.  I accept the Minister's bona fides.  I hope this provision will be interpreted in the widest possible way.  If it proves not to be, I hope supplementary action will be taken through guidance to public bodies from the Minister if that is necessary.  However, as I would prefer the legislation to be crystal clear, I will have to press the amendment.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is seeking to cover this information up.  I know he is not but I would like this definition to be there hard and fast in this legislation.  I hope it will be there in the interpretation and the regulations.</p></speech>

Senator Higgins is making it look like I am wishing that this is what is going to happen, crossing my fingers and hoping.  The clear reading of these provisions is that it includes all elements of vaccination, including vaccinations and vaccination trials.  I accept that there is a difference between those things.  A vaccination may have been a legitimate and existing vaccine at the time while a vaccination trial is something we would have deep concerns about.  There are also medicine trial, where the medicine may not have been administered through an injection but orally or something like that.  I cannot read this section in the way the Senator has suggested it could be interpreted to rule those things out.  It would play havoc with the plain English reading of the Bill.  I am fully convinced that all these things are covered.</p></speech>

This amendment comes on the back of intense engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on this issue.  It shows that I and my officials are willing to engage and make improvements to the legislation where it is necessary and legislatively possible.  I am happy that this amendment will underpin the primary aim of this Bill to provide the release of as much information as possible to relevant persons.  I acknowledge that Senator Higgins raised this issue and brought amendments to similar effect.  I believe my amendment covers all the Senator's amendments, Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive.  As such, I hope she is reassured that I have listened and engaged with her amendments and that this matter has now been comprehensively addressed.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that he has engaged with us.  We had very extensive debate on this matter, not only on this section but as an example of a concerns regarding the general data protection regulation that came up in respect of other sections.  This is not something anybody lobbied me about.  From reading the Bill, I could see what the effect could be if people were told somebody had called and inquired after them, multiple times in some cases, but were not told their name.  They would know somebody had cared and reached out or had concerns about them but would not know who that was.  People take comfort from the smallest amount of information.  I acknowledge that the legislation already had good provisions in place for situations where people had left letters, pictures, mementos or documents.  For those who may not have left a physical memento, the fact of the call will be something.  I thank the Minister for listening to me on this issue.  It is the kind of thing that will give people a lot of peace, or even closure or understanding.  It will give them a stronger picture of their story.  The way the Minister has framed the amendment, the degree of the relationship to another person will be given where applicable, but that does not limit it solely to those who may be relatives.  In some cases, it was people who cared, neighbours or others who made inquiries and sought to help.  This amendment is good.  It will spare people distress.  I thank the Minister for bringing it forward and I will be happy to withdraw mine in light of it.  The Minister's amendment captures the issue quite well.</p></speech>

It is a sense of who they are, where they have come from and the relationship or lack of it with extended family.  It is always interesting when we see programmes on television tracing family history.  The interviewer might ask if the person would like to see a picture of their mother, father or aunt.  It is very powerful even though it might only be one picture, but it is so strong and important.  If there is a resemblance to the person within the picture, they hang on dearly to it.</p><p>I have heard about and spoken to many people who were not in contact with their families for many years.  Due to circumstances, a mother might have written and said she had to surrender her child and give it up.  The person who wonders why he or she was in State care for 16 years then see the mother did not consent.  There are files where a mother has been contacted many times by State agencies or the health board and said she was not prepared to surrender her child for adoption in the hope that her circumstances might change.  In some cases, we see that someone is sending literally a few shillings a month.  That demonstrates a commitment, love and affection on the part of the older person, yet circumstances kept these people apart.  That is all it was &ndash; circumstances.  If things had been different, they would have been very different.  They were different times.  I know so many people that have clung on to that little connection, the little gem that made them feel special and helped them many years later to understand and to overcome some of the reasons why they might have felt rejected, and also to help them understand the journey not only that they had to take but their parent or parents had to take.</p><p>The amendment is critically important.  I thank the Minister for taking it on board.  It is appreciated.</p></speech>

Specifically by deletion of the word "genetic", the items we talked about &ndash; the letter, photograph, memento or other object that may be of great sentimental importance - from non-genetic relatives would be included under this Act.</p> <p>I know there is a reason for genetic relatives being specified by the Act in terms of medical information, for example, because that is very relevant, but there has been an extension of the use of the term into areas whereby there would not be scope for any relative, be it a relative by marriage, adoption or otherwise, who having given a person mementos, letters, photographs or other documents, to have them shared with a relevant person.  That is the intention of amendment No. 14.</p> <p>Amendment No. 15 is another way of coming at the same issue.  I do not believe there is any bad intent in these aspects of the Bill, however, I think that it is more that a framing of "genetic relative" is being overextended.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have suggested the addition of the phrase "or other qualifying" relative be part of the definition of provided items.  We could delete the word "genetic" or add in the phrase "or other qualifying" relative".</p><p>Amendment No. 16 seeks to amend the definition of "relevant record" by deleting the provision that a relevant record "relating to a relevant person that contains birth information, early life information, care information or medical information" and so forth, including photographs or other images of his mother, father or genetic relatives should apply only to genetic relatives.  I am suggesting that this provision should apply to all relatives.  We had extensive discussion on the issue of the use of the term "genetic relative" as opposed to other relatives in this Bill on Committee Stage.  As the genetic information is the relevant part, at the time I urged that wherever possible and where medical information is not concerned, we endeavour to be as close as possible to the spirit of the Children and Family Relationship Act 2015.   The Children and Family Relationship Act is a seminal legislation which recognised that children have multiple relationships, and that the definition of family can be very wide.  It recognises all the forms of relationship that a child might have.  In respect of the cases relating to this Bill, we are talking about people who were children but are now adults.  I have sought to expand the framing of the term "genetic relative" where I believe the narrow definition does not need to be there and in order to be more in the progressive spirit of the 2015 Act.</p><p>Amendment No.17 follows the approach that I outlined in respect of amendment No. 14.  Instead of deleting the requirement for the relative to be a genetic relative, I am seeking to add the phrase "or other qualifying" relative.  Amendment No. 18 seeks to amend the definition of a relevant record relating to communications from relatives by deleting the provision that it only applies to genetic relatives.  I am seeking to broaden it in order that it applies to all relatives.  Again, there may be cases where a non-genetic relative has communicated with a person in an institution or has exercised care in relation to a person in an institution.  In discussions with Senator Boyhan and others, examples were cited such that of an aunt by marriage, who is not a genetic relative, taking interest in and engaging with a child.  Amendment No. 19 seeks to do the same thing, namely, to add "or other qualifying" relative.  Amendment No. 20 seeks to amend the definition of relevant record relating to communications from relatives by deleting the provision that it only applies to genetic relatives and to broaden it.  Similarly, amendment No. 21 is an alternative to that.  I had sought to remove the references to "genetic relative" in general as being narrow in how it was framed.  The Minister made the case well and quite strongly on Committee Stage that, for example, in relation to medical information, it was very relevant.  I have tried to go through those parts of the Bill where the phrase "genetic relative" is used as a frame.  Where I think it is not necessary to confine something, I have proposed amendments.  These amendments are all related to those other strands of the relationship, including the communications, relevant records and provided items, that are not tied to physical genetic information.  I have sought to expand the definition in those cases.  I acknowledge that there are cases in which the genetic relative limitation is an appropriate one but I believe that wherever possible, we should go for the more expansive understanding of relative.  I hope the Minister can take on board these proposals. </p></speech>

It is central to ensuring clarity and consistency in facilitating the release of these items.  It is important to note that the definition is specific that it covers items left by a genetic relative or another person involved in the provision of care of the relevant person.  I am confident, having spoken to those familiar with the files, that this definition will cover all items left to the relevant person.  While overwhelmingly these items will have been left by parents, there could be some from persons who cared for the child.  I make that comment in relation to amendments Nos. 14 and 15.</p> <p>On amendments Nos. 16 to 20, inclusive, on the relevant record, the definition of relevant record covers any record relating to the relevant person that contains birth, early life, care or medical information, or photographs.  Administrative records, such as admissions and discharge registers, visitors books, baptismal and confirmation records, and any other records containing personal information on the daily life of an individual are also relevant records.  Section 43 empowers the Minister to prescribe other classes of records as relevant records and bring them within the scope of the definition.  There is a forward-looking element to the legislation contemplated within section 43.  </p> <p>The Senator is seeking to change the references in the definition from "genetic" to "or other qualifying [relative]".  I cannot support that amendment, because the definition of the term "genetic relative" is expansive and inclusive.  It is also clearly defined.  The legislation requires a definition that is clearly defined.  Following debates on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and having listened to Deputies there, I brought an amendment to the definition, clarifying that any image of the relevant person, their parents or genetic relatives is to be safeguarded.  At that point the definition was revisited.  I am happy that the definition is fully encompassing and I do not believe that it needs to be amended further.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#JJJJ00300"><p>I recognise that the definition was somewhat expanded following the D&aacute;il debate.  I do not know that I share the confidence of the Minister's assertion.  A person involved in caring for a relevant person and a person involved in the provision of care of a relevant person are quite different.  Using the example I referenced earlier of the aunt by marriage, who may not be involved in the provision of care, but who cares for the relevant person.  It is a slightly different thing.  They are small nuances, but it is not quite the same thing.  However, on the definition of relevant records, I take comfort from the fact that the Minister has provided that the definition can be further expanded in the future.  I know that I seem to be looking to worst-case scenario in each interpretation, but that is because people have experienced the worst, the narrowest and the most obstructive and obtuse interpretations on their journeys to accessing information.  While there is now discussion of a sea change, a change in attitude and so forth, we nonetheless must acknowledge that the experience that people have had is getting the minimum.  That is why, with every amendment, I am proposing to try to expand definitions.  It is because we want to ensure that people are armed with legislation that enables them to access information, rather than them having to rely on goodwill and on a positive and expansive interpretation of the legislation by whatever individual they may be engaging with.  As I said, I am not fully convinced on the issue of a person who has cared for a relevant person and a person who has been involved in the care of a relevant person.  However, I note the Minister's point on the provision for the potential expansion of the definition of relevant records.  I ask the Minister to indicate if that is something he will be monitoring.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Does the Minister plan to come back on that question?

This is again about the definitions of what might constitute a secondary source under the legislation.  The current list of secondary sources includes registered adoption societies or accredited bodies, but we know that many religious orders played a key role in the facilitation of adoptions.  Indeed, when we look at some of the other issues we have discussed, such as, for example, vaccine trials, and some of the economic exploitation sadly associated with Ireland's history in this area, there may be relevant information within religious orders.</p> <p>The Bill provides that the Minister may prescribe additional sources as secondary sources where he believes those sources may have a relevant record in their possession.  This again relies on the understanding that future Ministers will share the same position, understanding or orientation in that they will want to access information.  That is the case with the current Minister.  However, there is no guarantee that future Ministers will invoke their powers in that way.  In fact, Ireland has a history of indemnity and of shielding religious orders from accountability, public pressure and public outrage.  In many cases, there has been a failure in that regard.  We see it still in the ongoing issue arising from the fact that many religious orders have failed to contribute their portions under the necessity to make proper and appropriate reparation or contributions to redress.  There is a lack of confidence here.  It is too weak a measure for us to rely on the discretion of future Ministers in respect of ensuring that relevant religious orders are brought under the remit of secondary sources.  That is why I believe relevant religious orders should be named in the legislation as a secondary source.  There may then be a discretion for the Minister as to which bodies constitute relevant religious orders but at least it creates a greater pressure in that regard.</p> <p>The Minister expressed concern that a similar amendment we submitted on Committee Stage was too specific because I included in it particular religious orders.  This updated amendment gives a degree of discretion to the Minister in determining which are relevant religious orders.  It does not give discretion to the Minister as to whether religious orders may be considered secondary sources.</p> <p>The Minister is aware that I feel strongly about amendment No. 23.  It states that relevant psychiatric institutions should be included in the list of secondary sources.  The current list of secondary sources only includes registered adoption societies and accredited bodies despite the fact that we know psychiatric institutions were part of an architecture of control.  Those institutions were one of the means through which mothers were disappeared in order to stop them potentially obstructing adoptions and so forth.  We know that psychiatric institutions were part of the set of dangers, threats and pressures visited upon women by the State.  I have previously given distressing examples of women who were effectively institutionalised in post-natal distress and left in certain psychiatric institutions in this State for the rest of their lives.  Relevant psychiatric institutions should be included in the list of secondary sources.</p> <p>I have included the phrase "deemed relevant by the Minister" in the amendment and have thereby given discretion to the Minister in that regard.  I know he may not accept these amendments but I am continuing to mark these points because as I said, I am not satisfied with what is included because we cannot see what may happen down the line.  Frankly, I do not believe that another Minister will bring these institutions into the fold.  This has been a difficult area on which to engage.  The Minister has engaged in this very difficult discussion.  We need to be as strong and clear as possible to ensure that every potential source of information is named.  If they are not named in this legislation, we need them named and identified by the Minister during his term in office so that we have as comprehensive and extensive as possible a reach into the sources of information.</p> <p>The Minister will be aware of the age of many of the people affected by these issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If he cannot accept these amendments, I urge the Minister, subsequent to the passing of the legislation, to review the issue of secondary sources and not leave it to individuals to have to force the issue of making their case and having individual battles for information, and, in fact, ensure that the State will take the lead in trying to proactively identify such sources.  For example, if other institutions and religious orders emerge and are named in documentation that will come through the already named secondary sources, and if psychiatric institutions are named on a regular basis in the kinds of documentation that will come from the already prescribed secondary sources, I ask that the list of secondary sources is appropriately expanded as quickly and as promptly as possible.</p></speech>

It is important to note the list of secondary information sources already includes a person prescribed under section 43(2).  That is something that can be done through statutory instrument.  There are also wider mechanisms within Part 7 which provide that even where a person is not designated as an information source, records can still be taken in by the State.  I am confident that where relevant records are held by a religious order or psychiatric institution, they can be transferred to the AAI.</p> <p>The Bill has been carefully drafted with certain overlaps to ensure all scenarios we can envisage are catered for.  It has been my determined approach in progressing this legislation that it should be flexible and should support timely release of the records of which we are aware, with the ability to capture additional records that we become aware of over time.  It is very important that the legislation is feasible in the context of rapid implementation and allows for the further processing of information sources through ministerial powers in a future-focused manner.  The section that empowers a Minister, present or future, to prescribe additional information sources is section 43(2).  The list currently included in the published Bill was carefully considered through consultation with stakeholders and organisations currently operating in the area of adoption, information release and tracing.</p> <p>Section 46 already provides a catch-all requirement for any person or organisation in possession of a relevant record to safeguard it and to inform the authority that it holds the relevant record.  Section 48 is also very relevant in this regard.  It clearly sets out to whom and in what circumstances the adoption authority can issue a direction and, importantly, section 48(1)(b) states that a direction may issue to: "a person, other than an information source, who is in possession of a relevant record (whether [or not] such [a] person made a request under section 47 or not)."  Again, that is a broad provision.  This means the authority can direct the transfer of a relevant record from any person, regardless of whether that person wants the record to be transferred.  That point is particularly important in respect of the Senator's allusion to the potential for bad faith actors.  In addition, section 48(6) obliges the authority, when issuing a direction, to give consideration to any indication that a record may be at risk.</p> <p>Should the authority become aware of a relevant record held by any person, I am confident that it can take that record.  In particular, if the authority considers the record to be at risk, for example, of being lost or destroyed, it can take that record.  These sections will work in tandem with the Minister's ability to prescribe information sources to guarantee the relevant records will be safeguarded and can be transferred.  Therefore, I believe what the Senator is seeking to do can already happen within the provisions of the Bill.</p> <p>As I said during our previous discussion, if it is in any way helpful, mechanisms are there to understand and get an assessment of the practical implementation of the legislation.  It is there through the implementation group, although that could be a little high level in the context of what the Senator talked about, but the stakeholder reference group is also important.  These will be people who will look for information, use it, and will probably be very well networked in with others who are in the same situation.  Certainly, as long as I am in this role, if I believe a clear blockage has been identified, I will act and use the powers under secondary legislation.</p></speech>

I am glad those flexibilities have been built in.  I would like the Bill to be stronger and have flexibility, but I recognise that at least the capacity is there within the flexibilities to strengthen things.  I will add that in addition to the ongoing mechanisms, and engagement with stakeholders and others over the next period, that myself and others in the Oireachtas will also want to know what patterns have emerged and how things have moved.  I am sure the Minister will be willing to engage with us, for example, in 12 months' time so we can see what we hope will only be a very small number of bad scenarios we have outlined as potential scenarios that may unfold and, if they have, can be identified and addressed.</p> <p>Senator Dolan's point is very interesting.  It would be worth clarifying if institutions are covered by the HSE.  It is something I might follow up on, separate to this debate, because it would be useful to persons who are affected by that issue.  In that context, I will probably not press the second amendment.  However, I will go ahead and press the first.</p></speech>

I have a concern I indicated to the Minister, which is that the Bill at present provides that the Minister may: "provide for the insertion in the schedule of any institution that was established or operated for the purpose of providing care to children in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body has or had a regulatory or inspection function."  Again, I just want to ensure that nothing falls out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For example, there were gaps during those periods when there were not proper legal practices in adoptions.  Informal bodies operating between institutions were also involved in adoptions.  I do not believe that the provision in this amendment will be needed much, but I wish to ensure that everything is in place.  My amendment seeks to clarify that the Minister can provide for the insertion in the Schedule of any institution regardless of whether a public body had a regulatory or inspectorial function over it.  This is meant to ensure that there are no gaps and that bodies that were involved in the care of children but were not subject to regulation or inspection by a public body do not fall outside the remit of this legislation or that the Minister might be blocked from addressing them.</p><p>The Minister indicated his confidence that there would almost always be a situation where a public body had a regulatory or inspectorial function regardless of whether it exercised that function effectively, but I wish to expand this provision.  It is better to have it and not need to use it than to need it and not have it.  I am leaving the section largely as is and only adding the simple phrase "regardless of whether".  I do not know why we should not insert a more expansive framework to give us that scope.  The layers of the architecture involved are only coming out into the light now.  They were around for a long time.  Consider how long it took us from the point that cases of illegal adoptions from St. Patrick's Guild were flagged to when we began dealing with the issue.  Neither the Minister nor I have a full sense of the architecture that existed in the illegal adoption and inappropriate care of children.  This amendment would widen the Bill a little and give the Minister, or a future Minister, the powers instead of having to seek them at later point.</p></speech>

When drafting this legislation, I wanted to ensure that it was as broad and encompassing as possible while ensuring that the definitions and parameters included in it were strong enough to be sound legislatively and would not inadvertently introduce sweeping powers.</p><p>Section 5 reads: &quot;The Minister may ... provide for the insertion in the <i>Schedule</i>of any institution that was established or operated for the purpose of providing care to children&quot;.  This term was carefully considered at the time.  The section requires that the institution must have been subject to a regulatory or inspectorial function by a public body.  I was assured by the drafters that this was sufficiently broad and that, regardless of whether an inspection took place, the institution would still have been subject to a regulatory or inspectorial function.</p><p>The question of broadening this provision was raised at a technical briefing that I delivered earlier in the process and to which Members were invited.  I made the point that, if someone could provide me with an example of an institution that was not covered by this definition, I would be happy to examine the matter again, but I have still not been provided with a concrete example of what is missing.  Senator Higgins has speculated that something like that could or would be the case, but if we are to move towards the very broad power that she is proposing, which carries little constraint on what sort of body could be registered in the Schedule by me or future Ministers, then we need at least some indication of what is being talked about.  I have not heard any yet.  While I accept the Senator's point about the architecture being revealed, I believe that the specific institutions are known at this stage and that the term &quot;regulatory or inspection function&quot; covers them.</p><p>It is important to remember what the Schedule is about.  It is a catch-all for someone who was in an institution for a time but who does not fall within the broad definition of &quot;relevant person&quot; because he or she was not adopted from the institution, subject to an illegal birth registration from it or subject to a boarding out from it.  We did not have this provision in the Bill originally, but some came forward and gave the example of a person who was born in a mother and baby home, spent a number of years there with his or her mother and subsequently left with her.  The person was not boarded out, subject to an illegal birth registration or ever adopted.  But for this Schedule, that person would not be able to use the provisions of this Bill.  We included it to catch such cases.  Being a &quot;relevant person&quot; - an adopted person - is enough to qualify someone under this Bill.  A person does not have to have been in one of the institutions listed.  There was some confusion in this regard, so I wish to put the situation on the record a final time.</p><p>A future Minister or I can add to the list types of body that are subject to a &quot;regulatory or inspection function&quot;.  This encompasses all relevant institutions within the architecture that we have discussed to date.</p></speech>

He is right, in that including a Schedule that could be expanded was a step forward.  There was considerable frustration about which institutions were being examined or reviewed.  We recall the battle fought by those who had been in Bethany Home to get acknowledgment from the State of their experience and to have their circumstances examined properly.  I acknowledge the Schedule and the fact that it can be expanded to deal with other circumstances, which is a step forward.</p> <p>In light of the Minister's response, I will not press the amendment.  He has made the case and I do not have the examples for which he asked.  However, I know that I do not have a full sense of the situation either.  This is generally why I am pushing for the expansion, but I acknowledge the potential for expansion by the inclusion of a Schedule that can be added to.  It is a big step forward from the very frustrating discussions on how only a handful of institutions were covered previously.  I hope that nothing falls through the cracks but that, if it does, it will be identified through the mechanism that the Minister outlined.</p></speech>

Under the Bill, where a relevant body receives an application seeking a birth certificate but it does not hold that certificate, it would in writing and without delay inform the applicant of that fact.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My amendment No. 27 would slightly expand that.  One must imagine the physical experience of being written back to and told &quot;We do not have your birth certificate&quot;.  I believe it would be appropriate and constructive if when people receive the information that their birth certificate was not available &ldquo;&hellip;the Authority shall, in so far as practicable, provide the relevant person with a written statement which explains the absence of information within its possession in respect of their adoption and/or illegal birth registration, and provide information to the relevant person regarding the recourse and supports available to them in locating and interpreting this information.&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The same things happens in amendment No. 28 whereby if a person is told that the authority does not have the information then he or she would be told what to do next, and that this is not the end of the line.  We discussed this on Committee Stage and I have tried to narrow it down a bit by saying &quot;in so far as practicable&quot; to provide written statements around the absences: was it a fire or was it that the authority never had it, for example.<br/><br/>The Minister rightly made the point that in some cases there will be no knowledge as to why that information is not there.  This amendment suggests that where there is knowledge a written statement would be provided.  The really crucial part of it is that a person would get information about the next steps available and what further recourse or supports are available.  If people have gone down the route of seeking the relevant birth information from the body they believed held the information, and if they hit a wall, where do they go next?  This amendment is so it is not simply &quot;No&quot;.  It is about making sure that people have that arrow.  The recourse they have may simply be access to go back to whatever other birth information may exist to them in another realm, or it may simply be recourse around counselling supports.  I do not know what other recourse there might be, and I have tried not to be prescriptive because I am aware that circumstances may be slightly different.  I want to ensure that people do not just get a disappointing letter that tells them there is no information about them, and if they are not getting the information they would also get a letter with some arrow to supports that might be available to them.  This is why I included &quot;further recourse and supports&quot; when dealing with the fact that there is no information about the person.<br/><br/>The other amendment in the grouping under discussion is amendment No. 32, which is the Minister's amendment.  I had not seen these amendments.  I was quite pleased with the other one.  The Minister is, in fact, addressing it.  That is great.  Let us see.  I thank the Minister for looking to this.  I will let the Minister explain his amendment.  I am looking at &quot;the right of a person to make an application under <i>Part 5</i>&quot;.  The Minister is giving two of the very specific next steps that may be available to a person.  This goes some way towards the concerns I have addressed.  I am delighted to see they are addressed.  My apologies.  I am afraid that I have only just seen the Minister's amendments now.</p></speech>

I want to touch on something Senator Higgins said.  We have said this all along, and in fairness to the Minister he has also said this continuously, that we must be terribly careful about how we manage people's expectations.  I heard Senator Higgins talk about information not being there.  If there is nothing there, there is nothing there.  We must just be upfront.</p> <p>There is a suggestion that there is information somewhere for everybody who was in institutional care.  There is not.  There are many reasons the information is not there.  In some cases it was destroyed.  Places moved on and people got rid of the stuff.  There was all sorts of motivation, good bad and indifferent.  That is the critical thing.  It is about the truth and it is about belonging.  We must meet it head on.</p> <p>The Bill is important, but also is how it is managed.  In fairness, the Minister has also said this.  How we manage this and the genuine expectation that people have is important.  We cannot, in any way, hype up some expectation and then say, "There was nothing there and now you need services".  Of course people need ongoing support.  By the very nature of their experiences there is a need for ongoing support and counselling services.  This must be tempered by a really upfront and honest approach.  In many cases there is simply nothing there.</p> <p>I have travelled this journey with so many people and they have found nothing there.  That is just a matter of fact.  This is one of the things that will ultimately be managed when the legislation comes into effect for how we manage that.  The Minister has said this and I have said it on a number of occasions.  We must be mindful of this.</p></speech>

I am confident that, in a scenario where records do not exist, strong supports will be made available to the person.</p> <p>Section 63(1)(b) already provides that the agency and the authority will support persons by helping to identify for them a relevant body that may hold records for them.  That provision is there already.  What I am proposing is in addition to that.  Amendment No. 32 builds on that spectrum of support and ensures that where records are not found, an applicant will be signposted to the other avenues to information provided for under this Bill.</p> <p>I did reflect on what Senator Higgins had said when we discussed this previously.  I am not providing for a statement of why there is not information because I do not believe this would be doable in the vast majority of situations.  I take on board the Senator's point that a message of "No information. The end". is not satisfactory.  This amendment provides for signposting to both the contact preference register and the tracing service.  I know that very little will remove the disappointment for some people when they find that there is no information, but with regard to our obligations to people and the best that we can do to help, notwithstanding the other provisions in the legislation, this at least shows them an ability to place themselves on the contact preference register, where there may be a potential for someone else to reach out to contact the person, and to use the basic service where proactively the person may be able to use that to start to re-establish those lost family links.</p></speech>

There is a piece around what happened and why the information is not there, and there is the piece around what happens next for the individual.  I believe that what happens next for the individual is probably the most important part.  I acknowledge that the Minister has at least given one route forward for the individual who receives that letter, with regard to the contact register and the tracing services.  This is a very positive measure.</p> <p>With regard to the other part as to what happened and why the information is not there, I understand that it may be difficult to say where it is in each individual case.  It is however important to note - and I say "note" because I am trying to put markers down for what we track in the next 12 months - that if certain bodies are repeatedly coming back to persons and saying, "We do not have the record and we do not have your records", and if certain people were in particular institutions, if there are multiple cases, and even for those who get referred by this mechanism to the contacts preference register or the tracing service, then there would be some investigation again, based on a collective concern.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan said some information may have been lost due to accidental reasons, good, bad or indifferent, but for those situations where there is a bad pattern in relation to information not being provided, there could be some gathering again.  The stakeholder forum and others is one way that this could be identified.  I just want to make sure that where we get the flag, it does not just happen for the individual and that patterns are identified and followed up.</p> <p>In that context, the mechanism may be there in the review mechanisms the Minister has already indicated for monitoring, if particular bodies are failing to a higher degree than others to provide persons with the relevant information.  As I have said, however, of the two halves of my amendments, the one that gives the individual somewhere to go next is probably the most important part.  In recognition that the Minister has provided for this to some degree in amendment No. 32, I will not press my amendment No. 27.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-14a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061400002#OOOO00300"><p>I move amendment No. 29:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 25, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:   	<b>&ldquo;Information relating to contact preference</b><br /><br /><b>17.</b>In every case where an applicant is provided under this Act with a birth certificate or copy of the records that contain the birth information to which the application relates, or with a statement setting out the birth information contained in those records, the Authority shall send to the applicant, by prepaid registered post or other recorded delivery, a statement by the Authority setting out, in so far as it has established in relation to each relevant parent, whether&mdash; <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	(a) he or she has not made a statement under section 38(11), <br /><br />(b) he or she has made a statement under section 38(11) that either of the following applies: <blockquote> 	(i) he or she is seeking to have contact with the applicant;<br /><br />(ii) he or she is willing to be contacted by the applicant,  </blockquote>(c) he or she has made a statement under section 38(11) that he or she is not willing to be contacted by the applicant, <br /><br />(d) he or she is deceased, <br /><br />(e) he or she is not willing to be contacted by the applicant.&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>We have had a very extensive discussion.  I am sure that the Minister will be aware that the committee, including my colleague, Senator Ruane, and others, have had very extensive discussion on the provisions around information relating to contact preference.</p><p>Amendment No. 29 seeks to delete section 17, as drafted, and substitute a new section, which would replace the mandatory information session with a registered letter that sets out the information regarding the contact person preferences of each relevant parent.  I am aware that similar amendments were put forward by the Labour Party on Committee Stage and discussed at that point.</p><p>Amendment No. 29 seeks to make it clear that access to birth certificates and other relevant information by relevant persons should be unconditional.  Again, unconditional because of this being their personal information in this context.  Section 17 currently provides that an applicant or relevant person must attend an information session with a designated person prior to certain information being released to them.  The nub of this matter for many people is that the information includes birth certificates.  Every other person in the State can access their birth certificate without an information session but persons who have experienced adoption, who are &quot;relevant persons&quot; under this Bill, must go through the extra tier of an information session while every other person does not.  People feel very frustrated as an extra obstacle has been placed in their way.  Having already been poorly treated by the State in many ways, people feel that the provision is a sustained inequality for them.</p><p>Compared with where we were a few years ago when I debated this legislation with the previous Minister there has been progress, which I acknowledge.  We have moved passed the presumption of a non-sharing of information and the idea of an automatic veto.  The current Minister has talked about replacing a physical information session with a phone call session but people still have a philosophical and fundamental concern about the idea of having access to one's personal information being conditional, and the fact that nobody else in society has that conditionality attached to their birth certificate.  There are questions concerning a phone call.  For example, how can we be certain that it is an authorised person and how does a person satisfy themselves about that aspect?  The registered letter was a solution suggested by members of the Oireachtas joint committee during pre-legislative scrutiny.  The suggestion has the advantage of ensuring that the information has arrived and been received, which to me is a constructive proposal.  As the Minister will be aware, this section is just a red line for many of the stakeholders and survival groups.</p><p>Amendment No. 31 states: &quot;Where a relevant person refuses, or is not in a position, to attend an information session&quot; and information regarding the contact person in terms of preferences of relevant persons &quot;shall instead be provided to the relevant person in writing through a registered letter&quot;.  The Minister did make a point about a similar amendment that I tabled.  In this scenario it would be a situation where the first measure is for persons to be asked &quot;to attend an information session&quot;.</p><p>For a person who has a very strong objection to taking part in an information session, he or she could request this as an alternative.  So in this scenario one has the engagement of the person in that sense and he or she requests that the information &quot;shall instead be provided to the relevant person in writing through a registered letter&quot;.  In my previous amendment on Committee Stage, the provision was not for a registered letter and the Minister pointed out that the amendment was inadequate.  Subsequently, I have combined the idea of a registered letter with a narrower pool of people covered by amendment No. 31, who are just those persons who specifically and explicitly state that they do not attend.  In that scenario, one would leave the information session as the main route but have an alternative that persons could seek, by request, which would be &quot;a registered letter&quot;.  The amendment includes the registered letter mechanism but as an option that must be sought.  So this amendment just addresses those who have a huge personal objection.</p><p>I hope that the Minister will consider amendment No. 31 as it is a constructive attempt to reflect some of his concerns and some of the ideas of the committee.  The amendment gives some option to those people who have particular reservations while leaving the proposal set out in the Bill as the norm in most cases.  Again, it would only be the people who have a principled objection or, indeed, have physical constraints who would seek to use this mechanism.</p></speech>

It is contact with the person involved, which is so crucial.  As the Minister has previously referenced here, there are concerns about whether one speaks to the correct person, and that the registered letter is not opened by someone in the house who may not be the person that the letter is directed to, which is the essence of why a phone call is crucial as a first step.  We must ensure that this matter is handled in a way that makes the person and his or her family feel that this method is being used to accommodate them as well.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 30 entirely removes or deletes it whereas amendments Nos. 29 and 31 seek to alter the mechanism.  At this point we have debated this Bill for 30 hours across the two Houses and a very significant proportion of that time has been spent on discussing this issue.  I recognise the very strong and deeply held views on this point.</p> <p>In terms of what I advocate, I must return to the points that I made in previous debates.  Irish law has for too long prioritised the privacy right of a parent over the right of an adopted person to his or her identity and this legislation seeks to reverse that approach.  In fact, this legislation entirely changes that approach by putting the protection of an individual's right to his or her identity at its very core so is a right to full and unredacted access to information in every circumstance.  I think everyone in this House has agreed that this is the right approach to take.</p> <p>Let me explain what happens in any situation when the Oireachtas decides to balance sets of rights of individuals and citizens, and in particular when it decides to balance constitutional rights, then a clear decision is taken to elevate one constitutional right over the other.  Let us be very clear that we are elevating the constitutional right of an adopted person to his or her identity over the right of a parent to retain his or her privacy by retaining anonymity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, that process of balancing needs to be set out in legislation.  The mechanism must be clear and must not entirely negate the right that is being made subordinate.  In this case the right to privacy of the parent is being made subordinate, but that right cannot be entirely negated from the process.  We are seeking to balance the two rights.  We are seeking to prioritise the identity right of the adopted person, but we must ensure that the privacy right of a parent is not entirely negated because if we were to do that, the legislation risks being unconstitutional.  I do not believe I am scaremongering when I say there is a likelihood of challenge here.  We have seen constitutional challenges on this specific issue previously with the I. O'T case, the case that got us into this situation over the past 23 years where so many adopted people are being refused access to their information.</p><p>Regarding sections 29 and 31, there are different views on the best way to balance the privacy rights and the right to identity in the legislation.  The proposal to use a registered letter was specifically canvassed during our engagements with the Office of the Attorney General and advisory counsel.  It was advised that the information phone call was the best way to secure and protect the privacy rights and ensure that the privacy rights of the parent though diminished, though subordinate, were still present and still part of this process.</p><p>A great deal of consideration has gone into this.  I have engaged on this issue and have heard the concerns people have raised about what is being proposed.  I have also made very significant changes to the balancing process.  Originally, the engagement was to be an in-person engagement and I have now changed that to simplify it to just a phone call.  Originally, the engagement was to be undertaken by a social worker.  However, recognising the concern some adopted people expressed that having a social worker leading this meeting suggested they needed social work and needed some sort of counselling, we moved away from that and now the relevant person undertaking the meeting can be any official of the relevant body.</p><p>Importantly we changed the language of what was conveyed in that phone call.  It moved from referring to the adopted person's understanding the importance of respecting the privacy right of the parent, something that some adopted people regarded as patriarchal and condescending.  We listened to that and acted.  We moved it to the relevant person's simply informing the adopted person that the expression by the parent of a no-contact preference is an exercise of that parent's privacy rights and that is all that is conveyed.  These changes have all been made to reflect the concerns raised in this process.  We have gone as far as the legal advice my Department has received will let us go.  If the legislation does not contain the appropriate balancing mechanism, it is at risk of being found unconstitutional thereby risking the overall goal which is the release of full unredacted information in every circumstance.  I am not willing to risk that goal and that is why I recommend this approach to the House.</p></speech>
