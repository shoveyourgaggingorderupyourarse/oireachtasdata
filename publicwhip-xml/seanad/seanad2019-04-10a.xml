    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-10a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019041000002#B00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming in to take this important issue.  We are facing into the implementation of a new multi-annual rural water programme between 2019 and 2021.  I seek a proper water connection for households in Downpatrick, Furmoyle, and Carramore, which is a townland in Ballycastle, County Mayo, in order that they have water they can drink, wash their clothes in and use for showers which, sadly, has been lacking for many years.  They have made a case for this for years.</p> <p>I welcome the new multi-annual programme and the sensible inclusion of measure 6, which provides for community connections.  Downpatrick, in particular, has had a very raw deal because for many years the area has fallen outside of the criteria.  Last year, it was deemed ineligible because to provide a scheme it would have to be first built and then connected to a public mains operated by Irish Water.  There was no provision for that option in the criteria but the issue has been addressed this year.  I am hopeful that the scheme will get the green light and that funding of &euro;229,500, which is needed to deliver it, can be put in place and allocated.  This would serve a total of 17 domestic connections. </p> <p>The problem is that people have tried in vain for years to drill wells to get water from other sources.  There is a problem, although not a pollution problem - with the ground conditions in the area.  There is a lot of iron in the water and naturally occurring arsenic, and, therefore, one cannot drink the water, which is red in colour.  One could not wash one's clothes in the water either.  There is a manual pump located in the village of Ballycastle where people get water to use in their homes, which is unbelievable in this day and age.  Other than that they have to buy water to drink.  </p> <p>When one considers the debate that pertained regarding the equity of treatment of all citizens of the State in respect of water services, it is imperative that such projects be funded in order that people have access to water.  When the debate raged about whether citizens should pay for their water, these households were not shy in coming forward and asking, "Will you give this cheque to the Minister and tell him that I will pay for my water?"  These people are at their wit's end and have spent loads of money yet they still do not have a water supply.</p> <p>Equally, Carramore has approximately 18 houses.  They have made a separate application from the Downpatrick scheme.  They are equally in a dilemma and they have nowhere to turn if the State will not help them.  I ask that the scheme be given priority.</p> <p>Finally, I refer to Furmoyle.  I know from my own background work that there is an issue with the cost per unit.  It is considered too costly under the current criteria.  That is not the problem or fault of the households because the additional cost arises as a result of dispersed housing and the ground conditions, including the mix of rock, bedrock and topography.  More engineering works must be carried out to deliver the schemes, which is more costly.  If we are serious about providing water to households across the country, regardless of whether they are urban or rural, this matter must be addressed and additional funds must be put in place to support communities.  These communities are coming to the State as a last resort.  If they could drill their own wells, they would and get a satisfactory water supply but, unfortunately, they cannot do so.  This is a problem and it is up to us to sort it.  This problem is experienced by people in Counties Mayo and Galway, in particular, because of our rural populations and they need help.  I ask that these schemes be prioritised as we look forward to the announcement of the multi-annual funding, which I believe will be in late April or May.  These communities really need some good news.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-10a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019041000002#B00700"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and I am happy to respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the people of rural Ireland are supported in accessing good quality water and wastewater services.</p> <p>On 8 February 2019, the Minister announced a new investment programme for water services in rural areas - the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2019-2021.   Capital funding of &euro;23 million has been provided in 2019, an increase of &euro;3 million from 2018 in the previous programme.  On 8 February 2019, local authorities were also invited to submit their bids to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for the funding of schemes or projects in their functional areas, with the deadline for receipt of proposals set as 14 March 2019.</p> <p>I understand that Mayo County Council has included Downpatrick Head in its bid applications to the Department under measure 6 - community connection (water and wastewater) networks - of the multi-annual programme.  The Department is currently considering the applications received from local authorities and an expert panel has been put in place to support the evaluation process.  In addition to providing an expert perspective, the panel brings independence, openness and transparency to the bid evaluation process, which is undertaken on a national prioritised basis.  The expert panel's membership includes departmental, stakeholder and independent representation.  The panel will make recommendations to the Department on the suitability of schemes and projects for funding based on objective criteria, which are set out in the framework document.  The Department will consider the recommendations of the panel and, based on these, will propose allocations for consideration by the Minister.  He expects the process to be completed in the second quarter of 2019.</p> <p>A proposed Furmoyle group water scheme was included in the bids by the Mayo County Council in 2016, under the previous multi-annual funding cycle, at a unit cost of &euro;22,000 per house.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2432"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2432&amp;amp;pid=SeanCanney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The panel assembled by the Department to review the bid concluded that the cost of the proposed scheme was excessive and did not recommend it for funding.  The Department understands from the council that the situation has remained unchanged and the council did not include the proposed Furmoyle scheme in its recent bids under the current funding cycle.  I do not have a response with regard to Carramore, which was mentioned by the Senator, but I will ask the Department to come back to her directly.  </p><p>It is important to note that households that cannot access a group water scheme or a public supply through the Irish Water network have other alternatives to improve their domestic water supply, if necessary.  The individual wells grant under the Department's rural water programme can be accessed through the council to assist with the provision or necessary improvement of an individual water supply to households.</p><p>Following the review of rural water services put in place by the Minister in 2018, he also announced improvements to the grants available to private well owners in February 2019.  These are to take effect from the end of April in a few weeks.  The maximum grant for refurbishment works to a domestic well will increase from &euro;2,031 to &euro;3,000.  A new and additional provision is included for a maximum grant of &euro;5,000 where a new well is required as an exceptional measure.  I hope this clarifies matters regarding the group water schemes identified.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  I have hope.  There have been several schemes in Mayo and every time they change the rules, one scheme gets brought into the net.  It has been very piecemeal but it will make a big difference for the people concerned.  All of us can agree that in this day and age, having to bring water to one's house, drawing it in the way I have described and living with that for years and years is not an easy way to live, particularly for older people and people with children.  It is an essential commodity we all take for granted and I would like some fair play for these households.</p></speech>

I come from a rural part of Galway that still has issues with water supply.  I am working hard within the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on broadband for rural areas.  We say this is an essential but there are still places in the country where we do not have a potable water supply and security.  This is something we must address.  I appreciate that and I know that with regard to Kilreekil, County Galway, which still does not have a supply, another group water scheme from Cappataggle has generously allowed its water to be supplied to the other community.  All of the due diligence is being done on that.  We need to fill the remaining gaps in water supply.  The Senator has a particular interest in one or two schemes where water supply through the well might not be available so this might be something that could be looked at between the council and the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-10a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019041000002#C00400"><p>Given priority perhaps.</p></speech>

I will bring back the Senator's concerns in view of the fact that water supply from the well is not safe and potable.  I will ask the Minister or his officials to talk to Mayo County Council about that.</p> <p>The Senator hit the nail on the head when she mentioned paying for water and water charges.  We still need to understand that there are some people in this country who would love to be able to pay for the supply of water if they could get hold of it and that is a problem.  Even though the country gets so much rain, we still do not have potable water in certain areas.  However, significant efforts have been made over decades.  I compliment the group water schemes for what they have done for rural Ireland and the leadership they have shown throughout the years.  We will continue to work on that.</p></speech>

On the day that is in it, I could not go without mentioning Brexit again and the special meeting of the European Council in Brussels.  Theresa May is now hoping for a delay until 30 June but there does not seem to be a lot of co-operation and collaboration among the parties in the UK yet.  I still hope they will come to their senses and cancel Brexit but in the absence of that, although it is not necessarily wonderful to leave us all in an uncertain position, I would prefer an uncertain position to a certain position that was not very positive so we should try to encourage them to resolve it if they can but if they are unable to resolve it, we should allow them a delay to enable them to come to a position that, hopefully, will be better for Ireland than what is being proposed at the moment.</p> <p>The report published by PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, regarding the National Children's Hospital still raises concerns that there are significant risks and potential cost overruns even at this point.  The governance procedures and the way in which capital projects generally are being managed, not managed or poorly managed is a matter of concern for all of us.  We have the National Children's Hospital, the national broadband plan and various other capital infrastructure projects.  Only this morning, the Minister for Health was talking about wanting to turn a sod this year on the national maternity hospital.  There is potential there for significant cost overruns unless it is properly managed.  We should have a discussion with the Minister for Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform regarding procurement generally but particularly the procurement of large capital projects in the best interests of the nation.  It should not be rocket science at this stage.  We have motorways, airports and various other infrastructure but we need to examine how we do these projects in the longer term.  </p> <p>I also wish to flag the fact that we have the highest trolley numbers so far this year with 631 people currently awaiting a bed in a hospital.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a nationwide problem with Limerick, Sligo and Cork being particularly badly affected.  This House should hear from the Minister for Health as to what is being done.  This happens every year but this is the highest number so far.  One would have hoped that by April, as the weather improves and so on, that the situation would have improved rather than got worse.</p><p>It might be useful at some point for the Minister of State at the Department of Defence to come to the House to discuss Air Corps numbers and staffing because there is a report that the Air Corps is significantly understaffed, particularly in key grades, which has resulted in operational difficulties.  I ask that the Minister of State come to the House to outline his plans in that regard.</p></speech>

Today, all appearances are that he is going to be the head of the next government with the support of parties of the right and religious parties in the Israeli Knesset.  This gambit of his, which may have appeared to some to be a last throw of the dice in order to consolidate his electoral support on the day before an election, is now likely to be endorsed by a majority of the parties in the Knesset.  It is of some significance that a member state of the United Nations should ignore all precepts of international law and all of the previous resolutions of the United National in terms of this matter, and should now purport to steal territory which was never part of the State of Israel, as recognised internationally, and appropriate it on the basis of just simple conquest from the people of Palestine.</p> <p>When looks back at the history of this matter it becomes so clear that if there is any chance of there being peace in the Middle East in the long term, whether it is the Camp David Accords, something like that or something different, one thing is absolutely certain that there is no chance of peace based on the proposition that all the settlements "authorised" and "unauthorised" are now to be adopted as the sovereign territory of Israel.  It means, effectively, that the West Bank is being dismembered and made ungovernable and the possibility of a Palestinian state is being swept away.</p> <p>I mention this simply to say the following.  It is important that voices are raised against this.  It is important that voices are raised against this without the ridiculous charge of anti-Semitism being thrown in our faces.  I have indicated on a number of occasions, and I reiterate now, that I believe in the right of the Israeli State to exist.  I believe in the right of the Israeli State to defend itself.  I have absolutely no anti-Semitic intent at all.  I know that the views that I am expressing now are supported by a considerable number of people in Israel, so the charge of anti-Semitism simply does not stand.  In those circumstances, the Irish Government should become more courageous in standing up for what we believe in.  We should become more vocal.  The Bill that we passed on settlement goods was not an affront to international law.  It was condemned roundly by Prime Minister Netanyahu and he dubbed it anti-Semitic-----</p></speech>

Many school secretaries and caretakers are paid out of their school's ancillary grant and only around 10% are paid directly by the Department of Education and Skills.  The two-tier system means that some secretaries are paid way more than others with some being paid as little as &euro;12,000 a year.  This is deeply unfair and unjust which is why Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the campaign being led by the F&oacute;rsa trade union.  Some of these secretaries will also have to sign on the dole during the summer months such is the lack of stability around their wages.  The campaign seeks to ensure that all school secretaries are employed directly by the Department and enjoy full pension entitlements as public sector workers and equity in pay achieved through the linking of school secretary pay to the appropriate public sector pay grade.  It is atrocious that school secretaries are not treated in the same way as other staff within a school.  One cannot have that but we have seen it happen with CE supervisors and assistant supervisors where, despite a Labour Court ruling that they get a pension, they are told they are not entitled to one.  These are very simple things that must be put right.  If we are really serious about equality and fairness, we have to right those things to ensure that everybody is on the same playing field and people are paid in a proper manner.</p> <p>I draw attention to the report launched by Women's Aid this morning on the incidence and reporting of domestic violence.  While much progress has been made in terms of the new legislation we passed and the greater awareness of the help and assistance available, the figures are really shocking.  Last year, 19,089 contacts were made with Women's Aid.  Out of these contacts, 16,994 cases of domestic violence were against women.  In many cases, the violence was witnessed by a child in the family home setting.  Some 27% of these reported cases of abuse involved an ex-husband or partner.  There is no guarantee that ending the relationship means an end to abuse by the partner.  The report highlights many of the shortcomings in family law.  It starkly states that we have a system where there is a presumption of access for the father even where domestic violence is involved.</p> <p>We need to resource front-line services in a proper way, to reform the courts, to make the system easier for women and children who are fleeing abuse and to take these figures seriously.  Let us remember that only 20% of cases are ever reported so 80% of cases are never reported.  The crime of domestic violence must be tackled in a serious way not just through the legislation we have passed.  We need an all-island strategy on domestic violence and how to combat it.</p></speech>

I note the Israeli elections today and the news that Benjamin Netanyahu looks set to be returned as Prime Minister.  That is very worrying.  All of us who are internationalists and who are concerned about human rights and the rule of law should consider what these elections mean in practice.  We have a situation where millions of people living under permanent military occupation did not get a say yesterday.  They did not vote for the government that ultimately controls the most fundamental aspects of their everyday lives.  The occupation has been in place for 50 years but while Palestinians living in the West Bank know these elections will determine their futures and shape the conditions that they somehow live under, they can only look on in hope or, more accurately, in despair.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Polling stations are set up in illegal settlements built across the West Bank to facilitate the franchise of Israeli citizens transferred into occupied territory no matter that this is a war crime, a flagrant violation of international law and the stark anti-democratic reality of an occupied population watching on as their neighbours vote on competing promises of annexation.  To put it mildly, this is not what democracy looks like.  In a closing day pitch to this base, Netanyahu promised that if re-elected, he would formally annex the West Bank.  In reality, this shameful promise is essentially about formalising a situation that has already taken place over decades.  The <i>de facto</i>annexation of the West Bank has been a gradual process settlement by settlement and has been facilitated by an international community quick to harshly condemn this illegality but totally unwilling to take any meaningful steps to halt it.  This election and the right-wing government it will produce should act as another reminder.  We will soon come to the point at which we will drive past the last exit on the road to annexation.  This is the reason I tabled the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill.  I was proud to see this legislation being supported strongly by both Houses of the Oireachtas and to present it at the UN last week.  I saw strong support and an understanding that countries like Ireland, committed as we are to human rights and international law, have a duty to stand strongly against these practices.  As we share the same goal of realising the basic human rights of the Palestinian people, I urge the Government to reconsider its position on this Bill.  It can provide important input at a time of little hope and I fully intend to see it through these Houses and into law over the coming months.  The signal we send would be stronger still if we can do it unanimously.</p></speech>

As Senator Horkan rightly noted, today is yet another crucial day in yet another discussion about the ongoing malaise that is Brexit.  Whatever happens this afternoon, tomorrow or indeed the next 12 months, one of the key issues facing the country is the level of diversification, be it in terms of trade, exposure to the wider world and connectivity.  One issue where this is quite clear is increasing direct flights from Ireland to various parts of the world.  We have seen the success of this with regard to China and certain cities in the US but there is a clear need for a direct flight from Dublin to India, be it to Delhi or Mumbai.  I call on the Leader to bring the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the House to discuss this and other ways that Ireland can further diversify its ties to the wider world in the post-Brexit era.</p></speech>

The reason for this problem is that we do not have enough of them and the reason we do not have enough of them is because they cannot come to this country under what we call critical skills, which involves eligibility to come and work here.  There is a lack of suitable staff in our voluntary, private and public nursing homes.  I do not know whether or not anybody has noticed but we have an ageing population.  We are getting older and those who are becoming frail and feeble in their homes, communities or nursing homes need healthcare assistants.  They need healthcare assistants to feed, wash, turn and dress them and to be their friends because they are there 24 hours a day.  We cannot get candidates in Ireland for these positions and we are looking outside the EU.  We are looking to the EU but it has its own problems.</p> <p>I am calling on the House to think about this.  I have written to all the Ministers about it and am trying to organise some way of changing eligibility.  Did Senators know that a person can come here as a bone person within an agricultural setting or that a person working in a meat factory or a sheet metal worker is eligible, but a person is not eligible if he or she is going to deal with a human being for 24 hours every day of every week of every month of every year who happens to be in the home or community or trapped in their own homes?  It is extremely important that we have a pilot scheme with India and Mauritius, particularly India.  Our Taoiseach is from an Indian background.  The greatest doctors and nursing and medical staff have come from India and perhaps it is time we set up a pilot programme to see how we can work this.</p> <p>We should come together across all divides here to address this problem because most of the young people who come to help must either re-apply for visas and are ineligible because they do not come under what are called critical skills.  It is very simple.  We could expand the definition and organise our lives as we grow older.  We need these people.  When people talk to me about immigration, they do not know what they are talking about.  We need people to come from other countries to help us stay alive on our own island as we get older and as our children grow up and get educated.  What are we talking about?  There are all the wrong inferences about immigration.  I am sorry the Seanad is not fuller but will the Senators think about this because I will pursue it over the next two or three weeks?</p> <p>I second Senator McDowell's amendment to the Order of Business.  I think that thing is insane.  </p></speech>

As most Members know, I am a GP working at the coal face.  I will explain some of the changes that were announced recently.  Last Saturday, the Taoiseach and Minister for Health announced some preliminary agreements for changes to contracts for GPs.  A full general medical services contract has been promised since April 2017 - two years ago.  Assurances have been given that negotiations are slowly moving in the correct direction.  The increased funding of &euro;210 million over four years sounds impressive but it might be slightly misleading.</p> <p>Given the pedestrian nature of the talks so far, any progress is welcome but I would like to explain in more detail how this money will be spent.  I and many other GPs across the country have serious concerns about details of the agreement with the IMO.  In 2014 alone, &euro;219.8 million was cut from general practice to medical card patients.  Capitation rates were, in effect, cut by 38% due to the expansion of entitlements to free GP visits.  The Government appears to be trying to play the same trick by introducing free visits for six to 12 year olds while not actually funding the policy.  We have a trolley crisis because GPs are overstretched.  For every &euro;1 spent on primary care, &euro;5 is saved in the rest of the health sector.  If a proper general medical services contract was negotiated with GPs, midwives and nurses, we would not be in a situation where patients have to wait hours on end in accident and emergency departments to be seen and are then left on a trolley waiting for a bed.  Patients would be seen before their health deteriorated to the point where they needed hospitalisation and hospitals would not have to be used as the first point of care for patients who are unable to get appointments with GPs or a public health nurse.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When I left Wales a number of years ago, there was a four-week waiting list to see a GP while in Ireland it is looking now like one week.  We used to have same-day access only a few years back.  As of 1 March 2019, just over 2 million people, or 42.6%, of the population had access to free GP care.  While this step forward towards universality is wonderful and I applaud it and while I support Sl&aacute;intecare, time and again the Government has announced new healthcare policies without considering how to fund them.  Hence, 80,000 people have waited 33 weeks for the results of smear tests. I have patients who had a smear taken in August 2018 and who have still not received a result.  They come in and ask me where the results are and when they are going to get them and I say, "I don't know".  We do not know because we have been kept in the dark, which is a problem.</p><p>Rural and deprived urban areas cannot recruit young GPs.  That means this cohort of patients is being disenfranchised, yet the Department of Health can overspend its budget by &euro;1.3 billion, which does not even take into account the national children's hospital overspend.  If we are to be serious about providing adequate primary care services nationally, especially in rural locations, we have to look at putting a proper contract in place as soon as possible.  The FEMPI cuts must be reversed.  This is about providing care to the most vulnerable patients who, in this country, are patients with medical cards who live in urban deprived areas and rural areas which cannot attract a GP.  It is unfair.  Patients have to travel 30 km to 40 km to access GP services.  I ask the Leader to consider having a debate on this matter, which is one of major importance.  GPs are the front-line soldiers in the battle within the healthcare service.  If we do not have an adequate primary care service, we do not have a health service at all.</p></speech>

Senator Conway-Walsh is dead right.</p> <p>Senators Horkan and Richmond raised the issue of Brexit.  Today's special EU summit is important.  It is a bit like Groundhog Day on one level but time is advancing and there is a need for a decision to be made regarding whether Brexit involves a 30 June departure or a different date.  That is a matter for the Heads of Government today.  It is important that we in the Chamber continue to look to Westminster to resolve this impasse and to take a leap of fate and act of bravery in reaching a conclusion.  We know what they do not want but they must now tell us what they want.  Senator Richmond raised an important matter with regard to the diversification of transport and connectivity in a post-Brexit era.  The matters he raises are important for us, not just now but post Brexit.  I would be happy to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport come back to the House on the matter.</p> <p>Senator Horkan referred to the PwC report on the national children's hospital.  I concur with him on the need to have a debate on procurement and capital projects.  The report is 160 pages long and I have read some but not all of it.  I must be honest.  I ask all Members to read the report, which is most interesting and informative from many perspectives.  We must put matters in context.  The report deals with a project that is unique in scope, scale and complexity by comparison with any other health infrastructure built in the history of the State.  The report identifies and illustrates clearly weaknesses in the set-up, planning, budget, execution and governance.  I would be happy to arrange a debate on the report in due course.</p> <p>Senator Horkan also raised the issue of hospital trolleys, which is of great concern.  There has been an increase notwithstanding the increased level of investment by Government, including &euro;30 million for the winter investment plan and the opening of additional acute and community beds in many parts of the country.  We need the matter tackled.  It is linked to Senator Swanick's contribution, which is a matter now for discussion with the IMO and the NAGP.  There must be continued improvement and investment in primary care.  I agree with the Senator on the Defence Forces.  I read the article in the paper this morning and would be happy to have the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, come to the House again on the matter.</p> <p>Senators McDowell, Black and Norris mentioned the Israeli election and the likely outcome of the talks that will take place, given that no party in the Knesset has a majority.  A coalition is required.  Whether it is Mr. Netanyahu or Mr. Gantz, it is important that those who want peace know it is about a willingness to come to the table and engage in a spirit of co-operation, equality and fairness.  I would be happy to have the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come back to the House on that.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of school secretaries.  I attended the F&oacute;rsa meeting in Cork on school secretaries.  The significant administrative burden on schools is growing and in recent days the Minister for Education and Skills lifted the moratorium for schools with enrolments in excess of 700.  That will allow schools to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school.  Approximately 90 schools meet the criteria and 58 will benefit immediately from the announcement.  The remaining 33 have this level of staffing but will be permitted to fill vacancies under the clerical officer vacancies scheme as they arise.  There is an issue in schools and I addressed it in my contribution yesterday.  Secretaries fulfil a major role in our schools and perform perhaps the most important job in keeping schools functioning and running smoothly.  There is an anomaly here which must be addressed in the long term.  I hope that can be done.</p> <p>The Women's Aid report was published earlier.  Senator Conway-Walsh mentioned the 20,000 calls to Women's Aid in that context.  In tandem with that, we saw the publication recently of the report by the PSNI on 31,000 cases, or 80 per day, in the North of our country.  Hopefully, some of those are historical cases given the changes in the legislative route, as the Senator said.  It is far too many cases to have and I agree fully with her on the need for legislative action and resources.  It is about ensuring societal attitudes change and that we educate young people and everyone else on their attitudes to women and domestic and sexual violence.  Education has a critical role.  I would be happy to have that debate in due course.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell made a telling and fine contribution on the role of immigration in our country.  I cannot but completely agree with her that we need to have the right inference put on immigration.  We have a significant skills shortage.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, has made some changes to the visa programme but others need to be put in place.</p><p>Last week, I met with Nursing Homes Ireland which made the case for the need to have changes brought to their sector to deal with the skills shortages in nursing and healthcare assistant provision.  We have also seen the changes that will be required to deal with skills shortages in our hospitality sector.  This landscape needs to be changed to allow people to come to work here and make a contribution to our society.  We always have been an island of welcomes.  We have always had people come to our country and make a contribution.  As Senator Lawless will testify, it works the other way too when Irish people travel across the world.  They also have made telling contributions to the societies in which they have settled.</p><p>We need to change the visa permit system to allow people to come to Ireland.  The Senator referred to India.  I have no issue with what the Senator suggested and I am quite happy for the Minister to attend the House.  While some changes have been made to the visa permit system, I accept much more can be done.  We must have a wider debate on immigration and the proper inference which must be put on it.</p><p>Senator Swanick referred to the GP contract.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, has welcomed the conclusion of the contract talks.  We will not have a debate today on it because it is a discussion for the IMO membership.  I agree there is a need to see a reversal of FEMPI cuts and continued investment in primary care.  I would be happy to have a debate on that in due course.</p><p>I will not be accepting the amendment to the Order of Business for the reasons I have outlined.</p></speech>

It has been 43 days since the Minister agreed that it was entirely reasonable that the disposition of the Government to amendments be known at the earliest opportunity, yet we still have not seen what the amendments to section 44 will be.  Therefore, amendment No. 92b was meant to address the current section 44.  As the Minister is aware, section 44 in its current form would involve 16 members of the commission appointing the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the High Court and ordinary members of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal.  The process of appointment by this Government of all of the aforementioned positions in the past two years or so has included the president of an appellate court, the Attorney General and the chair of the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC.  This process was used to appoint the current Chief Justice, new ordinary members of the Supreme Court, and the President and new ordinary members of the Court of Appeal.</p><p>For most litigants, the Court of Appeal will be their last opportunity to have their cases heard, with only cases of exceptional public importance going to the Supreme Court.  The High Court, Circuit Court and District Court are bound by the decisions of their superior courts.  This includes the Court of Appeal with respect to the Supreme Court.  Decisions made by the latter two courts are of fundamental importance to the rule of law and their officeholders bear significant responsibility for how the law is applied and interpreted.</p><p>The Government in its wisdom deemed as a bare minimum that it was appropriate for the Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal and President of the High Court, all of whom are members of the Council of State, to be appointed by a separate senior judicial appointments committee.  This proposal was voted out of the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  The Government proposes that the Chief Justice, Attorney General and chair of the committee will recommend appointments to these offices rather than the 16-member judicial commission, which is how the process will operate if the section is enacted in the D&aacute;il version.  If the Government accepts the principle that the appointment process for the Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal and President of the High Court requires a more finessed consideration than the 16-member commission process, wherein all of these officeholders are either members or <i>ex officio</i>members of the Supreme Court, it is difficult to see why it would object to ordinary members of these courts also forming part of the separate senior judicial appointments committee process.  As matters stand, we do not know what the Government's position is regarding section 44, which bears directly on the operation of section 46.</p></speech>

We withdrew amendment No. 93, which related to the issue of seeking to ensure an adequate gender balance on the Judiciary.  We called a vote on amendment No. 92, which sought to insert the phrase "in the order of the Commission's preference".  Not only would regard be had to the objective that membership of the Judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women, but amendment No. 93 also called for the names recommended by the commission to be considered by the Government "in the order of the Commission's preference".  This concept was crucial and should have been included in the text of section 46.  Without this additional element, the section is lacking.  This point has been made in numerous critiques of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, namely, that the JAAB should be empowered or required to rank its recommendations in order of preference, as this would significantly improve and reform the system of judicial appointments.  Without having that concept or principle in section 46, we see a section that is a missed opportunity for the reform it could have represented.</p> <p>We called a vote on amendment No. 92.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have reserved the right in amendment No. 93 to resubmit it with a different wording, but with the same principles, on Report Stage.

I am opposed to adopting the section for all of the reasons that have been rehearsed in the debate on those amendments, including Senator Bacik's objection and the matters referred to just now by Senator Norris.</p> <p>First, it should be remembered that an amendment was tabled to allow three members of the commission to intimate dissent so that the Government should have some clear view that these decisions are not all unanimous when that is not the case, and that was rejected.</p> <p>Then there was a further amendment dealing with the situation that arose - we discussed this on the last occasion - that if a person is recommended for a vacancy, say, in the Court of Appeal, he or she should remain to be regarded as a person who the Government may have regard to in making an appointment even if a subsequent list comes in with three other names on it.</p> <p>We are now being asked to effectively make provision for section 44 although, as Senator Norris said, it is a long time since the Government was called upon to indicate exactly what it was proposing in respect of section 44.</p></speech>

It would have been so easy for the Government to table its amendment to section 44 as part of the process.  Then we could have had a clear view, when considering section 46, to understand what we were effectively agreeing by reference in the context of the Government's proposal to section 44, but none of that has been done.  I do not want to be disorderly or to go back to section 44, but I want to emphasise the importance of the another point.</p><p>I do not accept for one minute that the positions of Chief Justice, President of the High Court and President of the Court of Appeal are radically different from ordinary members of those courts.  The Chief Justice is <i>primus inter pares</i>but he or she is not somebody whose function under the Constitution is radically different.  The court operates by a majority and the opinion of a judge of the Supreme Court is just as weighty if he or she is an ordinary member of the court as if he or she is the president of that court.  The Minister's policy of segregating these three particular appointments, the presidents of the courts, and stating they are radically different is mistaken.  They are not radically different and they are of equal importance.  Two ordinary members of the Supreme Court can outvote the opinion of the Chief Justice.  I do not see that there is a basis for making a wholly different process for three particular appointments when the functional aspect of being a member of Supreme Court is not radically different whether one is Chief Justice or an ordinary member of the court.</p><p>Second, judges make law in some respects.  The Constitution means what individual judges decide it to mean.  As Senator Norris stated, the great majority of people will not get beyond the Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal, when that amendment was made providing for it recently by the people, is, in effect, the Supreme Court for most people.  It is the point at which law will be decided, except in exceptional cases of public importance, such as Article 26 references.  The ordinary membership of those courts is of considerable importance because judges make law.  They interpret the Constitution, make common law-type decisions, and apply European precepts to Irish law.  Although they are separate from the Legislature, they are, in fact, law makers of a different type.</p><p>I want to make this final point on this section.  If it is considered correct that the top three presidencies - if I may use that phrase about them - should be determined by a separate process, it underlines the need to reconsider the concept of ordinary members of those courts being treated radically differently.  I have mentioned here on occasion the fact that any member of the High Court is <i>ex officio</i>capable of functioning as a member of the Court of Appeal if asked to do so, which happens, any member the Court of Appeal or the High Court is <i>ex officio</i>capable of functioning as a member of the Supreme Court, and that happens from time to time.  I believe that if one looks at these judicial positions from a functional point of view, they are more or less similar.  A High Court judge sitting on his or her own makes the law.  The Court of Appeal determines whether he or she was correct in making the law and, in so doing, it makes the law.  It seems to me, therefore, that the effort to confine a special process to the three presidencies under section 44 is mistaken and should not be proceeded with.  The corollary of that thought is that judges who are in those positions and capable of carrying out those functions should not be required to go through the commission process and apply for a promotion, etc.  I have made that point on a number of other occasions.  I re-emphasise that section 46, which adopts by reference the terms of section 44, which is fluid at this stage because we have not seen the Government's proposal but the Minister has given us a fairly good indication that he intends to confine it to the three presidencies, it is objectionable on that ground.  I am opposed to it.  It should not form part of the Bill in its present form.</p><p>The amendments which were proposed would have considerably improved this section and they have been rejected.  In those circumstances, I must indicate opposition to the section.</p></speech>

I regret that Senator McDowell stated that he is not minded to support a proposal that would involve a committee of three people for the appointment of the three presidents.  I disagree with him when he states that the three presidents are no more distinguished in terms of the operation of their obligations and duties than are other judges.  I bow to his experience, but I beg to differ in that regard.  If the Seanad is not minded to support the proposal I intended to bring on Report Stage, I may not bring it at all.  That is another reason I think it appropriate to wait until Committee Stage has been completed.  Of course, I do not sense any disposition on the part of Senator Norris or others to facilitate the progress of the Bill-----</p></speech>

Obviously, it is of great import that, in advising the President in regard to an appointment, the Government should firstly consider the names recommended to the Minister.  That has always been the position of the Government.  If Senators were minded to go back to the general scheme of the Bill and the heads that were published at the outset or, indeed, to look at section 16 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, they would see consistency there.  Of course, although the Government shall first consider the appointment, that does not necessarily mean that this in any way impacts upon the constitutional right or requirement of the Government to ultimately make that decision.  We must ensure in this legislation that the Government is not constrained to only accepting advice that might be proffered by the commission.  I strongly advocate the retention of section 46.  The Seanad has voted on a number of amendments and I have a certain amount of sympathy for some, but they are covered in other aspects of the legislation.  I respectfully suggest that the question be put.</p></speech>

It occurs to me that the fundamental philosophical mistake being made is that the promotional appointments - if I may use that phrase which I do not like very much - to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court are, in my view, matters on which the Government should exercise its discretion because the Government as the Executive is the institution in which that discretion is vested by the Constitution.</p> <p>I again make a point which, in this context, bears repetition, namely, that under the criteria by reference to which the commission is supposed to make its decisions on recommendation which are set out in the Act and will be set out in greater detail in the statements of the procedures committee, the one thing the commission is not allowed to consider is probably the one thing with which the Government will be most concerned.  When the Government receives the three names, it will ask, "Who are these three people?  What kind of Supreme Court will we have if we accept one or more of them as recommended appointees?"  The Government comes to a view as to whether the candidate in question is liberal or very conservative.  That is one thing which the commission is prohibited from taking into account.  Such an assessment might involve looking at the judgment record of a particular judge to see whether he or she was reactionary or progressive, if one wishes to use those terms, which I do not particularly like either.</p> <p>Those are the kinds of things that the Executive will ask.  Taking the example of a very simple issue of huge significance in the day-to-day lives of ordinary Irish people who pay insurance premiums, it would ask, "Does this judge take a liberal and generous approach to the awarding of damages?  Has he or she shown that tendency as a judge of the High Court or Court of Appeal?  Do we want that approach reflected in the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal or Supreme Court?"<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are other criteria but these are the very things that the commission is not entitled to do.  The commission is not entitled to ask Mr. Justice So-and-So why he consistently takes such a generous or mean approach to the awarding of damages.  It is not entitled to ask a judge why he or she takes a particular line on this or that issue.  Those are the kinds of questions which the commission cannot ask a candidate but these are precisely the kinds of things that would influence the Government in reaching a decision.  The Government would be interested to know whether someone has been vocally opposed to various referenda being passed, for example, in deciding whether it wants to appoint that person to the Supreme Court.  It is perfectly reasonable for the Government to look at the Supreme Court and decide that it wants to give it a more liberal complexion or that it wants to make it more conservative.  Those are perfectly reasonable criteria for the Government to have in mind when making an appointment.  What I find really objectionable about this legislation is that a group of people who are not entitled to consider these issues and who are expressly prohibited from doing so will make a selection of three names and the Government is then supposed to consider those three people first when different criteria inform Government decisions to appoint people to our courts.  What is objectionable about section 44 is that it is so confined.  The Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court are hugely important courts.  Their membership is a matter of enormous importance.  The same criteria on liberalism versus conservatism or activism versus-----</p></speech>

The commission cannot ask Ms Justice So-and-So her views on social issues.  It cannot ask her that question.  It would be acting improperly were it to decide to put her on the list because she is a liberal.  That would be improper.  That is what is wrong with this whole idea of having promotional appointments dealt with in the way this Bill provides.  Even if the Minister were, in exasperation, to make no amendments to section 44 and leave it as a matter for the commission, I would be equally opposed to that.  I am absolutely clear in my mind that the proper constitutional thing to do is to leave the Government free to make promotional decisions among the Judiciary to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court without the input of people whose procedures expressly exclude them from considering matters which the Executive is bound to and does consider in making appointments.  I am opposed to the amendment on that account.</p></speech>

It is important that the Government would know the complexion of the mind of the judge that it is appointing because this is an extension of policy.

Then section 47(3), which is the kernel of the section as proposed by the Minister, states, &quot;The person shall take no part in the performance by the Commission of the particular function and, accordingly, shall neither attend any meeting of it held for the purpose of the performance of the particular function nor cast any vote in relation to any decision falling to be made by it for that purpose.&quot;</p><p>In passing, regardless of the amendment that I am now moving, it occurs to me that section 47(3) is, in any event, a cast too wide.  It prohibits a person who has made an application from attending any meeting of the commission held for the purpose of considering the particular appointment, but he or she could be doing more than one thing at a meeting.  It is something that the Minister might consider in any event.</p><p>The underlying principle of my amendment is that no member of the commission should be required to submit an application to the commission in any circumstance whatsoever.  There is no reason an <i>ex officio</i>person who is on it - not the Chief Justice who would not apply but the President of the High Court and the President of the Court of Appeal - should be required to apply to his or her colleagues on the commission and be included or excluded by them from a shortlist.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The reasons that we advance for it are as follows: first, on the process, let us imagine if the President of the High Court sought a-----</p></speech>

That sounds reasonable at first blush because it would be most remarkable if a would-be appointee voted on his or her own appointment.  That would be strange indeed and one would imagine that there is a lot to be said for requiring the person involved to absent himself or herself from the proceedings of the commission while his or her name is under consideration.  However, this brings a broader question into focus in an instance where the President of the High Court might seek appointment to be an ordinary member of the Supreme Court or an ordinary member or president of the Court of Appeal.  In such a case, what is the reality of him or her stepping aside from the process while his or her colleagues, in his or her absence, consider whether he or she is suitable to be shortlisted for appointment?  What would be the consequence if his or her colleagues decide he or she was not suitable?</p></speech>

The relationship between that officeholder and the rest of the commission would be severely tested by such an event.  Supposing that the President of the High Court got the message that the rest of the commission did not think much of him or her, from the point of view of being appointed to the Court of Appeal or Supreme Court.  That having happened, the President of the High Court is supposed to sit there quietly and adjudicate, in the company of everyone else, on other people's suitability for another vacancy in that court as if the rejection had not taken place.  That is not a good idea.  It is a very contrived situation.</p><p>Let us remember that we are dealing with the Attorney General and the presidents of the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, the latter being the Chief Justice.  It would not apply to the Chief Justice because, presumably, he or she would not be applying for appointment to anything else, but it would apply to each of the others.  There is something ridiculous about the commission sitting and adjudicating on the suitability of one of its own members to be a member of the Supreme Court.</p><p>Looking at it from another angle, if the President of the High Court is considered to be somebody suitable <i>ex officio </i>to express views about the suitability of other people, is it not remarkable that it could turn out that he or she was not suitable for the appointment themselves?  I keep reminding us of this point, but the President of the High Court can serve on the Supreme Court and does so on occasion.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The absurdity of saying that the President of the High Court could be voted off the shortlist to be sent to the Government by his or her colleagues becomes very apparent.<br/><br/>What is the remedy for this situation?  The alternative is clear, and that is that an <i>ex officio</i>member of the commission who is eligible for appointment and wishes to be appointed may indicate that fact to the secretary to the Government rather than going through the process of being interviewed by his or her colleagues and so on.  That would apply to judicial office holders and the Attorney General.  If the Attorney General wished to be considered for appointment, it would not make much sense for him or her to apply to fellow commission members with whom, if he or she failed to be appointed, he or she would be expected to carry on business as if nothing had happened when, alternatively, the Government, if it was minded to appoint the Attorney General, could do so without recourse to this process.<br/><br/>There is a kind of superficial attractiveness to the section as it stands because it looks very fair - &quot;I am the President of the High Court.  I will walk outside the room and not participate in advising on other appointments to the Court of Appeal while I am in that position.&quot;  It looks &quot;oh so fair&quot; that that person simply excludes himself or herself from the process.  However, he or she would be excluding himself or herself from a process in which he or she would be<i>ex officio </i>normally involved.  It is my strong view that the right remedy for this is as set out in the amendment, namely, that we would not ask a member of the commission to step outside the room and be interviewed by other members of the commission for a promotional appointment but, rather, simply allow that person to indicate to the Government his or her willingness to be appointed to the position and leave it at that.  It is nonsensical to think that a member of the commission holding one of the senior positions would be interviewed by its other members.  It would be far better to simply revert to the obvious solution, which is to allow the Government to appoint or decline to appoint a person who indicates an interest as it so wishes and without the absurdity of members of the commission interviewing each other, which proposal I consider grotesque.</p></speech>

Before I address the amendment, it is worthwhile to put its exact wording on the record of the House:</p><blockquote>In page 31, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;47. </b>(1) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as requiring a member of the Commission who is eligible for appointment to any judicial office to make an application to the Commission to be considered for appointment to that judicial office.<br /><br />(2) A person to whom subsection (1) applies may notify the secretary of the Government of his or her wish to be considered by the Government for appointment to any vacancy in any judicial office.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>It seems absolutely absurd that a member of the commission would be interviewed by fellow members of the commission and then, were he or she to be disappointed in his or her ambition to be made a member of the Supreme Court or another court, would have to go back and work with the members of the commission who had openly rejected him or her and stated that he or she was not fit to be appointed to the court, and then go on to consider the merits of another candidate.  It is absolutely daft.  Of course, that is my opinion and the Minister may differ.  I note he is chortling and nodding to himself, so perhaps he will differ.  More power to him.  I do not see how he can oppose this amendment because it seems to me to be perfect common sense.  It flies in the face of the common sense of which we hear so much in the admirable television series &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; that a sitting member of the commission must formally subject himself or herself to the commission's judicial appointment process only to fail and then return to work with the colleagues who failed to select him or her in the process.  It is absolutely daft.</p><p>It equally flies in the face of common sense that a person seeking promotion through the court ranks or who wishes to become a judge would be selected by the same people with whom he or she had been working in selecting other judicial nominees.  I would be very interested to hear the response of the Minister.  I look forward to a prolonged, protracted and even, perhaps, tedious argument on this subject.</p></speech>

He has referred to members absenting themselves or staying in the room, and it is all couched in intrigue.  I do not believe it will be at all like that.  The fundamental misguidance of Senator McDowell is borne from a hostility on his part to any involvement by persons other than lawyers and judges and an inability to countenance any lay participation on the basis of a lack of understanding on the part of lay persons of the appointments process.  That is with what I have a fundamental difficulty.  It very much explains his implacable opposition to the Bill.</p> <p>The amendment undoubtedly wishes to completely circumvent the recommendation process and would allow a member of the commission to notify the Government secretary of his or her wish to be considered for appointment by, thereby completely setting aside the new appointments system.  That is with what I have a problem.  I cannot accept a proposal that eligible persons on the commission need not bother with the new appointments system as it would defeat the fundamental objective of the Bill, although it is certainly consistent with the view of Senator McDowell, echoed by Senator Norris.</p> <p>I remind Senators of the recusal aspect of subsection 47(3) in particular.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The principle of recusal is not new.

First, I do not really see where Senator McDowell's alleged antagonism to lay participation comes in at all.  I do not see that it is relevant to the argument.  It is just something the Minister wanted to get off his chest because I do not see it is at all relevant to the discussion on this amendment.</p> <p>Does the Minister think there are members of the High Court, currently or in the past, who are unworthy to be considered for a position on the Supreme Court?  I think it would be very worrying indeed if this were the case, if there were people acting in the High Court who were unfit to be considered for the Supreme Court.  That would be a very worrying aspect of the situation.  These are just the two points that I make at this stage.</p></speech>

I have no problem with that principle at all.  I do have a problem of saying to the Chief Justice that the Chief Justice should not chair the commission purely as a put down for the Judiciary.  I do have a problem with saying that lay people must be a majority of every sub-committee as a matter of principle when that is not particularly necessary.  That is not relevant to this particular amendment.</p><p>To underline what Senator Norris just said, on the Minister's intervention to say that he had full confidence in every member of the High Court, every member of the High Court can function as a member of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, if asked by the President of either of those courts to participate in it.  This is not a question.  One cannot become a member of the High Court unless one is <i>ex officio</i>suitable to serve on the Supreme Court.  That is the law of the land as things stand and as they will stand in future.  One may not be a pavilion member of the High Court, that one is just scraping in and that one is in a category of people whom the Chief Justice cannot ask to serve on the Supreme Court in the event of a vacancy or a particular need.  The same applies to the Court of Appeal.  </p><p>Once one becomes a member of the High Court, one is as a matter of law, assuming an office which entitles one when one is invited to serve on the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.  One must be suitable <i>ex officio </i>to do that, if invited to do so.  Let us be very clear about this.  This is a central aspect of my worry about people who are so qualified being asked to submit to a further test of suitability by a commission.  That is why I have said from the very beginning that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board system is far better, because it states that serving members of the Judiciary need not, and may not, apply to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to be considered.  It is left to the Executive to make the decision by itself.</p><p>I am not conjuring up some dark secretive scenario, in which under a cloak of secrecy various rivalries get played out.  The Minister puts down a recusal section that says that if one wants to apply for the job one must opt out of the whole idea.  That sounds plausible.  The problem with it is that it envisages a situation that having opted out one does not get the job and one is not recommended.  However, what arises then is what is one's future relationship with one's fellow commission members if they have said that an individual is not suitable to be a permanent member of the Supreme Court and they are not recommending the individual even though<i>, ex officio, </i>the Chief Justice can ring one up in the morning and ask one to serve on that court for a particular case.  There is nothing untoward or contrived about what I am saying.  I am merely trying to address the same situation that the Minister's section is trying to address and that is the situation that exists if any member of the commission wishes to be considered for recommendation for appointment.</p><p>I am saying that it would be very strange indeed, and I reiterate this, for the President of the High Court to have to submit himself or herself to interview by fellow members of the commission to ascertain his or her suitability to be appointed to the Court of Appeal or to the Supreme Court.  I cannot imagine anything more artificial or ridiculous than that process.  What is the President of the High Court to do?  What is the interview supposed to be about?  One holds one of the high constitutional offices of the country, one is willing to serve in a vacancy in a court above the High Court, namely, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court.  What more is there for the commission to do?  To start interviewing the individual about his or her aptitudes, where one went to school.  I do not know what the interview would be.  Can one imagine the President of the High Court sitting in a room with a number of lay people asking him or her why he or she wants to be on the Supreme Court.  How grotesque is that?  Why is one not happy with the job one has?</p><p>Let us think about this, it really does reduce itself to nonsense.  What form could the interview take?  Just imagine anybody being the President of the High Court and a group of people asking him or her why he or she wants to be on the Supreme Court?  &quot;Because I am tired of the job, I have been worked too hard, I have done a very good job and I would prefer to be up there.&quot;  It becomes absolutely obvious that such a process is stupid.  The same applies to the President of the Court of Appeal.  If he or she wants to be appointed as an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court, on which he or she is<i>ex officio </i>capable of acting in any case, if invited by the Chief Justice, to say to that person, &quot;we are demanding that you be interviewed by the rest of us&quot;, is just grotesque.  It is not me conjuring this up this.  This is what the Minister is providing for.  He is saying that if the President of the High Court wishes to be appointed to be an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court, he or she has to exit the process take no further part in the process and subject himself or herself to an interview and an evaluation process by fellow committee members.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What is supposed to be done in this regard?  Is the President of the High Court supposed to write an essay on a form saying why he or she should be a member of the Supreme Court?  Is that seriously envisaged?  Is her or she supposed to give an outline of his or her experience?  Is her or she supposed to set out what has made him or her desire to be on the Supreme Court rather than retaining his or her present position?  That is the slightly weird process for which the Minister is legislating.  There is nothing imaginary about that process.  That is what section 47 will provide for.</p><p>My alternative section 47, on the other hand, is simple.  It would provide that such a person may be appointed by the Executive in any event because the Constitution provides for it, and he or she would not have to undergo the charade, absurdity and artificiality of being interviewed as to why he or she wanted to be appointed an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court.  It would provide a simple way for the Government to make the choice.  Instead of saying he or she is opting out of one process, it would simply require a letter to be written to the secretary to the Government to advise that if an appointment is being made, he or she is interested in the position.  That is simple, straightforward, honest and transparent.  From the Government's point of view, the name of the President of the High Court will naturally not be on the shortlist because he or she will have indicated an interest in the appointment, and that will be the end of the matter.  I can see nothing odd, artificial or arcane about the process I have in mind.  The idea, however, that a senior office holder such as the President of the Court of Appeal might have to stand aside from the commission, be interviewed by those members of the commission who comprise the interviewing committee, and set out why he or she wants to be a Supreme Court judge is absurd.  Even if he or she did not have to set out reasons, what would be the point of having his or her suitability assessed as an ordinary member of the Supreme Court given that he or she is, as a matter of law, suitable to serve on that court?</p><p>I return to a point I made earlier.  If the Government decides to appoint the President of the High Court as an ordinary member of the Supreme Court or to some other court, it will have policy considerations in mind which the interview process cannot address or have anything to do with.  Far from my proposed section 47 being in any way strange, it is the Minister's proposal that is strange and it is underlines and exposes the ridiculousness of one commissioner applying to the rest of the commission to have his or her suitability assessed when he or she is, as a matter of law, well capable of being appointed to the position in question. </p></speech>

I do not know what the Minister had for lunch because he has dreamed up all these fantasies of smoke-filled rooms, conspiracies and so on.  I do not know where it is all coming from.  As Senator McDowell has eloquently outlined, the President of the High Court is deemed as being eligible to act on the Supreme Court.  Is the Minister saying this person might not - not "is not" but "might not" - be suitable for appointment to the Supreme Court?  Otherwise, he is saying the person must automatically be deemed to be qualified.  Where is the argument?  I just do not see it.</p> <p>I do not know whether one has to be whatever expression I used was to oppose the amendment, but it certainly seems bizarre and I do not understand it.  I reiterate that the President of the High Court can act as a member of the Supreme Court and, therefore, is deemed to be qualified.  Why should he or she apply again, unless the Minister is saying such a person is not fit to be a member of the court?  If he is not saying that, he is saying such a person, as the President of the High Court, is automatically qualified.  I do not see any other explanation.</p></speech>

That might be the excuse that is made for there being a shortlist of three among which he or she did not appear.  I have thought the matter through, however, and even in that scenario, what is the President of the High Court to make of his or her fellow members of the commission if they say there are three people more suitable to be on the court than him or her, given that the following month the same President of the High Court may consider the suitability of other people for a similar vacancy?  It is ridiculous.  If we trust the President of the High Court <i>ex officio</i>sufficiently to say he or she is <i>ex officio</i>a member of the commission, it follows that the high degree of trust that automatically reposes in him or her as a member of the commission carries with it the entitlement not to be interviewed by his or her fellow commission members to assess his or her suitability.  It further follows that it would confer on him or her the small but totally practical right to say that as a member of the commission and a holder of high constitutional office, rather than being interviewed by one's fellow members and putting them in the position of choosing to accept or reject, to short-list or not to short-list, he or she will indicate to the secretary to the Government that he or she is available to fill the position, rather than causing any embarrassment.  What if the President of the High Court was appointed to be President of the Court of Appeal or an ordinary member of the Supreme Court?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If that happened and it was printed in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>, would it matter a damn that the commission was or was not in favour of such a thing?  Would anybody say it was a scandal that the President of the High Court had been made a permanent member of the Supreme Court on which he had in the past sat as an ordinary member at the invitation of the Chief Justice?  Would anyone say it was a scandal because the commission and his fellow commissioners did not recommend him?  What reality is there to that?  If there is none, let us forget section 47 and take the honest, straightforward path of excusing the fellow commissioners from the embarrassment of having to assess one of their own number and put him in a competitive process to get on a three-member list with other people and simply allow a commissioner to indicate a willingness to serve.  Let us leave it to the Government of the day to choose between those shortlisted and the commissioner who has indicated his willingness to be selected.  Nothing could be more efficient, sensible and less open to criticism than such an arrangement.<br/><br/>What would be open to criticism, however, would be the opposite scenario in which the President of High Court put his name forward, was interviewed, considered by the other commissioners, placed on the shortlist and selected by the Government.  People would say &quot;Big deal&quot;.  Would they seriously expect he would not be included on the shortlist?  Let us be honest.  Our amendment is a great deal more practical and a great deal more realistic.  It is a great deal less worthy of smoke-filled rooms or dark scenarios than the Minister's proposal.  The people would understand immediately that if the President of the High Court wished to be considered for ordinary membership of the Supreme Court, it would be more honest and straightforward to write to the Secretary of the Government and asked to be considered than to put the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal and fellow commissioners to the embarrassment of having to interview a person with whom they have been making choices before and with whom they will continue to make choices afterwards.  It would be to pretend to go through the process of including or excluding the President of the High Court from a shortlist.  I wonder which is the less credible scenario, my amendment or the Minister's section?  I consider it ridiculous that the public are to expect that the President of the High Court has to be interviewed by fellow commissioners and shortlisted to be one of three in order for the Government to consider him for membership of a court on which is already <i>ex officio </i>entitled to participate when invited.</p></speech>

I am not impugning their reputations or behaviour but they are human beings and there could, indeed, arise an element of vindictiveness, jealousy, malice or spite.  Someone might enjoy giving a poke to the President of the High Court if he or she went forward.  How can the President of the High Court be deemed competent to judge someone else's suitability if he or she is not suitable?  The very fact of putting the President in the position of having to judge the suitability of a candidate, puts him or her in an equal or superior position to that person.  If one is making a judgment on someone, it suggests one is his or her equal or superior.  I agree completely with Senator McDowell that the section is a nonsense and I support strongly the amendment he has tabled.</p></speech>

Therefore, I do not propose to have too long a debate on it.  Senator Norris thought we had debated it already but, in fact, we debated a very similar amendment that the Minister rejected.  I will not, therefore, reiterate the debate at great length.  However, it seems to me absurd that if I am on a shortlist of three and am recommended and a vacancy of the same type occurs a month later, the Government gets a shortlist on which I no longer appear.  I am deemed not to have been a recommended person even though I was recommended a month earlier.  In the circumstances, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

There is no earthly reason a person who has already gone through the application process for a previous position should have to do so again.</p></speech>

It is perfectly obvious that the person is eminently suitable. It gives the Government of the day the opportunity to appoint a person who may have been a close second on a previous occasion.  Under the Bill as drafted, that opportunity might not be there.  This is an important amendment and it is eminently sensible.  Why should someone who has been adjudged suitable and appropriate have to go through the whole rigmarole again and make another application?  It is complete nonsense.  As for wasting time and tedium, this is a completely tedious process.  It is a complete and utter nonsense and I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</p></speech>

What the Senators have in mind is a concept of "once recommended, always recommended".  That can present difficulties in so far as the workings of the commission are concerned.  I do not know how this would work.  For example, would it mean that a person would be recommended for a period of a year or two years?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Is it envisaged that a recommendation would remain live and active after two years?  Would there be a requirement that a further recommendation be made in respect of a new vacancy or would the commission be obliged to have no regard for any person other than those individuals already recommended?  If the intention here, as in the previous amendment, is to cut out the commission entirely, that would not be an acceptable approach.  I refer to this "once recommended, always recommended" approach being used to circumvent the commission process.  If the latter is the case, it is an unintended consequence that I cannot countenance.</p><p>I will provide an example.  If there are three appointments over the course of a year, we could then have a bank of persons who would remain recommended.  We could, for example, have nine names for consideration in respect of one appointment.  That would obviously present a difficulty.  There are practical problems.  I do not believe the approach outlined is an appropriate way of dealing with things.  It is fair to state that if we look at the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, and the manner in which its recommendations are made, there is not, to my knowledge, any application of a once recommended, always recommended framework.  Different specified requirements for candidates may emerge from time to time in the order of ranking.  That would, of course, be prescribed by the procedures committee under Part 8.  I am not going to accept the amendment.  I fully understand the points made in support of it but having a situation where a recommendation remains live, perhaps for years, is not the best way forward.</p></speech>

If so, are they suitable to be on the Bench at all?  It seems perfectly clear that Senator McDowell's amendment is very sensible.  If judges are considered competent and suitable, I do not see any reason they should not remain under consideration for posts, unless the Minister is suggesting they do degrade in some way.  Supposing there were nine of them, as the Minister mentioned, is that not a wonderful tribute to the judicial system in this country?  It would be marvellous to have nine judges all eminently suitable for consideration.  I am of the view that they should all be considered.  I have no problem with that at all.  I do not mind if there are nine of them.</p></speech>

In a matter of months, somebody in the Supreme Court could retire, somebody from the Court of Appeal could then get that job and there would be another vacancy on the Court of Appeal.  In other words, it is not at all unlikely that appointments to courts, and the superior courts, at the same level will take place with considerable regularity.  I am hoping that would not be a daily or weekly occurrence but it would certainly happen a number of times in a year, on average, given the size of the Bench.</p> <p>Let us suppose a judge of the High Court applied to be considered for a position on the Court of Appeal.  Suppose also that he or she has been told that he or she has been shortlisted for that job and recommended to the Minister for appointment.  One of the other persons on the shortlist is then chosen and two months later an appointment to the same court at the same level becomes available.  Is that person seriously to be asked to reapply, resubmit himself or herself for appointment and take part in a competitive process to be on a second shortlist for recommendation to the Government?  Let us assume, for example, in the scenario I just painted, that two out of the three people shortlisted are not appointed.  Another vacancy at the same level then becomes available.  It is advertised because that is the process.  Is the person who was not successful seriously to be asked would he or she now resubmit an application?  Would he or she be expected to compete against people, including some who may not have been applicants for the first position, who may knock him or her off the list if they are viewed by the commission as being better nominees than our original candidate?  How often is a High Court judge to be asked to do that in a year?  If that happened three or four times a year, at what stage will the High Court judge decide that he or she has had enough?</p> <p>If that judge has been told that he or she has been recommended and the Government is aware of his or her existence as a recommended person, why should we go through the whole process again of reminding the Government that the individual concerned is a recommended person?  Senator Norris asked the very good question as to whether the assumption here is that people degrade and become less suitable having been recommended.  It might perhaps be the converse and somebody else more suitable comes into focus.  My amendment does not state that a person will automatically be included in the next list.  It just means that person is noted by the Government as having already been recommended for a position.  The name of the person is included along with a fresh list of three other names.</p> <p>My amendment would mean a person would not be required to go through the whole process again.  In the example I have given, the Government could look at the four names before it.  It could then decide that the person who was the runner-up the last time, to use that phrase, is the person it is going to appoint this time.  That is especially the case in view of the Government's rejection of Senator Bacik's proposal that there be a running order.  The Government is not going to know the commission's preference for first, second and third in the ranking.  If the Government chooses an applicant, it is not going to know that the other two were ranked in any particular order.  I cannot see that anything will be lost by accepting this amendment.  The Minister asked if there is some time limit to all of this.  If a person is recommended in 2019, is he or she to be there forever?  Would he or she be there in 2027, for example, lurking in the wings-----</p></speech>

I would be happy to go along with such a wording.  The principle of what I am talking about, however, is, again, to make the system work.  It is intended to prevent the Bill, if enacted, from reducing the process of appointment to the Judiciary to a constant beauty contest whereby applicants must keep applying and competing for inclusion a shortlist against unknown new personnel from the Bar, as well as solicitors.  If applicants fall off the edge of the list in that situation, their eligibility for appointment is then deemed to have gone.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is wrong.

To my mind this is where it would impinge on the free hand of the Government in respect of the constitutional requirement.  In any event, looking at Senator McDowell's scenario, the practice, as I envisage it, will be that if a person who is recommended is not appointed that person may well be the subject matter of a positive recommendation at the earliest opportunity thereafter.  This will be an issue of which the Government will be mindful.  There is a practical solution to the point without introducing a new concept, which the amendment envisages, and that is that once a person is recommended that recommendation remains for however long the legislation might deem fit.  I see what the Senator is saying about the time limit.  I am not minded to introduce an amendment with a time limit.  Rather, I see a practical solution to this, which I am confident the commission in its wisdom will be mindful to apply.</p></speech>

If the Government received the nominations of three people ranked in order of preference, it would be terribly odd if it did not consider them in the ranking presented?  Why on earth would it not consider them in that ranking?  It would want to have a very clear and specific reason not to do so and I cannot understand why it would not do so.  If one is presented with a list of preferred candidates ranked one, two and three in order of fitness, why on earth would one start with number 3?  Why not start with number one and then move to number two followed by number three?  That would be the obvious thing to do and I cannot understand any reason why one would not do it.</p></speech>

I had forgotten about the subsection in section 40.  Owing to his stated opposition to Senator Bacik's amendment, I had assumed there was not a process of ordering the list in accordance with the commission's preference.  To return to the question of members of the commission being placed at number three rather than number one in the order of preference.  That is yet another reason the amendment the House just made is a sensible one.</p> <p>To go further, if the Government were, for instance, to select the third preferred choice of the commission and appoint that person, it would be very strange if the occupants of positions one and two had to resubmit themselves to the commission for re-evaluation in the light of the Government selecting a lower ranked recommendee.  Is the Minister of the view that the order in which people were recommended would be made known to the people recommended?  In other words, if I were recommended as a judge to the Government for appointment, would I be told that I was recommended number one or number three or would I be left in the dark on that subject?  If I am left in the dark on that subject, it could affect my willingness to apply again.  If I had been bypassed in favour of somebody else or, alternatively, if others were bypassed in favour of me, I might think the Government clearly does not want me and there is not much point in applying again.  Is it envisaged that in light of the requirement that it comply with best practice, which is set out in the Bill, would the commission tell somebody that he or she came first on its list or would the candidate be left in the dark on that subject?</p></speech>

After all, we are empowering and enabling the commission to set its own rules in terms of the practice and procedure.  I draw Senator McDowell's attention to section 53(5)(<i>g</i>) and (<i>h</i>) on the matter of the &quot;the need for good standards of communication with applicants for judicial office, and the provision otherwise of a good standard of service to them in respect of applications made by them under this Act&quot;.  That might fit the bill along the lines of the suggestion or proposal made by Senator McDowell.  It is eminently reasonable that the matter would be considered. </p></speech>

If the purpose of this legislation is to have a transparent process and one is going to say that the commission is obliged to give an order of preference, surely that information must be available to the people recommended, or not, as a matter of law, not just as a matter of the commission's discretion?  If I come first on the list and somebody who was recommended as number three gets the position, surely either I am or I am not, as a matter of law, entitled to know that is the situation?  Saying that one would leave it to the commission's own discretion as to whether I would be informed that I came first in the shortlist is a very non-transparent procedure.</p></speech>

It may well submit a number of names to the Government and allow the Government to consider them by way of an equality of recommendation.  In the circumstances, it is best to leave the matter to the commission to decide its ordering of rules.  If the commission decides to make a recommendation in order of preference, it would appear to me to be good practice that the applicant would be furnished with such information.</p></speech>

The Minister has referred the House a number of times to section 53(5)(<i>h</i>), which relates to the obligation on the commission to observe &quot;the need for good standards of communication with applicants for judicial office, and the provision otherwise of a good standard of service to them in respect of applications made by them under this Act&quot;.  The Minister has implied a number of times that this may be seen as imposing on the commission an obligation to inform a candidate for judicial office of whether he or she has been short-listed.  In my reading of it, though, it does not have that clear effect.  Therefore, we have tabled this amendment.  I hope that it will be accepted.  I cannot see any reason for it not to be.

If we expect unsuccessful and successful candidates to be told whether they have been short-listed, we should instruct the commission through the legislation that this is the policy it is to apply.  It only makes sense.  Imagine dealing with the scenario we discussed earlier.  The President of the High Court has recused himself from the process and allowed his fellow commission members to deal with it in his absence because he is interested in appointment to a position in the courts above his.  Either he will be told the outcome or he will not.  He is entitled to know it.  If he has gone to the trouble of applying, he is entitled to be told by his fellow commissioners whether he was on the shortlist.  If that applies to the President of the High Court, it applies to every other applicant.  Applicants are entitled to know whether they made the shortlist.</p><p>The alternative view is people are to be left banging their heads against a stone wall not knowing whether they will ever be, or have ever been, short-listed.  I can well imagine a senior solicitor or barrister who is seeking to be recommended.  To leave such a person in the dark and not tell him or her whether he or she has ever been short-listed would be slightly insulting to the person.  If, after five applications, the person has not been short-listed on any occasion, maybe the message will get through that it is pointless applying if he or she knows that.  However, if the person were to believe on the contrary that it was possible to get through after being short-listed on a number of occasions but where the Government had preferred someone else, he or she might view having another go as being worthwhile.  I cannot see any reason for this amendment not to be accepted.</p><p>I will put it to the Minister this way.  If the amendment is not accepted and I am being fobbed off with section 53(5)(<i>h</i>) as the best he can do on the question of transparency, I do not believe that anyone will be informed of whether he or she was short-listed.  In the absence of a clear statutory direction to inform unsuccessful and successful candidates as to whether they were short-listed, the commission will take the view that it is better to keep these matters confidential.  That means the whole thing will be shrouded in secrecy and applicants will have no idea.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This reminds me of the story about an American television reporter interviewing a rabbi in Jerusalem.  The reporter suggested that the rabbi had been at the Wailing Wall for the past 50 years and he said "Yes, that's true".  When asked if he prayed there every day he said, "Yes, that's true".  When asked what he prayed for, he said peace, fraternity and love among people.  The interviewer then asked what he thought after 50 years and he said that sometimes he thought he was just banging his head off a stone wall.  We cannot have applicants for judicial office placed in that position.</p></speech>

They would be smarting after that.  It would be a little painful but, on the other hand, looking at the complexities of the Bill and other provisions which mean that the Government has to reveal things, it is obvious that this should happen and that we should attempt to break the <i>omerta</i>, or code of silence, that has been unconstitutionally imposed on the Attorney General in the Bill as currently drafted.  Bizarrely, as the legislation stands, the Attorney General is forbidden, on pain of criminal offence, from revealing to the Cabinet any persons who sought judicial office as part of the commission's appointment process.  That is absolute madness in my opinion and, yet, under this amendment, if the commission is unable to recommend any person, for whatever reason, it is obliged to provide the name of every person who put himself or herself forward to the Minister.  Separately and just as bizarrely, the commission is only bound to provide the Minister with the applicant's education, professional qualifications, experience, character records and the results of any interview or test conducted by the commission in respect of the applicant if fewer than three persons are recommended for a particular position.  We have a ridiculous situation full of contrasts and paradoxes but this amendment goes a long way to resolve those inconsistencies and paradoxes.  I will certainly be vigorously supporting Senator McDowell's amendment.</p></speech>

It would place a duty on the commission to notify each and every applicant but Senators will recall that during the lengthy debate on 20 February, I agreed to accept an amendment moved by Senator Craughwell, namely, amendment No. 87b.  I doubt that Senator Norris has a clear recollection of it but it is on the third additional list of amendments.  The import was to insert a new section relating to the provision of information to applicants.  Said section will ensure than an applicant is informed as to whether he or she was the subject of a recommendation for the purposes of Chapter 2 of Part 7 and whether it was the case that the commission considered the person was not eligible for appointment.  There could be an ineligibility of which the person would, quite rightly, be entitled to be notified.  I made it clear that in the event of there being any unforeseen difficulty regarding the wording as proposed by Senator Craughwell, we could revert to the matter on Report Stage.  The statutory duty that amendment No. 93c seeks to impose is effectively the same as that set out in paragraph (a) of the new section 42 inserted by Senator Craughwell's amendment, which was presumably supported by Senators McDowell, Lawless and Norris.  That is the good news but in view of the fact that there may be an overlap and that said overlap might give rise to confusion, if not uncertainty, I am reluctant to accept amendment No. 93c.  However, I am satisfied that what is contained in the amendment is already covered in the amendment from Senator Craughwell that I was willing to accept on 20 February.</p></speech>

The latter were part of a series of amendments that the Ceann Comhairle ruled could not be moved in the Lower House for procedural reasons.  Section 47, to which these two amendments relate, provides for the recommendation to the Minister of a commission member and for the recusal of such member.  Taken together, these amendments are, to a large extent, consequential on the inclusion of the Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court on the commission.  The amendments provide, by extending the section, for their recusal where they have applied for appointment to judicial office and for their replacement in such event by the most senior judge of the relevant court.  The amendments which, in substance, are focused on amendment No. 95, also deal with the recusal of the Bar Council or Law Society nominees and their replacement on the commission in these limited circumstances by another practising barrister or solicitor.  I regard these additions as being necessary but I could not move them on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I will defer to Senator McDowell on the matter of amendments Nos. 96 and 97.</p></speech>

Senators will recall that, in the initial drafting of the Bill, it was suggested that there would be a smaller number of judges and that a series of sub-committees would sit from time to time, as appropriate.  On reflection, I felt it was desirable that there would be an <i>ex officio</i>place on the commission for each of the presidents and these amendments specifically deal with what would have been the new members, the Presidents of the Circuit Court and District Court, rather than, as heretofore, being on what a sub-committee or subset, that they would now sit on the commission.  It is following on the need for a recusal on their part where they have made an application for appointment themselves.  I am informed, insofar as this applies to the Presidents of the Court of Appeal and High Court, they would, in the normal course of events, recuse anyway.</p></speech>

That new subsection refers to &quot;a case to which <i>subsection (3)</i>applies, and the person to whom that subsection applies is&mdash; (a) a person referred to in section 10(1)(d), (e), (h) or (i).&quot;  The people referred to in section 10(1)(d), (e) and (f) are the Presidents of the District Court, Circuit Court and the Attorney General.</p><p>The amendment continues: (&quot;b) a person who is a member of the Commission by virtue of <i>section 17(5) </i>or <i>(6) </i>[which is a practising barrister or solicitor] whoever of the following is appropriate shall, notwithstanding anything in <i>section 10(1) </i>or <i>17(5) </i>or <i>(6)</i>, be a member of the Commission for the purpose, and the purpose only, of the performance by it of the particular function&quot;.  </p><p>The amendment then outlines that where the applicant is the President of the Circuit Court, the next most senior ordinary judge of the Circuit Court available shall be a member of the commission.  In a case in which the applicant is the President of the District Court, the next most senior of the District Court available shall be a member of the commission.  In a case where the applicant is a barrister, another practising barrier appointed by the General Council of the Bar in Ireland shall be a member of the commission.  It is a similar situation for solicitors.</p><p>A substitute is, therefore, provided for where the President of the District Court or Circuit Court is applying for a judicial office.  There is an application for a substitute from the respective court to be appointed.  Likewise, if a barrister has been nominated, another barrister has to come on in his or her place.  The same applies to a solicitor but not to the Attorney General because nobody substitutes for the Attorney General.</p><p>As I read this now, we are creating a lacuna in the case of the Presidents of the Court of Appeal and the High Court.  No substitute is provided for them if either of them applies.  The Bill does not provide that the next most senior judge of the Court of Appeal is deemed to be a member of the commission, nor has that been applied to the next most senior ordinary judge of the High Court.  I cannot understand why there is an omission in respect of the Presidents of the Court of Appeal and High Court and why there are no substitutes provided for their positions whereas this section seems to do so for the other three courts and the two professional members of the commission.</p></speech>

That is the model the Minister has proposed for section 44.  This is different.  This is dealing with the President of the High Court becoming an ordinary judge of, say, the Supreme Court.  It is not a section 44 appointment at all according to the Minister's model under that section, although it would be different if he had accepted my model of that section.  On his model, it is a job for the commission to fill ordinary positions in the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.  If the applicant happens to be the President of the Court of Appeal or High Court, applying for one of those positions, the Minister is leaving no substitute for them on the commission from either of those courts.</p></speech>

Every few weeks, we see these stories in the media.  They are often posted by people who are searching for properties online.  These stories then make it into the media.  They reflect the depths of desperation we have reached in the rental crisis.  Such stories will profile an advertisement for a rental letting that screams of the indignity of being a modern renter.  It is either a bed in a dorm room shared with several other people, a bed shared with a stranger, or a furnished shed or fabrication at the end of a garden, sometimes in the absence of planning permission.  What is more astonishing is that, even after media attention and online attention is brought to these lettings, the advertisements remain online.  They are rarely removed by the online letting agent and I presume and expect that most, if not all, end up getting rented out.</p> <p>It is depressing to go apartment hunting right now.  Some landlords seeking to take advantage of the housing crisis and the desperation of many are making such rooms available and advertising them online in the full knowledge that they are not within the law.  I will talk about existing legislation and regulations.  The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017 set out a robust series of measures regarding habitable standards in areas such as ventilation, heating, fire safety, sanitary facilities and basic kitchen facilities.  There is good reason for these regulations.  They set out a minimum standard so that people can live in a house or apartment and have their most basic needs catered for.  Equally, we have overcrowding legislation in section 63 of the Housing Act 1966.  However outdated it is, it sets out that people renting in a shared room must have 400 cu. ft. of their own space.  This means that cases of beds in dorm rooms shared with multiple strangers and cases of beds shared with a stranger are almost certainly outside of existing legislation and fire safety standards.  Council inspectors are struggling to fight against rogue landlordism.  Cash-strapped local authorities are largely failing to take on these landlords due to competing obligations and stretched resources arising from the housing crisis.  As a result, a lack of enforcement and effective rent control has brought us to a point of desperation.  Sub-standard housing is provided for inflated rents.   Many tenants are unaware of their rights or lack confidence in asserting those rights because they feel lucky to have a place at all.  While we are in the throes of a housing crisis caused by a lack of quantity, the Minister of State will know that we cannot neglect our commitment to quality.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is currently a rewarding time to be a landlord and it should not, therefore, be acceptable that minimum standards should not be met as a result of lack of investment by landlords.  The Bill seeks to curb the advertising, particularly online advertising, of substandard rental properties that do not meet existing legal rental standards, including overcrowding and fire safety regulations.  This short Bill does not seek to change the regulations; rather, it simply seeks to ban the advertising of properties that do not meet those regulations.</p><p>I will quickly outline the Bill's provisions.  Section 2 proposes the insertion of a new section 56A into the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011.  It deals with allowing the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, to issue directions to online platforms and letting agents to remove advertisements that breach current minimum standard regulations within a seven-day period.  It also allows for members of the public to report advertisements to the PSRA.  Although, the minimum standards regulations are a robust series of measures, breaches are not always obvious from photographs and a threshold of evidence would be required.  Subsection (5) would grant the PSRA powers to investigate and consult with advertisers to determine the threshold that may be needed in a manner similar to the code of conduct governing letting agents.  Letting agents in our towns and villages do not advertise in their shop windows properties that do not meet minimum standards.    </p><p>I met the PSRA on this matter and I concede that the Bill may need more clarity.  I will table amendments on Committee Stage to achieve that clarity.  I will also seek amendments on Committee Stage to deal with instances where the PSRA receives a complaint regarding a property that requires physical investigation.  In such cases, it should be able to request the relevant local authority to carry out the inspection on its behalf.</p><p>Ultimately, the Bill allows the Minister to set the operation of this legislation.  It can only be commenced if he and his Department are ready to go.</p><p>Although the PSRA does not currently have a remit to regulate online platforms, no other State body does either.  Given its experience in working with letting agents in this regard, it is best placed to achieve an effective response to this problem.</p><p>I wish to confirm that social media is included in this legislation and that persons may refer a social media ad to the PSRA in the same manner as a rental ad on any other platform.  The majority of social media advertising takes place on Facebook.  It currently operates an advertising policy whereby it does not approve ads that are in breach of the laws of any given jurisdiction.  This legislation would hold that policy to account.  Ideally, social media sites and rental platforms would self-regulate to ensure compliance with this law.  I am sure that is a subject which the Minister of State will address.</p><p>On the Fine Gael amendment to delay the Second Reading for six months, my opinion and that of Sinn F&eacute;in is that it is a dishonest delaying tactic.  I wonder if the Government is too embarrassed to vote against the proposal as it stands.  In delaying the legislation, is it saying that it is acceptable for illegal properties to be advertised on the market for the next six months?  I remind Fine Gael of the most recent time it submitted an amendment to a Bill I brought forward.  That Bill, co-signed by Senator Ruane, proposed a reduction of the voting age to 16 in certain elections.  The Government stated that it wished to consider the Bill further.  Six months on, there has been no engagement in spite of our attempts to bring that about.  When we brought the Bill back before the House it was opposed on the basis that a referendum would be held on the issue. However, that has not happened.</p></speech>

Such a delay is not a democratic proposal.  I call on Fine Gael not to stifle the efforts of this legislation but, rather, to work with me and other Members to ensure effective legislation is developed.</p> <p>The Bill is not a finished product.  There are multiple Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas to make it so.  No matter how long it takes or what form it may take, we are ready to work with the Government on the Bill.  The amendment tabled by Fine Gael does nothing to achieve any collaboration.  It is merely political cover to discourage the effort represented by the Bill.</p> <p>I wish to thank those who have supported the Bill.  It is the start of allowing renters to engage in the rental market with dignity and respect.  We want the current regulations to be enforced.  Properties that do not meet minimum legal standards should not be in the rental market.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House and say, &quot;Well done&quot;, to Senator Warfield for his action on this issue.  All Members have been aware of the prevalence of this issue since the downturn in 2007 or 2008.  Families had to move back in together, with children moving back to their parents' house or trying to find rental accommodation which has become increasingly scarce, particularly in our cities and especially on the east coast, where it is out of the reach of most young people.</p><p>In 2017, we became aware of the problem of substandard accommodation.  At that stage, Rathmines was a kind of bedsit haven - it still is, to some extent - for people from the country who came to Dublin for a job.  The accommodation in those bedsits was dubious, to say the least.  However, we have come a long a way in terms of hygiene standards, personal space, healthy living and healthy homes.  We expect far more than putting up with what is on offer.  However, some cases have seen the re-emergence of the almost slum-like conditions that were once prolific in Dublin.  In the early 1900s, the city was known throughout the world as the slum capital of Europe.</p><p>Those conditions are again evident in some properties in Dublin, as was particularly revealed by the 2017 &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; television programme on the issue.  Unfortunately, the three houses investigated in that programme were in my constituency and the neighbourhood of Crumlin.  There were 64 people living in a house, with 16 people shoehorned into each dirty single bedroom.  In an unauthorised development in Kilmainham, Dublin 8, bunk beds took up every available space, with 30 or 40 people sharing the property.  It was eventually shut down because it was an unauthorised development but its owners certainly got their money's worth out of its temporary occupiers.  In Rathmines, 23 women shared a two-bedroom house.  These cases date from last year and the year before, not back in the days when we shut up and put up with such conditions because we did not expect to have our own space.  Having one's own space is not a luxury.  Rather, it is an acceptable standard which has been deemed healthy to have.</p><p>If I am paying money for accommodation, I expect standards to be maintained.  The clear standards that are in place have been breached on many occasions, as revealed by inspections.  How much clearer can one get than a report that states there is immediate danger to the welfare and safety of tenants in a building?  There are flagrant abuses of advertising standards on websites such as <i>daft.ie</i>, Facebook and <i>spotahome.com</i>.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What it says on the tin is not what we get inside.  What we get inside are stuffy, unhealthy, mouldy and damp small spaces where people are meant to sleep, eat and live.  We will not accept that any more.<br/><br/>There are unfit rental properties in the city and people are making a fortune out of them.  These people run around unfettered enjoying their ill-gotten gains from various homes in the rental sector.  There are multiple breaches of fire safety, never mind overcrowding.  There are no escape routes or fire alarms.  I understand local authorities, which provide housing assistance payments and rent supports, endeavour to inspect homes for breaches of fire safety and other safety standards, such as rat infestations, but they are overwhelmed.  Last year, only 4% of rental properties were inspected.  Of this miserly 4%, 70% failed to meet the standards set for the payment of public moneys to landlords through the housing assistance payment and other rent supports.<br/><br/>The resources of local authorities have been cut to the bone.  I do not blame the local authorities in that they do not have the resources.  We need to bolster these resources because the situation is becoming progressively worse.  We are trying to play catch-up all the time but unscrupulous landlords have ways and means of staying under the radar.  The same property reappears on the same advertising sites with a different slant on it and perhaps a different number on the door.  These landlords use various means to get away with duping people into believing they are getting reasonable accommodation.  People are looking for reasonable accommodation, not top-end luxury.  We need more resources and a greater willingness to enforce regulation.  The purpose of this Bill is that certain advertisements would be called out and banned.<br/><br/>I am a Dubliner and this practice seems to be prolific in the city.  I went on to <i>daft.ie</i>to see a shed being offered after a woman showed it to me.  She was mildly intellectually disabled and she rented it at &euro;800 a month.  She explained to me that she was sick all of the time because she had to go to the main house to access toilet, bathroom, water and cooking facilities.  This slipped through the net.  Trying to make a complaint and get somebody to do something about it was impossible because many people stated they would take the accommodation.  Such is the desperation in the rental market.  Not only do we have utterly unsuitable accommodation and unscrupulous landlords, we have competition among desperate people trying to find somewhere to live.<br/><br/>Senator Conway-Walsh asked me to raise student accommodation and rural families paying way over the odds for substandard accommodation.  They allow their little ones travel to the big smoke to live a life but the accommodation is detrimental to them and their health.  It is their first time away from home and they want comfort.  We all want home comforts and we all deserve them, especially when we think we are paying for them.<br/><br/>I cannot see why the Minister of State would be so mean as to block or delay this legislation.  It makes sense.  It has taken years to get here.  I commend Senator Warfield on tabling the Bill for discussion.</p></speech>

I certainly recognise this.  The letting of properties is increasing throughout the country.  Obviously, the greatest pressure is in Dublin and the rental pressure zones, which include cities such as Waterford.  It is important that advertisements for lettings reflect accurately what is available to those interested in them.  Of most importance are the actual standards of accommodation that apply in lettings.  As we all know, demand is rising all the time and it is important that we increase the number of properties available for letting, whether apartments or houses.  We need to recognise in the debate the work that has been done in raising standards.  Many bedsits were excluded from the rental market recently.  For years, many landlords took advantage of tenants but they can no longer do so because substandard accommodation has been removed from circulation. Some time ago, calls were made to return some of the bedsits to circulation.  This would be a retrograde step.  We need to maintain the standard that has been set and find new ways of increasing supply to meet demand.</p><p>I recognise what the Minister has done recently in introducing new schemes to help increase availability and supply.  Under a scheme to bring homes back into use, supports, grants and incentives are offered to those who have vacant dwellings to renovate and regenerate their properties and offer them for letting at a proper standard.  The scheme is aimed at reducing vacancies and I commend the Minister on introducing it.  We should acknowledge every effort being made to increase supply.</p><p>Legislation is already in place to maintain proper standards.  The responsibility to do so rests with the housing authorities, which, whether we like it or not, are the local authorities.  They are closest to the ground to inspect properties and ensure an adequate standard of accommodation is maintained.  I acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister to increase funding to local authorities for inspections.  In his contribution, I am sure the Minister of State will tell us how much money is being invested and given to local authorities to carry out these inspections.  I am also interested in finding out about the performance of local authorities in inspecting private properties that are rented.  I suspect some are better than others.  The higher standard and performance should be adhered to and should at least be an objective and a target for all local authorities.  It is essential that proper standards are maintained.  We need adequate sanction where breaches are found.  We need to devise new ways of reporting breaches of substandard accommodation.  There should be online tools to inform local authority inspectors.  Simple photographs uploaded directly to a local authority inspectorate's website should be enough to raise awareness and possibly result in inspection and sanction if necessary.  There are ways to address this appropriately if the real need is there.</p><p>With regard to the Government amendment, the Opposition argues that we are trying to delay the Bill.  Obviously, I would not be so cynical.  It is reasonable for all of us to give the Minister, the departmental officials and the local authority inspectorates time to respond to the issues raised in the Bill.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State outline his rationale for requesting a period of several months, and that is all it is, to allow him and his officials to respond and take on board the views he hears in this debate and the concerns of those in various housing agencies who deal with tenants on a daily basis.  Further amendments might be needed at that stage.  This is a perfectly reasonable approach and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State address that issue.</p><p>Landlords have legal responsibilities and obligations and I they should uphold these obligations to the highest of standards.  They have to maintain proper standards of accommodation.  That is the law in this country.  As I stated, where breaches are known, local authorities have the powers to act and they should do so.  I am interested in learning how many inspections have resulted in sanctions.  The figure is possibly not as high as it should be.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We all know that there are substandard properties, including those owned by local authorities.  Many of us have been public representatives for many years and we often receive complaints from local authority tenants that their accommodation is not of the required standard.  The latter is despite the fact that the local authority is the letting body.  It is important that we have proper records and proper accountability in both the private and public rental sector in order to ensure that tenants are properly protected.</p><p>On the other hand, I am also conscious of the great demand existing for accommodation and we do not want to scare landlords out of existence.  We do not want landlords to give up rental properties when they are most needed.  The landlord representative bodies are stating that there is a major burden involved in becoming a landlord.  Many people are accidental landlords who may have had properties prior to marriage or something of that nature.  They have let those properties and are still paying the mortgages on them but the rent does not cover the latter.  There is a need for balance in the debate and we need to be careful that we do not scare away people who are letting properties and fulfilling the demand that exists.  I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's response.</p><p>It is important that we hear the concerns being expressed.  This Bill represents an attempt to address those concerns.  We have high standards for fire safety, sanitary, toilet and washing facilities and living space.  It is important that those standards are upheld.  It is also important that inspections are carried out.  Sanctions must apply where breaches of those standards are detected.  That is the best way to deal with substandard accommodation.  We must deal with it as it arises.  Local authorities must be encouraged to continue their inspections and resource them appropriately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-10a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019041000002#YY00200"><p>I thank my colleagues for bringing forward the Bill.  Legislation of this type can be very complicated but we need to find solutions to the problems that exist.  However, this legislation adds a layer of complexity to the rental market at a time when we need to be encouraging the availability of more units in the market and the retention of existing units.  We need affordable rental units for ordinary workers who are crippled by the market and we must also implement strategies to combat the scourge of dwellings that are unfit for occupation.  This Bill would make it illegal to advertise such dwellings.  As a matter of law, however, all landlords, big and small, have a legal duty to ensure that their rented properties comply with certain minimal physical standards.  These standards are set out in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017.  The issue of enforcing those regulations will be important in future.  It does not matter what regulations are brought in, if they are not enforced they are a waste of time.  That is where we are failing.  Enforcement is key.  As it is already illegal to rent out an unfit dwelling, advertising such a dwelling falls within the realm of misleading advertising complaints.  Under the Consumer Protection Act 2014, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, can take action, where appropriate, against businesses found to be misleading consumers.  The question arises then as to how each agency verifies a unit is unfit.  All of these questions need to be answered.  The Bill gives no clear indication as to what burden of administration would be placed on letting agents, newspapers and online advertisers to check each and every property.  Relying solely on complaints to the PSRA ignores the role of that body and its resources.</p> <p>Unfit dwellings should be dealt with by means of a new national inspection quality certificate.  That is what we need to look at for the future.  Every tenant should have an inspection quality certificate stating that his or her property is up to standard.  Local authorities should be adequately resourced to carry out their duties in inspecting rental properties to ensure they are fit for purpose.  It is also up to the local authorities to inspect private rental accommodation.  We need to find ways to strengthen the ability of local authorities to review the entire system and raise standards overall.  Unfit dwellings will become a rarity if that is done.  It is in this aspect of the process that we are falling down.  The national inspection rate is 4.96% and the average national failure rate is 80.5%.  The low inspection rate in Dublin, and other cities, and the high failure rate underlines the need to ramp up local authority inspections and further illustrates the need for a comprehensive national quality certificate for the rental market.  That quality certificate would be similar to the building energy rating, BER, certificate and would give assurance to all renters if it was backed up by a comprehensive rental regime.</p> <p>That is important and that is where we can make a change.  Fianna F&aacute;il has published legislation to extend rent pressure zone designations that are due to expire at the end of this year.  I want that legislation to be brought in now.  In 2016, when the rent pressure zones were introduced, the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, stated that he did not expect there would be any necessity to provide for further orders after the three period expired because additional supply, combined with the three years of rent predictability, would have eased the pressure in the rental market in the areas concerned.  That has been a total failure and, as a result, the rental market has been a failure.  That is unacceptable.  I see evidence of this in my area, which, because of the way the road network is designed, is part of the commuter belt adjacent to Dublin.  Rents have reached more than &euro;1,100 per month for homes in Carlow.  It is not just in the county town that this is happening.  The same rent rises are happening in the west and south of the county.  I have long called for an overall review of rent pressure zones and I have been accused of asking the Minister to do something illegal by changing the zones.  Action must be taken because the cost of renting in County Carlow, in rural and urban areas, is just eye-watering.  It pushes people into poverty and an accommodation limbo.  People cannot save to buy a house and are forced to make long commutes from towns where they can afford the rent.</p> <p>Something does need to be done for tenants.  However, we must also look at the overall situation.  During my time on Carlow County Council, I was a firm believer in having clarity, enforcement and proper education regarding what is possible in a given situation.  We need to spend some time on this issue and I will agree to extending the time available.  We all need to work together.  I compliment the proposers of the Bill but there is not enough clarification of many issues in the proposed legislation and too many issues are also not addressed in it.  We all need to look at this issue again, develop further solutions and take it from there.</p></speech>

I am in favour of this Bill and I commend Senator Warfield, his colleagues and his staff on the hard work they have done preparing it.  I hope this legislation can progress quickly.  All legislation goes through detailed scrutiny and reading at the relevant committees and that can only be helpful in progressing Bills.  The proposal before us, however, is already very strong.  It is something we should support.  I will not speak at length about the nuts and bolts of the legislation because Senator Warfield has given a clear, thoughtful overview of why this proposal is needed and its practical impact.</p> <p>This is a straightforward common-sense proposal.  I am surprised the PSRA, or some other similar body, is not already carrying out the kind of oversight function proposed in the Bill.  The Minister of State may feel that systems for quality control are already in place.  The examples cited by Senators, however, that are appearing in newspapers every week, are surely evidence that those quality control measures are not working properly.  The stories regarding large groups of people sharing tiny cramped rooms are disgraceful.  The people in those situations are often migrants or members of other disadvantage communities.  I have no doubt the Minister of State agrees that it is disgraceful.</p> <p>I was reared in the tenements in the 1960s and 1970s.  I know what it is like to live in a house full of people.  The houses next door to us were jam-packed with families and there were often as many as ten children in each family.  It is different today.  There was a community spirit back then and everybody looked after each other.  Today, we are dealing with adults crammed into tiny little rooms.  This is degrading and a horrendous way for any human being to live.  We recently opened a new tenement museum on Henrietta Street.  Looking at some of the rental properties in Dublin, such a museum may not be necessary.  That is the reality of the situation.  I am glad to see the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, supporting this legislation and other proposals on housing.  It is right for USI to fight this awful situation and the union has my full support.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> In terms of the Bill before us, it is not a radical proposal to say that letting agents should assume a meaningful level of responsibility for what is being advertised.  The Minister of State would agree that one would not let a car dealership advertise and facilitate the sale of vehicles below the minimum legal standards.  Similarly, I do not believe letting agents should be facilitating rental properties that do not meet the legal minimum standards.  We set these legal standards for a reason and we need to ensure they are met.  This should not place too high a burden on the letting agents.</p><p>Looking at the Bill, the most likely outcome in practice would be that individuals will see and report these sorts of properties and the PSRA would make an assessment and issue direction to the letting agents.  The agents will not need to do lengthy exhausting reporting.  A process such as this might also make some letting agents reconsider the quality controls they put in place, which can help further.</p><p>Senator Coffey stated this would scare landlords out of existence.  To be honest, some of them need to be scared out of existence because what they are doing is horrendous.</p><p>Overall, there is deep frustration among the Opposition that while we can keep fighting on this issue, we cannot allocate the resources needed to fix the crisis.  Restrictions on the right of the Opposition to legislate often mean we cannot compel the State to act, for example, to build social and affordable housing.  That is ultimately the decision of the Government.  While the Government may stick to the contention that the current policies are working, I would ask the Minister of State to look at the evidence, that is, the numbers on paper and on Dublin streets, and reconsider this position.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, is a good man.  He is authentic and he cares so I would ask him to reconsider this.</p><p>What the Opposition can do, however, is look at how the system is operating and try to improve on that.  We can look, for example, at the dysfunctional rental market and how it works in practice.  We can see obvious fixable problems, such as below standard properties being advertised, and try to address them.  This Bill takes an important step in that direction and I commend it to the House.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Warfield on the publication of the Bill and bringing it to the House.  Contrary to what Senator Black said, the Government is prepared to work with everybody to ensure the Bill is a better Bill.  That is why the amendment being put by Government is a reasonable and fair one.</p><p>All of us recognise that we have travelled some road in terms of the need to put in place strict advertising guidelines on the principles around which properties can be advertised.  I have to be honest and say that I have been with potential tenants who have wanted to rent a property.  I have gone with them to look at the property and what one sees in a glossy brochure is way different to what is the reality. That is something on which <i>myhome.ie</i>put in place a sort of a code and procedures in 2017.  The issue of equality in terms of advertising is also something that we should look at and work with.</p><p>Given that our model of delivery of housing is that we are moving towards a European style where people are living more in urban areas of the inner city and in dwellings that are less than habitable, there must be a balance struck between the need to enforce and penalise and the need to upgrade.  I have never been afraid to work with residents to bring landlords to the then Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, to maintain and upgrade properties.</p><p>Equally, we need private landlords to be part of the housing solution.  It is important a standard is upheld in terms of renting.  I suppose my primary focus is that I genuinely support the overarching principle the Bill is trying to achieve.  We need to place an emphasis on landlords being good landlords.  That means living in communities among people with property that is not only fit for habitation but is a home.</p><p>Just this week, the residents' association where I live handed in the notice for the collection of the so-called &quot;dues&quot; to pay for the maintenance of the public area.</p></speech>

There can be no diminution from that point of view.</p> <p>A debate we need to have, as part of the housing debate, is on how we can provide incentives to people, for instance, in Cork, to avail of the living over the shop scheme so that they can live in the city and be part of urban living which we will see more of in the coming years.  Under Project Ireland 2040, for example, the Government is ambitious for the city of Cork, where I live, with the primary focus on people living in the city and on what that means in terms of types of accommodation, public transport and services and facilities available.</p> <p>The Government proposal is a reasonable compromise so that we can make the Bill better.  It is about ensuring that we can work with local authorities and the different stakeholders to bring about the desired result which Senator Warfield and we all want to see achieved.  It is about ensuring that we create modern homes for different family types.  That means looking at the kind of grants and supports available and at how we can provide incentives, whether under the realm of climate change with energy retrofitting or in terms of incentivising the urban property owners to be able to modernise their buildings in keeping with the public realm.</p> <p>We have over the past number of years changed the responsibility threshold to put more emphasis on landlords having responsibilities, which is to be welcomed.  It is important that there is a monitor of the standard of accommodation.  It is important that we understand that tenants and landlords must co-exist and that people deserve to live in proper accommodation in terms of what is being advertised.  The advertising is the point that this Bill is about.  We need to pause and reflect on what we want to achieve.</p> <p>Senator Warfield has intimated that he is not in favour of the Government amendment and that is his prerogative.  I would hope that we would not divide the House and that we would allow for the Government to come back and make the Bill better.  My overarching thought is that this is something that I support but I understand where the Minister is coming from.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimhe chuig an diasp&oacute;ireacht anocht.</p> <p>I thank and commend Senator Warfield on the legislation before us for discussion tonight.  In doing so, I also want to thank Members who have contributed thus far to this important debate.  I also take the opportunity, because it is glaringly obvious in the Chamber tonight, to comment on the level of participation on this issue because, as everyone has acknowledged, regardless of where one falls on the Bill, the amendment or whatever, we have all acknowledged that this is an issue of crisis levels.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a Statewide emergency being faced by our people.  Sometimes, on the Order of Business, one will get a queue out the door of Members to lament the housing crisis and to talk about homelessness.  However, when we have legislation in front of us which seeks to give expression to the legal standards and requirements in place for rental properties, where are they?  I am disappointed by this.  I have no doubt those outside this Chamber who have an expectation will be watching this debate.  Some parties and groups are not represented here this evening which is disappointing.  However, that is the way it is.</p><p>We heard from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael on the amendment.  We will be opposing it because we believe in parliamentary procedure.  As Senator Warfield outlined earlier, it is a case of once bitten, twice shy.  For example, Senators Warfield and Ruane brought forward legislation to reduce the voting age to 16 which we considered reasonable.  However, other parties opposed it and sought to delay it despite having policies in favour of it in some instances.  When it came back after six months without any engagement, we were told it was opposed because there would be a referendum which never occurred.</p><p>Submitting this legislation on Second Stage is to give the Government and our colleagues in the Seanad notice.  It is to ensure all engagement, which is the norm with parliamentary procedure and legislative protocol, can take place.  It is to ensure Members can come back on Committee and other Stages to amend, to tweak, to endorse, to oppose or to support the legislation.  I do not understand why, on the one hand, one can endorse the Bill&rsquo;s sentiment, tell everyone that one agrees that rental adverts need to be standardised and made appropriate in tune with the legal requirements but then, on the other, claim it must be done in six months or somewhere down the line.</p><p>When I first came to Dublin to carry out my parliamentary work and obligations, I, along with other Members, had to go on some of these websites to get accommodation.  Some of them do not even dress it up in terms of false advertising.  Some of them would scare one in terms of what is offered to people who are coming to work, live or study in Dublin or find themselves here in more unfortunate circumstances.</p><p>The Seanad has an opportunity to do something about it.  I do not know if it is a party political decision but during the last Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members&rsquo; business I made the point that a pattern is emerging.  Despite the collaborative approach the Seanad takes to issues which unite us, when Sinn F&eacute;in brings legislation to the House, even if it chimes with individual or party policies, people melt like snow off a ditch and do not want to know about it.  The Minister of State will appreciate and understand why we are extremely reluctant.  Given the importance of this issue, given what the Bill seeks to do and given the work Senator Warfield and his parliamentary assistant, Conor Stitt, have done on this Bill, we will not be seeking to long-finger it.  We will be seeking to put it to the people because something must be done in this area.  We will be all too willing to redden the faces of those who come in every day to lament the housing crisis but when they have the opportunity to support legislation on it, they are nowhere to be found.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-10a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019041000002#AAA00200"><p>I wish to thank Senators &Oacute; Donnghaile, Gavan and Warfield for bringing forward this Bill which provides us with an opportunity to discuss the advertising of unfit lettings.  Some rental properties are of such poor quality they should not be on the market, let alone advertised.  No Member would condone that.</p> <p>The Government has no problem with the Bill&rsquo;s principle.  We would be happy to work with Sinn F&eacute;in on introducing legislation in this area.  It is a priority area for the Government.  However, we have issues with how the Bill is drafted.  We do not have the luxury of working on it on Committee Stage when there has not been the chance of engaging on it to tease it out.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile said it is a case of once bitten, twice shy.  However, the Government has a good record of working with Senators on legislation.  I have offered many times to work through issues with Members.  I would rather we would work together for a positive outcome on a matter on which we all agree instead of having political rows.  We will have political arguments and ideological differences on many issues.  That is the nature of politics.  However, that should not be the case on matters on which we all agree.  There is an onus on us all to work through matters.  The Department is willing to do that but it needs more time to tease this particular issue out.  This particular issue does not just come under our Department&rsquo;s remit but that of others, such as the Department of Justice and Equality.  We have not had the time to work through this Bill with the other Departments and agencies.  This may require six months or less but we will work on it.  It is not a case of ducking, diving or hiding.  That is not what the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, or I are into.</p> <p>Senator Grace O&rsquo;Sullivan brought forward a Bill on microbeads a year ago.  A similar Bill was introduced in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Sherlock of the Labour Party.  At the time, I explained to Senator Grace O&rsquo;Sullivan that, while the Bill had its merits, it was not at the level we needed.  I gave a commitment, however, that we would deal with it.  We went through the whole procedures and we got it done.  It was back on the floor of the D&aacute;il in autumn.  When we say we will follow up on a Bill, we are genuinely committed and it is not a cover-up or a lie.  The Minister , Deputy Eoghan Murphy, would like time to work on this legislation.  We put forward the amendment because we need more time on it.  Sinn F&eacute;in has said it cannot and that is its prerogative.  However, co-operation for a positive outcome works both ways.  This is an issue on which we could get a result.  I would prefer to work on this positively to get a good result rather than going in the opposite direction and bringing it through Committee Stage when there are issues with it.  The latter action may end up with us not getting the result we want.  Will the Senators park this for several months to give us a chance to work on it?</p> <p>The Government agrees that platforms have responsibility for what they are advertising.  We accept the spirt of the Bill and its genuine attempt to improve the situation for tenants by ensuring that properties available to let are deemed fully compliant with minimum standards before they are advertised.  The Minister has stated he wants to work on this.</p> <p>Recognising the importance of the Bill and notwithstanding the challenging issues it presents, we have tabled an amendment to see how best we can consider and address the challenges presented in this area.  We are proposing that this Bill be read in six months&rsquo; time to give us the opportunity, in conjunction with the Department of Justice and Equality, to explore further the extent to which the underlying issue the Bill seeks to address is already addressed, or capable of being addressed, under existing housing legislation.  It would also allow for further consideration of associated issues with the Bill, in particular those related to the impact on and compliance with EU law, such as the e-commerce directive and possibly the services directive, as well as other elements which may be legally problematic.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have not had a chance to examine all of those matters because when we bring forward legislation, we must carry out various procedures to ensure it is correct and will work.  There is no point in passing legislation that might not stand up in law or work.  While I accept that it sends out a good, strong message, it might not be enforceable thereafter.  The Senator addressed the importance of being able to enforce what legislation we enact and I am a firm believer in that.  There is a duty on us all, therefore, to ensure that the wording is correct, which is why we asked to park the Bill to allow for further consideration of issues associated with it.  The law must be evidence based and when we legislate in this area, we generally try to gather evidence.  We have all seen the advertisements but we must carry out some more in-depth evidence gathering, although it will not have to take months.  We must also carry out some research with other Departments.  While that may take a little time, it will not necessarily take the full six months and we could bring forward an alternative sooner if we committed to that.</p><p>I acknowledge that the Senator is not proposing the Bill for the credit of any particular party.  Nevertheless, when we bring forward Private Members' Bills to which we have made changes, we always acknowledge that they were created in co-operation with, or started by, others and that we only had to tweak or change them.  In the case of the Prohibition of Certain Products Containing Plastic Microbeads Bill 2018, for example, we were clear in that regard.  We emphasised that it had originally been brought forward by the House and that individual Members had pushed for it.  There is no issue with that.  If something has to be fixed, we will try to fix it for people.</p><p>We are committed to exploring the issues further and on that basis, we seek Senators' support for our approach and their approval of our amendment.  While that is up to Senators to decide, it is a genuine effort on the part of the Government because we want to see some progress.  The Bill concerns the advertising of unfit properties but we wish to prevent unfit properties in the first place.  That is where our focus has been in recent years as we try to improve the standards of property.  As has been acknowledged, standards have come a long way over the years.  Nevertheless, that does not mean we are getting everything perfectly right and that all properties are acceptable.  Work is ongoing and we must deal with unfit properties.  They are a more fundamental problem than advertisements for properties.  If we could prevent properties from being unfit in the first place, the advertising would not be the concern because they would not exist.  I understand, however, that until we catch up on all those properties, there will remain rogue individuals who will try to advertise them and dupe people into renting them or handing over money. </p><p>As Senators will appreciate, the Bill raises and revisits some issues that have been considered and are being implemented in the Government&rsquo;s strategy for the rental sector, published in December 2016.  I accept that the majority of landlords can be said to be earning good money.  Some are good landlords, some are poor landlords, while others have no respect.  There is diversity in the rental sector.  It is hard to have this conversation and find some way to endorse the good landlords while addressing the issue of poor landlords.  Regulations and new laws are a way of doing that and we are trying to do that as much as possible.  Some landlords make exorbitant profits while others do not.  The Bill relates to the standards of properties.  We are trying to bring everyone with us on this journey and improve standards.  State-owned housing stock was mentioned, in which much money has been invested over the years, but we are still playing catch-up.  While we try to build more high-quality stock, the quality of some of the existing stock must be upgraded.  We are investing taxpayers' money in doing that every year.</p><p>It is worthwhile outlining to the House some of the issues the Bill, as initiated, presents and which will need to be addressed in our further consideration of the issues.  As it stands, the Bill would have significant resourcing implications for the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, and local authorities.  It also presents some legal challenges, given that the lead authority role for the legislation referenced is vested in the local authorities and not the PSRA.  Those challenges, while not insurmountable, will need some time to be teased out to determine the best way to advance the legislation.  While we agree with the proposals in principle, there may be a different way to provide for them and we will need to work with Senators in that regard.  The new section 56A(3) would provide that any person could refer a complaint to the PSRA in respect of an advertisement of a rental letting which the complainant considers to be in breach of the regulations, that is, the provisions under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, the Housing Act 1996 or the Fire Services Act 1981.  It is difficult to see how the PSRA would be in a position to adjudicate on whether any such property is substandard because under the Housing Acts, this is the responsibility of local authorities.  A mechanism would need to be developed to ensure that where a complaint is made to the PSRA in respect of advertisement of an allegedly substandard rental property, the PSRA would be able to check with the relevant local authority to confirm whether a particular rental property is substandard.  In fairness to Senator Warfield, he acknowledged that when he indicated it could be dealt with by amendments on Committee Stage.  We are both, therefore, flagging the same issue that needs to be resolved.  While there might be various ways to address it, we have identified the same issue.</p><p>This is likely to give rise to challenging legal and procedural issues, as well as a requirement for additional resources in the responsible bodies.  As I stated, we must ensure that the Bill is usable.  While we want to agree with its aims, we have to ensure that the legislation is workable in order that it will not be defeated in places outside of the House.  Given our heightened awareness of data protection issues due to the general data protection regulation, possible solutions will need to be assessed with data protection in mind.  This is a complication for the various bodies with different responsibilities.  It is red tape and hassle but we must nonetheless deal with it because data protection is a major issue of which we must all be aware.  It has complicated all our lives but when drafting legislation, we must follow the procedure and address it.  Again, it is not as easy as saying we support legislation and should, therefore, plough on with it.  While we would like to do that in many cases, we must examine the various issues that arise.</p><p>Section 19 of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 defines a potentially dangerous building and supports enforcement action by fire authorities where warranted.  The section contains an exclusion, however, for &ldquo;premises consisting of a dwelling house occupied as a single dwelling&rdquo;, which is interpreted as including individual apartments and flats within multi-unit buildings, as distinct from the common areas, etc.  This throws up a specific challenge that will need to be addressed, as the Bill would introduce an avenue of complaint for non-compliance by rental properties with section 19 of the 1981 Act, even though that section of the Fire Services Acts does not apply to individual dwellings.  I am just highlighting issues.  I do not mean to make a big deal out of them but wish to point out the matters we must address in one way or another if we are to make progress.  We must also be conscious of potential unintended consequences that may arise, including, for example, the potential of a reduction in the number of units being advertised on online platforms and the knock-on effect for prospective tenants.  As Senator Black stated, there is no problem if that eliminates all the poor properties, but we wish to ensure there are no unintended consequences either.  Sometimes there is a sense of fear when changes are brought in because people might hear different interpretations.  Our intention is to address that and put it to bed.  Today we launched a document about bringing homes back to market and tackling vacancy, and all the related rules and regulations.  From speaking to people who own properties that are not in use, we know they do not even engage with the system because they have a fear of red tape and of getting involved with the State, even though we want to work with them to bring their properties back into use.  There is a communication issue, therefore, in ensuring there are no unintended consequences.  The legislation must be tight, proper and clear.</p><p>On the existing minimum standards and regulation, I will outline initiatives undertaken to date, such as the minimum standard regulation, and some of the important work that is ongoing in this area.  We all agree that the regulation does not address everything and that some properties continue to slip through the system.  I do not deny that but instead I want to show that we are trying to tackle the issue and that improving the whole situation is a priority.  The regulations setting out minimum standards for private rented accommodation generally were first set out in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993.  A number of changes, however, have been made to the regulatory framework since then to reflect the requirements of the modern rental sector.  The current minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019.  The purpose of the regulations is to provide residential rental accommodation that is safe, efficient, durable and comfortable.  These regulations specify minimum health and safety requirements for a range of matters, including fire safety, structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, and gas and electrical supply.  With limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units, as well as private rented residential accommodation.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with the regulations.  Responsibility for enforcement rests with the relevant local authority.  Where someone believes that a property is being made available to rent in breach of the standards, the matter should be referred to the relevant housing authority.  Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with the requirements under the Act is guilty of an offence.  Fines for non-compliance with the regulations include a fine whose maximum has been increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000, while the daily fine for a continuing offence has been increased from &euro;250 to &euro;400.  </p><p>The strategy for the rental sector recognises that high-quality rental accommodation is critical to the success and sustainability of the residential rental sector and its attractiveness as a long-term accommodation option for households.  It sets out a number of important actions to ensure the safety and quality of rented accommodation by bringing rental standards up to date and strengthening processes for inspection and compliance.  A major review of the standards was conducted in 2016.  The aim was to ensure that the applicable standards reflect requirements of the modern rental market, contribute to delivery of high-quality housing and provide increased protection for tenants by addressing critical health and safety concerns, with particular focus on three main areas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->First, changes to existing provisions are being introduced to reinforce them and, where appropriate, to include additional provisions that are not already covered.  Second, local authority implementation is being strengthened through closer collaboration, co-operation and the dissemination of best practice.  Third, there is a focus on increasing awareness of the minimum standards.  The Department published comprehensive guidelines in August 2017 to assist and support local authorities in implementing the regulations.  Those guidelines are currently being updated.</p><p>The sector faces a number of serious challenges with regard to minimum standards.  We are not hiding issues like the low rates of inspection, the high numbers of non-compliant properties, the inconsistencies in interpreting and applying the standards and guidelines, and the lack of follow-up and enforcement action.  We are putting those issues out there.  We are saying we have to lift the sector to be able to deal with all of this.  The working group on rental standards was established in 2017 to develop proposals and make recommendations to give effect to the actions on standards set out in the rental strategy.  Three specialist subgroups of the working group have been established.  The IT subgroup is focusing on the development and roll-out of a national standardised IT system over the long term, as well as the development and purchase of software solutions to upgrade from current spreadsheet work systems, etc.  The training subgroup is focusing on the development and implementation of a training programme for enforcement officers.  Two such programmes have been run to date.  The housing subgroup hosts an annual seminar to share knowledge and best practice and to support continuous professional development.  We are trying to upskill the local authorities by giving them the people they need to be able to do this work.  The human resources subgroup focuses on examining and making recommendations and securing agreement on all other human resources aspects, including annual inspection targets, staff numbers, grading structures, funding, qualifications and legal services.  We are committed to this space.  We are trying to upgrade the system to be able to deal with demand.  We are not hiding from it.  We are not denying it.  The figures for inspections are there.  No one is hiding those figures.  We know where they need to go.</p><p>Specific ring-fenced funding for inspection and compliance activity has been identified from 2018 onwards to increase the number of properties inspected.  Annual targets for inspection and compliance have been agreed with the local authorities.  Between 2005 and 2017, over &euro;36 million was allocated to local authorities to assist them in performing their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation.  Over 229,000 inspections were carried out during this period.  Additional resources need to be provided to local authorities to facilitate increased inspections of properties and to ensure greater compliance.  Everyone in the House wants this to happen.  I think we all support it.  That is the space we are in.  Provision has been made for &euro;4.5 million of Exchequer funding to be made available to local authorities in 2019 for these inspections.  It is intended that there will be further increases each year up to 2021 to facilitate a targeted inspection coverage of 25% of rental properties annually at that stage.  By 2021, one in four properties - at a minimum - will be inspected every year.  From then on, one's property will be inspected every four years.</p><p>I wish we could get there straightaway or tomorrow.  We have to build up the team of people, the resources, the skills and the allocation of money.  The money is committed and allocated for this year and subsequent years to get us to that level.  The number of inspections conducted across the local authority sector in 2018 was 28,692, which represented an increase of over 9,000 on the 2017 figure.  These data were a little wrong earlier.  This is in line with the target for that year, which was to inspect up to 10% of tenancies.  I accept that this is not enough.  It is at 10%.  Some local authorities are very close to 100%.  The average across the country is approximately 10%.  The high non-compliance rates in those inspections were mentioned earlier in the debate.  We discussed this matter a number of months ago.  When one goes behind the details of such cases, one finds that many of these investigations and inspections were targeted.  They had a plan for where they were going in the first place.  I am glad they are finding high levels of non-compliance because that means they are doing their job right.  We want to increase the 10% to 25% as soon as we can.</p><p>It is important to look at the current responsibilities of the PSRA because this will help us to identify the changes needed to deliver on the intent of the Bill.  A key responsibility of the PSRA is to control, supervise and regulate licensed property services providers such as auctioneers, estate agents, letting agents and management agents.  The Act which established the PSRA sets out a number of standards.  It provides that where such standards are breached, the authority may - following an investigation - make a finding of improper conduct against the licensee for a breach of the Act.  A minor administrative sanction, or a major sanction up to and including the revocation of a licence, which must be confirmed in the High Court, may be imposed on the agent in such circumstances.  Areas of improper conduct impacting on a letting agent may include failure to complete a service-level agreement with the client or landlord, or failure to pass on rental income to the client or landlord.  If a minor sanction is imposed, the licensee has a right to appeal the sanction to the Property Services Appeal Board.  If a major sanction is imposed, the licensee has a right have it confirmed by the High Court.</p><p>The Act provides for a number of offences which must be investigated and prosecuted in the District Court.  As it stands, the PSRA has no power to direct a licensee to undertake any specified course of action.  Furthermore, it does not have the power to direct any other party - in this instance, the proposed online advertising platform - to undertake a specific action.  The potential role for the PSRA that is envisaged in the Bill before the House is well considered and innovative.  A motion to defer has been proposed to enable the Government to give further consideration to the matter.  We want to see how we can make it really workable.  We also want to tease out whether the PSRA is the right authority to perform this function.  Perhaps a different body would be more appropriate for these purposes.  We agree that an effort should be made to do this.  That is not what we are against at all.</p><p>I thank the Senators for bringing this Bill before the House and thereby giving us an opportunity to have this conversation.  This debate will inform our approach to continuing to advance this key area of priority for the Government.  Therefore, I ask the House to support our amendment.  I stress that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I have been through this.  We would really like the House to support us as we work on this Bill in the months ahead.  I give the House my word that if Senators want to take this approach, we can sit down to work on this in the weeks ahead.  I am giving a commitment that we will try to reduce the timeline.  That is a choice for the Seanad to make.  I am making an offer on my own behalf and on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  This is a space we would like to work on.  We believe we can make a change in this regard.  It can probably be done quite quickly as well.</p></speech>

The fear I might take away from tonight is that this motion ensures rental properties which do not meet minimum standards will have a free run on the rental market for the next six months.  Senator Coffey suggested that we are a bit "cynical" over on this side.  Would he blame us?  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said he wanted to deal with this in January 2018.  Senator Buttimer said he hopes "we would not divide the House".  He knows that Private Members' Bills progress through this House at a snail's pace.  There is probably no need to place this amendment before the House to delay the Bill.  It is the Senator who moved the amendment who will cause the House to divide.</p> <p>I thank the Senators who contributed and those who came along to the debate but did not get into the discussion.  I thank Senators Devine, Coffey, Murnane O'Connor, Black, Buttimer, &Oacute; Donnghaile, Ruane, McFadden, Humphreys, Higgins and Noone for being here.  I thank Conor in my office for his support on this Bill and all the other Bills we have brought to the floor of the Seanad.  I do not need to remind the House or the Government that Second Stage debates are about debating the principle of the Bill rather than its technicalities, which are issues for Committee Stage.</p> <p>The second reason I oppose the amendment is that it refers to "compliance with EU law (eCommerce Directive and possibly the Services Directive)".  I do not think those directives have been mentioned too often in this debate, if at all.  Legislation that was proposed by Fine Gael Deputies in the other House recently could have led to similar questions being asked about compliance with EU directives.  Even though the Bills in question - the Prohibition of Above-cost Ticket Touting Bill 2017, in the name of Deputy Rock, and the Treatment of Cancer (Advertisements) Bill 2018, in the name of Deputy O'Connell - are not perfect and require refinement, neither of them has been subject to the six-month delay that has been proposed by the Government.  Deputy Rock's Bill was passed on Second Stage with the support of the Government.  Compliance with EU directives is a matter for the next Stage of the debate, rather than Second Stage.  The Government's proposal to delay the Second Reading of the Bill will not ensure it complies with EU directives - it will merely stifle its effectiveness.</p> <p>It is telling and problematic that Fianna F&aacute;il Senators have said they will support the amendment on the basis of their overall opposition to the Bill.  For those reasons, I propose that we reject this amendment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We should allow the Bill to proceed with the intention that Government and all interested Members would work together in a collaborative effort to address the issue of the advertising of substandard accommodation.  This issue has become very apparent in recent years.  As I have said, Deputy Eoghan Murphy said that he would deal with this in January 2018.  That is in the transcript of his response to a priority question.  </p><p>The Bill is sensible.  We are trying to ensure people's safety with regard to fire safety, overcrowding and sanitation regulations.  These properties should not be on the market.  How often does attention need to be brought to properties which are obviously in breach of regulations online, on social media and in the printed press?  People deserve to engage with the rental market with dignity and respect.  People deserve better.  We oppose the amendment and will be calling a vote on it.  If the amendment is passed I will be banging down the Minister of State's door on Monday morning.</p></speech>
