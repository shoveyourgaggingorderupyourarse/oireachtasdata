I thank her for her support to date in Dublin West.  She came out to visit Rath Dara Community College, as it is now known, in Dublin 15.  She understands the building issue concerning Danu Community Special School.  I thank the Government for the opening of Danu Community Special School in November 2019 with the patron, Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, DDLETB, at the temporary site at Hansfield.  I am sure we will talk about the building at some stage but today is more about the resources.</p> <p>I would prefer it if we were talking about the future of the children, but today I am talking about the future of the school because the school feels it is going from incident to incident and crisis to crisis in managing and not focusing enough on education and learning.  When I say "the school", I am talking about the parents and the brilliant work of the Autism School Dublin 15 committee.  The committee was behind the opening of the school and campaigned for it.</p> <p>The children associated with the school have very complex and challenging behavioural needs.  They are non-verbal and communicate through their behaviour.  They have severe learning disabilities.  Some have sensory impairments, and they can have autism spectrum disorder and anxiety.  We are dealing with complex cases involving children who were not in school.  They are the most vulnerable of all children, and their families are the ones under the most pressure.  They need the right resources in their school.  They need the wrap-around supports, behavioural therapists, the psychologist, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists.  The reality is that they do not feel they are getting them.  I am not sure the Minister of State is aware of how serious the circumstances are.</p> <p>The school has 30 children.  This number will rise to 34 in January and to 36, the allocation, in September 2022.  The school has a principal, six teachers and 15 special needs assistants, but it feels it needs more based on the assessments of the children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->At the moment they are getting two hours of behavioural support a week with a behavioural therapist.  This is three hours remotely.  This is their second therapist, which is important to mention in the context of knowledge and consistency.  They feel that they cannot focus on education at the moment because they are purely focused on managing behaviours.  They need the expertise of a behavioural therapist.  They are looking for a full-time behavioural therapist to work with proactive strategies and not to be constantly be dealing with the behavioural challenges.</p><p>The school has asked what is the policy and what is the definition of the new special school model.  They want clarity on what differentiates them from a special class in a school and about getting those wraparound supports.  The needs must be based on the needs of the children not the size of the school.  They are constantly battling that with the 1993 Special Education Review Committee, SERC, allocation of one teacher and two SNAs for six students.  To the school that is just not enough when dealing with the complexity of the cases.  Where does Progressing Disability Services fit around this?  We are not just talking about education here, we are also talking about life skills for the future.</p><p>The school feels that it is surviving and coping but not thriving or managing.  The school is in a building that is not fit for purpose.  It has dealt with the pandemic.  There is a constant staff turnover.  I know the staff personally, and the incentives are not there.  Why would the SNAs and the teachers take on these complex cases when they do not feel that they are getting the right supports in this instance?  They are overwhelmed.  Hopefully we can talk about the building itself in the next section.  This is a cry for help.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-04a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110400002#B00200"><p>I thank Senator Currie for her acknowledgement of the resources provided for in the budget.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for special education, it was very important to me that we put extra resources into children's additional educational needs of which we are aware there is a whole spectrum.  Some 90% of children with additional needs are in mainstream education.  If a child has a more complex need he or she will go into a special class, and if it is more severe again the child would go into a special school.</p><p>The Senator will be aware there are 126 special schools in the State that look after nearly 8,000 pupils.  In the budgets we increased provision for SNAs by 70% since 2011.  We are now at 1,165 special needs assistants, and there are 980 new special education teachers, which will help to create about 140 new special school places.  We are putting significant funding into this.  The Senator mentioned resources at the outset.  There is significant funding overall into special education schools and special education classes, and indeed into mainstream schools.  It is very important that we provide a flexible and tailored support for each child so that each child gets the appropriate education he or she deserves from the teachers.  Obviously, we always look to see if we can do better than we are already doing.</p><p>It is important that the Senator has highlighted this issue to me today.  My understanding is that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is engaging quite extensively with the school and with the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, in trying to provide a bespoke and tailored support to the school.  I understand that the school already has access to a behavioural practitioner, which is <i>de facto</i>the same as a behavioural therapist.  There is availability there.  One of the issues that is coming back to me is around staff capacity, which the Senator also mentioned, and making sure that staff have adequate training and advice.  The NCSE is working with NEPS to make sure that teachers have appropriate training and appropriate insight for this particular area.  The behavioural issues often go unnoticed.  We often think about education as just teaching the ABCs and the 123s, but it does not work like that.  The behavioural issues can be very problematic and particularly in special schools when there is acute need for such training.</p><p>The Senator asked about the distinction between a special class and a special school.  There is a huge difference in terms of the supports that special schools receive.  There are much more enhanced supports from a staffing level and an SNA level.  All of the supports they receive are above and beyond those in a special class.</p><p>From my perspective, the most important aspect is that there is ongoing support with NEPS, and ongoing collaboration and engagement.  They are in constant contact with the school around sorting this out.  They will be on site visiting the school next week for further engagement and further discussion.  This is a relatively new school.  I have been out to visit and I am aware of the building and the issue there.  It is important that the school is supported.  The Senator referred to the increase in numbers of children from 30 to 36, which may well increase into the future.  Obviously, there are mechanisms and processes in place so we can ensure that adequate supports are given on an ongoing basis.  When considering special needs in general, there has been an increase in special classes by 386% since 2011.  We went from 584 special classes to 2,118 special classes, which is significant.</p></speech>

I have been raising this issue for nearly a year and I am not getting around the full-time behavioural therapist requirement.  The school community feels that it is not being heard on this.  They need the full-time behavioural therapist.  The Minister of State said that they get access to more resources but when I speak to the school they want to know the definition so they have something by which they can measure what they have, and to know what the new model is.  I believe it is about a centre of excellence.  In January 2022 the school will be moving to Rath Dara Community College, but we know that they need a purpose-built school.  They cannot just have classrooms attached to another school.  These children deserve the full wraparound services and joined-up thinking with the purpose-built specific school with a full-time behavioural therapist.</p></speech>

The NCSE can sanction it.  The most important aspect is that there is engagement and discussion, and the fact that the NCSE is going out next week and will offer a bespoke solution for the school.  It is important that the Senator has highlighted the issue today.  The NCSE is aware that I am in the House today and that the matter has been brought up, and we will look at it in the round.  It is also about staff training, which is important.  There is access to a behavioural practitioner.  If the NCSE is of the view that they need to increase those hours, they do have a behavioural practitioner, but that post is not in the particular school.  That is the way it works.  They can discuss this with the school and see if there is more they can provide.  I am very grateful to the Senator for raising the matter.  It is very important Danu Community Special School will have adequate accommodation.  It is good that they are moving in in January.  Who knows what the future will hold>  We went out there also with the T&aacute;naiste and the Senator.  Hopefully there will be a resolution to that in the near future.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  I also thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for selecting this matter.  I know he understands the importance of this particular issue to the constituency in which he and I live.</p> <p>Last week, the Government relaxed the rules on working permits for individuals from outside of the European Economic Area, EEA.  This will have beneficial consequences for a number of sectors, including horticulture, which I raised in the House some weeks ago.  Other sectors which will benefit include construction and haulage.  However, the poultry sector and pig operators have been left out of the permit scheme.  They are disappointed and feel they have been forgotten.  They believe their sector could be in trouble because it has not been included in the scheme.  Unfortunately, their best efforts to recruit workers from the resident and indigenous workforce have proved unsuccessful and they have been forced to go down the road of trying to get workers from outside the EEA.  </p> <p>Poultry farmers in Monaghan believe this is not a national issue because the poultry industry is located primarily in the county and that perhaps that is the reason they have been left out.  County Monaghan has gained a positive global reputation in many sectors.  I would be here for the rest of the day listing them for the Minister of State.  One of those sectors is the poultry industry.  Monaghan is, in many ways, the home of that industry.  To give some facts, of the 413 poultry meat sites in the country, 240 are located in County Monaghan and 184 of the 186 egg production sites in the country are also located in the county.  Farmers in Monaghan tell us that it is not only minimum wage jobs they are seeking to fill and that they need a specialised workforce.  Unfortunately, they cannot recruit this workforce locally and are forced to go down this road.</p> <p>It is worth noting in the week that is in it, with COP26 and the Government&rsquo;s announcement today of the carbon action plan, that the poultry industry has the lowest carbon footprint of any meat sector.  As such, it has serious potential for growth, not just in County Monaghan but throughout the country.  I am giving a voice to the poultry farmers of Monaghan and I hope their plea, which I am making on their behalf today, will be advanced by the Department and the sector will get the work permits it needs to ensure business continues and the sector achieves further growth.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-04a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110400002#C00400"><p>I apologise for my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, who is unfortunately unable to attend the Seanad this morning.  He asked me to reply on his behalf and indicated he will facilitate a discussion with the Senator to go through the issues he has raised.  He also thanks the Senator for having raising them in the House.</p> <p>The employment permits system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-European Economic Area nationals to fill skills and-or labour shortages in the short to medium term in circumstances where there are no suitably qualified Irish or EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.</p> <p>The system is managed through the operation of the critical skills occupations list and the ineligible occupations list.  These are subject to twice-yearly evidence-based reviews in consultation with other Departments, sectoral representatives and the economic migration interdepartmental group.   Where shortages are clearly evidenced, the employment permit system is flexible enough to address them in real time.</p> <p>The most recent review concluded with the announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy English, on 27 October, of a broad suite of amendments to the occupations lists to address the skills and labour shortages of most immediate concern across a number of key economic sectors, including the agricultural sector.</p> <p>The agrifood sector shows evidence of significant challenges, most notably in meat processing and horticulture, and is continuing to experience unprecedented labour challenges due to the pandemic, in spite of initiatives to attract and retain staff.  The number of unfilled vacancies continues to increase with an attendant risk to supply chains and harvests.  The Government has responded to address these immediate needs with additional permit quotas for horticulture operatives, meat deboners, meat processing operatives and dairy farm operatives.  Ireland is an outlier in Europe in not having a seasonal employment permit.  While legislation proceeds to rectify this, these new quotas will assist in the sector.</p> <p>While mindful of the labour shortages in the agrifood sector but also the continued uncertainty in the labour market, consideration was given to the poultry sector.  Changes to the labour market as the economy continues to reopen will help the poultry sector.  However, changes specific to the sector for roles such as poultry catcher were not recommended for change at this time.  The sector needs to provide more evidence of recruitment efforts undertaken within the EEA through structured engagement with the Department of Social Protection.</p> <p>As I said, the Minister of State, Deputy English, will be available to discuss the matter further with the Senator.  I apologise for the short notice given for his inability to attend.  I will bring to the Minister of State's attention any matters the Senator wishes me to raise with him.  I fully understand the position of the poultry industry.  While County Monaghan is probably the largest producer of poultry, counties Mayo, Waterford and my home county of Limerick are also significant producers of poultry.</p></speech>

While he is here, I would like to acknowledge the help I have received from officials in his Department.  I ask him to pass on my sincere thanks to them.</p> <p>On the poultry sector, I see some light in the Minister of State's response in that it is now over to the poultry sector to provide the evidence the Department requires showing that it has tried to recruit locally.  As I said, that road has been travelled without success.  I will, however, communicate with the sector on again producing the evidence of having travelled that road.  When that evidence is submitted, as I have no doubt it will be, the Department may then see fit to issue the number of permits the sector requires.  The poultry sector is of great importance to County Monaghan and we cannot allow anything to interfere with its continued growth.</p></speech>

The last sentence of my initial contribution is the most important in that the sector needs to provide more evidence of recruitment efforts undertaken and to show engagement with the Department of Social Protection.</p> <p>This issue arises in other sectors and the Minister of State, Deputy English, has indicated that he is not averse to discussion or negotiations.  The Government has shown flexibility with other sectors.  We note that the horticultural and agrifood sectors are having particular problems.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, represents a rural constituency and is a pragmatic individual.  I will bring this matter to his attention and I hope that, in conjunction with Senator Gallagher and farming representatives, a resolution to this matter will be found.</p></speech>

Britain recently introduced an outright ban on metaldehyde that will come into effect in spring 2022.  It did this following research carried out by an expert group on pesticides and health and safety, which found incontrovertible evidence that pellets containing this chemical are harmful to wildlife pets and freshwater supplies, including ornamental ponds.  While any outright ban would, of course, require consultation and a lead-in time, surely we could stop the use of these pellets in suburban gardens and public grounds?  I volunteer with a hedgehog rescue and every year it takes in hedgehogs foaming at the mouth after ingesting slugs and snails that have consumed the pellets.  As the Minister of State will be aware, hedgehogs are a protected species under appendix 3 of the Bern convention and the Wildlife Act 1976 and the amending Act of 2000.  However, when it comes to the risks to wildlife from the use of metaldehyde, just hedgehogs are affected.  Birds, including birds of prey, have been poisoned, as have foxes and family pets.  In Britain it is estimated that at least ten family pets or dogs die a year just from ingesting slug pellets.  When it rains, the metaldehyde is washed off the soil and into watercourses, which include ponds, and leads to the poisoning of fish, toads and frogs.</p> <p>In 2019, we declared a biodiversity emergency and we were the first country to do so.  Will the Minister of State consider as a bare minimum that we restrict the use of these pellets in household gardens?  Today, anyone can just walk into any of the very well-known discount stores we see in all of our towns and villages and on the high streets and buy these slug pellets for as little as &euro;1.50.  I encourage the Minister to roll out a public awareness campaign.  I do not think people are deliberately putting down slug pellets to destroy wildlife.  They want to protect their plants and they are not aware of the alternatives.  Ferric phosphate has been proven to work just as effectively as metaldehyde.  Ultimately, we should show people that rather than using ferric phosphate they can make their gardens wildlife friendly by taking very small measures.  There are simple measures such as creating a small entrance gap in the fence or gate to encourage hedgehogs to come in.  If people encourage their neighbours to do the same, they can ensure hedgehogs have a viable habitat and food to survive in the suburbs.</p> <p>Any of us who are into gardening, and particularly wildlife watching, will know that if we can encourage hedgehogs and birds into our gardens we definitely do not need slug pellets because they are the best slug and snail deterrents we can have in the garden.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment to roll out a public awareness campaign and give serious consideration to at least stopping the sale of these products to people in ordinary households which do not need them for their gardens as there are other alternatives that are safe, and encourage people to make space for nature in their gardens?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-04a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110400002#D00300"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I have a response from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but in quick response to the Senator's two asks on the restriction of use in household gardens I wholeheartedly agree.  People can buy stuff off the shelf in supermarkets and garden centres for domestic use.  People should stop doing it.  I do not recommend people use those products.  They are doing huge damage.  We saw it in the past with song thrushes and the impact on wild birds.  Certainly we will give consideration to a public awareness campaign from the National Parks and Wildlife Service side.  We are more than happy to do this.  I will give the Senator the response from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and then sum up and we can exchange views.</p> <p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the competent authority in Ireland with responsibility for the authorisation of plant protection products, including slug pellet products.  Pesticide active substances contained in plant protection products are approved centrally at EU-level based on detailed assessments prepared by member state regulatory authorities and a rigorous peer review process managed by the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA.</p> <p>Products are subsequently authorised nationally by the relevant competent authorities in accordance with evaluation and decision-making criteria agreed at EU level and taking account of local agri-environmental conditions.  Products are only authorised if it can be reliably concluded that the intended uses have no unacceptable impacts on human or animal health and the environment.  We have seen with the impending ban in the UK that there is a considered different view out there.</p> <p>Potential impacts on small mammals, such as hedgehogs, and on other wildlife were considered as part of the active substance approval and product authorisation processes in all cases.  Products may be designated for professional use only or may be permitted for amateur or domestic use, depending on the specific intended uses and their risk profiles.  They may only be used for the purposes and in the manner for which they have been authorised as outlined on the approved product label.</p> <p>Slug pellet products authorised for sale and use in Ireland contain one of two EU-approved pesticide active substances.  The products are used to minimise the potential for damage to crops or garden plants.  Products should only be used if necessary and users should always consider the potential for alternative control methods, such as sowing seeds to a greater soil depth or planting slug resistant crop or plant varieties.</p> <p>Most of the products are authorised for domestic use by amateur users but some are for professional use only.  Products allowed for amateur use generally have a lower risk profile, with less concentrated formulations and lower application rates.  I agree with the contention that they should not be used in domestic settings.</p> <p>Active substance and product authorisations are time limited.  They are reviewed by member states if an application for renewal of approval of the active substance is submitted or withdrawn, or if there is no application for renewal.  Subsequently, member states review authorisations for products containing the active substance based on the outcome of the EU review process, including amateur uses, in accordance with EU procedures.</p> <p>The current EU approval period for one of the EU approved active substances used in slug pellet products is due to expire on 31 May 2023.  An application to renew its approval is now being assessed by Poland on behalf of all member states.  Poland is due to submit an assessment report to EFSA towards the end of this year.  The authority will then arrange for a detailed peer review to be carried out, involving public consultation and input from member state technical experts.  The assessment and peer review will be based on the most up to date scientific information available, including information on possible impacts on small mammals and other wildlife.</p> <p>I want to give my commitment, and I want to say that I do not recommend that people use these products domestically.  There are alternatives and people should not be using them.  We will give active consideration to a public awareness campaign on this.</p></speech>

I am disappointed we cannot get a commitment from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on putting a stop to them being sold in discount stores.  I agree that farmers are trained on how to use these and they know when they should and should not be used.  The incontrovertible evidence from the British expert committee on this has found they are very harmful.  I echo what the Minister of State has said on encouraging people not to use these products at all.  It would be better if they were taken off the shelves.  We all know we might live in a bubble and follow the news but most people will just go in and pick something up.  If it is cheap at &euro;1.50 and they think it will protect their garden plants, they probably do not realise the damage they are doing.  I appreciate the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

She showed me photographs of some beautiful hedgehogs before we came into the Chamber.  They are essential to our biodiversity.  It is essential that we have connected habitats for nature.  Natural pest control should work far better.  Barn owls on a farm are natural predators and pest control in themselves.  We need to restore nature as part of this bigger picture.</p> <p>Looking at the pending UK ban, we will have a situation where one part of the island will have a ban on such products but not down south.  An EU-wide review should take place in this regard.  We are in the depths of a biodiversity crisis.  It is very important that we do this.  There are alternative slug control methods out there.  Certainly there is a different set of circumstances for commercial crop growers and we recognise this.  Once again, I reiterate to the public they should not use these products in their gardens.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-04a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110400002#E00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  This issue relates to homelessness and young people.  If the various controversies relating to homelessness in the past few months - and I do not intend to go into them here - have taught us anything, it is that we need to be constantly vigilant to ensure that those experiencing homelessness are given all the supports they need, that there is no exploitation of them or their vulnerabilities and that the necessary protections, including legislative protection, Government protection and protection from the institutions of the State, are afforded to them at every level.  I know there is a high-level homeless task force whose business is under way.  I acknowledge the enormous amount of work of the Peter McVerry Trust, the Dublin Simon Community, Focus Ireland, Threshold, Crosscare, Depaul, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and, for that matter, the local authorities, which do a tremendous amount of work.  People are not aware of the extent of the work a lot of the local authorities do in co-ordinating homelessness initiatives, nor are they aware of the work of the Minister of State's Department.  I am glad to say I have had opportunities to pick up the phone and talk directly to very senior staff in his Department with responsibility for homelessness and housing generally.  They have always been responsive and have got back to me, including outside of office hours, and they have assisted these people to get into appropriate homes and care.</p> <p>What am I asking in the few minutes available to me?  I think we know that young people are at a crucial point in their personal, emotional, cognitive and social development.  It is a difficult transitional period for many of them but it is more difficult for people coming out of direct provision, hostels, institutions or care centres, where they are meant to be cared for, protected and supported.  Such people are leaving an institution or an institutional support system rather than a functional family situation.  We know the huge issues facing homeless people.  Their needs relate to issues ranging from childhood experiences to poor mental health and problems with drugs or alcohol, and in many cases a combination of all those issues.  These are therefore vulnerable people.  As I said, many of them are leaving State care, detention or direct provision and others are from migrant or ethnic groups.  They need our support.</p> <p>I will leave the Minister of State with this.  I am deeply concerned about the practice of young people being placed in inappropriate accommodation - including emergency accommodation - with adults where they are at risk in the broadest sense of the word "risk".  These are vulnerable people, with the State knowing they are vulnerable, and they are placed in situations of risk, intimidation and exploitation.  If the Minister of State talks to any of the agencies I have mentioned, they will tell him the same.  I am therefore trying to find out how the youth homelessness strategy is working, how it is going and when we will have a definite strategy in place to address and tackle what is a very difficult set of circumstances for young people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-04a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110400002#E00300"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this really important issue.  Yesterday, I opened the Little Houses exhibition in Collins Barracks with the young people from Stoneybatter Youth Service.  I urge the Senator, if he gets a chance, to go and look at that exhibition.  It highlighted young people's experiences during lockdown of being at home and lots of the myriad issues they faced, in particular being restricted to home life and, perhaps, in some cases, homelessness.  I thank the young people I met there.  It was a wonderful collaboration with the National Museum of Ireland.  It is really important to document that and it is critically important, particularly for young people who have experienced disproportionately the challenges of Covid and homelessness, that we address this.  I will outline the Government's priorities in that regard.</p> <p>A lot of work is already being done on service provision in this area, and I acknowledge the commitment of those involved in local authorities, as the Senator himself said, voluntary organisations and statutory bodies.  Housing for All, the Government's strategic action plan, published in September, details how the Government is further approaching this challenge.  It includes commitments to develop a youth homelessness strategy within quarter 1 of 2022 and to work to eradicate homelessness by 2030.  Having specific policy and actions in this area is based on a fundamental understanding that supporting young people at risk of becoming homeless through strategic interventions can help avoid a cycle of longer term homelessness.</p> <p>Preparing this strategy involves co-operation and co-ordination between the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman.  Key operational elements in the provision of supports to young people experiencing or at risk of homelessness fall within the responsibility of a range of agencies and stakeholder bodies.  Action has already commenced on the preparation of the youth homelessness strategy.  The Ministers, Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Roderic O'Gorman, and their respective Departments have been engaging with one another, and work in this regard is proceeding.</p> <p>On his appointment, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, also established a high-level homelessness task force to provide a forum for engagement with key organisations working to address homelessness.  The task force is also inputting to the implementation of the commitments on homelessness in the programme for Government and Housing for All.  The membership of the task force consists of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, Crosscare, Depaul, Focus Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust, the Dublin Simon Community, Threshold and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The Minister has discussed the preparation of a youth homelessness strategy and sought the views of members of the task force.  Work on the strategy will continue through the remainder of 2021 and into 2022, involving broader stakeholder engagement.</p> <p>It is well understood that certain young people leaving residential care, foster care, prison or juvenile detention services may be at enhanced risk of homelessness.  Tusla has a responsibility in this area, which it addressed through the provision of aftercare supports for such young people.  Since September 2017, young people leaving care at the age of 18 have the right to an aftercare plan prepared by Tusla.  Tusla can provide assistance to young people up to the age of 21 who have been in care.  This can be extended until the young person reaches 23 years of age in order to facilitate the completion of an education course.  The plan, which includes arrangements for accommodation, is a key response in preventing a young man or woman from falling into homelessness.</p> <p>Funding for a dedicated accommodation centre for care leavers is also provided through the capital assistance scheme operated by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The scheme funds approved housing bodies that work with local authorities in developing this accommodation.  Housing for All specifically recognises the importance of this scheme.</p> <p>Tackling homelessness across all ages has been a key priority of the Government.  Significant progress has been made in recent times, with homelessness among children and families in particular decline.  From a peak of 3,873 in September 2019, the number of children in emergency accommodation has fallen by almost 40% to 2,344.  I assure Senator Boyhan and others in the House of the work being done to address homelessness among children and young people.  Our commitment is to see this work enhanced over the coming years.</p></speech>

I will reflect on it and perhaps come back to the Department later.  The reply has confirmed that we have 2,344 children who are homeless.  That is too many.  I know the Minister of State knows that.  It is desperate that 2,344 of our children are in emergency accommodation.  It goes back to the long-term plan and the strategies being worked on, and I acknowledge and accept that.  However, we have to be continually vigilant and ensure the protection and safety of these children this very night, not in six months' time.  I say that as someone who has been in contact with these agencies and who was a member of the joint committee on housing.  No more reports, no more inquiries and no more discussions about the death and cruelty faced by our children.  In Ireland, where the State has a responsibility, we see that these children are exposed, are experiencing homeless, are vulnerable and need our supports.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and going through this report from his Department.  I appreciate it.</p></speech>

As a statistic, 2,344 is way too high a number.  We want, and the Government is committed, to end homelessness.  I reiterate that addressing homelessness is a priority of the Government.  Budget 2022 reflects this priority with provision of &euro;194 million in funding for homelessness services.  When account is taken of Covid-related costs, this is an increase on the baseline funding provided in 2021.  Good progress continues to be made, which is shown by recent homelessness reports published by my Department on Friday, 30 October 2020.  These reports show that exits from homelessness remain strong and that the number of people in emergency accommodation remains well below the numbers recorded in 2019 and 2020.  While there remains a lot of work to do on this front, I recognise the progress that has been made on the ground by local authorities and our NGO service providers in changing people's lives.  I appreciate the fact that the Senator has mentioned local authorities specifically.  They do amazing work on the ground.  I know that from my county.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Significant numbers of households continue to exit homelessness into a home each month.

We will continue to work towards our national goal of eradicating homelessness by 2030.

Today is international day against violence and bullying at school, including cyberbullying.  UNESCO member states decided to designate it such because they recognise schools-based violence and cyberbullying are particularly difficult for children and adolescents.  Cyberbullying has been increasing significantly, as we know.  DCU has done a lot of research in this area which shows that, last year, 20% of our young people had experienced cyberbullying, with another 50% saying they were aware of, or had seen, such behaviour.  It is a huge issue we need to recognise and tackle.  As I said, DCU has done incredible work in this area.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, recently launched a competition organised by the university seeking initiatives in this area that young people in different schools have developed.  The deadline for submissions is 26 November and the entries can be in the form of posters or short videos.  It is important that young people get involved in the conversation.  I recommend and encourage schools to participate and make submissions to <i>www.tacklebullying.ie</i>.</p><p>I want to raise the issue of the increase in the number of cases of the spiking of drinks, which is very frightening.  People of every age and gender need to be vigilant when they are out socialising.  What we are seeing on social media and hearing from victims, mainly young women, is horrific.  We need to strengthen our laws to deal with this and encourage victims to report to venues as well as the Garda.  It is very important to do that.  I urge everybody to stay safe and never leave a drink unattended.</p><p>The other issue I want to raise is the situation of amputees in this country.  There are 5,000 people with prosthetic limbs.  Without a medical card, which is discretionary and considered individually, amputees get no support whatsoever.  One prosthetic limb is provided if the initial surgery is done publicly.  If it is done privately, the prosthetic is not provided by the State.  For children, the limb needs to be changed every year and, for adults, every two years.  A person who is involved in sport will need more than one particular limb.  The State should be giving more support to these people.  It is traumatic enough to lose a limb without having to face this lack of support.  Counselling supports should be put in place and we must look at other measures to support the 5,000 amputees in this country.</p></speech>

It should be a wide-ranging debate that covers not just this particular aspect but also the matter of the 500 or so workers at RT&Eacute; who are deemed to be either temporary or on contract.  That is an issue about which we should all be concerned.  In addition, we should look at the licence fee and the role the national broadcaster and public service broadcasting can play in the future.  It is important we have a debate on the future of broadcasting and media in this House.  We have seen a modal shift in how people consume news and engage with newspapers.  During the Covid period in particular, we saw the value of good-quality, local newspapers and media in giving information and keeping people in touch.

There is need for a wider debate around the role a new type of policing authority can play in policing antisocial behaviour on public transport.  Senators will have heard what Dermot O'Leary of the NBRU had to say on the news last Friday.  We are all aware of the rise in antisocial behaviour.  As I said during the debate last night, we have a duty of care to the workers and to those travelling on our public transport.  I am not sure if the Seanad Public Consultation Committee is still functioning, but this may be a piece of work that could be done by that committee.  I would be happy to sit down with Members to put together a piece of work on that.  I would ask, respectfully, that we have those debates.</p></speech>

That would certainly be timely.</p> <p>There are two issues I would like to raise with the Leader.  The first concerns the leaving certificate.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills is currently looking at the issue of leaving certificate reform.  The development of syllabi is ongoing by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  There are many concerns among science teachers and science academics about the development of the syllabus in areas like chemistry, biology, physics and agricultural science by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  These concerns are being expressed by the Irish Science Teachers Association.  The concern is that a very vague template is being prepared for each of these subjects in terms of teaching and assessment.  This could lead to confusion among teachers about what they are meant to teach and, indeed, to what depth they should teach for success in the leaving certificate.  Some of the changes are being proposed in the name of promoting creativity, but the science teachers argue that specifying learning outcomes is all very well but these learning outcomes can apply to any level of teaching on a given subject.  They are concerned that when they raise objections the executive committee of the NCCA progresses these matters regardless, which is what appeared to happen in 2014.  Rather than get into excessive detail on this, I ask for a debate with the Minister on the NCCA, how it goes about its work of curriculum development, how it deals with the concerns of those experts that it brings on to its committees in the area of science teaching and science academia and whether their concerns are in fact being listened to. </p> <p>The second issue I would like to raise with the Leader concerns the information surfaced by Deputy Carol Nolan in the D&aacute;il that there have been a total of 94 incidents of adverse events reported to the State Claims Agency with regard to the operation of the new abortion law.  It is not clear what was involved in these adverse incidents.  Information would be important.  I refer, of course, to information that is properly anonymised.  We do not know whether these adverse incidents relate to catastrophic situations such as the misdiagnosis that led to the taking of baby Christopher's life by the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, or whether they relate to issues that have adversely impacted on women's health.  These issues about abortion concern women's health and, of course, they concern the ongoing contested space about whether it is right to take the life of the unborn.  It is clear that we cannot just have the vague indication by the Government that there is to be a three-year review.  We need to be getting information and discussing in these Houses issues such as, for example, the implications for the ongoing practice of abortion being provided through telemedicine arising out of Covid.  There are many concerns about the dangers associated with that.  Above all, there is a need for information and open debate.  I ask that the Minister for Health would come to the House to discuss with us what is at the back of these adverse claims, what they tell us about the way abortion law is operating and what changes we can fairly debate in the Houses.</p></speech>

The State provides these transport services and so it has a responsibility to protect all passengers.  The State needs to not only protect people but to incentivise them to avail of public transport because that is intrinsic to this country reaching its climate targets.  That cannot be done without a multi-sectoral approach.  We need great collaboration from the different sectors.  At the heart of that is public transport.  We want to encourage people to use it.  We get hung up about electric vehicles.  Even if every car was replaced by an electric vehicle there should still be gridlock and congestion on our roads.  Public transport is key.</p><p>In regard to the reports of antisocial behaviour there is <i>prima facie</i>evidence that they are law breakers.  They are grotesquely rude, selfish and uncaring people who are undermining the rule of law.  There should be zero tolerance of them.  People should feel safe to travel by train but that is not the case at the moment.  Germany and France have a tradition of zero tolerance, but not Ireland.  We have to start that conversation, but we must have a collaborative approach.  The Green Party in government has to step up here.  The Green Party has a proud, close affinity and deep, strong advocacy for the use of public transport.  What resources are required by the Department of Justice, the Department of Transport and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make public transport safe for people?</p><p>I am aware of a person who got his dream job of providing catering services on trains.  He had to leave that job owing to the grotesque behaviour of passengers.  He thought he had his dream job.  I am also aware of a family who, when travelling on a train, had to go <i>en masse</i>to the toilet because they could not leave anyone alone owing to bullying and grotesque behaviour of passengers sitting adjacent to them.  We have to come up with concrete, active ways of translating words into actions to help staff who are doing a good job.  I know this House is supportive of that.  During the winter, with the snow and inclement weather conditions, we know how lucky we are to have a transport system.  My county is very fortunate to be served with rail transport.  We must be seen to act.  I propose to write to the Garda Commissioner and other relevant bodies and authorities in regard to a concrete tangible result that re-incentivises people to use public transport.  People have to feel and be safe and protected on our public transport services.</p></speech>

I am hoping that there will be an element of consultation around the climate action plan.  We do not have a good reputation in this country of consulting with people, whether it is on planning matters, forestry or renewable energy.  We seem to baulk at the thought of asking people for their opinions.  This leads to us getting caught up in courts and judicial reviews and delays because one cannot stop people wanting to have their say about what is happening in their lives and in their communities.</p> <p>It is interesting that even with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 we had to fight tooth and nail to have it undergo pre-legislative scrutiny.  We at least managed to strengthen the Bill, but when it came before the committee we had to fight to have obligations for public consultation included.  I was minded to mention that those of us who attended that committee heard from eminent experts such as Dr. Aine Ryall, who were at pains to emphasise how important consultation is when it comes to climate action.  Consultation is not about delaying; it is about a two-way dialogue which should be ongoing and inclusive.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am particularly interested to see if there will be a just transition commission in the climate action plan, because that would facilitate that dialogue to be ongoing, to make sure that we are meeting our targets, and to make sure that we are assessing as we go the impacts on different communities.  That would allow us to adjust and mitigate any negative impacts that are happening.  </p><p>I would also like to raise the disappointing news that Equinor, our leading offshore wind developer, has decided to pull out of the Irish market.  It will probably be a real spanner in the works for the development of our hydrogen strategy.  I again point out the issue of consultation.  We must not fall into the trap, because Equinor is saying that it is about the regulatory framework.  We have a marine framework coming.  That needs to happen.  The marine protected zones also need to happen.  However, we cannot allow wind companies to try to undermine the process in the meantime.</p><p>I would like to finish by encouraging all the Members of the House to come to the Garden of Remembrance at 12 noon on Saturday for the COP26 Coalition.  It is calling for greater ambition to come out of the COP26 talks.  Its demands are simple: green jobs; a just transition; free, green and frequent public transport; a moratorium on data centres; a ban on liquefied natural gas, LNG; and sustainable agriculture and fisheries communities.  I am sure everybody would agree with all of those demands.  I look forward to seeing Members on Saturday.</p></speech>

Of course, we recently passed the 60th anniversary of this great military event.  These Irish soldiers are not just regarded as heroes in their homeland, but by a growing number of people worldwide.</p><p>I recently came across the wording of the surrender document of Commandant Patrick Quinlan at Jadotville.  It is important to put it on the record of the House: </p> <blockquote> 	  	Jadotville, 17 September 1961.  I Commandant Patrick Quinlan officer commanding Irish United Nations troops in Jadotville do hereby agree to the terms of surrender of Minister Munongo because - The Irish force is here in a peaceful police role and any further action would result in the loss of African and Irish lives.  I also wish to state that my troops fought only in self defence having been fired on while attending mass on the morning of 13 September at 0740 hours.  It is also agreed that the Irish troops will have their arms stored at the location of the Irish troops accommodation.  In the absence of orders from higher authority I take the responsibility for this decision.  </blockquote> <p>It is never too late to do the right thing.  It is never too late to honour the men under the command of Commandant Quinlan in the way their commanding officer recommended.</p><p>The second item I wanted to raise today is the growing cost of energy prices for so many people in this country, as well as the urgent need for Government to address it.  Like many people in this House, my own office and phone is inundated with people who are facing a cold winter.  My colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, raised this matter with the Taoiseach in the Lower House yesterday.  The discussion yesterday was on the recent European Council meeting of 21 and 22 October.  The Council mandated energy ministers to convene an extraordinary meeting to follow up on Council conclusions.  Those ministers agreed that short term measures have to be taken as a matter of urgency to shield vulnerable customers from enormous price hikes.  The Commission has issued a clear policy framework that allows member states to take action, including temporary tax breaks.</p><p>Of course, this surge in energy costs is an unexpected windfall for the coffers of Government.  The State charges 13.5% VAT on top of the increasing price of energy.  In fact, as Deputy Howlin pointed out yesterday, not only does it charge 13.5% on gas and electricity, it also charges 13.5% on the carbon tax and on the public service obligation, PSO, levy.  The EU energy taxation directive and the VAT directive give flexibility to member states to exempt or apply a reduced rate of VAT on electricity, natural gas, coal and solid fuels used in households.  Given the extraordinary rise in energy costs, the Government must act to ensure that all households can battle these costs this winter.  Government has been given a green light to do so.  I hope the Minister can help all of those who are worried about heating their homes this winter.</p></speech>

This designation by the state of Israel is a clear attack on civil society organisations working in defence of human rights and international law.  Such actions do little to challenge the view of Israel as a repressive, apartheid regime.  Israel and pro-Israel organisations have for years been going after donors to cut off funding to these Palestinian human rights organisations, some of which are at the forefront of pushing cases before the International Criminal Court, ICC, including against Israeli defence minister, Mr. Benny Gantz, while also imprisoning human rights defenders on the ground.  The donors, including European governments, have repeatedly found no basis for the accusations of terrorism.  Remember, these orders were issued by the same government minister who this summer authorised the bombing of a building that housed various media offices, including the Associated Press, in Gaza.  This was also under the pretext of secret evidence.</p> <p>The attacks against six Palestinian organisations are, therefore, just another step in a long-standing series of attempts to try to ban any criticism and, particularly, any legal activism against Israel.  It is little wonder that hundreds of rights organisations around the world have seen through Israel&rsquo;s latest fa&ccedil;ade, and that our own Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, has stated that he has seen no evidence to support the assertion that these are terrorist organisations.  This attack comes as part of an Israeli campaign against the Palestinian people and civil society to delegitimise, eliminate and smear their work in the areas of human rights, gender, and social and environmental justice.  The organisations are targeted because of their powerful and professional work in documenting human rights violations and conducting advocacy to hold Israel accountable for its war crimes and crimes against humanity.  </p> <p>Palestinian civil society has been tirelessly documenting human rights violations, advocating for protection and justice, and offering legal and social support to the Palestinian people.  The work of civil society is fundamental to upholding democratic practices and the protection of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, especially the right of self-determination and the right of Palestinian refugees to return.</p> <p>I call for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to update the House on what he and the Government are going to do, given that no evidence of terrorism has been provided.  Irish Aid-funded human rights organisations have been effectively criminalised.  Are we going to fund vital human rights work and watch as the staff, some of whom are Irish citizens, face arrests and jail time?  I would like the Minister to come into the House to give us an update on what is going to happen.</p></speech>

These are events that many of us want to leave behind us.  Unfortunately, for some families, those times have never gone away.  This past week has seen renewed calls for information regarding the disappearance of Columba McVeigh.  The family of Columba McVeigh has made a further appeal for information as part of a walk they hold every year on 2 November, All Souls Day.</p> <p>In November 1975, the then teenager from Donaghmore, Tyrone, was abducted, murdered and secretly buried.  It is believed that his remains lie hidden in a bog in Bragan, in north County Monaghan.  Despite a number of searches through the years, unfortunately, his remains have not been recovered.  Oliver McVeigh, a family member, has repeatedly made an appeal for anyone with information to come forward.  In the words of the family, they are prepared to "let bygones be bygones&rdquo;.</p> <p>I would like to echo the call from the McVeigh family this morning.  I would like the entire House to echo the call from the McVeigh family, so that this family, which has suffered now for 46 years, can finally bring their suffering to an end.  They have suffered long enough.  It is time for them to have peace and closure.</p></speech>

That meeting took place the other day.  I was somewhat disturbed that we were presented with the <i>fait accompli</i>by the regulator by way of a PowerPoint presentation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

I was told I would be given the PowerPoint presentation before the end of the week, along with the undertaking from the regulator.  That all sounded very plausible, but the key point I want to make today is that IALPA is not at all happy with what was presented to Members of the Seanad the other day.  We cannot go ahead with this legislation while this doubt hangs over it.  The pilots and the pilots&rsquo; organisations are the people who know what is happening on the ground.  Unless we listen carefully to what they are saying, we cannot allow legislation to go ahead.  It is flawed, as far as I am concerned, and I will do everything in my power to obstruct it if we are not prepared to have a proper conversation about this.</p><p>I know this is not the fault of the Leader.  She arranged the meeting and I am grateful to her for that.  The meeting was a very slick performance, I have to say, but at the very end of it, there was very little time.  No matter how often I asked if I could have the PowerPoint presentation, I was told &ldquo;No&rdquo; and told I would get a letter of undertaking.  It is simply not good enough.  We are talking about the safety of the public as they fly.  If we take the peer support group part of the legislation, we already know one pilot who was suffering from severe depression flew a plane into the Alps.  We do not want to see a serious accident.  I believe the Irish pilots are genuine in their efforts to make this legislation sound.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to release the PowerPoint presentation and not to proceed with this legislation until IALPA has had an opportunity to provide a rebuttal.</p><p>Before I sit down, and I beg the indulgence of the Chair.  Paddy Cosgrave at the Web Summit made the most outrageous attack on the T&aacute;naiste of this country.  I have no allegiance to any political party and have never had since I was elected to this House, but the bottom line is that people like Paddy Cosgrave-----</p></speech>

It followed an illegal protest purporting to be against the protocol.  People have a right to protest.  They have a right to peaceful protest in opposition to political events of the day, and I and, I am sure, colleagues will defend that right fully.  Of course, this protest did not take place at the headquarters of the DUP, it did not take place at the Northern Ireland Office, it did not take place at No. 10 Downing Street; it took place at an interface.  I would call from this House today on my unionist colleagues in particular in the North to tone down the provocative rhetoric in this regard.  We have seen a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old arrested last night.  With the greatest respect to them, I am sure neither of them could outline the concerns around the complexities of trade in regard to the protocol.  There are people and families living at both sides of the interface who want nothing to do with this and who deserve to live and rear their families in peace.</p> <p>I commend and thank my own party colleagues, community workers and youth workers who were out on the ground last night trying to ease tensions.  I am sure they will be out again tonight and over the coming days, but they should not have to be.  I do not want to over-egg it.  This was sporadic and it was quite minimal in comparison with other events we have seen, but once people are brought out onto the street in this fashion and led by such provocative and inflammatory language and sentiment, it always has a very dangerous potential.  I want us today, through the Leader, to condemn those events last night and to call on people to engage on this issue respectfully, peacefully and, probably most important of all, realistically going forward.  We do not want to see any further escalation or any harm brought to young people or the families living along the interface between the Springfield Road and the Shankill Road.</p></speech>

Following on from Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, while we are talking about the right to protest, and it is a very important right in this country that we should protect and stand up for, with every right comes responsibilities.  Sadly, while the majority of protests in this country are done in a responsible way, we have seen small fringe elements who have taken it into their own hands and decided to picket outside individual&rsquo;s homes.  It is not just politicians.  We have seen journalists and the Chief Medical Officer being subjected to this kind of abuse.  Frankly, I do not think it is acceptable.  We need to give the powers to garda&iacute; to be able to address this.</p> <p>For every right, there are also responsibilities and there are competing sets of rights.  Alongside the right to protest there is the right to privacy, which an individual has, and the right to a family home.  It is often not just the person who is the subject or target of that protest who is affected.  It is their family and it often involves children and, indeed, their neighbours.  Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is part of Irish law, very clearly respects that right to privacy.  Under our Constitution, it has been held as one of the unenumerated rights.  This very specific type of legislation was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 1988.  It is important we now protect individuals&rsquo; private homes.</p> <p>I am happy to introduce the Bill today.  It will proceed as a Private Members&rsquo; Bill but I hope the Government will consider taking it on board.</p></speech>

It has had remarkable success in recent years.  I pay tribute to Niamh Daffy, the CEO, who was identified as one of the most influential women in sport in Ireland.  It is a tribute to what she and the organisation have achieved, and I congratulate her on that.</p><p>I want to raise the fact the HPV vaccine has been shown to lead to a 90% reduction in cervical cancer.  It is a tribute to Laura Brennan and a tribute to the people who have campaigned tirelessly for the HPV vaccine to be taken up in this country.  It is wonderful that over 80% of young people now get the HPV vaccine, and we need to get that to 95%, 96% or even 100%, if possible.  It is a proven and documented vaccine and a report in <i>The Irish Times</i>today shows how successful it is.</p><p>On a Commencement matter in the House three or four weeks ago, I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the issue that, for those who do not get the HPV vaccine for their children and decide a couple of years later it is a good idea to do so, there is a cost of between &euro;400 and &euro;600.  That is another barrier to people getting the HPV vaccine.  The Minister of State very kindly responded that this is going to be eliminated and that cost is not going to be a barrier for people taking the HPV vaccine at any stage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That was six weeks ago.

It is often said that an ounce of action is worth a ton of talk.  Today we must all recognise the time for talking is over.  Today is a day we must all take action.  Climate change is real.  It is dangerous and it is taking place at an unprecedented rate.  This is indisputable.  It is a fact that none of us can escape or deny and we must all accept it.  If we want the best for our children and for their friends and future generations, we must all take action.  We all want our children and their friends and future generations to live healthier, smarter and more sustainable lives than us.  We must take action to enable them to do this.</p> <p>Around the world, governments have wasted far too much time.  This is why I say that today the talking must stop.  We must take action.  We as legislators must not just endorse the Government's action plan - we have to own it.  We have to champion it and make it real for people.  We have to make it real for home owners and enable them to retrofit their homes.  We have to make it real for public servants.  We have to ensure that all legislation and public policy and every publicly funded programme is climate proofed.  We need to support everybody involved in the transportation industry, including bus drivers, taxi drivers and delivery people.  We must help them to adapt to sustainable transport modes.  We must help our farmers to grow and protect our environment.</p> <p>I know the Leader knows this and the Government knows this.  We have an opportunity to leave a legacy for future generations that will give them real hope for a healthier, cleaner and greener environment within which they can live and where there will be more opportunities for everyone.  It is not just down to us in government.  It is also down to those in opposition to stop the cynical negative prevarication and do the right thing.  Supporting the climate action plan is not just the environmentally right thing, the economically right thing or socially right thing - it is the morally right thing to do not for us but for future generations.  I want to use my time today to call on the Opposition and every elected member not just in this Chamber but in every chamber throughout the country to get behind the Government's climate action plan today and make it real and deliver on the promise and hope of a cleaner greener world for us all.</p></speech>

This issue affects not just politicians but also many other people who work in very important roles and do what is not just very important but also what is very good.</p> <p>Will the Leader get an update from the Minister of State with responsibility for sport on sports capital grants?  We had an announcement in early August with regard to the equipment side of sports capital grants and this was hugely welcome for sports clubs throughout the country, including in County Tipperary.  This is the small money.  The big money is the next round that comes.  I am being inundated by clubs.  In Tipperary there are many clubs that are hugely keen to get as much funding as possible.  There is a worry about when it will be announced.  There was talk it would be November or December and now it looks like it might be January or maybe later.  I know almost all of the applications have been assessed at this stage.  Is there any update on when this will happen?  The clubs are eager to get going and get funded.  I have been contacted by a huge number of clubs in Tipperary that want to get started.  The work done is of huge benefit to the area and the clubs.  I am thinking of all clubs, including tennis and GAA clubs, Kilsheelan-Kilcash GAA club and Clonmel soccer club.  The women's hockey team in Clonmel has an application for a new hockey pitch.  It has had no hockey pitch for years.  It has made an application with the Presentation school in Clonmel.  It really wants to get going on this to support so many people who are into sport in the area.  If we could get an update it would be greatly appreciated.</p></speech>

I want to share several points with Members today.  I thank the people who engaged in a very constructive and interesting debate although we did not get the outcome we sought.  There has been huge interest in it and I hope we will have another opportunity at another time to engage on it.  It was a very interesting debate.  If I represented people on a Luas line, a train line or any other form of public transport, I would be very concerned.  We exchanged these views last night so I will not reopen it.  I will just say that I will be exceptionally active on it.  I am doing two media interviews today on it.  It is important.  We had an opportunity and we took a decision not to support it but we are moving on.  That is politics and we have to keep going.</p> <p>Yesterday, I met the Minister for Health and spoke to him about my concerns about scoliosis.  I met him here in Leinster House briefly.  He has confirmed, and I accept, that he cannot come before us prior to Tuesday, 23 November, as the Leader had told us.  While it is disappointing, he made the case that he had to come with some positive news and that there was no point in coming and rattling off some old story that was of no consolation to the people who have scoliosis and the advocacy group I am dealing with.  I thank the Leader.  I know she made efforts.  They did not come to very much but that is not a reflection on her.  It is a reflection on the Minister's timetable and diary and his view that he needs to come with something concrete to share with us and tell us.</p> <p>We are here considering a draft Order of Business.  It is the Leader's job to bring it to the House and I respect this.  I would ask that at a minimum we need at least an hour and a half to consider it.  We have to give it justice.  We have the right to amend or seek to amend, with the consent of the House, the Order of Business and I would like to ask the Leader to facilitate that the Order of Business would be with Members at least 90 minutes before we come to the House to discuss it, if possible and if practical.  It is a reasonable request and I hope the Leader will be in agreement to facilitate it.</p></speech>

I rise today to thank the Leader for her intervention when I raised the issue of children under the age of 18 being discriminated against when playing competitive basketball.  I welcome this morning's announcement by the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Chambers, that the Government has made an amendment whereby children will be allowed to play in competition and not just in training.  This is very welcome news.  I had been contacted by a number of basketball organisations and clubs on this.  I thank the Leader for her intervention on this.</p> <p>Yesterday, I received an alarming phone call from a mother who was very concerned.  Over the weekend, her daughter had been out and a friend of hers had her drink spiked.  It turned out that up to 20 people had their drinks spiked in the one premises over the weekend.  This is something that has been raised on the floor of the Chamber previously.  There needs to be an awareness campaign.  Institute of Technology Carlow has students patrolling their bars and watching out for students, particularly first years, to ensure their drinks are not spiked.  This is something that seems to be escalating and going out of control.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Is there a need to get the Minister for Health into the House to discuss the matter in order to see if an awareness campaign can be initiated or to determine what restrictions can be put in place?  I ask that because it is alarming to hear of that number of people allegedly having their drinks spiked in one night alone.  That was just in one place, and there are many more.  Looking at local newspapers and listening to local radio stations shows that this is happening everywhere.  It is frightening.</p></speech>

At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters this morning, I heard a word that I never expected to hear in Leinster House or the Oireachtas.  I refer to the use of the word "eugenics" during the discussion at the meeting.  That is not something I ever expected to hear.  A witness who was appearing before the raised the possibility that people with autism would be obliged to train themselves out of displaying any of the features or characteristics which go with that condition.  We heard evidence about cognitive behavioural therapy that is given to autistic people in this State - they are autistic because that is part of who they are and they are proud of their identity - to teach them how to mask their condition.  I was struck by reading about that in the first instance.</p> <p>I attended an event held by the WALK community recently at which service users who had come through training for peer representation talked about their experiences.  One of those people spoke about how he feels obliged to mask the fact that he has a disability when he is out and about and pretend that he is neurotypical.  There is something to that.  Each week, I have come in here and talked about ableist privilege, but we must take this matter seriously.  We must consider what we are doing.  I am getting more emails and messages now because I have spoken about this issue week after week.  I am hearing about the lived experience of families with a child with a disability and from people in the autistic community.  Children in preschool are being expelled because they get anxiety, they have difficulties or they behave in a way that is not acceptable to their so-called carers.</p> <p>We need public information and training in respect of this issue.  We require so many things in order to ensure that everybody in our community has a right to be who they are and has that right supported.  We must ensure that we are inclusive and challenge issues in this area.  At the heart of everything we do must be the principle of "There is nothing about us, without us", and that must be treasured and held absolutely sacredly.  Nothing should happen in this State without the people who are most affected having a say and being able to influence the outcomes.</p></speech>

I have been here for a few years, but I am actually shocked by what the Senator said.  I am the mother of a young man who is on the autistic spectrum.  He is just the most gorgeous young man one could possibly meet.  He is sitting his leaving certificate examination this year and he has had the same journey over the past couple of years that all our other children have had.  He has the highest aspirations for himself and gets supported in the same way as my other three kids do, which is absolutely right.  I could never imagine trying to tell him to be something other than what he is.  I think what the Senator referred to is shocking.</p> <p>I welcome the other issue that she raised, however, regarding the cost of disability report.  We are going to debate it next week and I am grateful that the Minister of State has given her time.  It will give rise to much more debate and, hopefully, a great deal of action to alleviate some of the financial difficulties that people with all kinds of disabilities experience daily, other than the obvious barriers that Senator Seery Kearney talks about every Thursday morning.  I look forward to the debate next week.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the bizarre variances between Basketball Ireland and Sport Ireland which were brought to our attention last week and which she raised earlier this week.  It was no problem for me to raise that matter with the Minister of State, and I am very glad that he has sorted out those regulations as swiftly as he has this week.  It is not until something is done to upset people that it is possible to realise just how many people are involved in some of these organisations.  A great many of our children play basketball and I acknowledge that.</p> <p>The Senator also referred to the fact that she has been contacted by people, I presume in her part of the country, about a particular matter.  Senator O'Loughlin started off this morning by talking about the increase in the number of incidences of spiking.  Nightclubs only opened a week and a half ago, and yet we are already talking about what is a new phenomenon.  The spiking of the drinks of women and men is not new, but the use of needles is a practice which is very new to us.  I spent an hour on the phone yesterday evening talking to a mother.  It was a horrific conversation.  She has a young lady who is the same age as my 20-year-old daughter.  I cannot even begin to imagine what the young lady in question and her family are going through now.  Despite the abuse that some of us have received from people who seem to think that we are scaremongering, that there is no such occurrence as a woman getting spiked with a needle and that we are making mountains out of molehills, on foot of the telephone conversation to which I refer, I wrote to the Garda Commissioner, the presidents of all our universities and the directors of our licensed vintners' associations yesterday evening to invite them to a meeting at a date that is convenient, hopefully next week, in order that we can sit around a table and talk about the occurrences that have happened in the last ten days and the protocols that should be in place.</p> <p>The mother to whom I spoke to yesterday said that her daughter was told by the health and safety people in the nightclub where she was to go home and sleep it off.  When she went to the accident and emergency department the next day, the doctor there tried to assure her that it was an insect bite that she got on the dance floor and that she had not been spiked with a needle.  It was only when she went to the accident and emergency department and the genito-urinary medicine, GUM, unit in Cork University Hospital, CUH, that she received toxicology reports.  That young lady will now be on hepatitis and PrEP medication for three months arising from the incident she experienced.</p> <p>This is a real and serious issue.  I am a mother and most of us are parents, and we worry about absolutely bloody well everything.  I never thought, however, that when my two young girls are going out to nightclubs that I would have to worry and to warn them about not getting injected by some bowsie wanting to take advantage of them.  What is happening is unacceptable, and we must step up and ensure that we put in place the protocols concerning how we deal with this issue.  I refer to ensuring that licensed vintners know how to deal with young women when they present in these kinds of situations, that hospitals know what to do and when to do it, that the police know how to follow up and that everybody is aware of their responsibilities.  Anybody who wants to come to the meeting I have arranged is more than welcome to do so.  I thank the Senators for raising the issue this morning.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan talked about the debate on public transport we had last night.  It was welcome.  This is an issue, and that was made evident by many people who work in our transport sector and the number of public representatives who have made representations regarding the safety of those employees.  It is also an issue affecting people who travel on buses, trains and Darts.  Despite what Barry Kenny has said, this is an issue.  I do not agree with him.  Perhaps we do not need a special police force for our public transport, but we certainly do need a different way for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to go about looking after the safety of the employees and users of public transport services.</p> <p>I am glad that the Senator also met with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, yesterday and spoke with him about the issue scoliosis.  I hope that for the person concerned, and for the other 172 under 18-year-olds on the waiting lists, that the Minister will respond to us in the next couple of weeks with good news.  I wish all those people success and as much success as young Adam Terry had last week with his operation.  It was a success and that is great news.</p> <p>Senator Ahearn spoke about the matter of protests against individuals, and he also sought an update on the sports capital grants.  I will contact the relevant Minister of State today and ask him if he will give me the magic date regarding when we are going to get the good announcements.</p></speech>

With respect, Senator McDowell brought the matter up this morning at our weekly meeting of group leaders.  The schedule for next week was given to people at that meeting today, which is only Thursday.  The Order of Business only comes from and reflects the schedule given to the leaders of the groups on Thursdays.  It is given to everybody 60 minutes before we come in, and there is little difference, if ever any difference, between the information I provide on Thursdays and what happens then in the following week.  The information concerned, however, is given to every Member as early in the morning as it is possible for us to do so.</p> <p>I cannot give Senator Boyhan a commitment that it will be provided 90 minutes beforehand.  It is, though, given to everybody now an hour beforehand, and if anyone has a difference of opinion in respect of what is provided to the Senators on a Thursday and then what is later provided on the mornings of the following Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, then I would be happy to discuss that at the weekly meeting of the group leaders.  We can only do what we can do, though.  We work with the Seanad Office and all the Ministers to prepare an order every morning and we give that to all our Members within an hour before coming here.  That is the best commitment that I can give.  I am sorry.</p></speech>

I wholeheartedly agree with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and I condemn last night's violence.  I ask everybody to step back.  It is interesting that in recent poll of business owners in the North a significant majority said they welcomed the Northern Ireland protocol, albeit that they wanted little tweaks here and there to make it better.  They also said it had increased their level of business, both North-South and east-west, which makes me wonder if we are listening to the loudest voices as opposed to the people with the most impact.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the meeting on Tuesday, despite having raised the time constraints with the Minister last week, because we were dealing with the Order of Business.  Since I missed the meeting, I did not see the presentation that was promised to us.  I will inform the Minister today that we need to see the PowerPoint presentation and seek an undertaking in that regard.  I give Senator Craughwell and the 11 or 12 other Senators who attended the meeting the other day a commitment in that regard.</p> <p>There are very real concerns about the Air Navigation and Transport Bill and I am in the unfortunate position of having to say that I share them.  The reason is not political or based on votes in Fingal, an accusation that gets thrown in my face every 20 minutes.  It is based on the fact that 1,300 pilots are crying out for these rules and regulations to protect them in order that they can protect the thousands of people who get on aeroplanes every single day and put their safety and lives in pilots' hands.  I question why a regulatory office would not want to have powers and controls to ensure Ireland has the safest possible airline industry, one which reflects the safe industry we have across Europe.  I will follow up on the matter for Senator Craughwell and try to get a commitment today.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher spoke with great passion and remembrance regarding the plea from Columba McVeigh's family.  I am astounded by the family's dignity in spite of their loss and the 46 years they have spent trying to get information.  There was great dignity in the statement they made this year about letting bygones be bygones.  All they want to do is to be able to bury their loved one and have somewhere they can visit and put some flowers.  I concur with Senator Gallagher in making that call, as we do so often, on anyone who has any information to please give it to the Garda or local organisations that can help find this young man's body in order that his family can finally have peace and rest.</p> <p>Senator Black spoke about the six Palestinian groups that have suddenly been designated as terrorist groups by the Israelis.  I will make sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs hears of her reflections this morning and I will ask for an update.  The Minister will speak about the Northern Ireland protocol in the House in the coming weeks, as he has been repeatedly requested to do by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  I have requested a debate on Palestine, Israel, the conflict there and the two-state solution.  I do not have a date yet, but as soon as I get one, I will speak to Senator Black about it.  I will make sure the Minister hears her reflections this morning.</p> <p>I thank Senator Mark Wall for what he read out and said about Jadotville.  I agree with him.  There have been a number of requests by this House.  There is never a wrong time to do the right thing.  I encourage the Senator to keep his passion in the place he has it.</p> <p>I acknowledge that while the House debated energy security, we did not have a debate on the price of energy, which is a pertinent issue.  As I am supposed to represent the Government on most days, I should note that this is not just an Irish phenomenon.  However, we must put it in a national context.  It is making a significant difference to people's weekly outgoings and is not something we can ignore.</p> <p>Senator Boylan spoke about the climate action plan.  I know Sinn F&eacute;in has raised concerns about consultation.  I can only reassure the Senator that the 4,000 original submissions made on the climate action plan as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process fed into and strengthened the climate action Bill.  The whole premise of the Bill is to make sure we have constant consultation.  The only way this will be a success is if we bring everybody with us and do not start picking holes and fighting about this or that industry.  At the end of the day, we are all of the same mind and we are all better when we work together.  There is only one way this is ever going to work.  We can talk about doing it for our kids and grandkids but it does not make a difference who we do it for.  I am young enough and I hope I will not feel the impacts of this.  We need to do this for ourselves.  I acknowledge Senator Boylan's concerns.</p> <p>Senator Martin spoke as eloquently as he always does about antisocial behaviour on trains.  I will request that the Minister comes the House.</p> <p>Senator Mullen raised concerns about science subjects on the curriculum.  We have debates to mark Science Week next week, so that may be an opportunity for the Senator to raise the matter.  There is probably a wider debate regarding the formation of the curriculum and reforms to the leaving certificate.  I will write to the Minister today asking that she make time available in her diary as soon as she can.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on RT&Eacute;, in particular in light of the significant amount of money it has spent in the past ten years either fighting or settling defamation claims.  A more important concern should be the number of people in RT&Eacute; who have been taken off temporary short-term contracts and made permanent employees in recent years.  Some of them had worked for RT&Eacute; for 25 or 30 years.  A significant number of staff still remain on precarious employment contracts, which is not acceptable.  I will organise a debate as quickly as I can.</p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin started proceedings by pointing out that today is international day against violence and bullying at school.  We have spoken about this issue a number of times.  I have requested a debate, not just on the curriculum and how teachers, guidance counsellors and support staff in schools look after children, but how we can best support families &ndash; the parents and siblings of a child who is being bullied - to make sure that they do not believe bullying is a normal occurrence, as it seems to have become in towns and villages.  We must support children who are experiencing increasing anxiety problems and resilience issues.  I do not have a date for a debate but I will keep chasing it up.</p></speech>

In amendment No. 1, I try to spell out some of the aspects more specifically.  There is a slightly different piece of work being done in amendment No. 3.  Fundamentally, these amendments provide for reports both on the operations of this Bill and on the operations of the mechanisms which are being updated by this legislation.  The specific area of focus for me is related to the precautionary condition credit line.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1 provides that there would be, by 31 December 2022, just over 12 months from now, a report laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on what potential reviews there may be of the European Stability Mechanism and its operations, including the potential revisions of the Annex III criteria, which is a specific area of interest for me and which we discussed previously, to better reflect the outcomes from the EU economic governance framework which, as the Minister rightly highlighted, was relaunched in September - it was initially there in 2020 but was suspended - and is open for pubic engagement until December.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I encourage people to engage because the governance framework we have at an EU level is going to be really important.  We know mistakes were made in regard to that governance framework in the past, whereby, as I have highlighted before, things like the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth initiative, which was a very well though-through plan under Europe 2020, was very much put aside in favour of economic and short-term fiscal targets.  There were the 11 points put forward by the former head of the European Commission, Mr. Juncker, which later needed to be supplemented by a social pillar because the way economic governance had been focused, with the emphasis on austerity and short-term fiscal governance and targets over the long-term development goals for the EU and the states within it.  That led to a fracturing of our social fabric and resulted in many missed opportunities.  Many of us have an eye at this time to COP26 and climate action.  We lost a lot of time in terms of making the transitions we should be making in respect of sustainability during the period when the focus was constantly on the short-term fiscal targets and the EU semester process excessively focused on that.</p><p>The semester process is gone, the recovery and resilience process is functioning and we now have the discussion on what comes next.  I do not necessarily want to fight over old battles but I want to make sure we do not embed old structures.  Unfortunately, the criteria that are currently proposed under Annex III are very much the same criteria, including fiscal criteria, that we had in the past.  For example, Article 14 allows that the board of governors of the ESM may decide to change the eligibility criteria.  I might be ruled out of order for trying to change the actual mechanism but the board of governors, which Ireland has a role in, may decide to change the eligibility criteria around precautionary financial assistance and may amend Annex III in that regard.  These are things that are potentially likely to happen.  One of the key factors that may influence how they happen is the decisions that are made on what kind of economic governance framework we want to have, where all of this fits into it and, I hope, a recognition of the failures of the past.</p><p>Another point to consider is that as well as the review of economic governance, there is a parallel process underway in the form of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  My participation in that forum was the reason I was not able to engage directly with the Minister on Committee Stage.  I thank colleagues for having brought forward points of concerns.  One of the conversations at the conference is around what we are going to prioritise, what the focus will be, whether we can make the kinds of long-term transformational changes that are needed and how we can facilitate public investment.  The tools we had, including the precautionary credit line, were found to be inadequate in the face of a crisis like Covid.  In fact, we had a situation with that credit line where we had to change the rules and waive many of the requirements in order to be able to act with the speed and in the way we needed to act to give the fiscal stimulus that was vital and very much welcomed across Europe.  Indeed, that went a long way towards rebuilding public faith in, and engagement with, the European project.</p><p>The point is that there was a solidarity response, although, unfortunately, it was not extended to the wider world in terms of a TRIPS waiver.  Be that as it may, within the European Union, there was a solidarity response and there were speedy mechanisms deployed.  This pointed up that the tools we had available were not fit for purpose and were, in fact, getting in the way.  When we talk about things like the climate crisis, for instance, or the massive transformations that are needed in terms of something as simple as the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, with people in that cohort making up 14% to 18% of society across different EU states, that creates a whole shift.  When major changes are needed and there is a major deficit to address, including the deficits in public services that came to light during the Covid crisis, we need economic governance policies that facilitate long-term thinking and a fiscal response that is flexible and recognises the environmental boundaries and social imperatives.</p><p>It seems like I am bringing a lot into this discussion but I am doing so because I know the Minister is aware of all of this and is fully engaged in the European discussion.  Nothing is closed.  We are not in an Overton window position where we have had business as usual and now we have a small window in which we are doing things differently during the Covid period but we will then will go back to the same as before.  The Minister has acknowledged that we are facing periods of radical change and transformation and that how we in Ireland and our fellow EU states are able and willing to respond to that is crucial.  The two major conversations, namely, the Conference on the Future of Europe and the review of economic governance, are fundamental.</p><p>I spoke on Second Stage about my concern that we have chosen to build the same old mechanisms into the new arrangements.  They are slightly different because it is a case of doing things in advance rather than after the fact, but they are still the same fiscal criteria and debt ratios.  There is scope in this agreement to change them.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 make specific provision in that regard and amendment No. 3 is specifically around the precautionary conditional credit line.  We had a situation where we had a supposed safety net for states for which only nine countries qualified.  If the safety net does not work for a majority of European Stability Mechanism members, then it is not a safety net that works or is fit for purpose.  We might press each country to get to the fiscal targets and criteria that will allow them to qualify for the precautionary conditional credit line but, in some cases, that would be asking countries that are under pressure to put themselves under further pressure to get to a level at which they can be helped.  If there is a financial crisis in each of those countries, they are not going to be able to access the support.  We have a situation where this credit line is not meeting its purpose  The Minister acknowledged in his speech, as has been acknowledged in briefings previously, that it was a failure that the previous criteria served as an obstacle such that nobody accessed the precautionary conditional credit line.  It certainly was of no use in regard to the Covid crisis.</p><p>What I am trying to do in amendment No. 3 is have the Minister be a champion within this process.  We cannot change the process.  I tried to do so in some of my amendments on Committee Stage but I know I cannot change the mechanisms.  Nonetheless, the Minister and Ireland have a key role within that process.  Amendment No. 3 is asking that the Minister, or his or her representative on the board of governors, would advocate, if we have a situation where more than half the members of the ESM do not qualify for the safety net, that there be a review of it.  If we have a situation, as we have had in the past, where only nine countries qualify for the credit line, the criteria should be reviewed to ensure it is a credit line that can work and that people can reach.  I am asking that in those situations, Ireland, through its role on the board of governors, would advocate for a review of the criteria, including the eligibility criteria provided for in Annex III, as is allowed for under Article 14.1 of the proposed schedule, and that powers be activated whereby the board of governors may decide to change the eligibility criteria for the ESM precautionary financial assistance provision and amend Annex III accordingly.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I advocate Ireland's triggering of the activation of the powers in those circumstances and having an appropriate review.</p><p>There are two things happening in these amendments.  We could have argued against their grouping.  In the first two, I am suggesting there should be a review of the Annex III criteria that reflects the outcomes of the economic governance review and the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I ask that the Minister, in his report and engagement with the Oireachtas in this regard, indicate the position Ireland will take in the review.  He should engage with both Houses of the Oireachtas or the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the position Ireland will take given the outcomes of the Conference on the Future of Europe and the review of economic governance.  That is one proposal.</p><p>My other proposal, as contained in amendment No. 3, is that if the precautionary conditioned credit line does not work for, or is not within reach of, at least half of the ESM member states, Ireland should seek the triggering of a review of the criteria to ensure fitness for purpose.</p><p>Perhaps an amendment like mine will be proposed in the D&aacute;il.  It would be a worthy amendment.  I would be glad if the Minister gave us a signal on this because it would be useful.  I have indicated three reasons why a review of Annex III might be needed but, if for any other reason the board of governors decides to change the eligibility criteria for ESM precautionary financial assistance and amend Annex III, I hope the Minister will engage.  It is stated the changes would come into force only after applicable national procedures.  I hope the Minister will indicate to us today that he will consider engagement with the Oireachtas or the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to be part of the applicable national procedure for Ireland if it is to take a position on proposed changes to eligibility criteria.  Perhaps that is a matter the Minister will address in his answer.</p><p>The Minister will be aware of an amendment of mine that would not be in order because it deals with the shared document.  It specifies that the applicable national procedure for Ireland should include consultation with the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  Perhaps that might be revisited in the D&aacute;il.  It would certainly give some assurance.  Could the Minister indicate that where the powers under Article 14 are being triggered or activated, he intends to engage with the Oireachtas on the position Ireland will take regarding the board of governors?</p><p>I thank the Minister for his engagement on this.  I read the detailed comments he made on Committee Stage.  I am aware that he understands very well the kinds of decisions we are making and the seriousness of our future direction, and that is why I hope he might be able to give a positive indication regarding the reports and reviews.</p></speech>

The Minister made a very thoughtful speech on Second Stage in which he contrasted the approach of the EU in the wake of the Covid crisis with the approach associated with the austerity of the preceding decade.  I believe he was right, and that is why I do not understand why there has been no change to the financial criteria for accessing the precautionary credit line.  It does not make sense.  Therefore, the requests made by Senator Higgins are very reasonable.  I urge the Minister to accept them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-04a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110400002#T00300"><p>I apologise to Members for keeping them waiting.  I have just come from the D&aacute;il, where I was taking Leaders' Questions, so I could not get here any quicker.</p> <p>I thank Senator Higgins for the substantive amendments she has tabled and the important matters she is raising regarding this legislation and its future operation.  I thank her also for her acknowledgement of the importance of the debates currently under way in the European Union.  I am very much aware of, and understand, the issues she is raising.  In addition to approaching these matters as Minister for Finance for our country, which is a tremendous privilege, I am also serving as chairman of the board of governors of the ESM.  Therefore, I have regular engagement with the ESM and understand the issues the Senator is raising, in addition to those concerning the future architecture of the European Union in the sense of how it will deal with the future of economic and monetary union and, in particular, with countries or banks that experience great financial difficulty.</p> <p>I genuinely thank Senator Higgins for displaying such interest in these matters because they are so important to the future of Ireland and Europe.  In responding to the broad group of amendments that have been tabled by her, I can assure her regarding the spirit in which, and attitude with which, I would approach co-operation with the Oireachtas on the debate on the future of the Stability and Growth Pact.  I assure her that in the context of any decisions the board of governors might need to make on the operation of the ESM, I and, I expect, future Ministers for Finance will engage with the Oireachtas and explain to the Seanad or relevant committee the Government's view on the debate on the future of the Stability and Growth Pact, the input Ireland has regarding the operation of the ESM, the actions taken, the view on how the ESM is operating and decisions it might make.</p> <p>I will deal with the procedural questions before I move on to the policy issues the Senator raised.  While I can assure the Senator on the spirit in which I will co-operate and on my expectation that future Ministers will co-operate, I cannot accept these amendments.  I cannot do so for two reasons, the first of which is that I believe, as a matter of principle, that it is not appropriate to deal with issues concerning the relationship between the Executive and the Parliament by way of requiring reports to be furnished through legislation.  I do not believe it is good use of legislation, nor do I believe it is appropriate that issues of accountability be dealt with in that specific way.</p> <p>Second, regarding the role of Ireland as a member of the board of governors of the ESM, it is very conceivable that decisions will have to be made by the ESM and its board at speed.  In those circumstances, we will have to respect the need for fast and efficient decision-making.  We will have to respect the fact that it may at times be practically difficult for the board of governors to operate in really urgent circumstances.  Overlaying the process with the kinds of procedures Senator Higgins is seeking, in the sense of requiring the Government to account for the view of its representative on the board, can be done, but it should be done in a way that respects the fact that the ESM deals with very sensitive matters.  It has to deal with those matters in private, and sometimes in a really urgent way.  It is possible that its board of governors might not be able to fulfil its duties as a board if some of the things Senator Higgins is calling on our representative on the board to do must be done.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Those are the procedural reasons I am not in a position to accept the amendments - first, because of the relationship between the Oireachtas and the Government and, second, the particular way in which the ESM may have to operate, though I hope we it is never obliged to operate in that way.</p><p>To move to the policy matters raised by Senator Higgins, the first issue I understand her to be raising in that regard is her concern that this ESM legislation in some way predetermines the debate that is under way regarding what could be the future of the stability and growth pact.  Let us park for a moment that debate and where it may end up.  I fully respect the Senator's views on that issue and thank her for the role she is playing on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  However, on a basic and fundamental level, a law or a treaty can only make reference to other laws or architectures that are in place at this time.  This framework can only make reference to the stability and growth pact, SGP, because the only governance framework that is in place within the European Union is the SGP.  She stated that it should not predetermine the political debate that is under way, and I understand that point.  However, I make the point that a law or a treaty can only refer to other laws or treaties that are in existence and cannot be based on change that may happen in the future.  If there were to be change in the stability and growth pact and the economic architecture of the European Union and the euro area, the board of governors of the ESM would be cognisant of that change in any decisions they may make in the future.  However, on a fundamental level, if the Senator is arguing that this is predetermining any political debate, I do not believe it is doing so, but would argue that a law or a treaty can only make reference to other laws or treaties as they stand at this time.  </p><p>Second, the Senator made the point that the safety net of the Covid precautionary credit line from the European stability mechanism was inadequate because only nine countries could have qualified for it.</p></speech>

The Covid fund was widely applicable.  My point related to the previous tool, namely, the precautionary conditional credit line.  I was told by the Minister's Department that approximately nine countries would have qualified for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-04a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110400002#U00300"><p>That may be so, but a safety net is only credible if it recognises that countries might not need it because their national finances are sound and resilient.  How would a credit net be realistic or credible if a country in excellent economic condition, with very low debt, in surplus year to year and a growing economy with multiple sources of employment and income growth and no macroeconomic imbalances, also qualifies for use of the safety net?  The very nature of a safety net is that it will have criteria for access and there will be countries that will not need it.  I do not believe that in order for a safety net or a credit line to be credible, all countries have to be able to immediately qualify for it.  There will always be countries that, by dint of their national budgetary policies and the decisions they make, may not need to qualify for it.</p> <p>As regards the Covid-related points made by the Senator, the reason it ended up being the case that no countries had a need to access the Covid precautionary credit line in particular was the success of all the other things the European Union did, such as the decision the Commission made with regard to activating the general escape clause, the decision the European Central Bank made through its pandemic emergency purchase programme and the role of the support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency, SURE, programme.  For me, particularly in the context of the Covid environment we are in, the fact that the ESM was not called in is purely a consequence of the success of other interventions by the European Union and the national buffers that many countries, including Ireland, had built up before this awful disease hit.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the various issues she has highlighted.  Issues of accountability and the relationship between the Executive and the Parliament are better dealt with outside the legal framework we are currently debating.  In any event, I do not believe it would be practically possible in the event that the ESM was called into action or that the treaty we are discussing predetermines the outcome of the political process that is under way in respect of the stability and growth pact.</p></speech>

To be clear, my amendment does not relate to the Covid conditional credit line.  The general escape clause was needed.  If we have a stability mechanism where a general escape clause is needed, that raises questions regarding the functionality of that mechanism.  However, my concern does not relate to those that do not need it.  The problem is that fiscal criteria for fiscal health are being set in order to be able to qualify for it.  That is the concern.  The concern is that there is a need to hit certain debt-to-spending ratios, the same kinds of criteria that countries were required to meet in order to access the safety net.  It is not about the countries in good financial health being excluded; the concern is that the countries that might need or have needed this precautionary credit line the most - not the Covid particular credit line but the general precautionary credit line - will not qualify for it, particularly now because the idea is that it is a pre-qualification to get near the safety net of that precautionary conditional credit line.  The argument was made that it was political because of the political impact of having these criteria attached after the fact.  It is a problem if there is something that several countries may need but cannot qualify for and access and the only way around that is a general escape clause.</p> <p>There is a concern relating to the Annex III criteria the Minister mentioned in terms of their amendments and change.  I am not suggesting that the board of governors would have to consult Ireland on every decision it makes.  The specific aspect I was speaking to relates to where there is a change in the eligibility criteria for ESM precautionary financial assistance and amendments to Annex III.  Even in a situation where emergency or other decisions are being made in a short timeline or at short notice, there is nothing to preclude the inclusion of a provision for them to be reviewed.  That is a matter that could be considered on Report Stage or as the Bill progresses through the D&aacute;il.  It is normal to build reviews into legislation and to recognise that situations arise where decisions may need to be reviewed.  That would be appropriate.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister's indication that where the board of governors is making a decision, it is his expectation that there would be engagement with the joint Oireachtas committee.  That is important.  These are significant decisions.  In terms of the balance of what I have put forward, I am not attempting to pre-empt what might emerge from the process on the review of economic governance or the Conference on the Future of Europe.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is appropriate - this happens all the time with legislation - to build in review points and points where it can be anticipated there will be a review.  We know this from lots of legislation, such as, for example, the two-year review built into the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act.  It is quite standard practice to build in a review point, especially with legislation that is coming through in a situation where there are known unknowns and where there is a known uncertainty regarding the landscape in which that legislation will operate.  In this case, the known unknowns include the economic governance review and the outcomes of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  There are probably also some known unknowns regarding the impact of the climate crisis.  We know we have a situation in which the landscape will change.  As a result, the report is the mechanism which I can suggest be used.</p><p>I will push back a little on the Minister's suggestion that reports are not the best.  For those of us in the Seanad who cannot bring forward amendments with a financial implication, for example, reports are one of the key ways in which we can identify and signal key policy issues in respect of the consequences or impact of legislation.  They are an important tool at times and have been very useful.  We know that, in many cases, amendments on Report Stage requiring the submission of reports on issues relating to legislation being dealt with by the House have ended up sowing the seeds of subsequent legislation that might come from Departments.  There is a role for reports.</p><p>Leaving that aside, whatever one's views on reports, there is certainly a role for reviews.  It would be useful if, perhaps, in this Bill's journey through the D&aacute;il consideration was given to making a commitment to carry out a review on what position Ireland will take.  We will go further into the positions Ireland might take on the economic governance review in our next set of amendments.  I will not anticipate the debate in that regard.  On both the issue of a situation whereby a number of countries do not meet the qualifying criteria of the precautionary condition credit line, or a situation where the board decides to amend Annex III, even if those happen at short notice, we could build in a mechanism whereby the Oireachtas will engage with the Minister, or any subsequent Minister, on what position Ireland will take.  That might be six-month review or it may be a matter of a decision needing to be made.  If it is an emergency decision, or one taken in an emergency context, it is all the more important that it is reviewed and gets proper scrutiny.</p><p>We need these mechanisms for healthy countries with healthy finances and so on because it is vitally important that we have solidarity between countries.  We are focusing on the Stability and Growth Pact mechanisms, but their overall thrust and goal, and that of the legislation, is to have a mechanism that functions in the context of solidarity.  The reason each country's health matters to the others is that we are connected globally but, very specifically, we are connected within the European Union and in the context of economic and monetary union.  We are deeply interdependent.  There have been failures of solidarity in the past, which have had consequences that may not always have come out on the balance sheets of the economy, but have come out socially and through situations of political instability.  In that regard, it is in everybody's interest, no matter what the health of any country is, that the safety net works for a majority of members to whom it is meant to apply.</p></speech>

Three, rather than two, amendments have gone in.  Effectively, these amendments relate to that process the Minister rightly highlighted is happening, and is important, which is the European Commission's reinstated review of EU economic governance.  Again, I know we cannot have a situation whereby we require the Minister to have agreement and so forth, but it is appropriate that there would be engagement because the position Ireland takes on this really matters.  It matters in the sense that the position each country takes on the future of EU economic governance is fundamentally important to the health and survival of our Union.</p> <p>It is, perhaps, particularly important in the context of the position Ireland takes because the Minister is very influential in terms of economic policy at European level.  I have seen him engage in discussions and debate at an EU level.  It is very important and appropriate that where Ireland is participating, contributing and perhaps shaping economic policy, all those branches of expression of the Irish public through the legislature would have engagement in that conversation.  We know the influence that Irish financial advocacy has had.  We saw it very recently, for example, in the discussions on tax law.  The Minister spoke recently with Ms Yellen on the positions being taken by the US Treasury on tax and the question of at least - or not at least - a 15% corporate tax rate.  These are all massively significant decisions and there is an onus on the Oireachtas and the Government, as the Executive branch, to engage very constructively on this because the decisions made on economic governance, and the positions taken on economic and financial policy and governance, have extraordinarily significant life and death impacts on the lives of the citizens we represent.</p> <p>We know that during the financial crisis many of the decisions, including those relating to banking, were taken in the middle of the night.  We know there was deep frustration during some of the period of austerity regarding the sense of disempowerment, disenfranchisement and disengagement when it came to crucial financial decisions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many people felt that their discussion was always on the outcomes and about what service gets cut and what is most needed.  We need to have an empowering, positive engagement and relationship with the European Union.  For that to be meaningful, it needs to have citizen engagement and the public representatives in both of these Houses must be able to show that we can engage and that we can help to shape the European Union and its economic governance and financial structures.  That is part of rebuilding faith and trust in the European Union.  It says that these areas are not shut down.  It is not simply a case of saying what has happened in Europe and what we need to do now but instead that we shape it.  I know that we shape it and that the Minister shapes it.  We need to bring that connection to the public.  These are incredibly important decisions about what the economic governance of the European Union will look like in the future.</p><p>I ask that the Minister provide the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach with an outline of the proposed position that Ireland intends to take.  I have three versions of the amendment.  I ask that the Minister engage with us prior to any decision on economic governance.  These are all different ways of wording it.  I wanted to make sure that I balanced appropriately and was clear.  I am not saying that the Minister needs to seek the approval of both Houses or even of the committee about the position that he takes but I ask that he engage.  Will he indicate if he can support any of these three amendments?  If there is a principled objection about a report, perhaps the Minister will signal what other mechanism would be appropriate for ensuring that we have public and visible scrutiny of the position Ireland will take on the next direction for the European Union.</p></speech>

I believe that the need that Senator Higgins refers to is better discharged through the normal functioning of the Oireachtas and the normal procedures of accountability between the Minister and the Oireachtas committee.  As I indicated in my opening contribution, I do not believe that there should be further reporting requirements for a member of Government on this matter beyond the normal procedures that are in place.  In particular, I have a concern about amendment No. 4, which lays down a timeline in which this could be done.  It is certain that by 1 December 2021, the Government will not have concluded its work on what our national position will be in the debate that is unfolding on the future of the Stability and Growth Pact.  On the other matters, I believe that the best way for the Government to inform the Oireachtas and the country on our view on the future of the Stability and Growth Pact and our national position is through the normal procedures between the Oireachtas and the Government.  For those reasons, I am not in a position to accept Senator Higgins's amendments but I assure her that, in the debate which will unfold across next year rather than this year, the Government will make the Oireachtas aware of our national position in this important debate.</p></speech>

Ireland is one of only seven countries in the European Union that did not have parliamentary scrutiny or debate on our plan for recovery and resilience.  That is a fund of &euro;850 million, which is substantial, and which did not have public scrutiny, Oireachtas scrutiny or engagement.  That is why I am trying to insert hard instruments in this regard to ensure we have such engagement because, sadly, we have not had it.  We had requests from the joint committee about scrutiny of that matter.  It is a frustrating issue, given that one of the largest individual, financial and fiscal packages was being made, since we did not have the opportunity to input, guide or engage on that plan.  We were an outlier within the European Union on that.  Only seven countries did not have such a process.</p> <p>I agree that the December date in amendment No. 4 is tight.  It is because mid-December is the point for public and stakeholder engagement.  For stakeholders to be able to engage on the economic governance position, it is useful for them to have it.  That is why I refer to an outline.  I agree that it may not be finalised.  I hope that when there is engagement from the Government, it will not be fully finalised but there will be scope and flexibility to engage with what is coming through.  At the moment, the deadline for other stakeholders to engage on economic governance falls in December.  There is not a sense yet of an outline of what position Ireland will advocate for and what difference it will make.  I do not like to cite media concerns.</p> <p>There was a concern with regard to housing which I will not go into in depth since it is not in the Minister's remit.  We have seen clear positions being taken in the Department of Finance with regard to other realms and other areas, relating to, for example, the State accessing finance.  I am concerned that leasing, which we were told was only being done because we were required to do it by the fiscal rules, has continued to be part of this year's budget strategy.  More than 2,600 houses are proposed to be provided through leasing, which is bad value for the State.  There is a concern that policies and preferences are being pursued which, in some cases, overrule other economic advice such as the advice from the ESRI, yet it has not had public discussion.</p> <p>Even the tensions between competing goals that we have as a State have not been properly articulated, for example, between our long-term development strategy and our position on fiscal constraints or the Stability and Growth Pact.  I am not likely to put this in.  It is only in the context of some frustration about engagement on this that I would table these amendments.  I will withdraw amendment No. 4 but will press amendments Nos. 5 and 6.  I recognise that 1 December is quite tight, but it is tight for everyone.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are certainly related.<br/><br/>The Minister provided clarity on the ESM's engagement with the European Commission in his reply on Committee Stage.  While I am very interested in those clarities, in amendment No. 7, I have proposed that it would be useful if we had procedures or agreements between the ESM and the European Commission, for example, if there are memorandums of understanding, MOUs, and if there are clearly demarcated areas of responsibility.  The Minister gave some information on that but if there are any formal instruments or agreements that emerge on that, it would be very useful for those to be made public.  Perhaps they will be made public.  The Minister might be able to give me assurance on that, in which case the amendment would not be necessary.  Certainly, we need clarity on exactly what the roles the ESM and the European Commission are when they are co-operating on policy.  I very much appreciate the Minister's outlining of it.  If there are any formal mechanisms, it would be also be useful to have those.  It is always better to see procedures in writing.<br/><br/>On amendment No. 8 the focus is not the ESM's engagement with the European Commission regarding any member.  Where the ESM is engaging with the European Commission on a member and the ESM is engaging, as is provided for under the amended legislation, with a private investor to a member, the ESM may have these two different roles.  On the one hand, it may be engaging access to funding for a member with the European Commission, with the Stability and Growth Pact and so forth.  The Minister has indicated in his speech that this is voluntary and on request, but nonetheless there is concern over working with private investors on the one hand and working with one of the instruments or bodies of the European Union on the other hand while ensuring each interest is very clearly specified.<br/><br/>I have suggested that the Minister might publish a report outlining what procedures, safeguards, firewalls and internal confidentiality protocols are in place.  I know there is an indication in the legislation that there would be confidentiality - I believe the Minister also indicated it in his speech - on the ESM's engagement with the private investor to a member and that it would all be happening at the request of the member.  Sometimes confidentiality can be a bit of a concern as much as a protection.  If we do not know what conversation the ESM is having with the private investor, we should at least be absolutely sure it is not influencing in any sense the discussions the ESM may be having with the European Commission about a member.<br/><br/>Particularly regarding internal confidentiality protocols, will there be the same kinds of firewalls we expect in companies?  Will there be different staff?  Will there be clear confidentiality on what can come out of the conversation with a private investor and go into a conversation with the EU Commission and <i>vice versa</i>?  I am concerned about these two functions happening in-house and how we can have best practice.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 10 is probably slightly different, but maybe it is not different, which in itself is a concern.  The proposed new legislation provides that there may be <i>ad hoc</i>attendance at a meeting of the board of directors.  This legislation outlines the very significant power the board of directors of the ESM will have.  The Minister has indicated he is the chair of the board of directors of the ESM.  It would always be good practice to have transparency on any <i>ad hoc</i>attendees so that we know who is in the room at least.  I realise I cannot change the formal structures or standing orders of the board of directors, but this amendment seeks to encourage the Minister to advocate for publication of a list of all persons who attend meetings of the board of directors for the purposes of transparency and accountability.</p></speech>

When this treaty comes into force, a memorandum of co-operation between the ESM and the European Commission will be published.  That will be publicly available on the websites of both the ESM and the European Commission to indicate to stakeholders how the Commission and the stability mechanism will engage with each other.</p><p>Amendment No. 8 relates to the engagement the ESM will have with the European Commission or another private investment or a member.  Issues relating to the engagement between the ESM and the Commission will be dealt with by the memorandum of understanding which will be published when the treaty comes into force.  The engagement the ESM might have with a private investor will only happen when a member state that could be the subject of that kind of engagement gives its consent to the ESM dealing with investors.  Engagement between the stability mechanism and private investors about a member state will only happen when a member state gives its consent to the ESM for that kind of engagement to be initiated.  By its very nature, it will be confidential because the European Stability Mechanism will be dealing with issues that are very important to the confidence financial markets may have in a member state.  For those reasons it is very important to maintain confidentiality when it is happening, which is why I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p><p>I am not accepting amendment No. 10 because information regarding who will attend the meetings of the board of directors is already publicly available.  That is published on the website of the ESM.  Information regarding who can attend those meetings but does not have voting rights is available.  I can tell the Senator who they are.  Observers appointed by the European Commission who would be in charge of economic and monetary affairs may attend but do not have voting rights.  The president of the Eurogroup working group, the secretary general of the ESM and representatives of institutions or organisations might be there on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis, but they do not have voting rights.  A list of those institutions and countries with voting rights is already publicly available.  For those reasons, I am not in a position to accept that amendment.  In summary it is because the names of those who have voting rights are already publicly available.</p></speech>

I think only one amendment remains after this.</p><p>Exactly as the Minister has outlined, the focus of this amendment is on the <i>ad hoc</i>attendees.

That would be an improvement on the current transparency structures.  That is why my amendment specified &quot;all persons attending&quot; rather than those voting.  <br/><br/>I thank the Minister for his assurance in relation to amendment No. 7 and the publication of the MOU.  That addresses my concerns.  I suspected it might and am glad it does.<br/><br/>Regarding amendment No. 8, unfortunately the Minister did not address my key concern.  He spoke about the ESM's relationship with the European Commission and its engagement with private investors but my amendment focuses on the separation between the engagement with the European Commission and that with provide investors.  My concern is not the internal relations described in (a) and (b) but the relationship between (a) and (b).  How do we ensure that ESM engagement with a private investor in respect of a country, a process whose workings the Minister has described, does not overly influence the other engagement?</p></speech>

It is a retrospective amendment whereas most of the others look forward.  I am asking that the Minister publish in the next year a report looking at the period in question.  If we are to shape the future in terms of a new economic governance framework for the EU we need to learn from the past.  It would be beneficial if the Minister published a report examining:</p> <blockquote> 	  	 <blockquote> 	where, between 2012 and 2020, compliance with EU fiscal rules has been a factor in Government decisions to deliver public services or infrastructure &ldquo;off balance sheet&rdquo;, through newly created bodies or through contracted services rather than through direct public investment or provision, and<br /><br />... an analysis of the costs associated with such an approach, including the opportunity cost of short-term expenditure versus long-term investment. </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>We could list these, from Irish Water, which had to be done off balance sheet, creating much tension around the concern it was not being done through our public utilities directly, to the concerns in relation to leasing.  We have thrown money away on leasing, rather than buying or building, and are continuing to do so.  </p><p>I could talk at length on this but will not.  We know the economic analysis of the opportunity cost and loss.  There is a  short-terming saving and a long-term cost.  We know that from Mazzucato's writings and I know the Minister is aware of the role the entrepreneurial state can play in investing and driving the future.  We know from Piketty the issues when having capital is given predominance.  I worry that the policies and the fiscal rules we had led much of the time to the opportunity being given to the private sector and the State ending up subsidising that sector and being unable to make a wise choice.  There is Terry Pratchett's story about the boots, whereby the best value are the boots that last ten years, but all people can afford are short-term boots that need to be replaced every six months.  That is what we have had in terms of leasing.  We have lost opportunities and allowed private sector capital to seize advantages and opportunities that could have been public advantages and opportunities.  That is due to a short-term framework of targets that we have prioritised and to a prioritisation of austerity and narrow targets over long-term benefits.</p><p>Looking back at EU fiscal rules, we see how they have factored and the amount of times we have heard of things having to be off balance sheet or needing to be done in a way that defies common sense and, in many cases, has defied long-term development vision or long-term common sense.  It is so we can learn from that and it can affect how we input into the new economic governance framework and how we ensure that we as a state have space in the future to make the transformational investment we will need.</p><p>I hope the Minister will consider such a report.  He will be aware of the analysis that many bodies have done on austerity and its impacts but this is specifically in terms of giving scope to the State for long-term thinking and investment, especially at a time like now when the State can borrow at almost zero interest yet we are still asking private providers who need to build in a profit dividend and have to borrow at a higher rate than the State.  All those financing, profit and dividend costs are added into the provision of the essential needs of the State.  We can learn from the past.  I hope the Minister will support the amendment for a report on that matter.</p></speech>

Terry Pratchett, may he rest in peace, wrote about much but I missed his book on European monetary union, if he wrote one.  If he did,  I am sure it is worth a read.</p><p>On the views of Piketty and Mazzucato on the future of Europe and economic policy in relation to it, the degree to which Ireland and Europe are already responding to the issues Mariana Mazzucato has championed about the entrepreneurial state is underestimated.  The role of the European Union in co-funding and creating an environment in which we will be the leading exporter of vaccines to the world is the entrepreneurial state in action.  It is happening.  The work of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, in co-funding innovative companies and having a stake in their future and their returns is the entrepreneurial state in action.</p><p>The world of Thomas Piketty is a cold one for a small country in the European Union.  I agree with many of his views regarding the change in the composition between public and private capital, a broader assessment of his views has to acknowledge that he has a lot to say about big countries but not much to say about small ones.  </p><p>I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  The fiscal rules of the European Union as currently structured allow and facilitate investment and expenditure in the future.  They make the point that the majority of that needs to be funded from taxes that a country can raise.  That is a reasonable position for those rules to take.  It allows borrowing but if a country wants to invest in its future and its public services, much but not all of that investment should come from the taxes it raises.  That is a reasonable balance.  The debate the Senator is looking for happens all the time here and in various Oireachtas committees.  Given that debate is ongoing, I do not believe a report should be required within this legislation. </p></speech>

The idea is that the State will gather the money first but we know that not all large-scale investment firms and other funds move to gather the money first.  In many cases, they look to the future dividends.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When we as a State invest up front, it will not necessarily be about spending dividends and revenue but about creating future social and economic dividends.  Sometimes that does require upfront investment.  It is like the idea that sometimes a coat of paint is not the best solution when dealing with things like substantial dry rot or a need to make a major change.  That is why we have the financing systems.</p><p>This is my last and a vital point.  The one point on which I disagree with the Minister as far as the entrepreneurial state is concerned is in respect of the vaccines.  We cannot afford that to be an entrepreneurial or business opportunity.  The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, here in the Seanad yesterday acknowledged that we should support a TRIPS waiver.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, has acknowledged that we should support a TRIPS waiver.  I urge the Minister and his party in government to ensure we support that.  We cannot have the EU exporting the vaccine to the world because that means its member states are the only ones manufacturing it.  This is a point on which we need to move beyond the European Union perspective.  A TRIPS waiver is one of the most vital decisions we would make.</p></speech>

I know he will have a keen interest in the issue under discussion.  I thank Government colleagues and all Members for being here to discuss a really important issue that has been a scourge on many people living along the river basin from where the River Shannon rises in the Cuilcagh Mountains in County Cavan to where it flows out to the Shannon Estuary in Limerick.  This Bill seeks to remove specific water levels from legislation and to allow the ESB to set levels in conjunction with all relevant bodies, including Waterways Ireland, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the local authorities.  There are many NGOs, farming groups and conservation groups who, going forward, should be part of a forum that would have one policy with regard to control of water levels on the River Shannon.</p> <p>The Electricity Supply (Amendment) Bill 2021 is an amendment to the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1934, which gave responsibility for water levels on the River Shannon to the ESB.  This was related to Ardnacrusha and hydroelectric power, which was very important for the country.  It is rather amazing that 86 or more years on, we are only now looking to amend the 1934 Act.  The legislation needs to be updated.  As I said, I hope that through this discussion we can work out a policy that is agreeable to everybody.  In terms of climate action and the consequences of changed weather patterns, we need to act as a matter of urgency.  People living along the River Shannon basin have put up with years of misery.  I have lived along that basin for all of my lifetime.  Almost every year as we approach spring all politicians are contacted about rising water levels.  I am already getting telephone calls about this.  I was told the other day that a lot of water is being in held in Lough Allen in County Leitrim.  Business people in Carrick-on-Shannon fear they could be flooded if this water is let go.  One of the problems is that the 1934 Act ties the hands of the ESB in terms of carrying out necessary works.  I acknowledge that this work has to be done in an environmentally friendly way as well.  That can be done.</p> <p>I accept that this Bill is not a silver bullet.  We all know that we cannot prevent some flooding along the River Shannon basin, but we could provide reassurance for people such that every year they do not have to contact politicians and the ESB on the issue of rising water levels.  The pattern of rainfall now has dramatically changed.  The level of rainfall that previously fell over two days can now fall within a couple of hours.  As a consequence of that quick and dramatic rainfall, farmyards, houses, businesses and community facilities are being wrecked.  We have seen this happen all along the River Shannon and in other parts of the country.</p> <p>There is another issue that we need to address.  This point is not made strongly enough.  The amount of damage done to flora, fauna and wildlife by water that cannot take its course - flooded waters - is extraordinary.  The amount of damage to wildlife in areas such as the Shannon Callows near Athlone because of unnecessary flooding is extraordinary.  It has cost us dearly from an environmental perspective.  We should recognise that.  Like me, Senator Paul Daly has a very close relationship with everything that happens along the River Shannon.  I recall the devastation of the floods in 2009 and 2015.  People speak often about one-in-100-year events.  The floods of 2009 and 2015 were just six years apart, which shows that we are definitely in different times.  The devastation caused to the natural growth, plants, flora, fauna and wildlife was extraordinary.  That element has suffered very badly as well.  Going forward, we must ensure we reinstate and protect it.  The Minister of State will be aware of the great plan for the Shannon Callows in relation to the curlew population and bringing it back to the area.  Those types of plans are vital and important.  It is heartening to hear farmers and local communities, who are custodians of much of this culture, saying that while much of the flora and fauna has been destroyed they want to work to have it reinstated.  We also need to have our wildlife returned.  One of the greatest indicators in terms of weather forecasting is how the birds operate.  If the birds are building nests near the water the rainfall will not be great.  If they are building inland that indicates a wet autumn, winter and spring.  That has been proven.  For previous generations, watching what the birds were doing was the only way they could forecast the weather.  They did not have the modern paraphernalia to do that.  </p> <p>I again thank Senators and the Minister of State for being here.  The purpose of this Bill is to move forward with legislation that will be sound and secure and will give a little bit of breathing space to the local communities and protect our environment as well.  I am prepared to work with Departments, Ministers, agencies, the Opposition and so on to achieve this.  If we can put this in place, it will benefit all of our people in that part of the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-04a.180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110400002#BB00400"><p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State and I thank him for being here.  I compliment my colleague, Senator Eugene Murphy, on the strenuous and hard work he put into bringing this Bill to this Stage.  This is just one issue on which Senator Murphy has been to the fore on behalf of his constituents in Roscommon and further afield.  Senator Murphy mentioned the people who live, farm and work along the river basin.  I live further upstream.  When I was being taught geography in school, I learned about Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg and the three tributaries, the rivers Brosna, Inny and Suck.  I am from Kilbeggan which is not far from the River Brosna.  From an agricultural perspective, 50 flood relief schemes have been implemented since 1995.  The putting in place of a flood defence scheme is almost an admission that flooding is going to happen but that an attempt is being made to defend against it.  As Senator Murphy stated, we will never stop the flooding of the River Shannon in some form or another but we can improve the situation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2464"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2464&amp;amp;pid=PaulDaly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The Shannon, through its tributaries, is responsible for the drainage of 750,000 ha, which is 20% of Irish land.  Way upstream of even the Brosna, which is only a tributary, there will be a small stream, sheugh or a drain as we call it at home.  If the Shannon is flooding, the water is stagnant in that stream and therefore the drainage of the land is affected.  There are probably 6,000 ha that are most extremely flooded.  They are known as the Shannon callows.  It is an area of vital importance for the people who farm there.  The forage they take off that land in the months of July and August is their winter feed and if there is flooding at that time, they lose that crop and hence the winter food for their animals.</p><p>Even back upstream, if the streams, sheughs and tributaries are not flowing, the land is filling up.  Looking at a field you might not see a sheet of water on it and think it is not flooded, but the water table is so high that there is no soakage or drainage.  As the Minister of State knows, we are making every effort to eliminate the loss of nitrates and to introduce low-emissions slurry spreading.  However, if the water level is high in a field, irrespective of what technology is used to spread slurry during the permitted window, quite legally and when it is necessary to do so, there is a greater chance of some nitrates leaking into the stream and then into the Brosna and eventually into the Shannon.</p><p>This is very important, and I applaud Senator Murphy on the approach he is taking.  I agree with him that the ultimate silver bullet, as he called it, will be a single River Shannon authority.  We all admit that it is further down the line, but this Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill 2021 is a first step towards it.  The ESB is curtailed in the levels at which it can control the waters in Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg by legislation that dates back to 1934.  This is a completely different world in every respect from that of 1934, climate change aside, and climate change is the big thing that will affect anything to do with water and flooding.  The buildings, roads, concrete yards and all the development that has taken place in the catchment area of the Shannon since 1934 have changed the lie of the land, for want of a better phrase, and it is nigh on impossible to see how it could even be feasible, workable or possible for an agency to have to regulate based on an Act from so long ago.</p><p>The Bill is an important first step in getting to a stage where we will need a single River Shannon authority which would include all vested interests.  These include the farmers for the reasons I have mentioned, because of the callows and the land they farm, the local authorities in the counties the River Shannon flows through, inland fisheries, Waterways Ireland and the NGOs Senator Murphy mentioned when it comes to protection of flora, fauna, animals, fish, the environment and the landscape.  They all must have a say, but the only way they can have a constructive input and an effective outcome is if they are all sitting around one board table and have the same interest, which is the management of the Shannon.</p><p>I welcome the fact there is a river basin management plan in the programme for Government.  That is vital and I hope to see good progress on it.  As I said at the outset, flood defences defend against floods.  I believe we can control the floods in far better ways by proper management, be it silt removal or drain cleaning.  This is parochial for me, but I stress that the Shannon basin is vital and that 20% of the country is drained, directly or indirectly, by the Shannon through its tributaries and their smaller tributaries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-04a.182" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110400002#CC00200"><p>I commend Senator Murphy on the Bill and support it proceeding to Committee Stage.  Flooding is an important issue and we have discussed it on numerous occasions in this House.  It is going to become a more pressing issue as we face into the winter months and, in the longer term, more extreme weather events due to climate change.  I recognise the devastating effects of flooding on the area around the Shannon lakes, especially around Carrick-on-Shannon, Leitrim village and the upper Shannon region north of Lough Ree.  Data show there has been an increase in the pattern of flooding over the past 60 years and there is categorical evidence that the floods are getting bigger.  These floods are devastating to homes, farmlands and businesses, and are eroding the quality of life for those who live there.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies have been very proactive on this issue.  International best practice shows that tackling the issue of flooding requires a holistic, river-basin approach.  It is not good enough to focus on only one area of the river.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies brought forward a Bill to establish a single Shannon river management agency, which the Senator also agrees is essential to look after the river in its entirety.  There are currently 20 agencies, ranging from the Office of Public Works, OPW, to Waterways Ireland and local authorities, involved in water management and maintenance of the River Shannon.  This Bill would give one agency, the ESB, new powers for flood management whereas the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill would bring those powers under one body.  Community groups and local people up and down the Shannon are warmly welcoming the Bill, which seeks to place the agency on a firm statutory footing.  People have suffered long enough and are worn out with the lack of action on this issue.  They are constantly living in fear of when the next major flooding will take place.  This constant living in fear is not fair.</p> <p>When it comes to the issue of dredging, I do not agree fully with the Senator.  Communities are tired of piecemeal or half-baked measures that will only push the problem of flooding to somewhere else downstream, and they do not want measures that will destroy the biodiversity of the rivers.  There is a recognition now, certainly internationally, that hard engineering solutions such as dredging and flood walls are not the answer and actually make the problem worse, usually impacting on the community that is further downstream.  We need a mix of hard and soft engineering solutions like natural flood management.  Studies have shown that when carried out appropriately, natural water retention can slow down the flow and hold the water in the landscape for between 12 and 24 hours.</p> <p>We do not have to look too far away to see this working in action.  In 2019, I brought over an expert from the Slow the Flow programme in Britain to outline how it was working really effectively over there.  It is also creating jobs for people, non-extractive jobs that are low in emissions, and providing incomes to farming communities along the watercourses.  The expert spoke in the Leinster House audiovisual room.  We know the nature-based solutions he outlined on that occasion are effective in reducing flooding, particularly in small catchment areas.  Not only are they more effective, the cost savings are immense when you take account of the role played by nature-based solutions in reducing the occurrence of smaller, frequent floods or what are called nuisance floods in the United States.  We are familiar with the catastrophic floods that occur every few years and more frequently now, and that cause massive financial damage, but the nuisance floods that happen regularly also have a cost.  It is just not calculated in the same way because they are happening in different places and at smaller levels.</p> <p>We must listen to and work with the science and always evolve the way in which we approach flood management.  In addition, it is vital that nature-based catchment management projects are community-led.  This cannot be enforced on communities.  Communities have to be included in the process, must benefit from the process and must have ownership of the process.  This also holds true for hard landscaping measures.  I spoke this morning on the Order of Business about how bad we are at public consultation in this country.  We shy away from asking people for their opinions and from working with them to find the solutions and the compromises for rolling out a project to which there will be less resistance in the long term.  It does not get held up and delayed when people work with the communities.  BusConnects is probably a good example of working with communities and listening to what their issues are.</p> <p>I differ with some of the comments I have heard as to why this Bill is needed, but those could be teased out on Committee Stage.  That is the perfect Stage to have that discussion.  We can bring in the experts to hear about the evidence-based policy and what is working now.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are happy to allow the Bill to proceed.

I welcome the opportunity to address the House on flooding matters.  Flooding is an important issue that affects many people in Ireland.  That is increasing as time goes on.  Extreme weather events around the world in the past year have shown us all that we must act quickly to protect ourselves and our planet.  This year's extreme weather has provided a stark backdrop to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.  Flooding is just one of those extreme events.  The frequency and intensity of flooding has greatly changed, and will change into the future, as Met &Eacute;ireann can confirm.  The type and intensity of our rain and our weather have changed our flood management.  Our flood management needs to adapt as well.</p><p>Ireland is gradually becoming a wetter place with more rainfall as a result of climate change, according to the Environmental Protection Agency's 2020 climate status report.  The United Nations released a code red report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, earlier this year, which found that climate change is occurring at a faster pace than previously estimated.  The report noted that coastal areas will see continued sea level rise throughout the 21st century.  This will contribute to more frequent and severe coastal flooding in low-lying areas, as well as coastal erosion.  Extreme sea level events that previously occurred once in 100 years could happen every year by 2100.  Furthermore, the report noted that in cities, climate change impacts may be amplified including flooding from precipitation events and sea level rise in coastal cities.  </p><p>The Government is focused on doing what it can to mitigate the effects of climate change.  The recently published national development plan is underpinned by climate action objectives, including significant investment in flood relief schemes to be progressed over the lifetime of the plan from 2021 to 2030.  This is identified by flood risk management plans should protect approximately 23,000 properties in communities threatened from river and coastal flood risk.  We passed the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 in July.  This embedded the process of carbon budgeting into law.  Earlier this month, we welcomed the publication of the proposed carbon budgets from the Climate Change Advisory Council.  We will be publishing the 2021 climate action plan shortly.  Every sector of the economy will need to play its part.  There will be different targets for each sector based on their respective starting points and the relative difficulty, cost, speed and benefits of reducing emissions.</p><p>As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, outlined in the recent Seanad debate on flood risk management, the Government has a strong record in managing flood risk.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, is the lead agency for co-ordinating the delivery of flood risk management policy.  It chairs interdepartmental flood risk co-ordination group, which takes a whole-of-Government approach to the issue of flood policy.  The co-ordination group comprises representatives from eight departments, two offices and the local authority sector.  The OPW carries out this role by co-ordinating the implementation of the flood risk management policy and measures across three strategic areas.  </p><p>The first area is prevention.  This is achieved by avoiding construction in flood-prone areas.  Examples of initiatives taken in this respect include the statutory planning system and the flood risk management guidelines, which were issued by the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2009, as well as the once-off voluntary homeowners relocation scheme, which is operated by the OPW.  Local authorities are required to have regard to planning guidelines which set out a rigorous approach to flood risk assessment when considering the development of plans and assessing planning applications.  The OPW has continued to review forward-planning documents to help to ensure the 2009 guidelines are implemented and to promote sustainable development.  These documents have included the regional, spatial and economic strategies, as well as development and local area plans.  </p><p>The second area is protection.  This is brought about by taking feasible measures to protect areas against flooding, including the implementation of major flood relief schemes.  In addition, the OPW&rsquo;s minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme provides 90% of funding to local authorities to address local flooding issues, to a cost of &euro;750,000.  Since the establishment of the scheme in 2009 and up to the end of 2020, in excess of &euro;55 million has been approved for more than 828 projects across all local authorities.  Completed schemes to the end of 2020 are providing protection to in excess of 7,325 properties, which makes a massive difference in local communities, as Senators will be aware.  The OPW's arterial drainage maintenance programme of 11,500 km of channels and 800 km of embankments protects 77 towns and villages and 242,000 ha of agricultural land.  </p><p>The third and last area is preparedness.  We have been planning and responding to reduce the impacts of flood events, including through the establishment of the National Flood Forecasting and Warning Service, NFFWS, and the national emergency framework for major emergency management, and to develop national and community resilience.  Historically, flood risk management focused on arterial drainage for the benefit of agricultural improvement.  Arising from increasing flood risk in urban areas, the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 was amended in 1995 to permit the OPW to implement flood relief schemes to provide flood protection for cities, towns and villages.  The OPW&rsquo;s major flood relief schemes are typically designed and built to a standard that protects areas against the one-in-100-year flood event, and coastal areas against the one-in-200-year flood event, where it is feasible to do so.  These are significant flood events that can cause significant impacts and are often called &ldquo;once in a lifetime floods&rdquo;.  In reality, the term &quot;one in 100 years&quot; that means that there is a 1% chance of them occurring in any single year.  </p><p>To establish which communities are at risk from these significant flood events, the OPW in 2018 completed the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken by the State.  The OPW&rsquo;s catchment flood risk assessment management, CFRAM, programme was undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW, working in partnership with local authorities.  The CFRAM programme studied 80% of Ireland's primary flood risk and identified solutions that can protect over 95% of that risk.  CFRAM is a whole-of-river solution.  The programme takes in all of the catchment area, and not only areas around the mouths of rivers.  The OPW, together with its partners in local authorities, conducts a flood risk study on the entire catchment area, from the gestation to the completion of the programme.  The national CFRAM study followed best international practice.  It was the largest study ever undertaken of our risk from significant flood events, including potential impacts of climate change.  These solutions are set out in a series of 29 flood risk management plans.  They were launched in May 2018 and they are available on <i>floodinfo.ie.  </i>They include some 150 additional flood relief schemes.  The Government has committed &euro;1.3 billion to the delivery of these flood relief schemes over the lifetime of the national development plan to 2030, to protect approximately 23,000 properties in threatened communities from river and coastal flood risk. </p><p>Since 2018, as part of a phased approach to scheme delivery, this funding has allowed the OPW to treble to over 90 the number of schemes at design and construction at this time.  Completed schemes by the OPW are providing protection to over 10,000 properties.  The economic benefit to the State in damage and losses avoided is estimated to be in the region of &euro;1.8 billion.  Today, work by the OPW is complete or under way to deliver protection to 80% of properties to be protected by this significant investment programme.  On the issue of flood risk management and the impact of climate change, the OPW prepared a climate change sectoral adaptation plan for flood risk management for the period 2019 to 2024, in line with the requirements of the national adaptation framework and the climate action plan 2019.  The plan was approved by the Government in October 2019.  The sectoral adaptation plan sets out a long-term goal for adaptation and flood risk management to promote sustainable communities and support our environment through the effective management of the potential impacts of climate change on flooding and flood risk.  It includes a range of actions to meet the objectives of enhancing our knowledge and understanding the potential impacts of climate change for flooding and flood risk management.  It does this through ongoing research and assessment with partners, adapting our flood risk management practice to effectively manage the potential impacts of climate change on future flood risk, and aligning adaptation with regards to flood risk across sectors and wider Government policy including planning and development.  Key actions in the plan focus on the ongoing assessment of the risks from climate change, the inclusion of adaptation in flood relief schemes and the consideration of potential future flood scenarios in planning and development management.  Good progress is being made on implementing some of the actions set out in the plan.  For example, maps of future flood extents under climate change scenarios have been published through the web portal <i>floodinfo.ie. </i></p><p>The OPW is providing funds to the Eastern and Midland Climate Action Regional Office for research to further improve our understanding of the potential impacts of changing rainfall patterns.  Assessments have begun into the adaptability of flood relief schemes, those currently under design and those already completed, which is important as some of these must change.  The design brief for future schemes includes a requirement to consider and plan for adaptation needs.  There is also work towards the establishment of the NFFWS, through Met &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>Turning to the motion raised by the Senator, I note that whereas OPW has no powers to instruct the ESB on its works on the River Shannon, the ESB has been consulted and is content to abide by the proposed legislative amendments, should they be adopted.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Whereas the OPW has no powers to instruct the ESB on its work on the River Shannon, the ESB has been consulted and is content to abide by the proposed legislative amendments, should they be adopted.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the Bill does not change the purpose of the 1934 Act, which focuses on electricity generation.  The removal of the water level limits from the 1934 Act neither increases the ESB's powers nor provides additional flexibility in how the Shannon operations are managed.  The levels referred to in the 1934 Act do not constitute mandatory operational levels.  The new wording that purports to give the ESB power to create new channels and deepen existing channels will not obviate the ESB's obligation to obtain planning permission or obey both national and EU legislation on the environment.  Given the Bill does not change the purpose of the 1934 Act, which was for electricity generation, any works envisaged by this amending Bill would equally need to be for the purpose of electricity generation.  Restrictions in water flow in the River Shannon are primarily as a result of the river's topography and not legislation.  The Shannon flood risk management plan published by the Office of Public Works in 2016 is the correct vehicle for managing flood risk on the river.<br/><br/>The River Shannon is very flat from the headwaters at Lough Allen to the Parteen Basin upstream of Limerick.  There are three large lakes, namely, Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg, as well as many smaller lakes along the main channels of the river.  The main controls in the river are at Ardnacrusha, Parteen Weir, Athlone and Lough Allen.  The controls at the lower end of Lough Derg, Ardnacrusha and Parteen Weir are very effective at up to a ten-year flood.  For larger events there is significant flooding in the old course of the River Shannon and it is not possible to regulate levels due to insufficient capacity downstream.<br/><br/>The controls at Athlone are not effective for managing floods and they control the level of Lough Ree during the summer.  When the river is in flood, the level in Lough Ree is essentially the same as the level downstream and there is no possibility of managing floods.  There is some storage in Lough Allen but this is not usable for around half the time the river is in flood, again because it is not feasible to discharge to the channel downstream.  As a result, this storage cannot be relied upon as part of any flood risk management solution.<br/><br/>The river tends to flood quite frequently because the only way for the river to discharge excess water is by building up levels so water can be pushed out on the lower end.  For example, on the longest reach, from Meelick to Athlone, the level of the river downstream of the weir at Athlone is often 1.5 m higher than the level at the upstream side of Meelick Weir, even when the river is not yet in flood.  The river is level over this reach during periods of low flow.  A flood lasting a few days on one of the major tributaries, especially the River Suck, can lead to a flood lasting several weeks on the main river.  The capacity of the lakes and the flood plain is small relative to the overall volume of water that flows down the river so the flood plains and lakes fill quickly, often two or three days from the onset of a flood.  It can take several weeks of dry weather for the river and lakes to return to normal levels in spring.<br/><br/>Detailed modelling was carried out as part of the Shannon catchment base flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study, and this was extensively reported on in the hydraulics report, preliminary options report and flood risk management plan for the River Shannon, all of which are available at <i>floodinfo.ie</i>.  This work concluded the operation of the controls at Ardnacrusha, Parteen Weir, Athlone and Lough Allen has been extensively modelled and studied as part of the Shannon CFRAM study and no realistic operational options to mitigate floods were identified.<br/><br/>I draw Members' attention to the water framework directive, which places an obligation on Ireland to protect water status from deterioration and bring all water to at least &quot;good&quot; status or good ecological potential by 2027 at the very latest.  Any policy or legislative measures taken must comply with and be coherent with the implementation of both the water framework directive and the floods directive.<br/><br/>Ireland is currently in the latter stages of preparing the next river basin management plan for Ireland.  The plan is required under the water framework directive for the period 2022 to 2027.  In September 2021, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, published the draft river basin management plan for Ireland for 2022 to 2027 for public consultation.  Achieving good water quality in our rivers, lakes, estuaries and seas is essential for protecting Ireland's drinking water sources, environment and people's quality of life.  Investing in nature can bring multiple benefits with nature-based catchment management solutions improving water quality, reducing flood risk and creating habitats.  In carrying out these functions, these measures can also provide multiple co-benefits, such as climate regulation, climate change adaptation, improved soil management and the creation of amenities.<br/><br/>Due to their multifunctional nature, the successful implementation of nature-based solutions requires multi-agency co-operation and engagement to fully realise their potential benefits.  However, we must carefully manage the proposed legislation to avoid any unintended impacts on the water framework directive.<br/><br/>One specific challenge is the proposed Bill would allow other works without the required assessments, leaving project-specific assessment aspects to be incorporated, including perhaps an overall strategic environmental assessment and screening for appropriate assessment under the habitats directive.  The Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled the environmental objectives of the water framework directive are legally binding on member states and we will need to tread carefully to avoid compromising objectives of that directive.<br/><br/>The challenges we are facing are multifaceted and it appears there are very few easy solutions.  I commend the proposed legislation as a potential additional tool in our collective armoury as we look for possible means of mitigating flood risk.  We must continue our whole-of-government approach to flood policy and ensure we work collectively to minimise the risk of flooding and flood damage through prevention, protection and preparedness.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-04a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110400002#EE00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and this Bill from Senator Murphy.  As a neighbour across the Shannon, I see first-hand the devastation the Shannon has done in the past along areas of both the Shannon and Lough Ree.  In particular I think of areas of Clondra, Killashee, Newtowncashel and Lanesborough within County Longford and Tarmonbarry in Roscommon.  They have been severely affected by the Shannon.  In my constituency in the recent past a significant number of houses in estates in Athlone were flooded, with severe damage done.</p> <p>I was recently in Athlone with the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, where works are being undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  The former Minister of State, Mr. Kevin Boxer Moran, would have been involved with securing funding to do works there and safeguard a significant number of houses there.  I know in the national development plan there is an allocation in the region of &euro;1 billion for flood defence measures.  It is something the Government is taking seriously and it is prepared to put the funding into it.</p> <p>Part of this Bill relates to the dredging of new channels and deepening existing channels.  This might cause issues.  I do not see a problem as it must be done.  There are parts of the Shannon at pinch points where the river is narrowed to half its size.  If we do nothing and there is flooding, we will damage flora and fauna on the land anyway, which must be taken into account.</p> <p>I agree with the proposal from Senators Murphy and Paul Daly for one authority to look after this issue.  There is a working group comprising a number of authorities.  I will relate a specific case from approximately 18 months ago.  Waterways Ireland opened the gates at Meelick to reduce rising waters and the ESB decided to open two additional sluice gates at Athlone, bringing to six gates in total being opened at Athlone.  All six gates were left open for the next five days until the lands at farms north of Meelick were flooded.  For five days there was no co-ordination between the ESB in Athlone and Waterways Ireland in Meelick and, in between, the people on the Shannon callows were flooded.  It is a fundamental problem and a lack of co-ordination led to that flooding.  We must give the full legal responsibility for co-ordinating all operations to one body, which should be the Office of Public Works.  It is a Government body and it could alleviate summer flooding and reduce the scale of winter flooding along the Shannon and its tributaries.  We have been calling for that for a long time and it is incumbent on us to ensure this happens.</p> <p>Maintenance or even large-scale works will not completely prevent flooding but could delay it and ensure land is not flooded.  People will be able to keep their animals out for longer.  It would also ensure housing is not flooded.  Any legislation improving that position should be supported and I wanted to be here today to support Senator Murphy's Bill.</p></speech>

I accept that.  Listening to the Minister of State and Senator Paul Daly, it is extraordinary the amount of money that has been invested in flood relief from 1995 right up to now.  There is a serious commitment from the Government to continue that, and that must be acknowledged.  One shudders to think, if we had not done that work, the consequences we would have had in this country in recent years.<br/><br/>I thank Senator Boylan, who spoke first, for a very valuable contribution.  I will have no difficulty working with her on this issue.  She is right that sometimes we get public consultation wrong.  I fully agree with her.  I very much endorse what she said about the way we do public consultation.  It is really important that people get into back gardens and say: </p><blockquote>	Look.  This is what we mean.  It might not be as it is coming out in Meath or wherever.  We will explain it to you this way. </blockquote><p>I know that some of Senator Boylan's fellow Sinn F&eacute;in Oireachtas Members have been involved with a Bill.  We commenced this work in 2016 and 2017, when I was a Deputy.  Unfortunately, when the Government fell, the Bill fell.  That is why we are back where we are today.<br/><br/>I also thank Senator Carrigy for his very valid contribution and his colleagues for their support.  I repeat that this is work everybody should do together.  If we have to make some amendments or changes, we should do that.<br/><br/>To clarify, one of the problems we need to understand with dredging is that, down through the years, the silt and peat have taken away valuable space in the river.  That is the reality.  We need to take that away.  Now that the Bord na M&oacute;na areas are not really operational, we need to look at taking that peat and silt away because that will automatically generate extra space.  I have not got the figures yet, but I know a huge amount of peat and silt has built up in the river around Lanesborough and places like that.  Senator Carrigy will be aware of that.  It has been shocking there for years.<br/><br/>The other point we need to bring on board is the extraordinary damage that has been done to our flora, fauna, wildlife and birdlife.  They have been decimated along the River Shannon and we need in our new plan, if we get it through, to be able to take that on board, to protect all that again and to bring it back in many respects.  Floodwaters do serious damage in that regard.<br/><br/>I will not labour proceedings any more.  I thank all the Members for being here to discuss this Bill.  I really appreciate the fact that we are now able to move the Bill on and I look forward to discussing it with them all.  Thank you, Chair, for your forbearance, and I thank the staff, as usual, for their help.</p></speech>
