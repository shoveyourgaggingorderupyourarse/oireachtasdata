My request to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is that she lead a new scheme to provide gymnasiums for existing schools which do not have them and that it be a cross-departmental scheme involving Departments such as the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Health and Transport, Tourism and Sport which all have a stake in children's lives in terms of their health and well-being.  This is not existing policy, but it would be a very smart policy.  I have experience of this in Galway.  I refer to three schools in Galway city, Salerno secondary school in Salthill and the Mercy and Presentation secondary schools which it is proposed to amalgamate.  Salerno secondary school has no gym, but it has raised money to contribute to the cost of one.  It is begging for a new proposal from the Minister to help it to provide a gym for the 600 girls in the school.  A couple of weeks ago I tabled a Commencement Matter which was taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, about the proposed amalgamation of the Mercy and the Presentation secondary schools.  The site chosen by CEIST is the site of the Presentation secondary school which has no gym.  However, the school which will be vacated does have one.  When I asked the Minister of State whether there would be a new gym following the amalgamation, his answer was that the schools could use the proceeds of the sale of the Mercy secondary school site to fund one.</p>  <p>I need not tell the Minister of State about the evidence in favour of physical education and physical exercise.  We know that we are facing a time bomb when it comes to obesity.  Long before this time bomb emerged, there was much evidence showing that girls' interest in physical exercise decreased at second level unless it was made more interesting and appropriate to their needs.  For the Government not to invest in the health and well-being of young girls is appalling and a missed opportunity.  We are only storing up problems for the future.  We must instil good lifestyle habits early.  There is strong evidence in favour of this approach which I will not go into now.</p>  <p>The second issue is equity.  I understand the pressing need for new accommodation and accept that all new schools have a gym, which is phenomenal.  However, where is the equity for existing schools?  The parents of children attending Salerno second school pay their taxes, as do the parents of children attending the Mercy and Presentation secondary schools.  On that basis they should receive equity with equal access to facilities.  I, therefore, request that the Minister for Education and Skills lead a scheme involving the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs and Transport, Tourism and Sport and perhaps the Department of Justice and Equality.  It should not be impossible to do this; it is not mind-blowing.  We need a new policy in order that the children concerned can have equity.  I understand that in terms of the finances the community must give a figure of 20% or 40%, but the principle that existing schools which do not have a gym will not have one provided is fundamentally wrong.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising it, as it provides me with an opportunity to clarify the current position on the provision of physical education facilities in post-primary schools.</p>  <p>The Department of Education and Skills fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve physical education facilities for all pupils attending schools within the constraints of the available funding.  I also advise the Senator that the physical education curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary.  For example, many primary schools have a general purpose room, while almost all schools have outdoor play areas which are used to teach different aspects of the physical education programme.  There is a similar situation at second level in the case of sports halls and outdoor facilities.  In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.  The provision of play space where site conditions and circumstances allow is one of the issues considered in the architectural design of new schools and major extensions.  The Department's design guidelines for schools include guidance on the provision of physical education halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts.</p>  <p>The Senator will appreciate that in assessing applications from schools for funding for physical education hall facilities the Department needs to balance such requests in priority terms against the critical need to provide essential classroom accommodation, particularly in areas of demographic growth.  In view of the constraints on available funding imposed by the need to provide such accommodation, the Department is not in a position at this time to consider an initiative as proposed by the Senator.</p> <p>However, I wish to advise her that the number of schools with general purpose rooms and physical education halls is increasing all the time, while practically all schools have outside exercise space such as basketball and tennis courts and playing fields.  In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</p> <p>The facilities that schools have on site are just part of the picture because they may also have access to excellent local sports facilities, which have been greatly expanded and improved through funding from the Government's sports capital programme in recent years.  In that regard, the Department has liaised with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on school applications for sporting facilities and with local authorities on shared school and community facilities where this is possible to achieve.  The value of a cross-departmental approach in enhancing the contribution made by physical exercise in the promotion of healthy lifestyles has long been recognised by the Department.</p> <p>In that regard, the Department is currently finalising guidance about measures to promote healthy lifestyles in consultation with the Department of Health and the HSE.  This guidance will encompass measures to promote healthy eating, healthy vending and the promotion of physical education and physical activity.  This guidance will be targeted in the first instance at post-primary schools and similar guidance will issue subsequently to primary schools.  The Department is also participating in the cross-departmental group that is responsible for developing the national physical activity plan.  This group, which is co-chaired by the Department of Health and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is currently finalising a national plan containing a range of measures to promote physical activity across society, including in the education sector.</p> <p>In view of the current interdepartmental co-operation on the development of healthy lifestyles, including physical education, the Minister does not propose to progress an interdepartmental scheme as proposed by the Senator.  I thank her for allowing me the opportunity to clarify the current position in relation to physical education facilities in post-primary schools.</p> <p>The Senator made a point on young women in secondary school which hit home for me given on my own experience in this area.  I served on VECs and education and training boards for more than ten years.  During that period I read numerous reports which outlined stark decreases in participation rates among this cohort, even where excellent facilities were available.  The decrease was most noticeable after first year in secondary school but the numbers dropped constantly despite efforts to promote physical activities.  While programmes worked for a short period, the fall off would subsequently recur.  We tend to focus on young men and women who are very interested in sports or have individual qualities that allow their skills to be developed but the problems often arise in the group that does not join anything.  This issue requires further investigation by the Departments of Health and Education and Science.  I will relay the Senator's comments to the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, when I speak to her this afternoon or early tomorrow.</p></speech>

However, his official reply is very disappointing.  He indicated that a cross-departmental approach is being taken in the discussions.  I want the Minister for Education and Skills or the Minister for Transport, Sport and Tourism to offer leadership in developing the appropriate infrastructure.  That may involve local negotiations with a view to schools sharing facilities.  We cannot leave 1,000 or more girls in Galway city without a gym.  The solution should involve consulting girls at second level to find out what they are interested in doing because if the right space and environment is not available to them, they will probably not participate at all.  I hope the Minister of State will relay my comments to the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, although many Ministers make that commitment but do not do so.</p></speech>

As a public representative, I have long been concerned about excellent facilities being locked up during school holidays or weekends.  We have to examine the resources available to us.  A community audit would be worthwhile in this regard to identify the facilities available and ensure their use is maximised.  We are operating under financial constraints and we have to utilise whatever facilities are available rather than see them closed at weekends or at 4 p.m. every day.  There is a need for basic co-operation but this can be achieved quite quickly by true leadership in local communities.</p></speech>

From media reports I understand she indicated a current compliance rate of 80%.  This figure has been disputed by the newly elected Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice, who has represented the turf cutters for a number of years.  He pointed out that only 1,500 out of 9,000 turf cutters were in compliance.  He said that while his group was prepared to sit down with the Minister, if the Government continued to drive the issue he would continue to oppose it.  This raises fundamental questions over Ireland's position on the EU habitats directive.  It comes in the wake of an incident mentioned by our colleague, the Seanad Government Whip, who referred to the death of a hen harrier in Kerry, which, I now understand from media reports, may have been shot accidentally rather than deliberately, which may be of some comfort.  As a result of that incident, it has been reported that 6% of the land of Ireland is reserved for the protection of wild bird species, raptors, as they are called.  This is having a detrimental effect on the valuations of farms, particularly in half a dozen counties.  Some farmers and farming organisations have referred to this running to several hundred million euro.  I ask for the Ministe to come before the House to outline what has been going on in the area of the EU habitats directive and Ireland's role in it.  It has been pointed out that we are liable for fines of up to &euro;12 million a year, yet Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice has pointed out that Ireland has not paid one cent in fines so far.  The habitats directive has caused enormous problems in the agriculture sector for a large number of years.  I believe it is time to have a debate on the matter.  The Minister could air her views on the habitats directive, specifically as it affects the turf-cutting issue, which will not go away.  I, therefore, call on her to come before the House to discuss this urgent matter without delay.</p></speech>

In the interests of safety and sanity, I appeal to An Taisce to withdraw its judicial review opposing the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is the final arbiter.  Of course, it is entitled to a judicial review if a judge grants it.  I think we accept that An Bord Plean&aacute;la weighs up these matters properly, taking into account its inspectors' reports, and decides accordingly.  It should pay more attention to them, as well as all local views.  This is not a new road.</p> <p>It has been widened in the interests of safety.  There were major accidents on it and there are incidents annually that we would like to see eliminated.  I appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which is aware of the concerns of local people, as I am, about the matter which is of the utmost importance.  The money is in place to do the work.  Safety should be paramount, as we should all recognise.</p></speech>

The matters surrounding the issue raise questions that must be addressed in a modern democracy.  Article 30 of the Constitution states:<blockquote><br /><br />1 There shall be an Attorney General who shall be the adviser of the Government in matters of law and legal opinion, and shall exercise and perform all such powers, functions and duties as are conferred or imposed on him by this Constitution or by law.<br /><br />2 The Attorney General shall be appointed by the President on the nomination of the Taoiseach ...<br /><br />4 The Attorney General shall not be a member of the Government.</blockquote>In recent years the Government has frequently advised the Oireachtas and the public that, on the advice of the Attorney General, it had no choice but to enact or oppose an item of legislation.  The question arises as to why such weight is attached to the advice of one man or woman.  Why is one barrister's advice held in such high esteem?  Is the Law Library not full of contradictory voices and opinions?  The Attorney General who is referred to as the chief law officer of the State cannot have his or her advice followed slavishly and without question.  Appointment as Attorney General does not bestow infallible wisdom on the holder of the office for, if it did, it would make the Taoiseach infallible in the selection of the officeholder.</p></speech>

The Attorney General sometimes gets it wrong and when that happens, the State must carry the cost of erroneous advice.  Court actions to rectify where the law is wrong frequently end up in the Supreme Court.  This is a very costly place to have to go and the public carries the cost.  Is the legal advice the Government receives always correct?  According to the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, it is not.  An article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>on Saturday, 10 November 2012 by Paul O'Brien, political editor, headlined, &quot;Varadkar: Referendum legal advice was wrong&quot;, states, &quot;The legal advice 'was wrong' Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said yesterday of the process that led to the Government misusing public money on its referendum website and booklet&quot;.</p></speech>

It certainly is allowable to speak in this Chamber about the Office of the Attorney General or any public office.  The idea that the Attorney General's advice is sometimes wrong is uncontestable.  It is challenged at Supreme Court level and sometimes found that it is not what it is.  However, when the Attorney General expresses the opinion that the actions of the Government are unconstitutional, Article 15 of the Constitution kicks in and requires the Government not to enact or attempt to enact legislation thought to be unconstitutional.  It is as clear as day and there can be no argument about this, as Article 15 makes clear.</p></speech>

As part of a &euro;150 million property investment, an advance manufacturing facility will be provided in Galway next year.

In the past year or so, I have had the opportunity to visit Greece, Portugal and Spain and I have met people affected by the crisis at first hand.  I met the women cleaners who were on strike outside the Ministry of Finance in Greece because of their situation.  I met staff from the national broadcaster that was shut down in Greece because of the impact of the cutbacks and I have met people in Spain and Portugal in similar situations.  The ordinary people in those countries are suffering badly and the fact our Government and Minister of Finance will not even enter into debate about how debt could be restructured across Europe is an absolute disgrace.</p>  <p>The Labour Party, in particular, as a party that stands for trade union rights etc., should stand up and say we need to have this debate.  I believe the Seanad would be the ideal arena for us to look at the proposals that are being put forward by the progressive government in Greece.  The least we could do, in solidarity with comrades across Europe, is to look at and debate the proposals to see if there is merit in them.  If we come to the same conclusion as the Minister for Finance, so be it, but at least let us have a debate on them.  The fact debate is being shut down and that our Government is going out to Europe and signalling the door is shut, without having had a debate, is a disgrace.  We need to ensure this does not happen.  I call for a debate on this issue in the Seanad.  We have expertise in this House and have open debate on issues such as this.  This is the least we can do for and on behalf of our comrades across Europe.</p></speech>

This is great news and the proposals are important for the west, including counties Sligo and Leitrim.  A fund of &euro;50 million will be drawn down in 2015 to promote jobs in these areas.  We have significant job creation in the eastern part of the country, but critics would say there has not been enough investment west of the Shannon.  This investment west of the Shannon is a real opportunity.  Some 612 jobs have been created in Sligo in the past couple of years and 352 in County Leitrim.  We can now look forward to adding to that figure.  The people with the lead responsibility in this area will be the local authorities and communities and Enterprise Ireland.  If people have ideas, they will have the opportunity to put them on paper and talk to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and to move forward with them.  This is good news.</p>  <p>It is welcome that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, is in the United States signing deals for beef exports.  The good news is the US market will take approximately 1 billion tonnes of Irish beef in the next period.  Any of us who have been out and about in cattle marts recently know that coming on the back of a difficult 2014, this expected buoyant trade is good for farmers.  This has come about because of the good deals that have been signed in the agri sector. </p></speech>

I hope we can have this debate as soon possible.</p>  <p>Last Friday, I attended the official opening by the Taoiseach of the Cavan-Monaghan education and training board multi-complex in the former Army barracks site in Monaghan town.  This complex houses Gaelscoil Ultain, Col&aacute;iste Oiriall, the Monaghan Institute and the Garage Theatre.  It is a state of the art complex and I pay tribute to everybody involved in getting the complex to its completed state, fully occupied and officially opened by the Taoiseach last Friday.  I compliment everybody involved, including the chief executive of Cavan-Monaghan education and training board, Martin O'Brien and the committee members of the former County Monaghan VEC whose brainchild this was.  They were ably assisted in the project by a former colleague in the D&aacute;il, Margaret Conlon.  I also thank former Ministers, Batt O'Keeffe, Mary Coughlan and Ruair&iacute; Quinn for the input they had in ensuring this complex came into existence.  Will the Deputy Leader please invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House in order that we can ask her what plans, if any, she has for the former D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Army barracks in Cavan town which are now in the ownership of the said Cavan-Monaghan education and training board?  This barracks was the only purpose built Army barracks in the history of the State.  It is a state-of-the-art building, but it was closed over two years ago by the Government.  It has been in the ownership of the board mentioned for over two years and is sitting idle.  It costs more to maintain it closed than it cost to keep it going when fully occupied by members of the Defence Forces.  It is a matter of urgency to ascertain from the Department and the Minister what plans, if any, they have for that site. </p></speech>

Some &euro;150 million of these moneys will go towards building nine manufacturing facilities, strategically located throughout the country, one of which will be in County Galway.  I will make a strong case for the Galway location to be in the east of the county, in Ballinasloe, where 1,000 industrial jobs have been lost over the past decade.  I also welcome the fact that &euro;100 million will be made available to Enterprise Ireland to invest in local projects with good prospects of creating significant jobs in the next few years.  It is gratifying to see a Tuam-based company, Steeltech Garden Sheds, announce a significant expansion this morning that will create 100 new jobs in Tuam.  We must take advantage of every possible opportunity and it is welcome that the regional action plans for jobs will be completed and published by July.  The plan for the midlands is due to be published in the next couple of weeks and the plans for the other regions will be rolled out in July.  We support these plans.</p>  <p>Tourism is strongly linked with our economic recovery and I welcome the significant announcement made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, this morning that this year a number of iconic buildings will be part of global greening for St. Patrick's Day such as the Colosseum in Rome, the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville and the Sacr&eacute; Coeur basilica in Paris.</p> <p>This will add to the very significant number of buildings throughout the world that will help us by recognising St. Patrick's Day.  We must build on the wonderful work being done by Tourism Ireland promoting tourism throughout the world.  In 2014, there was a very significant 14% increase in visitor numbers to the country.  On St. Patrick's Day, we get a window of opportunity that no other country in the world gets and we must take advantage of it and build on it.  I hope our Ministers will travel throughout the world promoting Ireland this St. Patrick's Day because our tourism industry depends on it.</p></speech>

We could renew some of our Christian values which St. Patrick bequeathed to us.  There is a need for it in society across Europe and Ireland.</p>  <p>Will the Deputy Leader invite the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, here to debate the issue of crimes such as burglaries and theft, which go under the radar and receive very little focus and publicity, yet which are very insidious and damaging to people's lives?  I have already mentioned here a lady in her 90s who was living alone and was burgled.  The experience ruined the rest of her life because she no longer had the confidence to live alone.  This crime is endemic across the country and in my area, south west Wexford, there has been a spate of robberies.  Most of them go undetected and unresolved and nobody is brought to justice for them.  One of the most significant problems is that the perpetrators go on to become involved in much more serious crime.  There is no such thing as a victimless crime.  I would like a debate here on this because there has been no statement from the Minister or any Government politician on it.  The Garda must put more emphasis on it in order that the detection of such crimes is brought up to the standards of best practice internationally.  Very few of these crimes are solved.  Often, garda&iacute; know who the perpetrators are but cannot meet the evidential barrier.</p>  <p>I would like a debate on the Constitution.  Recently there have been debates here and in the Lower House about abortion in situations in which unborn children are diagnosed as being terminally ill or having a disability that means they will not survive.  We must be careful because in the neighbouring island, where this is allowed, unborn babies who are diagnosed in the womb with a cleft palate or a club foot have been aborted as a result.  It is used as an excuse to introduce abortion on demand.  The Constitution has been a great protection for Irish people over the years and rather than dismissing it and its provisions, we should welcome its protection.  Ultimately, the people will decide all these issues.</p></speech>

The EU directive requires that by 2020, 16% of our energy must come from renewable sources.  Only 7.1% of our energy comes from renewables.  Today, Apple has invested $700 billion in solar energy and will create a plant in San Francisco, which will do good for the world and climate change.  I congratulate Dublin City Council which also announced today that it will install solar panels on four of its libraries and the Civic Offices, which will save the council &euro;21,000.  I seek a renewed debate on renewable energy.  Of our renewable energy, 46% comes from wind and 43% from biomass with only a small proportion coming from solar.  People might say I am mad thinking about solar energy.  I am not.  There are new types of panels.  The biggest solar power facility in the world is in Leipzig, Germany and a new report has found that Dublin would benefit in the same way as Germany from solar energy, not just from sun but from daylight.  I seek renewed debate and action to ensure we provide more of our energy using renewable sources and discuss how we will do it.  We are approaching 2020.  It will be upon us before we know it.  We are in the throes of discussing climate change and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill.  We had a good debate here before.  I compliment Jody Corcoran, who had an article on wind energy in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  He wrote that he was walking beside wind turbines and they were like a lady's skirt blowing in the wind.</p></speech>

Edgar Allen Poe wrote a short story entitled <i>The Fall of the House of Usher</i>, and one could align it to the fall of the house of banking in 2008 in which we, the Irish people, had to pay back &euro;65 billion of private debts, creating an enormous albatross.  At the same time, the Bank of Ireland is telling its customers they will have to pay more to withdraw cash, pay in cash and use cheques.  The same practices are happening in an individual, insidious way as in 2008.<br/><br/>There is an excellent banking inquiry under way with people coming from all over the world to tell us about our own-goals, Kalashnikovs to the kidneys and what we did and did not do.  Every day, something new is coming from the banks to ostracise people.  Human beings are no longer needed or spoken to in banks.  Only if people play the banks' games their way, the automatic, technological way, will the banks answer them.  While it is all right for small businesses, most Irish people deal with the banks individually with their cash.  I would like the Minister to come here and tell us what smacht, to use the Irish word for order, is being put on Irish banks, especially Bank of Ireland, to prevent them from carrying on and doing what they like to the Irish people while we are still saving them and keeping them open because they have not got a penny to their names, except what the Canadians gave them.</p></speech>

Many have argued that the economic recovery is a Dublin-only phenomenon and across the world's economies it has been shown that economic recovery must take place in capital cities before the effect is felt outside urban areas.</p> <p>This new strategy is geared towards dealing with growth outside Dublin.  The plan will see &euro;250 million spent over five years, with &euro;150 million going to IDA Ireland to develop infrastructure to attract companies to the regions, outside the urban centres.  This strategy is crucial in helping to revitalise regions which have lagged behind in the recovery, while stemming the flow of emigration of young people from regional and rural areas.  It is easy to forget that when the Government took office we were haemorrhaging jobs on a weekly basis.  We made a commitment to create 100,000 new jobs by 2016 and now look on course to exceed that target.  This latest strategy is a vital stepping stone towards the target of full employment by 2018.</p></speech>

The scheme he set up was minimal but very worthy.  Recently I asked him to consider extending that and doing it again but I received a reply in recent days to the effect that he has no intention of doing so.  In his reply he states,  "I have no plans to extend pre-retirement access to pension savings beyond what is provided for in relation to AVCs".  I wish to express my disappointment with this, particularly with the announcement this week that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain has introduced a scheme under which 1 million people over 65 will enjoy better incomes.  One pensioner in ten will be up to &pound;600 better off under the multi-billion pound bonds windfall announced by the Chancellor on Monday.  I mention this because being able to access their AVCs enables people to spend money which in turn helps the economy, as well as relieving them of financial worries.  It gives people the opportunity to help the economy.  Yesterday Senator Darragh O'Brien made the case for having a debate on pensions and I agree that we should have such a debate soon.  If we do so, we will be able to cover a much wider area than would be possible otherwise.</p></speech>

Once again, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda is in the news.  I was absolutely shocked to hear Mr. Tony Fitzpatrick of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, on radio this morning referring to the fact that well over 60 people were lying on trolleys there.  This simply cannot be allowed to continue. Some of those people have been waiting four or five days to be seen and admitted.  Last night there were up to 40 patients on trolleys in the accident and emergency department, ten on trolleys in already-full wards and 13 in the medical assessment unit, MAU.  Ironically, the MAU was set up two years ago to help to alleviate this very problem.   I was astonished to hear that many of the patients were elderly, some of them over 75.  Mr. Fitzpatrick confirmed that if beds were provided, such patients would take up two full wards.  It is vital that the Minister come to the House to discuss this.</p>  <p>The second issue is the audit that was carried out over two years on the number of undetected breech births in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  The biggest disappointment in this regard is the fact that the audit was patient-led.  It was only when the patients complained that something was actually done.  Unfortunately, there were 221 breech births at the hospital and one baby lost its life.  A further source of disappointment is the fact that of the 21 late-diagnosis breech births, 13 were in the clinical-led unit, while eight were in the midwifery-led unit.  These figures are disproportionate in the context of what is acceptable by European standards.  I ask that the Minister for Health would come to the House to discuss these issues.</p></speech>

We should hear from the Minister for Health on this issue because between 2005 and 2009, the HSE spent approximately &euro;10 million per year on spin doctors and PR firms.  I have been unable to get the up to date figures and undoubtedly the annual spend has fallen somewhat.  Nevertheless, the question remains as to why the HSE has been engaging the services of PR firms at all.  Why is a public body, established under the Health Act 2004, investing in a press operation?  Senators will have heard the phrase about having a dog and barking oneself, which is relevant here.  Why is it that the HSE has people in receipt of publicly-funded salaries doing communications work for it but is also procuring PR and spin doctor services through contracts at a time when people are struggling?  I and many other Senators have been raising so many challenges faced by individuals, families and communities.  Recently I spoke about people trying to get basic housing allocated to them and about people being in danger of losing their accommodation because of rent increases.  This is going on while our public bodies spend fortunes on making themselves look good in the eyes of voters and the wider public.</p>  <p>I raise this issue today because currently the west has no baby cooling system for children who were deprived of oxygen before birth.  Unless such babies are given cooling treatment brain damage can occur.  I understand that Saolta, as it is now called after an expensive name change, has engaged Setanta Communications - a PR firm - to justify and spin about the fact, among other things, University College Hospital Galway has no cooling system in place.  Let me just draw on the words of one particular advertisement - the cost of a baby cooling mat: &euro;10,000; the cost of the services of a neonatalogist: &euro;60,000; the cost of a law suit for a child who suffered brain damage: &euro;4 million; and the cost of saving a child's life: priceless.  We have our priorities all wrong and it is disgraceful that the spend on PR firms is greater than the spend on life-saving treatments.</p>  <p>The Cathaoirleach ruled earlier on the question of adverting to Deputy Clare Daly's Private Member's Bill in the other House which was a direct assault on the dignity and rights of some very vulnerable children.</p></speech>

The Senator has asked that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, come to the House to debate the issue.  I will seek such a debate with the Minister and have already asked for a debate on library services which the Senator sought yesterday.  However, if there is a specific issue arising with regard to levels of compliance, that might be best approached as a commencement matter directed to the Minister.  That would certainly be a quicker way of getting a response from her.  That said, I will seek the broader debate for which the Senator has called.</p>  <p>Senator Paul Coghlan raised the issue of an An Taisce case in County Kerry.

I do not think I should comment further on something which may be the subject of a judicial review.  </p>  <p>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell raised the issue of the Private Member's Bill put forward by Deputy Clare Daly in the other House yesterday.  The Cathaoirleach has ruled on that issue and my own views on it are well known.  The Senator sought a debate in this House on the office of the Attorney General.  As colleagues will be aware, under Article 30 of the Constitution, the Attorney General is legal adviser to the Government.  I have not seen her advice on this matter which was issued to the Government for Government members.   Government members stated that in respect of Deputy Clare Daly's Bill, the advice was that it was unconstitutional.</p> <p>I can certainly look into having a debate on the role of the Attorney General, but I am not sure we can do so in this House.

We have had an extensive debate on the Order of Business because a number of other colleagues raised the issue of the role played by the Attorney General.</p>  <p>Senator John Gilroy referred to the role of the Attorney General and Article 15.  Colleagues will be aware that Article 15.4.1&deg;  states the Oireachtas shall not enact any law which is in any respect repugnant to the Constitution, but, as we know, in any Article 26 reference that succeeded &ndash; in other words, where the Supreme Court struck down a Bill as being unconstitutional &ndash; there was advice from the Attorney General that the Bill was constitutional.  Clearly, no Attorney General is infallible and I do not think anyone would ever suggest the Attorney General was.</p>  <p>Senator James Heffernan referred to the Private Members' Bill on which the Cathaoirleach had ruled and asked specifically about a matter before the Labour Party Parliamentary Party.  All I can say is that the advice of the Attorney General was not disclosed to anyone who was not a member of the Government.  Like the Senator, I wish Deputy Anne Ferris very well.  I regret that we could not legislate for fatal foetal abnormalities and have asked the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health to look at whether it would be possible to draft legislation within the terms of the Constitution to deal with that specific issue.  I accept it would have to be highly restrictive to stay within the terms of Article 43.3 which I believe should be repealed, but that is a matter for another day.</p>  <p>Senator Hildegarde Naughton welcomed the announcement by IDA Ireland and the launch today of An Action Plan for Jobs which is region focused.  We should all join in welcoming this really important initiative.  It is a new five-year &euro;250 million strategy aimed at accelerating jobs recovery, which is under way.  A few colleagues mentioned really good news on job announcements in specific parts of the country, which are hugely welcome.  Each of the eight regional areas is to develop its own action plan.  There is a very structured plan at which I advise colleagues to look in terms of how it will be rolled out, with the first tranche of &euro;50 million to be made available this year.  Colleagues referred to specific aspects of the plan, with Senator Hildegarde Naughton referring to Galway, to which Senator Michael Comiskey also referred.  It would be worthwhile colleagues looking at it, particular from the point of view of their own areas, to see how it will be rolled out and how they can assist in any way in supporting it.</p>  <p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to the proposals for the restructuring of Greek debt which had been put forward.  I answered this question yesterday when I pointed out that there would be a debate on the matter  in the other House last night on foot of a Private Members' motion.  I committed to looking for a debate on it in this House also.  As I said yesterday, the taxpayer has invested in the region of &euro;350 million as part of the Greek programme and the Government has stated it wants to see a resolution to help the Greek people.  As the Senator said, we all appreciate the suffering and hardship people in Greece and other eurozone countries have endured in recent years as a result of particularly high levels of unemployment and debt.</p>  <p>Senator Michael Comiskey referred to the job announcements and welcomed the visit of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, to the United States and the return of Irish beef to the market there, which we all welcome. </p>  <p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson referred to the habitats directive.  He also welcomed the provision of a new complex in Monaghan to include the new Gaelscoil.  I thank him for being very inclusive in his remarks.  He thanked colleagues in different parties, including the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, for the action taken, which, obviously, is very welcome.  </p>  <p>The Senator also asked about the development of the former barracks in Cavan town.  I suggest he table a Commencement Matter to the Minister for Education and Skills as it is a very specific question which is probably not appropriate to a more general debate.</p>  <p>Senator Michael Mullins welcomed the jobs plan and the announcement of the creation of 100 jobs in Tuam.  He also referred to the greening of iconic buildings around the world, including the Sacr&eacute;-Coeur in Paris, the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville and the Colosseum in Rome, which is hugely welcome for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations.  As the Senator said, this is a unique opportunity for us to grow the tourism industry.</p>  <p>Senator Jim Walsh called for a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the impact on victims of the crimes of burglary and theft.  I will seek such a debate.  I have dealt with the issue of abortion and the Constitution.</p>  <p>Senator C&aacute;it Keane referred to renewable energy targets and developments on solar energy at Dublin City Council and in other places.  She called for a debate on the issue of renewable energy.  It would be good to have such a debate which I will certainly look to have.  I did not know about Leipzig being the location of the biggest solar panel in the world, which is interesting. </p>  <p>With her customary eloquence, Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell referred to the treatment of customers by banks and ongoing practices in banking.  I do not know if the Joint committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has specifically looked at the issue of customer service in banks, but it would provide a really good focus for the committee because, as I said yesterday in another context, it could invite people in and hold hearings.  We can look for a debate in the House on the issue, but the committee might provide a better forum for it.</p>  <p>Senator Catherine Noone referred to An Action Plan for Jobs, is which region-focused.  I have covered that issue.  </p>  <p>Senator Feargal Quinn referred to the issue of access to AVCs and giving people access to pension funds to free up money for spending.  I agree with the Senator that we could deal with that issue in the context of the debate on pensions which was looked for yesterday and for which I have asked.</p>  <p>Senator Mary Moran referred to the very worrying reports from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital on the treatment of breech births, a matter of great concern to us all.  I understand practices have improved since.  The Senator also referred to other issues in the health service and called on the Minister for Health to come to the House to debate the issue of trolley figures and overcrowding in accident and emergency departments.  As the Minister for Health said, the current high figures which are very concerning are due to a combination of factors, including delayed discharges which are at a higher level.  It was apparent from listening to staff working in accident and emergency departments on radio this morning that the issue of delayed discharges is very significant.  It is not so much that more beds are required in hospitals but more beds in step-down facilities to ensure patients may be discharged safely.  The Government has taken action in allocating 300 additional fair deal scheme places, 400 additional home care packages and reopening or funding 500 transitional and community beds.  The Department and the HSE are working to have another 200 beds opened in the next two weeks.  Mount Carmel Hospital, local to my area in Dublin, will be reopened as a community hospital in March.  We all hope these developments will result in an easing of the problem.  There has also been a difficulty in recruiting senior decision-making doctors, while there has been the seasonal outbreak of flu.  These have contributed to the problem.  However, it must be remembered that there were problems with overcrowding in accident and emergency departments even during the boom times.  It is as much a matter of seeking to manage the problem as it is an issue of funding and resources.  I will certainly look for the Minister for Health to come to the House to tell us what he was doing to tackle the issue.</p>  <p>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen referred to the issue of contract procurement and spending in the HSE, which I suggest is one for the Committee of Public Accounts or the Joint Committee on Health.</p></speech>

This reform programme is being informed to a substantial extent by the excellent work undertaken by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  Overall, the Government&rsquo;s objectives are to ensure the confidence of the public in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is maintained, as well as to bring forward the necessary change to ensure the high-quality and respected service that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided is continued and enhanced to better meet the realities, requirements and expectations of 21st century policing.</p>  <p>The underlying focus of the reform programme, supervised by the Cabinet committee on justice reform and chaired by the Taoiseach, is to put in place effective arrangements for the oversight, governance and accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As a member of the Cabinet committee, and more particularly as the responsible line Minister, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is leading the implementation of the reform programme.</p>  <p>The Bill marks an important element of these reforms.  Before turning to deal specifically with the Bill, I wish to update Senators briefly on the other important elements of the justice reform programme.  The Minister has published the scheme of a Bill for the proposed new policing authority which takes into account a significant number of the recommendations made by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The Bill is being drafted on a priority basis and the scheme was considered by the joint committee in the course of pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Minister is looking forward to publishing the Bill and bringing it before the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  That will afford us another opportunity to consider any additional measures that might be required to enhance the role of GSOC, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p>  <p>&middot; The independent review mechanism, consisting of a panel of counsel established to examine approximately 300 complaints alleging Garda misconduct or problems with investigating misconduct, is continuing its work and has made significant progress.  The Public Appointments Service has managed the first open competition to appoint a new Garda Commissioner which gave rise to the appointment of the current commissioner.  Following a process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service seeking expressions of interest, the Government has nominated Ms Josephine Feehily as the chairperson-designate for the forthcoming independent policing authority.  As chairperson-designate, Ms Feehily will assist in the preparations for the establishment of the authority.</p> <p> The Minister has also published the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s crime inspectorate report which deals with crime recording and investigation.  It also deals with some of the concerns raised by Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin, SC, in his report to the Government earlier this year about certain Garda actions.  The report contains more than 200 recommendations for implementation which are being actively pursued.  The establishment of a commission of investigation into matters identified in the Guerin report is in train.  The Fennelly commission of investigation is proceeding with its task of examining the operation of telephone recording systems in certain Garda stations for many years, as well as other matters.  It has indicated that it will submit an interim report on specific issues.</p> <p>The report on Judge Cooke&rsquo;s inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC has been published.  GSOC has published a redacted version of the report it commissioned into the possible disclosure of confidential information.</p> <p>Following the recent publication of the report of the Garda professional standards unit on cancellations in the fixed charge processing system, a further set of new arrangements has been introduced, including the referral for determination by the Director of Public Prosecution of cases involving garda&iacute; in seeking to have points cancelled on the basis that they were performing official duties at the time; an exemption provided in law for garda&iacute; and other emergency vehicle drivers; the establishment of a new enforcement unit in the fixed-charge processing office which will follow up on all cases cancelled owing to the fixed charge notice being returned having not been delivered through the postal system; and consultations between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the introduction of legislative changes arising from recommendations made in the report.  In addition, the Minister has appointed Judge Mathew Deery, former President of the Circuit Court, as the independent oversight authority for the fixed charge processing system.  The authority will be free to inspect at random any fixed charge notice cancellation and report its findings on the operation of the system to the Minister.</p> <p>The review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road agreement is expected to be completed shortly.  It encompasses all aspects of the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>The Minister has published the report of the independent review group on the Department of Justice and Equality and is working closely with the Department&rsquo;s senior management team to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</p> <p>The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 has amended Garda legislation to allow Garda members to make protected disclosures to GSOC in confidence in respect of alleged Garda misconduct.  The relevant provisions of the Act have been brought into operation.</p> <p>In presenting the Bill to the House I look forward to constructive engagement with Senators.  Overall, the Minister believes it is important that we, as Members of the Oireachtas, should not forget the ongoing and substantial contribution An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its members have made for over 90 years in terms keeping communities safe and preserving the security of the State.  This has been a contribution delivered in the face of ever present threats and tragically at the cost of the lives of some members of the force.  It is a contribution for which we should be grateful to the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, for all this good work, the Minister is not blind to that which is not good, including issues related to penalty points, crime investigation and responding to whistleblowers.  In some cases, what we have learned about the behaviour of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has struck at the heart of our shared understanding of what justice itself is.  We live in a republic - a republic of laws - in which there is not and never can be one law for some but not others, in which all persons are and should always be treated equally.  That is what we expect and, more importantly, what we are entitled to expect.</p> <p>We have had too much controversy of late regarding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Minister acknowledges that this has been a difficult time for the members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the vast majority of whom joined the force with the sincerest of aspirations to provide the highest levels of service for the public and are disappointed at the failures that have been uncovered and the controversies that have raged.  Similarly, the Minister is aware that there is a commonly shared determination and desire within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and among communities across the country to see reform happen, to see a break from the past and to move on from this period of controversy to a new one of confidence.  She wants to see confidence trumping controversy.  She wants to see confidence restored in the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  She wants to see the organisation, structures, practices and systems put in place to support the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver effectively the best possible policing and security services for communities and the country.  She wants to see, as she said when taking office, a sea change in the performance, administration and oversight of justice and policing in the State.  This will involve confronting deficiencies and failures.  It will also involve examining, openly, transparently and vigorously, operational practices that are simply not up to standard.  This is being done and at the heart of the Government's programme of justice reform.  Ultimately, the Minister wants to move from the concept of a police force to delivery of a police service that is fit and ready to meet the realities, requirements and expectations of 21st century policing.  Achieving this requires acknowledgment, reforms and resources.  The Government has begun the process of addressing the question of resources.  It has provided funding for 400 new Garda vehicles.  Some 300 trainees have recently entered the Garda College in Templemore - the first new intake since 2009 - and arrangements are under way to civilianise immigration functions which will free up 150 garda&iacute; for front-line policing duties.</p> <p>In presenting the justice reform programme the Minister has also stressed her priority objective of strengthening the role and remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  The Bill seeks to deliver on this commitment.  As Senators will be aware, the primary functions of GSOC are concerned with dealing with complaints against Garda members and examining Garda practices and procedures.  However, since its establishment under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, there have been certain restrictions on the extent to which the GSOC functions can be exercised.</p> <p>The preparation of the Bill has been informed by a public consultation process which was completed in May 2014, the Farmleigh consultation seminar in June 2014 which was attended by 100 participants representing key stakeholders and direct contacts with GSOC.  It has also been informed by the valuable work carried out by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  As Senators will be aware, the joint committee's report contained extensive recommendations following its comprehensive review of current Garda legislation.  This followed a series of hearings and visits to other jurisdictions.  The Minister is grateful to the committee for the report and I am happy that the Bill addresses some of its recommendations.  Very careful further consideration is being given to the report with reference to the preparation of the legislation on the proposed policing authority.</p> <p>For the most part, the Bill amends the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 which is the primary statute governing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some of the amendments involved are technical in nature and I will deal with them more specifically as the Bill progresses.  Amendments are also being made to the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 to permit GSOC to exercise certain additional police powers.</p> <p>I now turn to the specific content of the Bill.  Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, are standard provisions containing definitions and technical amendments arising from later provisions in the Bill.</p> <p>Section 4 extends the general time limit in section 84(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 for making a complaint to GSOC from six to 12 months.  This does not alter the current position under which it is open to GSOC to extend the time limit if it considers there are good reasons for doing so.  Senators will be aware that the issue of time limits was covered in the report of the Oireachtas joint committee.</p> <p>Section 5 is to be read in conjunction with sections 12 and 13.  It substitutes a new definition of &lsquo;&lsquo;enactment&rsquo;&rsquo; in section 98(5) of the 2005 Act, as amended, to remove the current prohibitions on GSOC exercising police powers under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009.  In that context, section 12 amends the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 to enable GSOC to undertake the interception of communications for the purposes of a criminal investigation by it under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  The approach adopted is that a GSOC investigating officer will have the powers that would be available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the same circumstances.  In addition, the conditions and safeguards contained in the 1993 Act will operate where interception is sought by GSOC.</p> <p>Similarly, section 13 provides for amendments to the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 to enable GSOC to carry out surveillance where it is necessary in connection with a criminal investigation into an arrestable offence.  In this context, GSOC will be in the same position as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purposes of conducting such an investigation.</p> <p>Section 6 amends section 102 of the 2005 Act to broaden the scope for the Minister to refer a matter to GSOC to allow it to investigate it, even if the identity of the member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not known at the time of the investigation or where the investigation may also involve a person who is not a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These issues were identified in Judge Cooke's report as ones that could usefully be clarified and the Minister has undertaken that this be done.</p> <p>Section 7 inserts a new section 102B into the 2005 Act to brings the Garda Commissioner within the scope of GSOC investigations for the first time.</p> <p>This was also an issue addressed in the report of the joint committee.  This section was the subject of debate during the passage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il, in particular, the question of whether the consent of the Minister should be required where GSOC proposed to undertake an investigation on its own initiative into alleged misconduct on the part of the Garda Commissioner.  After careful consideration and reflecting on that debate, as well as taking account of the key position of the Garda Commissioner in security matters, the provisions of section 102B were strengthened on Report Stage to provide a specific role for the Government, rather than just the Minister, in the important decisions to be taken under the section.  </p> <p>In addition to carrying out general policing functions, the Garda Commissioner is head of the national security service in which role he or she fulfils a vital role closely linked with the obligations of the Government to preserve the security of the State.  In these circumstances the Minister believes it is appropriate the Government should approve the granting or withholding of consent by the Minister where the conduct of the Garda Commissioner is called into question.  Moreover, the original proposal has been further strengthened to ensure that in a situation where a request from GSOC to undertake an investigation into conduct of the Garda Commissioner is being refused, this can only be done for stated reasons.  The practical reality is that only in exceptional cases consent to a proposed investigation would not be given and in these circumstances specific reasons will be provided.  The Minister believes that, on foot of a demonstrable concern that the Garda Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct, it is extremely unlikely in almost any circumstance that consent would be withheld.  Accordingly, subsection (1) of the new section enables GSOC to investigate, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so and subject to the consent of the Minister given with the approval of the Government, any matter that gives rise to a concern that the Garda Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct.  Subsection (2) allows the Minister, with the approval of the Government, if he or she considers it desirable in the public interest to do so, to request GSOC to investigate any matter that gives rise to a concern that the Garda Commissioner may have done anything referred to in subsection (1) and the commission is required to investigate that matter.  By virtue of subsection (3), the Minister may, with the approval of the Government, for stated reasons, refuse to consent to an investigation by GSOC of any matter under subsection (2).  Subsections (4) and (5) are provisions necessary to facilitate the operation of the section.  In particular, adaptations are being made to the 2005 Act to ensure GSOC will have the necessary powers to undertake an investigation involving the Garda Commissioner.</p> <p>Section 8 is consequential on the insertion of the new section 102B under section 7.  It amends section 103 of the 2005 Act which deals with keeping certain persons informed of GSOC investigations.</p> <p>Section 9 inserts a new section 103A into the 2005 Act and is intended to strengthen the flow of information from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to GSOC, in particular under the protocol arrangements in place under section 108.  Specifically, it imposes a statutory duty on the Garda Commissioner to ensure information to be provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for GSOC for the purposes of an investigation will be supplied as soon as practicable.</p> <p>Section 10 replaces section 106 of the 2005 Act and allows GSOC for the first time to carry out an examination, on its own initiative, of practices, policies or procedures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purpose of preventing or reducing complaints.  Currently, it can only do this when requested by the Minister and the change being proposed was recommended by the joint committee.  The reports will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, subject to the possible exclusion of certain matters such as those, for example, relating to national security or where the commission of an offence may be facilitated.</p> <p>Just as GSOC is being given the power to initiate examinations of Garda practices independently, the Minister believes, in line with a further recommendation of the joint committee, that it should also be open to the Garda Inspectorate to do this.  Accordingly, section 11 amends section 117(2) of the 2005 Act to enable the inspectorate to conduct, on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister, inspections or inquiries into a particular aspect of the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At present, the inspectorate can only conduct such an inspection or inquiry with the prior consent of the Minister.</p> <p>Section 14 sets out the Short Title, collective citation and commencement provisions for the Bill.</p> <p>The Minister is conscious that the changes proposed in the Bill will give rise to additional demands on the resources of GSOC and also the Garda Inspectorate.  I referred briefly to budget 2015 in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I can also confirm to the House that budget 2015 provided for an increase of &euro;1 million in the allocation to GSOC and an increase of &euro;250,000 in the allocation to the inspectorate.  Throughout the recent public debate on justice reform the Minister has consistently made it clear that the reform must not simply be about change for its own sake.  Our reforms are about providing the country with the police force it needs, operating to the highest professional standards, ready to meet existing and emerging challenges.  They are about ensuring that throughout the country the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be fully supported by good organisational structures, practices and systems to ensure they can deliver the best possible policing and security services for communities and their people.  They are about addressing broader systematic failures which have called into question the capacity of the Garda organisation to function properly and carry out its core tasks.  The reforms are about restoring the confidence of the public in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-11a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1116" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015021100014#T00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 is important legislation, but we must not over-egg the pudding.  This is the first step in expanding the remit and powers of GSOC.  I am a supporter of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as is every citizen.  It deserves our support and does very good work within the resources allowed to it by the Government.  The force is under considerable pressure at all times and issues around resources have not been addressed in the Minister's reform plans.</p>  <p>The Bill falls far short of the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  It seems the initial enthusiasm that the change of justice Minister would change the way we did things with a big sweep-out in the Department has waned.  The Bill does not go far enough in securing the independence and impartiality of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We must maintain the independence of the police force.  It must be independent of the Minister for Justice and Equality and others to ensure it can do its job properly, protect society and guard the peace.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Garda (amendment) Bill proposed to create a stronger ombudsman unfettered by political interference in investigations, while still guarding against the possible undermining of national security, a consideration which may not always be fashionable but of which we must be conscious.</p>  <p>The Bill introduces several welcome changes such as the extension of the time limit for making complaints to GSOC from six to 12 months.  GSOC will have more investigative powers under the Bill using surveillance and the same power as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in certain investigations which it did not have before.  The Garda Commissioner will be brought within the oversight of GSOC, but the consent of the Minister and the Government will be required for this to happen.  This is a real gap in the legislation.  The Bill allows the Minister to request permission to carry out investigations in the public interest, which is welcome.  It provides that information requested by GSOC will be provided by the Garda as soon as is practicable/  This is a commonsense provision.  The Bill allows GSOC to carry out investigations, on its own initiative, and investigate the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  All of these provisions are very important and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have nothing to fear from them.</p>  <p>The legislation, however, does not go far enough.  While we will support it, we will be trying to improve it.  We need to allow the commission to have access to PULSE, police using leading systems effectively, on a statutory basis.  GSOC needs to have complete independence from ministerial oversight when investigating the Garda Commissioner.  The Minister has made the point that in normal circumstances investigations into the Garda Commissioner are very rare.  They should be; if not, we have completely failed.  It should not be forgotten, however, that it was the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, who accused the Taoiseach of sacking the last Garda Commissioner.</p> <p>He said that.  The idea that the Government will rarely get involved in these matters is not correct.  A commission of investigation is examining what went on at that time.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague has made up his mind on it, as many of us have.  I certainly agreed with him at the time that it had the appearance of the Taoiseach sacking a Garda Commissioner.</p> <p>We need GSOC as an independent body to investigate everybody, to be separate from Government and from the Garda.  That is what should have happened if the Government had a problem with the Commissioner at that time.  We look forward to the publication of the report of the Fennelly commission, as I am sure the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources does too, as soon as possible.  We need to know the truth about what went on.  The garda&iacute; need to know too because they are the ones who are criticised when many of them are struggling because of wage cuts and resource cuts. </p> <p>The Bill also fails to put the Garda authority on a statutory footing.  That could have been done.  I welcome the appointment of Josephine Feehily as the chairperson designate.  In fairness to her and to the Revenue Commissioners they have come out of the boom and bust in the economy relatively unscathed.  People have respect for the Revenue Commissioners.  They are seen to have done a fairly good job.  They do their job efficiently.  We might not always like them, nobody likes tax collectors but that is the nature of the job.  Ms Feehily has done a really good job there and I hope she will bring the same efficiency, determination and commitment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na authority.  I think she will be a really positive force there.  </p> <p>This Bill fails to give responsibility for the recruitment and appointment of senior Garda officers to the Public Appointments Service or indeed to the proposed Garda authority.  It does not expand freedom of information beyond existing provisions.  We support this Bill but would like to see it go much further.  It is a pity that it has not gone much further.</p> <p>It is only one part of the story.  Resources are the bigger issue, what the Garda can do, the closure of Garda stations, the reduction in Garda numbers.  Garda numbers are down by 1,600 and while we welcome the new recruits they are few in the overall context.  I wish them the best of luck as they start a very important job.  A total of 139 Garda stations have been closed in isolated rural areas.  Prisons are overcrowded.  There is a revolving door in the prisons which we last saw at the end of the last rainbow Government.  Thousands of summons, bench warrants, remain outstanding, undermining the criminal justice system.  Four inquiries have been established into the administration of the Department of Justice and Equality.  One resulted in the resignation of the previous Minister.  Change is badly needed and change needs to mean the garda&iacute; are completely separate from politics.  </p> <p>There has been much discussion, public and private, about political policing.  I do not believe we have political policing in this country.  However, when we consider the antics of the Taoiseach and the Garda Commissioner last year and of the former Garda Commissioner with the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, passing information about a Deputy, one can well understand why people talk about political policing even though I do not believe it exists on the ground.  That is what is going on.  That is what we need to change.  We need to remove the politics, remove the Government from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, let it do its job independently and have all our support.  It needs change but it needs to be independent and it deserves and has the support of the people.  We will support the Bill but will continue to put pressure on the Government to make positive changes. </p></speech>

I welcome the Bill.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister of State are bringing forward necessary legislation.  This Bill deals with the defects in the system.  It gives wider powers to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman, which is welcome.  I welcome the extension of the time limit for filing complaints from six months to 12 months.  There is also a problem about interception of postal packets.  Some of these are technical amendments but they are important.</p>  <p>While mistakes have been made they have been made by very few people.  I am based in Cork and the contribution of the garda&iacute; to the local community there has been fantastic.  I have worked with them for over 25 years, particularly with young people.  I have seen many garda&iacute; involved in various community organisations after hours, without pay, in particular directing young people who have got involved in crime at an early age into youth clubs, sports organisations and education.  I had the privilege of being involved in one such facility which had at any one time more than 40 young people who had dropped out of school.  Every one of them was heading in the wrong direction, getting involved in petty crime which in the long term would lead to more serious issues.  Nine times out of ten it was the garda&iacute; who got those people back into the education system.  There were garda&iacute; involved with the board and at all stages in that process.  When we did a survey of the people who had left the facility five years previously we found that over 70% were in full-time employment.  They came from families where neither the parents nor the grandparents had ever worked.  That project would not have succeeded without the contribution of the garda&iacute;.  It is easy to criticise a few but it is important to also give credit to the people who work beyond the call of duty.  </p>  <p>This Bill puts in place the procedures necessary to deal with issues that arise if people are not doing their job or not doing it correctly.  It also gives power to the Minister under the section which allows the Minister to refer a matter to GSOC.  It is important that this is all transparent, except on an issue of national security.</p>  <p>I remind Senator Byrne that the previous Minister, Deputy Shatter, gave the go-ahead for the building of the new prison in Cork, which is progressing.  The project was in waiting for over 20 years.  I am delighted that it is progressing and that we will have proper facilities.  It is also important to develop and grow the educational system within our prisons because there is no point keeping someone in prison for one, two or three years and releasing him or her into the rut he or she was in before going into prison.  We have a contribution to make in that area. </p>  <p>This Bill deals with the issues covered by various inquiries in recent years.  There is a need for checks and balances.  There must also be fairness in any investigation.  This Bill provides for that.  I welcome the legislation because it will restore the street credibility of the garda&iacute;.  We can complain all we like about the garda&iacute; and criticise them for things not done but they cannot work without the support of the community.  We have been lucky that the Cork area has not suffered the same level of serious crime as other parts of the country.  That is due not only to the garda&iacute; being involved in the local community but also to the community giving support to the garda&iacute; when it is needed.</p> <p>I welcome this legislation.  It is important that it be put into place and that the procedures that must be set up are established under it.</p></speech>

This Bill also is welcome and it was interesting to hear Senator Byrne indicate that he - and I imagine Fianna F&aacute;il - welcome it but will seek some changes.  I hope the Minister of State has a listening attitude to any proposals that arise on Committee Stage.  Most people in Ireland have a high regard for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ever since its establishment in the early 1920s, it has managed to maintain that well.  Personally, I had a major experience 33 years ago when anybody who was in the supermarket business was under threat of kidnap.  Members may recall that at least three of the major supermarket people had been attacked or kidnapped.  The Garda came to the conclusion that my family was a likely target.  I was not the target because apparently, I was the one who could get the money out but the children or my wife might had been targeted.  We went through a number of weeks in which we had the special branch living in the house with us and watching us.  My regard and that of our family and friends for the professionalism of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at that time has not changed since.  Moreover, it appears to me that such professionalism instils confidence and is capable of being recognised by the public here.<br/><br/>I welcome any moves to improve the public service offered by the Garda.  Members should stress today that it should not be considered a police force but a service to citizens.  I was concerned when the former Garda Commissioner referred to the Garda as his &quot;force&quot;.  I am glad the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State have stated that preparation of the scheme of a Bill to provide for the establishment of an independent new policing authority is in progress.  I would like to hear from the Minister of State as to what countries the Government has consulted in preparing the police authority and on improving the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.<br/><br/>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has raised a number of concerns with the current set-up of GSOC, including the fact that its mandatory powers of investigation remain limited to a narrow range of cases involving &quot;death or serious harm&quot;.  All other cases involving, for instance, allegations of sexual offences or excessive use of force during Garda operations effectively may be referred to the Garda Commissioner for investigation by Garda members.  It recommends that mandatory investigations by GSOC should be broadened substantially to include all complaints made to GSOC unless that complaint is suitable for a mediated resolution.  It would be reasonable to amend section 91 of the Principal Act and other relevant sections to mean that GSOC would have mandatory powers to investigate serious sexual offences, serious corruption and other assaults.  Can the Minister of State indicate whether the Government would be open to an amendment to this effect?  If the Government is not open to this, I would be interested to hear the reasons it is not.  I welcome the new powers of GSOC contained in this Bill to be able to investigate a Garda Commissioner, which is sensible.  Why then does the Bill provide that effectively, it will be up to the Minister to sanction an investigation of a Garda Commissioner?  I am not satisfied that this is an acceptable separation of powers and GSOC should have more autonomy in this area.  While I acknowledge that this issue has been discussed, it is worth putting on the record.<br/><br/>I will take this opportunity to speak briefly about wider reform of the Garda.  It often is overlooked that the fundamental goal of policing actually is crime prevention.  One does not hear that often enough.  More than 200 years ago, the father of the modern police service, Robert Peel, said that crime prevention is the core of policing.  However, this concept needs repeating as I seldom hear it said by politicians in the media.  Even the Garda rarely mentions it and I believe that in a time of less manpower and fewer resources, the Garda must go back to a crime prevention-based police service.  Crime prevention is not a reaction to burglaries or crime and is not a person calling up a Garda station but is about the Garda being proactive.  It is the approach that involves going to businesses and giving them security advice, for example, on locks.  It is meeting with older people on security advice or identifying owners of certain cars and making them aware.  It is going to the home of an older person and installing alarms to the Garda station and giving advice there.  That sort of policing has diminished in recent years because the efforts, quite understandably, have been on catching the criminals.  I refer instead to managing to take steps to prevent the criminals from having that opportunity.<br/><br/>One question is whether we are looking at innovation.  For instance, in New Zealand, the entire police service is now moving to what they call a &quot;crime prevention first&quot; approach.  It is based on research such as that of the Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science, which looks at the science of crime and thus new ways to prevent crime.  This category of crime prevention focuses on criminal opportunities rather than the circumstances of the offender.  There, the system aims to make possible criminal targets less vulnerable and to provide assistance and information to both potential and actual victims.  In Ireland, we have a real tendency to go blindly down a path instead of following best practice, for instance, from our European neighbours.  Members should consider the United Kingdom, where one police service has pioneered a technique of &quot;predictive mapping&quot; of burglaries to deploy staff to high-risk areas at specific times and, together with other measures, this has brought about a significant fall in that type of crime.  I wonder whether that is being done here or whether, because of the difficulty of having enough money to pay a sufficient number of garda&iacute;, we are not concentrating on the right things.<br/><br/>In the context of crime prevention, Members should consider that a large proportion of all crimes are committed against crime victims who have been victimised previously in a phenomenon known as repeat victimisation.  One classic study found that just 1% of people experienced 59% of personal crimes, including violence, while 2% of people experienced 41% of property crimes.  These are very interesting figures and this means that bank robbers are much more likely to return to the same branch if they get away with a lot of money the first time.  In this system, the Garda would visit that same branch - which is more likely to get robbed - and help the people there to introduce measures to stop it happening again.  Perhaps the Garda is doing this but Members do not know about it.  The main conclusion of this famous study is that it shows that repeat victimisation and crime can be prevented and in the study, through prevention activities, crimes decreased by one sixth in the prevention condition when compared with the normal condition.  The decreases were greatest, up to one fifth, for programmes that were designed to prevent repeat burglaries, both residential and commercial.  I believe the Garda should be taking this international evidence on board much more.<br/><br/>The situation in which the concept of prevention has been lost has been identified in other European Union countries.  Unfortunately, it has not been highlighted here.  A major report on policing in the United Kingdom found that only one of the 190 modules of basic training that all new recruits undergo focuses on crime prevention.  Sir Denis O'Connor, the retired UK Chief Inspector of Constabulary made a great impact in that regard.  Personally, I would like to ascertain whether Sir Denis O'Connor could be hired by the Government to undertake a thorough analysis of the Garda.  I believe that many senior garda&iacute; would not like that to happen and that Sir Denis O'Connor would most probably be shocked at what he would find.  If it cost &euro;100,000 or more to get someone like that to do a report on the Garda, it would be money well spent.  Can the Minister of State indicate whether the Government would be open to get some expert from the outside with a history of success to carry out such an analysis?<br/><br/>I wish to raise one final idea from Switzerland, where the focus of the police is on prevention.  There, plain-clothes <i>Police Judiciaire</i>provide what is known as street intelligence to uniformed police by radio.  They blend in with crowds, working at street-level to often anticipate such crimes as robbery and drug dealing and then act accordingly and quickly.  It is a modern, agile, tailored approach which is backed up with the latest technology.  While the public calls for a garda walking in the beat in high-visibility jackets, this actual visibility of the Garda means that a thief simply waits until the garda&iacute; pass before committing a crime.  The Swiss example of prioritising plain-clothes police is counter-intuitive but it is one that has been proven to work much better.</p> <p>Dublin could benefit from that.</p> <p>This is worthwhile legislation and I congratulate the Government on bringing it forward.  However, I still believe there are some elements that we could improve further.  We are missing a major aspect of the future of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that of crime prevention.  We are not concentrating on prevention but on detection.  That said, we should make sure that in bringing this Bill through the House, we make it the best legislation possible.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State has said, it is part of a comprehensive programme of justice reform which will, among other things, substantially strengthen Garda accountability and I very much welcome it in that context.  In his speech the Minister of State set out quite a range of different aspects of the reform programme which are under way.  I particularly welcome the decision to establish the new policing authority which was a plank of Labour Party policy for many years and which I am delighted to see is finally taking shape.  I am conscious of the fact that the Minister has published the scheme of a Bill which has been considered by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  I also welcome the appointment of Ms Josephine Feehily as the chairperson designate of the new authority.  That is an important part of the process of ensuring greater accountability structures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>The Minister of State also mentioned a range of reports and reviews which have been undertaken.  In particular, it is worth highlighting the really comprehensive Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate's crime investigation report which contains more than 200 recommendations.  Among the issues it examines are the matters dealt with by senior counsel Mr. Sean Guerin in his report to the Government in respect of certain Garda actions.  Members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality engaged with the Garda Inspectorate in respect of the report as a whole quite recently.  We found its recommendations to be really extensive on the aspects of Garda operational practice that they cover.  While listening to Senator Quinn I was conscious of the fact that a substantial number of those recommendations are related to crime prevention.  The Inspectorate looked at different ways in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can improve its crime prevention work, for example, through the text message scheme for local communities that has been operational in some Garda divisions, through enhanced community policing and so forth.  The inspectorate report deals with crime prevention but it also deals with very technical aspects of day to day policing, the processing of cases, the handling of investigations and prosecutions and so forth.  I strongly recommend that my colleagues read the report.</p>  <p>As I said, one of the issues examined by the Garda Inspectorate was the Guerin report and the findings therein.  I read that report with great interest.  It raises some very worrying aspects of Garda practice.  A particular feature of the report which stood out for me was Mr. Guerin's commentary on the lack of oversight and supervision of junior and probationary garda&iacute;.  In many cases they were left with substantial responsibility but without any supervision of their handling of cases, complaints and crime allegations in particular stations.  The Garda Inspectorate has identified supervision, oversight and adequate structures for ensuring accountability of senior officers where junior garda&iacute; are put in charge of investigations and has argued that better structures must be put in place.  This is an important part of the reform process.  </p>  <p>I will now turn to GSOC and the reforms that have been suggested and recommended for that body.  Again, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality looked at this issue and as the Minister of State has said, it produced a report not just on GSOC but also on a review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, published last October.  I am really glad to see that some of the very significant recommendations of that report have been taken on board in this Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No.3) Bill.  I note in particular that in section 4, in line with a recommendation of the aforementioned committee, the time has been extended for the making of a complaint to GSOC in respect of Garda practice.  The time limit was six months and the committee recommended that it be extended.  The Bill now proposes to extend it to 12 months.  Of course, GSOC always had the power to extend the time limit if it considered that there were good reasons for doing so.  Certainly, that short time limit, in my experience as a practising barrister in the criminal area in the past, had a chilling effect on people in terms of bringing forward complaints.  Therefore, I really welcome that extension in section 4, which is quite important in terms of day to day practice in GSOC.</p>  <p>I also greatly welcome the change in section 7 that will enable the Garda Commissioner to come within the remit of GSOC.  Again, that was something that was recommended by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  I note the procedures in place before such an investigation can be carried out and I acknowledge that the Garda Commissioner has a particularly significant role in terms of security matters as well as policing.  I understand that is why the hurdle or safeguard of the consent of the Minister and the Government is required.  There is a specific role provided for the Government rather than just the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The spirit of that provision is certainly in line with the recommendation of the committee, which was that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the Garda Commissioner, should be made accountable to GSOC.  </p>  <p>I also welcome the provisions in sections 10 and 11 dealing with issues which were important to the committee.  GSOC, for the first time, will be able to carry out an examination on its own initiative of practices, policies or procedures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This goes way beyond the very restricted remit of GSOC in just looking at complaints and enables the commission to look at, for example, a pattern of complaints relating to a particular practice.  Penalty points is just one random example here.  These provisions will enable GSOC to extend its powers of investigation greatly.  Section 11 also contains a similar extension of powers for the Garda Inspectorate, which is also very welcome.</p>  <p>A number of the other provisions in the Bill are relatively technical in nature but will have an important effect in extending the investigative powers of GSOC.  However, there were other recommendations made by the Oireachtas committee in this regard which were not incorporated into the Bill.  I know that the Minister of State has said that some recommendations from the committee will feed into other legislation, in particular the independent policing authority Bill but I wonder whether the issue of access to PULSE should have been dealt with in this Bill.  The Oireachtas committee recommended that access to the PULSE system by GSOC would be placed on a statutory footing.  Members felt that access to PULSE would be of integral importance to the operation of effective oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I might raise this issue with the Minister at a future date.</p>  <p>The Oireachtas committee also made a number of recommendations concerning differentiation between various types of complaints.  We had heard that a large number of very minor issues were being brought to GSOC which slowed down its processes considerably.  One of the key issues we heard about during our hearings was the delay in the processing of complaints by GSOC.  We suggested that consideration be given to the establishment of an independent helpline to determine if a complaint to GSOC was warranted or if the issue could be dealt with in a different manner.  These are technical matters and perhaps they do not require legislative change; they may simply involve changing the work practices of GSOC.</p>  <p>The one very substantial change that the committee recommended which would require statutory change and which I do not see implemented in this Bill is the changing of the structure of GSOC.  We suggested that instead of three people, there would be a single Garda ombudsman.  We made that recommendation because we felt it would ensure a greater degree of accountability and further ensure no possibility of dissenting opinions or divergence in the ombudsman's findings.  We were quite persuaded by experience elsewhere of the strength of the single ombudsman model, where there is one person acting as ombudsman rather than a commission of three, as we have here.  In our hearings, we heard from people like Ms Nuala O'Loan, the first Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland, about her role.  I wonder if that is still under consideration or was that recommendation specifically ruled out in the drafting of this Bill?  Perhaps we will see it in some future legislation.  </p>  <p>Having raised again the issues that were important to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I welcome the reforming aspects of this Bill.  I particularly welcome the strengthening of the powers of GSOC and the extension of its remit to allow it to examine practices, policies and procedures on its own initiative.  That is really important, as are the other provisions I have mentioned. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-11a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1122" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015021100017#W00300"><p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an mBille seo agus muid ar bhealach fanacht p&iacute;osa fada leis an mBille c&eacute;anna.  I am pleased to welcome this Bill today.  It is fair to say that we have been waiting for it for quite a while.  It has been a very disturbing period in terms of the administration and application of justice in this State.  Public confidence has been fundamentally undermined by the incompetence and sometimes arrogance shown by this Government in overseeing all the episodes that have emerged in recent months and years.</p>  <p>Sinn F&eacute;in has called time and again for an independent policing authority.  Such an authority was not included in the programme for Government because it was not considered important enough.  Unfortunately, it has not been included here either.  However, I am assured that it will be established by another Bill in the coming weeks.</p> <p>I, and my party, will continue to push for this as we believe it is integral to the reform of policing in this State.</p> <p>When the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill was enacted in 2005, my party colleagues in the House said it did not go far enough and that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission did not have the powers to carry out its responsibility.  I am happy, therefore, that the Bill before us today will rectify that via section 7.  </p> <p>For the first time the Garda Commissioner will be brought within the scope of GSOC investigations which is a great improvement.  In recent times we witnessed the limitations of the powers of GSOC when it could not access the PULSE system directly.  Unfortunately, this too is not addressed here.</p> <p>Access to PULSE was one of the recommendations of the justice committee, as has been mentioned.  In its submission to the Department on the reform of policing, the committee called for a statutory provision to allow GSOC access the PULSE system to better equip GSOC staff in their investigations.  The adherence to agreed protocols between Garda and GSOC should be made compulsory in legislation.  We should legislate to grant direct access to PULSE for GSOC.  I shall seek to submit amendments on this matter as the Bill passes through the House, as I feel it is crucial to the work of GSOC.</p> <p>I also want to make reference to further comments made by Conor Brady more recently when he spoke about information being withheld from GSOC on the basis of State security.  We need to ensure that this is supervised to ensure this aspect is not used as a mechanism to hamper GSOC investigations.  I shall seek to amend the legislation to deal with this important issue.</p> <p>I shall speak briefly on the Garda Inspectorate.  Another of the Oireachtas joint committee's recommendations was the formation of a criminal justice inspectorate to include the powers of the Garda Inspectorate but wider in scope to encompass a number of bodies.  Sinn F&eacute;in advocates the broadening the role of the inspectorate to that of a criminal justice inspectorate.  Such an inspectorate would be primarily responsible for the effectiveness and efficiency of the workings of organisations within the criminal justice sector.  They must also have responsibility for laying their reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The bodies we want to come under the remit of the proposed criminal justice inspectorate include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Probation Service, the Courts Service and the Irish Youth Justice Service.  This  legislation changes the definition of the ombudsman in that it can now consist of three people with which I disagree.  I firmly believe there should only be one ombudsman and I note Senator Bacik's comments, in this regard.</p> <p>The joint committee also recommended changing the structure of GSOC from three commissioners to one ombudsman.  It cited that a single ombudsman would ensure a greater degree of accountability and ensure there is no possibility of dissenting opinions or a divergence in the ombudsman's findings.  I will seek to submit an amendment regarding section 65(1) of the 2005 Act to change the structure of the commission so that instead of three people there is a single Garda ombudsman.</p> <p>I accept that the former RUC is not, in crucial aspects, comparable with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  None the less important lessons can be gained from the changes to policing in the North as a result of the Patten report and the Good Friday Agreement.  In terms of this issue, we have circulated our document to all Oireachtas Members.  I invite those who have not had an opportunity to look through it to do so.  It is our considered contribution but it is not definitive. </p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in believes in a new beginning for policing in the South.  We want an open and transparent policing service, not a force, which is representative of all people residing in this State.  We need to see freedom from partisan political control or influence, operational independence and community policing in order to maximise  confidence in the police.  I support the Bill but will seek to bring forward the  recommendations and amendments that I have outlined.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.  </p></speech>

I am pleased that the Bill has attracted a significant degree of consensus, particularly in regard to its key provisions which provide for an expansion of the remit and powers of both GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Inspectorate.  I am grateful to Senators for their support in regards to these aspects.  I hope, given the level of consensus that has been demonstrated, that it will be possible to enact this Bill as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>As I said in my opening contribution, this Bill is one of a series of measures that have been taken by the Government as part of a comprehensive programme of justice reform which will substantially strengthen Garda accountability.  This reform programme is being informed, to a substantial extent, by the excellent work undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  However, I want to stress again that this Bill is not and was never intended to be the only or primary legislative response from the Government to the relevant work of the Oireachtas joint committee.<br/><br/>I again draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister published the scheme of a Bill for the proposed new policing authority before Christmas.  The scheme takes into account a significant number of the recommendations made by an Oireachtas joint committee.  The scheme is being considered by the joint committee in the course of pre-legislative scrutiny and the Bill is being drafted on a priority basis. <br/><br/>The Minister intends to bring the Bill before the Oireachtas as soon as is practicable.  The establishment of a new policing authority will be a significant element of the Government's programme of reform to tackle head-on the systematic failures which have come to light in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Bill contributes to these reforms by proactively enhancing the capacity of GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  Once again I want to express my gratitude to Senators who have expressed their support for the Bill and look forward to its early enactment.  <br/><br/>I shall respond directly to Senator Quinn's significant contribution on the area of crime prevention.  About 18 months ago I read an article by Neil Gaiman, which was published in the <i>The Guardian </i>newspaper.  He wrote about attending a conference of prison operators in the United States.  He mentioned that when they make plans for the potential prison population in 15 years hence they look at the literacy levels of ten and 11-year olds in any given district.  Therefore, I suggest we have a conversation another time on different and more expansive ways to tackle crime. </p></speech>

Section 13 is also amended to introduce a similar definition for a bookmaking operation.  The Bill provides that a licensed bookmaker may accept remote bets to a value of the lower of &euro;250,000 or 10% of annual turnover.  A licensed bookmaker who accepts remote bets to a value beyond this threshold will be obliged to take out a remote bookmaker&rsquo;s licence.  A technical amendment is made to section 13 which, for the avoidance of doubt, clarifies that the threshold value applies to any one calendar year of a bookmaker&rsquo;s licence.  The remaining amendments to sections 13 and 14 are technical amendments to rephrase the meaning of the term licence final day, in relation to a bookmaker&rsquo;s licence, a remote bookmaker&rsquo;s licence and a remote betting intermediary&rsquo;s licence in order to remove any doubt about when these licences fall due for renewal.</p></speech>

The public are to be warned of the addictive nature of gambling as follows&mdash;<br /><br />(a) all licensed bookmaker outlets must have on display this government warning:<blockquote>&ldquo;Warning: Gambling has been shown to be addictive, causing financial loss and damage to interpersonal, working and family relationships&rdquo;,</blockquote>(b) all betting slips/documents issued by bookmakers must carry the following warning:<blockquote>&ldquo;Warning: Gambling has been shown to be addictive, causing financial loss and damage to interpersonal, working and family relationships&rdquo;,</blockquote>(c) all on-line and electronic gambling systems (including: Internet, smartphone, interactive television and telephone) must for a period of not less than 15 seconds and before the user gains access to the gambling platform display the following notice:<blockquote>&ldquo;Warning: Gambling has been shown to be addictive, causing financial loss and damage to interpersonal, working and family relationships&rdquo;,</blockquote>(d) all advertising on billboards, television, radio and the Internet must carry the following warning:<blockquote>&ldquo;Warning: Gambling has been shown to be addictive, causing financial loss and damage to interpersonal, working and family relationships&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote>I welcome the introduction of the licensing regime for online bookmakers and betting exchanges.  It is widely accepted that the current legislative framework is outdated and unsuitable for the online environment in particular.  I welcome the fact that section 23 of the Betting Act 1931 will be amended by section 26 of this Bill to extend the current prohibition on licensed bookmakers from taking bets from those under the age of 18.  Interestingly, there have been no studies examining the prevalence of problem gambling in Ireland.  We only have research from other countries to go by.  There is, however, consistent evidence that the rate of problem gambling is higher among youths than in the general adult population.  I am aware that the Gambling Control Bill 2013 will introduce a range of measures to promote responsible gambling and protect vulnerable persons, including children, from problem gambling but I still feel it is necessary to include in this Bill several amendments to promote socially responsible gambling and to deter persons from engaging in irresponsible gambling.<br/><br/>The focus of the Bill is on offences but there is no emphasis on deterrents.  While the psychology of gambling and the nature of addiction are complex, a multifaceted and prominently displayed warning sign and opportunities for self-exclusion have been found to be effective particularly in the online environment.  I have encountered two cases since my election to this House, one is a family that had to borrow &euro;15,000 to pay off the debts of a son in college who got involved in gambling.  I am not sure how or where he raised the money.  The second was an adult who gambled away &euro;80,000 in six weeks.  The point he made was that he could wake up in the middle of the night and take his smartphone from under his pillow and run of a couple of bets.  I am thrown completely offside by the thought that he spent &euro;80,000. <br/><br/>There is a warning on cigarette packs to the effect that if I smoke I am likely to incur some health risk.  There are notices all over the place from drinkaware advising me of the dangers of consuming too much alcohol yet I can walk into a bookmaker&rsquo;s shop or use my home phone, smartphone or computer and gamble away my entire life savings and those of my family and possibly any assets I have, without any deterrent whatsoever.  With all due regard to the Gambling Control Bill 2013, which will seek to introduce more severe measures I call on the Minister of State to introduce this new section into the Bill which warns the public of the addictive nature of gambling.<br/><br/>I have rarely felt as strongly as I feel about this matter.  Thankfully I have never been involved in gambling.  I would find it hard to buy a lotto ticket.  I wonder why I do not win the lotto but I guess one cannot win it unless one buys the ticket.  I feel if I buy one ticket I will keep on buying more tickets.  It really worries me when I hear the stories of addiction.  This is a silent addiction.  If I am a smoker one will smell the smoke on my clothes, if I am a drinker I will more than likely fall around the place drunk at some stage and there are physical signs that I have engaged in these practices.  I can be a gambler and nobody will know.  I can keep this secret from my nearest and dearest.  This does not only involve men as we traditionally think, it now involves women and children.  There is some anecdotal evidence to suggest that problem gambling affects between 0.9% and 3.3% of people.  That is a fairly substantial number.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State consider inserting this section into the Bill?  I will welcome his comments on it.</p></speech>

I will table a couple of amendments on Report Stage, in particular around the review, which I want to flag.  Given the scheduling of this Bill, amendments had to be tabled by Monday, so the deadline was missed.  Senator Cummins and I, in particular, and others have been asking for this legislation for a number of years, so I am pleased it is before us.  It is not perfect, but it is a start.</p>  <p>I will not go over what I said on Second Stage but when we completed that Stage, we were going to report back to the commission and tell it what our plans were.  However, the gambling control Bill was supposed to be introduced in conjunction with this legislation.  Senator Craughwell spoke about gambling.  Gambling and betting are two different things, and I know the Senator knows that.  What we are talking about here is bookmakers, horse racing and greyhound racing and not about casinos, online casinos and online gambling.  We were supposed to have a gambling control Bill in parallel with this Betting (Amendment) Bill.  Maybe the reason it has not been introduced is due to resources in the Department of Justice and Equality and the priorities for legislation as large pieces of legislation are coming through that Department.  This is relevant to the section Senator Craughwell wants to insert in the Bill which does not introduce any controls on the online sector or on bookmaker shops.  If one walks into a bookmaker shop, one will see an electronic roulette wheel in the corner.  Many of them have poker machines in the corner and have virtual gambling.  There is nothing in this legislation to address that and that is my real concern.  </p>  <p>I am not anti-betting or anti-gambling.  There is a purpose for it and like everything else, it should be done in moderation.  I want the independent bookmakers to have a level playing pitch, which this Bill goes some way to doing.  I want off-course and online betting taxed because I want the Exchequer to get that income and to ensure we are not run by the large bookmaker chains.  However, what is missing is any of the gambling control measures we were told would be introduced in conjunction with this Bill.  That is why Senator Craughwell's amendment would be helpful in the interim because something needs to be done in the interim.   When this legislation my party and I support is enacted, it will deal with betting which is one side of this.  Colleagues have different views on it and views were expressed on Second Stage about liberalising opening hours and so on and points were very well made.  However, nothing is being done about this sector, which is the most dangerous one.</p>  <p>At least reputable bookmakers have some control over their clients and punters and they will regulate the betting in shops, as they have been doing for years.  However, I mention online gambling and roulette wheels in Paddy Power's and, I am sure, in Ladbrokes and other places - they are good companies, so I am not singling them out for criticism.  They set a &euro;100 maximum bet for roulette.  The Fitzwilliam casino, one of the private casino clubs which is around the corner, sets a maximum of &euro;50.  However, on the online side, we are letting this go and we are not getting tax revenue on any of it, when we should be.  It probably amounts to &euro;200 million.</p>  <p>I would like to know when the gambling control Bill will be published.  Is it expected to be enacted in the term of this Government or will it be left for further down the road?</p></speech>

There is a need for warnings to be issued because of the danger of addiction where betting and gambling are concerned.  I share Senator Darragh O'Brien's concerns in regard to the gambling control Bill.  I would have thought we would have had it by now but I have been told we will have it by the end of the year.  I hoped we would have had it early in this term.</p>  <p>There are a number of anomalies in the system where betting is concerned.  I am probably boring people mentioning them because I have done so on several occasions.  One must be over 18 years of age to buy a lottery ticket and to go into a bookmakers shop yet we have a State-sponsored tote where children, making their first holy communion, are brought to the dog track where they queue up to bet.  I have seen that happen and people who are addicted to gambling have told me they are addicted because of their early introduction to gambling, especially at dog tracks and racetracks where the tote is concerned.  That is an anomaly in the system.  In opposition, I tabled a Private Members' Bill to address it, but it was not addressed.  I have been told this Betting (Amendment) Bill is not the legislation in which it can be addressed, so I hope it will be addressed in the gambling control Bill.  I also hope that when this Bill is passed and when we move on to the gambling control Bill, people will not say we should have done this when dealing with the Betting (Amendment) Bill.  There is a need for somebody to address this anomaly where children can bet on the tote.  </p>  <p>The greyhound industry and the horse racing industry would be up in arms if they thought children would be prevented from betting.  I know of the lobbying the last time with people asking what this fellow was on about trying to prevent children placing a couple of bob on the tote.  That is the type of lobbying done by the industry and the sooner we stand up to it, the better.  If the Minister of State says it is a matter for the gambling control Bill, I hope people will not say that it should have been dealt with in the Betting (Amendment) Bill.  I need that clarified.</p>  <p>I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien in regard to a number of points he made.  There are poker machines and roulette wheels in bookie shops.  As far as I am concerned, Revenue should be removing them.  They are illegal and Revenue is turning a blind eye.  If we did not pay a few pence in tax, Revenue would be down on our backs but it is not going into these bookmaker shops and tearing out these machines, which it should be doing.  This is under the radar and people are prepared to let it be and ask what harm are they doing.  It is doing a hell of a lot of harm and the matter needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

The destructive technologies are the use of the Internet which gives the opportunity for people to gamble with abandon.  Senator Craughwell made the point that people are able to spend as much money as is available to them there and then.  That is not something I do not support nor should this House support it.  We should try to do something about it here and now.  I raised this issue on Second Stage, as did many others.  If it is possible to do this in this Bill, then it should be done.  If other legislation is required, I am sure the Leader will make the time available as soon as is practicable to ensure we can move on this.</p>  <p>The new version of gambling is moving and changing at a scary rate.</p> <p>I have too many young friends who are able to gamble whatever money is available to them, that is, people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, because they got involved far too early, as Senator Cummins has noted.  Something must be done about this and Members cannot sit on their hands, scratch their heads and state there will be another opportunity to do something about it.  Now is the time to do something about it and I look forward to the Minister of State's response to ascertain whether this is the legislation that is required and whether now is the time to do something about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-11a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1135" speakername="Ca&iacute;t Keane" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015021100021#HH00200"><p>As the Leader has said, I am trying to avoid being told, while debating the gambling control Bill, that I should have raised the matter here.  I refer to online gambling and the huge money being generated therefrom that is not being taxed or having duty taken from it at present.  I am trying to make the point that &euro;25 million is raised annually on online betting and Members must ensure the online sector is treated in exactly the same way in terms of regulations, licensing etc.  I acknowledge that horseracing is a great industry in Ireland that employs perhaps 22,000 people, raises a lot of money and is to be commended.  While money should go to the horseracing and greyhound industries, I have raised this point in the Chamber previously.  Some of the new money coming on-stream from online gambling should be diverted towards other sports and facilities, as well as to health, education about gambling addiction as advocated by Senator Craughwell, and prevention.  While I acknowledge Members are not debating the disease of gambling today, regulation is important.</p>  <p>I turn now to the betting exchanges that came on stream five or six years ago, that is, wholesale betting operators operating as exchanges in Ireland, albeit on a server or wherever outside the country.  Betfair is one such exchange and there is no tax involved.  The technology is changing all the time but when we are aware of it, we should be in a position to state that legislation is in place that can be implemented for bookmakers who can set up those betting exchanges immediately without any regulation.  It is unfair to those bookmakers who are legitimately present in this country if such organisations can act as bookmakers and lay bets on the betting exchange.  It could be next door to the premises of a bookmaker that is paying tax, is being regulated and so on but the exchange is operating without any deduction of duty on those activities.  It places the traditional forms of gambling at a significant disadvantage when one has that type of operation.  Regardless of where it is introduced, be it in the gambling control Bill or this Bill, I wish to lay down markers that some sports people also have raised,  In addition to aiding good industries such as horseracing, there should also be an educational elbow in respect of the tax, as well as funds for other sports like the GAA and for women's sports, which are not funded from any source or which are the poor relation.  I take this opportunity to raise these points now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-11a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015021100021#HH00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and note that 15 of the 18 amendments have been proposed by the Minister.  Consequently, I am glad he is listening to opinion on this legislation.  Senator Craughwell has raised very important points, which also were mentioned by Senators Michael D'Arcy and Cummins.  This is an appalling addiction and whereas cigarettes and alcohol take a long time, this can destroy a family immediately.  I thank Members opposite for the points they have made but between now and Report Stage, would it be possible to provide for a rule that one cannot spend more than a certain percentage of one's income on a bet?  The purpose of this would be to try to slow down the process by which people destroy their families, their children and so on.</p>  <p>This is the worst addiction.  I receive documents about the betting exchanges and so on mentioned by Senator Keane to the effect that this will create thousand jobs.  It could destroy just as many jobs if it develops gambling addictions that wipe out families.  While Senator Craughwell's formulations in his amendment are very good, I seek a formulation to the effect that when these businesses are legalised and brought within the scope of the legislation there should be a warning that one should not spend more than 2% or 3% of one's income because, most likely, one will be fleeced  The warning should state that the gambler must support the bookie and his family, as well as the computer system and so on and that they are not charitable organisations.  A huge mistake was made here in Ireland when banking got out of control and that should teach us to be much more careful with money and finances.  In this context, dealing with gambling is a good place to start.</p></speech>

I also am in agreement with Senator Craughwell's amendment.  To clarify, Members today are referring to amendments to online betting.  All Members present share the frustration because ever since they came into this House, they have been waiting for this legislation.  I acknowledge that technical EU matters have delayed the officials.  Everyone shares the frustrations.  I understand that &euro;5 billion has been bet online and given the current state of the Exchequer and how many citizens find it hard to make ends meet, it is a shame that this tax is not being collected.  The sooner this legislation can be passed the better.  However, is there any way in which the Minister of State can speed up the projected timeframe of the end of the year for the gambling control Bill?  I have also spoken to the Leader on the subject and I ask because Members are referring to the issue of online betting.</p>  <p>Yesterday was designated Internet safety day and I was smiling to myself because last year in this House, somebody gave me a tip for Cheltenham and I joined Betfair.  That company texts me continually.  It does not know who I am or what age I am as it did not ask me.  Moreover, in response to Senator Barrett's suggestion, it did not ask me how much I earned.  I get texts suggesting a refund for Mary Ann and how, were I to place exchange football bets, I would get a 50% refund.  Last week, the company sent me an exclusive offer for Mary Ann O'Brien, in which I could make the most of my weekend with a 100% refund on my exchange sports bets and so on.  I reiterate that yesterday marked Internet safety day.  All Members have children or grandchildren at home, all of whom have access to the Internet through smartphones.  There is nothing to stop them from taking a credit card from their father or mother or whatever and signing up.  The question is how to protect these young people in the future.</p>  <p>This is in parallel with how there is a great deal of support in this House for rural Ireland, as well as a great deal of angst about it.  In this context, we punch way above our weight globally in the horseracing industry and if one considers the likes of Coolmore Stud, we are the best in class.  There are very few sports or industries in which we can say Ireland is top of the class in the world in terms of both breeding and prize-money.  For example, Aidan O'Brien commands records that never will be bettered by any other racehorse trainers in the world.  Moreover, I refer to all the people in Ireland to whom these people give employment and to the tourism it brings in.  Unfortunately, however, to revert to the points made by Senator Craughwell, this is married to this serious situation that has been encountered by all Members.  I have met such a person for whom the lives of the entire family are in tatters.  The family home was going because the dad has had a serious problem that was secret for a long time.  It is now out in the open, the family is in shame and they are completely without the means to go forward.  This is what can happen.  Again, it would have been wonderful had Members able to debate this in parallel, because I really respect Senator Craughwell's position and the conversation he has instigated.  In particular, it is even worse with online betting because it is easier to do it in secret at home than it is to walk into a shop or go to the racecourse.</p></speech>

It is about betting and creating a level playing pitch for both the traditional bricks and mortar establishment on the high street and online betting.  I hear the frustration and also a sense of urgency about the pertinent societal matters.  That is coming through strongly in the debate.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell referred to the example of a &euro;15,000 debt building up over a short period of time and an adult gambling 80,000 units using a smart phone.  These are serious issues that we must grapple with.  Senator Mary Anne O'Brien also referred to the sense of urgency and the need for the gambling control Bill to be made a priority.  The general scheme of the gambling control Bill was approved by the Government in July 2013 and the scheme is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel awaiting formal drafting.  At this stage, it is not possible to indicate when the Bill is likely to be published.  I will speak to my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the viewpoints of Senators will be listened to.</p> <p>Senator Maurice Cummins referred to children and those under 18 years.  It is an important matter, as is his point about totes.  I am repeating myself in saying that this is a regulatory Bill.  Let us consider the frustration of the traditional bricks and mortar betting house having to pay a 1% levy when online competitors do not have to pay.  The Bill provides for the regulation of all remote bookmakers and betting exchanges offering betting services in Ireland.  Senator Keane referred to exchanges, which the Bill covers.  This must be seen as the first phase of a more enhanced regulatory environment being prepared by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The general scheme of a new comprehensive Bill on gambling was approved by the Government in July 2013.  Gambling control legislation will bring together, under a single enactment, the regulatory environment for all forms of gambling.  The Government has indicated that the tote should be brought within the scope of the scheme following an examination of the issues involved.  I hear what the Senator is saying about the tote but that will come under the forthcoming legislation.</p> <p>The House acts as an important springboard for forthcoming legislation in the short and medium term.  Having been a Member of the Seanad for five years, the moral compass of the House is as finely tuned as ever in terms of the important issues at stake.  Senator Michael D'Arcy referred to the wider legislative discussion, which will happen within the gambling control Bill.  We are all grappling with the magnitude of the new ways of gambling and such rapid change in terms of the Internet.  We might think that Facebook has been around a short time or a long time but it has been in existence for 11 years.  Phenomenal change has happened in a short period.  Any opportunity to discuss the wider aspects of Internet usage is a conversation that must be focused on.  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien referred to Internet safety day taking place yesterday.  This House has a role to play in that discussion.</p> <p>Senator Keane is correct that the Bill is about revenue collection and introducing a regulatory and licensing regime for online betting.  Senator Sean Barrett echoed the sentiments and the amendment proposed by Senator Craughwell.  That will be to the forefront of the gambling control Bill but I am not in a position to say when it will happen.  The Senator's sentiments and his sympathy to the amendment are clear.  In this regard Senator Mary Ann O'Brien emphasised speeding up the enactment of the gambling control Bill.  I hope this debate will act as a catalyst in focusing the Minister on this.  I will speak to her personally on the matter because many challenges exist.  While betting offices on the high streets close at a certain time of the evening, someone can wake up at 1 o'clock in the morning and bet online.  There are serious issues related to that.</p> <p>I do not propose to accept the amendment but I hear the sentiment expressed by the Senators and his genuine and sincere concerns about the totality of gambling.  The Senator drew parallels with warnings on cigarette packages and a similar message on gambling.  That will be dealt with in the wider context of the gambling control Bill.  I will not accept the amendment because I am confined by the specific nature of this interim legislation, which is about regulation to level the playing pitch for online and off-line and to examine the licensing regime and revenue collection.</p></speech>

I do not for one moment suggest that a warning in betting shops and on online gambling sites will deter people or reduce the level of addiction.  However, as a State and as a people, we have an obligation to warn people of the dangers and to make people aware, like the drink aware advertising.</p>  <p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien referred to receiving messages on her mobile telephone.  Families are being destroyed by this.  Senator Maurice Cummins made a point I had not thought about.  I have been on many racecourses and I have seen children with their few pennies at the tote office.  We have an obligation to do something about this and this is the first chance we have had to do so.  I am not aware of similar legislation anywhere in Europe.  Ireland was the first country in the world to lead with the smoking ban and this is the opportunity to do the same with betting.</p>  <p>Putting the problem in context means making people aware of the issues.  The case mentioned a few moments ago involved a family finding out about a gambling addiction.  Generally, by then it is too late and the family's assets are already burned.  The worst case scenario is that some loan shark is in the middle of this.  We have an opportunity here and I will push this as far as I can.  I will resubmit an amendment on Report Stage if it is not accepted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-11a.167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015021100022#JJ00500"><p>I understand what the Minister of State is saying but I back up Senator Craughwell on this point.  The Minister of State mentioned that the Bill is due to be drafted so it is not yet at drafting stage.  None of us can predict when the next election will take place but if the Bill is scheduled for the end of the year and we are getting into election territory, we can be pretty sure it will not happen.</p> <p>We have the announcement of a budget in October, followed by the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill.</p> <p>Senator Maurice Cummins and others, in particular Senator Michael D'Arcy, being from Wexford, will be aware of the work of Ais&eacute;ir&iacute; in dealing with the issue of gambling addiction.  The report it published in 2011 looked at the issue of under-age gambling.  I am not talking about betting but gambling, which is specific and missing from the Bill.  I do not have many concerns about this one legislation; the problem I have is that we were told this would be done in conjunction with a gambling Bill.  We were told a code of conduct would be brought forward, like the one overseen by the Gambling Commission in England, whereby parents could be advised how to block things such as the ones going through to Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's phone, although she is well able to deal with the matter.</p> <p>We need proper advice on how we can levy the gambling industry.  A 1% levy was proposed in 2013, with the money to be used in areas such as education, treatment and research, but that is all gone now.  For me, the betting tax Bill is really about providing a level playing pitch in the case of on-course, online and shop betting.  There is no other great distinction within it, apart from deciding who can have licences and so on.  The really important issue is how we protect people.  Senator Maurice Cummins spoke about kids growing up with the tote in Shelbourne Park or Dundalk and actually putting on a bet.  What the tote wants to happen is for this kid of ten or 11 years to win a bet and say, "Fantastic; I have put down &euro;1 and won &euro;20."  That is how this is triggered in somebody's mind and he or she will then always associate it with gambling through their adult life and it is much more difficult when they are earning money.</p> <p>We also need to look at what we are losing in revenue terms by not properly regulating the sector.  If someone goes to a private gaming club around the corner from here and puts on a bet, he or she will pay at a rate of 23%; the same applies in a gaming arcade.  If he or she were to do the same online, however, he or she would pay zero.  There is no control, no regulation and no help available, bar that from groups such as Ais&eacute;ir&iacute; which is doing work on behalf of the Government, but the problem is getting worse.  In the political cycle we are in I fear that when there is a general election, there will be a new Government in a new D&aacute;il and a new Seanad, with a new list of priorities.  With the best will in the world and despite the work departmental officials have done on this issue, from my information, it appears that work has stopped within the Department and that there is no one available to draft the legislation.  While I hope I am wrong, if it is the case that the legislation has not even been drafted, it is not going to happen.</p> <p>The Seanad could do something, although not, in any way, shape or form, by trying to embarrass the Government.  At the very least, the amendment Senator Gerard P. Craughwell has tabled is a sensible one.  We would be doing a decent service in saying that, while it might not be perfect, we should insert it into the Bill and look at it on Report Stage; otherwise, the Minister of State should give some commitment that he will have a word with the Cabinet and come back to the issue on Report Stage.  We could then say we were going to make it a priority to have a gambling control Bill introduced in the House in the second quarter, or September, and we could make absolutely sure that would happen.  Before Report Stage there might be an opportunity for the Minister of State to give us feedback.  He knows from Members on all sides of the House that there is genuine concern that we are not dealing with the most important issue.  If he was to go back to his senior colleagues in the Government and have the issue discussed at the Cabinet to decide what we need to prioritise, he could come back to us before Report Stage to tell us if it was at all possible to proceed.  However, I am not happy with where we are and will certainly support Senator Gerard P. Craughwell's amendment, which would be helpful.</p></speech>

Some of these fellows exist in the cloud.  The Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, had to amend the Finance Act to make corporations declare a residence, although they had an extra year to decide where they would like to be resident.  In this case, the important point is that we are not quite sure where the gambling organisation is located, but we do know that the customer is in this jurisdiction.  Therefore, one of the ways this issue could be controlled is by saying: "Wherever you are located, you are told that in this jurisdiction there has to be a warning given before a person engages in electronic gambling."  Perhaps it is too strong to draw the parallel, but Al Capone was caught for income tax fraud, rather than for his more nefarious crimes.  Senator Gerard P. Craughwell's amendment would affords the Minister of State an opportunity to control the activity from the customer's end, as well as trying to do so from the producer's end.  I am sure the Government will take the opportunity provided.</p></speech>

I know that they are reinforcing their original contributions which I take as sincere and genuine.  This highlights the degree of frustration felt in trying to have a very important issue placed on the agenda.  In line with Senator Darragh O'Brien's point, I will find out where the Bill is at in the drafting process.  I will seek clarity on the issue before the next Stage.</p>  <p>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell tabled the amendment.  While there is a distinction to be drawn between gambling and betting, it is very hard to have that conversation without introducing wider societal issues, but it is only right to do so as they are interrelated.  We are very familiar with the ter"m putting off until tomorrow what we can do today", but I am going to take back to my colleagues the very clear and loud message I have heard today.  While the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, has specific responsibility for this legislation, there is also a role for the Minister for Justice and Equality.  There is a strong message for the senior Ministers which, no doubt, the Leader of the House will also carry back.  However, we must consider what is practical and achievable within a short period because, given that there is possibly only one more term after this one, we are operating within tight time constraints.  At the same time, however, if we can have clarity on the current position, we will seek to provide it.</p>  <p>Senator Sean D. Barrett addressed a different section, about which there are issues I want to raise at a later stage.</p></speech>

I support the section and support the proposal that if somebody other than a bookmaker represents him or herself as a bookmaker, this should be liable as an offence.  However, I wish to make a point, on the basis of what we have discussed already, that while we are regulating one part of this sector strongly, we are leaving the other side open, for example betting exchanges or similar areas.  I am aware we cannot tackle everything, but the way the industry is growing and the way betting is expanding makes it very difficult to control this area.</p>  <p>I support this section but the irony is not lost that we cannot look at issues such as gambling sites.  Effectively, I could set up a website tomorrow and start taking bets on it.  I could put up an online casino, card games or similar and there is nothing in the way of control.  On the other side, if someone represents himself as a bookmaker and takes a bet off track, he will be hammered.  I do not intend to oppose the section and will not labour the point further, but wanted to put this view on the record.</p></speech>

As we have seen, any bookmaker must apply to a chief superintendent of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a licence and the chief superintendent can check his history to see whether he has behaved well in the past and is a fit person to hold a licence.</p>  <p>This section relates to people who are resident outside the State, whose application for a licence must be made to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Some instances in this regard have been brought to my attention, where some remote operators took a bet from a person, but stopped paying him winnings because there was a gamble on a particular horse or dog.  They refused to pay him and had him investigated by the authorities in England.  This man was cleared of any offence but his name had been dragged through the mud and his payments stopped until he was cleared.  In a normal situation where such an incident occurred and an objection to a licence was made to the chief superintendent, I am sure it would be upheld by the superintendent.  However, in this particular case, the people affected must apply to the Minister.</p>  <p>What is the situation in regard to objections to licences being granted to people like this?  In the case to which I have referred the person in question has brought the matter to a superintendent close to the head office of the operator and also brought it to the attention of Customs and Excise.  He does not want a situation where the person can renew his licence without apologising and making reparation to him for the grievous wrong done to him.  In the case of objections to such licences, what happens in the case of an objection.  The licensee must apply for a renewal of a licence and must advertise within 14 days, in two newspapers, that he is applying for a licence.  What happens with the objection?  Where does it go and what is the situation as a result?</p></speech>

This section sets out the application process for a certificate of personal fitness to hold a bookmaker's license for a person resident outside the State to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  A person seeking a certificate of personal fitness must provide notice in two daily newspapers circulated in the State of his intention to make such an application, between two weeks and one month in advance of making the application.  A period of not later than 56 days is provided within which the certificate is granted or refused.  The section also provides a basis for refusing a certificate and for penalties for making or providing false or misleading statements or information in the course of an application for a certificate.</p>  <p>On the Senator's question regarding whether there is an opportunity for third party objections or where objections should be lodged, I would point out there is a 56 day period of time.  I will find out for the Senator whether the objection should be made to an independent person or whether it should go directly to the Minister or whether the objection should be made at a more local level.  However, there is an adequate period of time before the certificate is granted or refused for an objection to be lodged.  Also, the application is in the public domain for a period of two weeks through the newspapers.  These time periods together should ensure that if there are third party objections they are facilitated.  I will check out how contact is to be made with the appropriate person to lodge an objection.</p>  <p>In the context of the gambling control Bill, the purpose of that Bill is to provide for a regulator.  Perhaps we should have a similar point of contact in regard to this Bill and that bears consideration.</p></speech>

The gambling control Bill has nothing to do with the issue.  The person in question feels wronged and wants to object to the issuing of a licence to a company that will, I am sure, be applying for a licence.  His name was dragged through the mud.</p> <p>His name was dragged through the mud but probably not by the company.  </p> <p>Everybody knew his bets were stopped, that he was not paid and he was investigated.  He has had no recognition by this company of any wrongdoing on its behalf.  I shall outline what I presume he wants to happen within 14 days.  I accept that the Minister of State will come back to me about the matter.  I presume that it is the Minister for Justice and Equality to whom the man will probably have to object directly.  He has written to the Minister.</p> <p>This man is intent on having his name cleared and for the company to clear his name as well.  This is an important issue.  He has gone to great lengths already and he is prepared to go further.  He wants to object to this licence unless there is compensation, apologies or whatever provided but he wants his name cleared.  His name has been cleared by the authorities who look after racing.  I hope the matter can be clarified. </p></speech>

On that occasion I objected, from the staffing point of view and that of everybody else, to bookmakers opening until 9.30 or 10 o'clock at night and the possibility of opening at 7 o'clock in the morning.  I think I have been stifled because the provision was put into the Finance Act before it came back here in the Betting (Amendment) Act.  That shows things can be done fairly fast and moved to various Acts if necessary.  I hope that the points I raised here today about the tote, under age persons, and the machines that are in bookmakers at the moment, will be acted upon as fast as section 25 was opposed.  The provision was put into the Finance Act and I hope my points will be taken on board again and acted upon in as judicious a fashion and as expeditiously as they were in this regard.</p></speech>

I am not as concerned as he would be and just want to say it has been removed to the Finance Act now.  I welcome the fact that we have liberalised opening hours and got up to speed, particularly with regard to some of the major racing festivals, in order to ensure bookmakers are open and can compete with online betting.  I knew Senator Cummins had a large degree of influence on Government.  It has moved mountains and sections of legislation to ensure he did not go overboard which is pretty impressive. </p></speech>

The amendment provides for the penalties that will apply to such an offence.

These sections will prohibit Internet service providers, advertisers or persons promoting products from providing services in the State for unlicensed remote operators.  Revenue may issue compliance notices to these service providers.  The service providers may appeal a compliance notice to the District Court which will either affirm the notice or direct Revenue to withdraw it.

Amendment No. 16 is proposed because there is a need for a broader debate on the betting, horse and greyhound industries.  In my party's view there is a need to make progress towards or for a return to a link between betting duty and racing.  Everyone with whom my party has discussed this issue is up for holding such a debate.  More broadly, there are issues around why online betting has not been subject to VAT all these years and why other forms of gambling do not attract duty.  A report, as requested in the amendment, would be a starting point.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 17 would be a means to seek a debate on statistical data on the issue of applying betting duty to the punter, as opposed to the bookie.  This would be a return to an older way of doing things.  There has been a misrepresentation of what my party has proposed with regard to betting duty.  For example, in our alternative budget we stated the preference would be for placing the levy on the punter.</p></speech>

I suggested earlier that we were going to find out what the position was in the drafting of the Bill; therefore, I will leave that matter until then.</p>  <p>On amendment No. 16, I imagine Sinn F&eacute;in would support the tax revenue going towards funding the horse and greyhound industries, which are very important flagship industries for the country.  Many appreciate the fact that the money is going to fund world-class industries.  There is merit in the proposal to review the legislation, particularly in the context of what we discussed earlier.

We debated this issue in November and one of the Government backbenchers in my county sent me an email on the decision made at the time.  Appropriately, he had been photographed beside the statue of a horse, as the email announced that the horse and greyhound fund was being increased by 26% to &euro;68 million, of which 80% was to go to the horse racing industry.  That is a subsidy to everyone who attends a horse race meeting of &euro;54 and to everybody who attends a dog race meeting of &euro;12.60.  In the same period the SILC report shows that we have reduced disposable income for every child in the country by &euro;3,300.  That is a 16% reduction in what people have to spend on children and a 26% increase in expenditure on horses and dogs.  It is a totally inappropriate set of priorities.</p>  <p>I am delighted this issue is to be discussed.  When the fund was first established by the late Albert Reynolds, there was approximately &pound;3 million for horse racing and &pound;500,000 for dog racing.  The fund was capped over its lifetime, subject to a ministerial change.  It was never intended to exceed &euro;200 million, but we are now spending that much every three years.  It is not the cap from 1992 which was expected to prevail over the entire lifetime of the fund, subject to a major review of the legislation.</p></speech>

I also welcome representatives of NABCO, Threshold and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to the Visitors Gallery.  I also note the presence in the Visitors Gallery of Mr. Tom Dunne, a former chairman of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, and the Commission on the Private Rented Sector in 1999 and 2000.  <br/><br/>As everyone is aware, we are facing a housing crisis, although there is light at the end of the tunnel.  The Government has published a number of strategies in this regard.  It has published a strategy to kick-start the construction sector with Construction 2020, an ambitious strategy to end long-term homelessness by 2016, and the social housing strategy which will prove, in time, to be the key in the recovery of the social rented sector which has been neglected for some time.  However, it would be fair to say we do not have a strategy for the private rented sector.  <br/><br/>In 2004 we passed the Residential Tenancies Act which was considered to be cutting-edge legislation at the time and which changed the rental market in Ireland substantially by providing for a degree of security of tenure.  It provided for the establishment of the PRTB, which aims to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  It also provided for the registration system we have in place today, under which approximately 85% of landlords are registered with the PRTB.  I accept that the 2004 legislation was momentous and replaced the system under which the most a tenant could hope for in the absence of a lease was 28 days notice.  That said, the legislation is more than a decade old and the situation in Ireland has changed very significantly since.  One in five families today live in private rented housing.  That number rises to one in four in Dublin and one in three in Galway.  Effectively, the private rented sector doubled in size between 2006 and 2011 and is predicted to increase to 25% of the housing market before the end of the decade.  <br/><br/>The motion is a composite one covering both the private rented and social housing sectors.  My colleague Senator Denis Landy will deal with the social housing aspects.  I will focus my attention on where we need to go in reforming the private rented sector.  <br/><br/>We must face the reality that renting is a long-term scenario for many Irish people.  That point was made starkly recently when there was a lot of media attention focused on new Central Bank rules put in place to ensure people did not sign up to mortgages that they could not afford.  The aim of the rules is to ensure we do not go back to the housing bubble we saw in the past.  In reality, the new rules mean that many people are facing a future in which they will not be able to enter into home ownership.  Additionally, we have traditionally looked to the private rented sector to house lower income tenants who have not been able to access social housing.  We now have a scenario where 32% of the entire private rented sector is being subsidised by the State through the rent supplement system.  We have had a failure for many years to address the issues in the social rented sector, most of which is the responsibility of local authorities.  We have seen a very significant increase in the numbers on housing waiting lists, particularly since the early 1990s.  This has meant the private rented sector has become a long-term housing option for those who are dependent on the State for housing through the rent supplement system.  In reality, generation rent has become the future many face today, regardless of their preference.<br/><br/>While it is not within the remit of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the issue of rent supplement and rent caps is one which needs to be addressed urgently.  Rents are rising spectacularly, particularly in urban areas and most notably in Dublin, but the rent caps have not risen to reflect this reality.  Unfortunately, we are seeing instances of people being economically evicted or forced into homeless services because rent caps do not enable them to either keep or seek rental accommodation.  This issue must be addressed.  However, as a country, we cannot continue to follow the market, particularly in a situation where there is a serious lack of supply.  Therefore, I ask the Government to consider very seriously the idea of rent regulation.  <br/><br/>A number of European countries have strong and robust private rental sectors that provide for significant security of tenure and higher standards of accommodation than here.  There has been a lack of focus on the private rented sector.  Until recently, it was the norm to accept poor standards of accommodation.  There has also been a failure to regulate some of the worst excesses of the market.  In particular, we have seen cases of people who are ostensibly in secure accommodation under the legislation but whose landlords are now claiming that they require the accommodation for family members or that they need to sell it.  This means that people are effectively losing what little security of tenure they have.  <br/><br/>Ireland is effectively an outlier in terms of regulation, particularly with regard to rents.  Through the 2004 Residential Tenancies Act, we have a measure of rent regulation in that rents can only be increased once annually to market levels.  However, we are in a scenario where rents are spiralling out of control in many areas, particularly in Dublin, and organisations such as Threshold and the Society of the St. Vincent de Paul are reporting that clients are facing rent increases of between 30% and 50%.  We must address the issue of unaffordable rent increases that bear no resemblance to the cost of providing accommodation.  I appreciate that work is being done by organisations such as Threshold, of which I am chair, in providing the tenancy protection service, but in reality rents continue to rise and rent caps do not resolve the issue.  Dealing with it on a case by case basis, as is the strategy, is not solving the problem.  Therefore, we need a rent system to provide certainty.  Rent increases must be reasonable and predictable if the private rented sector is to function properly.  There must be a real option for individuals and families to make a home in the private rented sector.  Families need to know that their children will be able to attend the same school in 12 months time if they are to put down real roots in a community.  <br/><br/>Many arguments have been made against the idea of introducing a rent certainty model, particularly about its constitutionality.  However, there is sufficient evidence, including in the recent DKM report, to suggest the constitutionality of what is known as third generation rent regulation would not be an issue in the Irish context.  The argument was also made in the aforementioned DKM report that rent controls might drive landlords out of the market.  However, we see that countries where there is greater regulation of the private rented sector and where there are rent controls such as the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France and so forth actually have much larger private rented sectors than here.  We are dealing with a housing market that is very volatile and unpredictable.  It can be argued that predictability is actually very good for investment in the sector in the longer run.  We have a scenario where landlords can charge what they want, which means that we are dealing with a market that is effectively out of control.  Having certainty would be in everyone's interests.  If the market were to become more stable, there would be fewer instances of tenants over-holding.</p> <p>Tenants cannot afford to pay new levels of rent and as a result they remain in a property because there is no option for them to move out or to move anywhere else.  In the long run it does not favour landlords who are no longer getting any form of rent.  Often it could be some years before a tenant may be moved out of a property.  I know this issue will be addressed in the residential tenancies (amendment) (No. 2) Bill but a predictable market is good for landlords and tenants.  In recent decades we have seen the Irish housing market rise and fall and at the end of the day we do not appear to have learned the lesson that stability in the market is better in the longer run for the overall market and for landlords and tenants.</p> <p>The quality of rented accommodation is an issue.  Some 58% of the almost 18,000 private rented dwellings that underwent initial inspections by local authorities in 2013 were found to be below minimum standards.  The 2013 figures also reveal that no inspections were carried out and no inspection data were provided to the Minister of State's Department by 31 out of the 87 local authorities while other authorities only carried out a handful of inspections.  The bottom line is that we have a scenario where those figures are not improving significantly in spite of the fact that more resources have been made available by local authorities to inspect rented properties.  I suggest we need an NCT for rented housing.  A landlord should not be entitled to rent out property that does not have a certificate of fitness and it should be an automatic offence to do so.  With the proposed introduction of the housing assistance payment this would be a good way for local authorities to deal with the scenario where many properties do not meet minimum standards and they have difficulty in enforcing the additional law.  </p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of the deposition protection scheme and seek some clarification on it.  The unlawful retention of deposits is still a major cause of disputes in the sector and has resulted in tenants, effectively, becoming homeless or remaining in substandard properties.  We have a situation where there is a significant amount of arrears of mortgages in the buy to let market and receivers of rented properties are receiving rent but are not undertaking any of the obligations of the landlord.  We need to have a change in the law that puts receivers into the shoes of landlords where they are receiving rent and it should be their responsibility to ensure that repairs are carried out.</p> <p>I do not think any Government has had such a complexity of housing challenges.  We have dealt with the international financial crisis, fuelled in this country by an unsustainable housing market bubble, the collapse of the banking system, the deep level of housing debt and negative equity which has not washed through the system yet, rising repossessions and homelessness, all of which are major challenges.  The bailout programme has restricted our ability as a Government to act in this area.  However, we see some light at the end of the tunnel and we must use this opportunity wisely if we are to avoid making the same mistakes.  Our social housing strategy is relying on the private rented sector.  Some 75,000 of the units under the social housing strategy are to be delivered through the private rented sector particularly through the housing assistance payment, HAP, which I believe will be an important step forward for tenants in that they will be enabled to work and pay rent according to their means.  If that strategy is to work properly it must link with the private rented sector strategy.  The private rented sector needs substantial reform if it is to be a long-term housing option in terms of security of tenure, certainty around rent and absolute guarantees of appropriate standards of accommodation.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  While I will deal with some aspects of social housing I wish to make a few general points.</p>  <p>Currently there are more than 300,000 people living in private rented accommodation.  This Government, unlike previous Governments, is tackling the problem and intends to tackle it for the remainder of its term of office.  Government policy aims to provide short-term and long-term rental opportunities to citizens in an attractive way.  It is true that the tradition for Irish people is to own their own homes.  This probably goes back to colonial times and the fear of being put off the land or put out of the house.  That is a historical fact.  We are at odds with statistics in the European Union although we are catching up.  In Europe, 80% of people rent and 20% of people own their homes.  Our statistics are the other way around at 60:40.  There is a recognition by many people in Ireland that due to economic circumstances they will end up renting on a long-term basis, therefore, we need to deal with the issues that surround the rental market.  Some work has been done and I acknowledge the 2004 Act which put in place provisions on a four year tenancy and rent reviews.  The 2012 Bill aims to establish protection for deposits and to deal with non-payment of rent.  It also aims to extend the obligations on these issues to approved housing bodies.  The Residential Tenancies Act provides that rents may only be reviewed once per year.  However, rents have increased nationally between 2013 and 2014 by almost 6% and in Dublin by almost 10%.  While tenants must be given 28 days notice and allowed an appeal to the Private Residential Tenancies Board the difficulty is that many tenants, particularly in rural areas, know very little about the private residential tenancies board and their rights and, therefore, on a daily basis, as politicians we are encountering people who are being denied their rights and are bullied and told they have to pay increased rents.  As Senator Aideen Hayden has said some literally end up out on the street because they cannot afford the rent.  They cannot seek rent subsidy as many are employed in what appears to be gainful employment but the bottom line is that they do not have the money for rent.</p>  <p>The Government is trying to improve the situation and is working towards reducing the number of people on waiting lists.  The Government's social housing strategy aims to provide 35,000 social houses over six years and support 75,000 households to attain private rented accommodation, mainly through the housing assistance payment.  In 2015 alone we will see 7,000 new social houses and almost 8,500 units secured through HAP, involving an investment of more than &euro;800 million.  I am glad the State will return to the central role of providing social housing.  </p>  <p>I took note of the amendment tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il which is basically a criticism of Government policy in the main.  I look back to the time I was a public representative at local government level where year on year no house was built in County Tipperary by a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  Suddenly, its amendment is a criticism of the efforts by this Government to address the 90,000 people it abandoned and allowed to go on housing lists across the State.  I welcome amendments to motions but I do not welcome a naked criticism by people who did nothing about the problem when in charge of the ball for 14 years.</p>  <p>In 2014 the Government provided 6,000 units of social housing.  Almost 6,000 houses have been identified by NAMA as of December 2014.  It is a pity Fianna F&aacute;il would not do some research.  The reality is that 2,200 of those houses are in demand by local authorities.  The houses are in areas where there is no demand by local authorities and, therefore, in many cases the houses are useless in dealing with the current housing crisis.  The Government recognises the problems surrounding the private rental sector, as outlined so eloquently by Senator Aideen Hayden.  It also recognises the need to come centre stage in terms of the provision of social housing.  That is what the Government is going to do - 7,000 new units are being provided in 2015 and 8,500 units are being provided through HAP, an investment of &euro;800 million.  If Fianna F&aacute;il can match that from its historical experience for people who need housing I will accept and support its amendment.</p></speech>

To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following: <blockquote>&ldquo;notes that: <blockquote>- the lack of housing supply is causing serious distortions in the property market; <br /><br />- the dramatic increase in rents and the failure to increase rent supplement supports have put many individuals and families at serious risk of homelessness; and <br /><br />- 90,000 persons are currently on the social housing waiting lists around the country; </blockquote>further notes that: <blockquote>- the rent caps under the Rent Supplement Scheme and the Housing Assistance Payment scheme are too low for adequate accommodation in the current rental market, particularly in urban areas; <br /><br />- levels of investment in new social housing units envisaged under Construction 2020 and the Social Housing Strategy 2020 are inadequate to meet the demand for social housing and to significantly reduce waiting lists; <br /><br />- the &euro;2.2bn in social housing spending over the next three years is at the same spending levels as 2009 despite the number of persons on social housing waiting lists being 33% greater this year; <br /><br />- the &euro;1.5bn in actual exchequer funding over three years will yield around 10,000 social housing units, far short of what is actually needed; <br /><br />- to date, only 518 housing units under the control of NAMA have been designated as social housing and transferred to local authorities, despite the fact that ten times that amount has been identified by NAMA as suitable; </blockquote>and<blockquote>calls on the Government to:<blockquote>- utilise &euro;1bn from the Strategic Investment Fund to immediately initiate a local authority home building programme;<br /><br />- urgently review rent caps under Rent Supplement Scheme and the Housing Assistance Payment to take account of current market trends and increase rent allowance limits to meet the market value of rents in the private sector;<br /><br />- allow families on waiting lists to move into vacant homes and defray the costs of refurbishing them from future rent;<br /><br />- develop Voluntary Housing Associations to a scale where they can access credit and start to build on their own initiative; and<br /><br />- establish NAMA transfer units in local authorities to accelerate the transfer of NAMA properties that have been identified as suitable for immediate use as social housing units to local authority control.&rdquo;</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>I thank the Labour Party for tabling this important motion on the ongoing crisis in the housing sector, both private and State.  My party has consistently highlighted the failure of the Government to take real action to meets its own pledges - not ours or historic pledges - to end homelessness in 2016.  We believe the Government's ambition is unachievable with the resources that have been made available.  Meanwhile, a vicious combination of harsh social welfare cuts and escalating rents in Dublin have driven increasing numbers of people onto the streets.  This is not just Fianna F&aacute;il's analysis.  <i>The Irish Times</i>reported that Fr. Peter McVerry described the Government's plans to provide 35,000 new social housing units by 2020 and end homelessness by 2016 as &quot;fantasy&quot; at a two-day housing conference attended by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, which ended yesterday.  Fr. McVerry stated that families are being forced to sleep on the streets due to concurrent crises in the private rental and social housing sectors, and he dismissed the Government's ambition to eradicate homelessness by 2016 as unachievable with currently available resources.  This is an individual whose opinions on housing are highly respected.<br/><br/>I note the Minister has committed to providing &euro;1.5 billion in guaranteed up-front Exchequer investment from 2015 to 2017.  That is welcome.  The Government also intends to develop a new housing public-private partnership worth &euro;300 million and to make available up to &euro;400 million in public investment in a new housing finance entity to leverage further substantial private investment.  This is a very ambitious programme but it seems those who operate at ground level do not believe the Government's promise to attack the issue.<br/><br/>In a spirit of positivity, I will make some suggestions that might be helpful.  There has been much talk about rent control.  Senator Hayden pointed out that rent control was found to be unconstitutional in the 1980s.  However, the Senator also referred to the various regulatory regimes that operate in other European countries.  The Government should investigate these regimes.  The old system was replaced with flexible limits which balanced the interests of landlords and tenants.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's comments in that regard.<br/><br/>On the issue of releasing land for housing, this should be based on the campaign slogan for the post offices, namely, use it or lose it.  There is merit in the argument that planning legislation should include strong and enforceable incentives to ensure land that is bought for house building and that has planning permission is used within a set timeframe.  There has been talk about doing this but there was little action.  Particularly in Dublin, where the crisis is more acute, it would go a long way if we unlocked lands held up by greedy developers who are waiting for land values to rise further.  We went through this previously and the lessons should have been learned.<br/><br/>Clearly we need to build more houses.  Not-for-profit housing associations could play a greater role in building houses for vulnerable citizens, primarily because they are able to access public funding that would be off the State's balance sheet via the Housing Agency.  I understand South Dublin County Council is examining a proposal to establish a housing trust, which would in effect be an arm's length building company able to borrow money from the Housing Finance Authority.<br/><br/>Rents should be made more affordable and, therefore, rent caps should be increased.  The Minister for Social Protection has expressed opposition to increasing the rent allowance on the grounds that it would drive up rents.  However, the rent allowance has not been increased over the last 12 months whereas rents have increased significantly in the Dublin area.  It is not necessarily a case of one following the other in that regard.  I welcome that the Dublin region homelessness executive is working with the Department of Social Protection to give community welfare officers the ability to increase rent supplement on a case-by-case basis.<br/><br/>A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>asked the interesting question of whether NAMA can help to solve the housing crisis.  It is possible that will go some way towards doing that.  When NAMA began its work in 2010 it inherited a stock of approximately 15,000 housing units.  Senator Landy noted that 2,854 of these units were deemed unsuitable or were located in areas for which there was no demand.  However, I understand all of these units have since been sold or let to the private sector.  Even though they may not have been attractive to local authorities because of their location, somehow the private sector has picked them up.  Demand for more than 2,000 units was confirmed by local authorities, while a further 500 were still under consideration as of last year.  NAMA was one of more than 50 groups attending meetings with the Minister, Deputy Kelly, last week to explore measures aimed at alleviating homelessness in the capital.<br/><br/>In regard to new builds, I am pleased that recent revisions to Part V provisions in the Planning and Development Act 2000 require that 10% of any development must be social housing, as distinct from the original provision which allowed developers to wriggle out of their obligations by giving cash to local authorities.  I hope this new requirement will be strictly enforced.  <br/><br/>In regard to NAMA's continuing involvement in alleviating the housing crisis, I understand the Government has given it a residential mandate that will involve construction of 4,500 units in the greater Dublin area by next year and possibly an additional 20,000 across the country in the next five years.  If one applies the 10% rule to these numbers, it will mean a further 2,500 social housing units.  This would make NAMA an important player in delivering the Government's plans to have 35,000 units ready by 2020.  NAMA's involvement in building these properties means that cash strapped local authorities will not have to bear the up-front capital costs of construction.  That burden will rest with NAMA and it will enter into long leases with approved housing bodies, which will have an option to purchase the properties concerned two thirds of the way through the lease.  To finance this work, NAMA intends to package the leases and sell them on to pension funds with an attractive net yield of approximately 5%.  That is very positive and I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on NAMA's role in alleviating the housing crisis.<br/><br/>Ultimately, however, the reality of this Government's commitment is that more than 90,000 households are on social housing waiting and 2,600 people are homeless, of whom 200 are sleeping rough.  It has not yet delivered on its promises and there is a moral obligation on it to achieve the objectives it has set out.</p></speech>

I compliment the Labour Party on tabling a Private Member's motion on a most important topic for our people.  I concur with Senator Hayden that there has been a failure of policy over many years.  We have reached the stage where there is over reliance on the private sector to resolve the issue.  That is not going to happen.  We should examine the past to see where the various mistakes were made.  The property bubble began in 1996 with the introduction of the coastal resort schemes.  I had investigated whether the schemes would be a good investment.</p> <p>The developers added the tax break to the price of the house.  Given that everybody thought they would get a bigger tax break, houses that would have been bought for approximately &euro;150,000 were suddenly priced at &euro;375,000 with the tax break.  This inflation of house prices was enormously damaging.</p> <p>We were involved in many of the section 23 projects which were introduced in the early 1980s.  An investor who bought a section 23 property could write off all the interest against his or her tax bill and the capital cost over 10 years.  While doing that, we were starting to deprive people who were struggling to get on the property ladder by reducing the tax breaks on their mortgages.  I could never understand it, and at a parliamentary party meeting I argued that it did not make sense.  I have enumerated many examples of such failure of public service thinking and experience regarding what needed to be done.  I place some responsibility on our &ldquo;permanent government&rdquo; and some on the governments in power.</p> <p>I would have thought that after four years in office, the Government would soon start to take some responsibility for some of the shortcomings and failures of its policies, certainly in the housing area.  I left local government in 2004, and throughout my time on Wexford County Council and New Ross Town Council I took a particular interest in housing.  We had a building programme there and when I left, there were no hard cases waiting to be accommodated in council housing.  The lists were practically exhausted.  I accept the fair criticism that in the subsequent years at the height of the Celtic tiger we built too many houses and apartments and not enough council houses.  I never accepted Peter Bacon's analysis that increasing supply until it exceeded demand would correct house price inflation.  As Senator Landy said, while supply and demand is a principle of economics, housing is more than just an economic unit.  It is a social necessity.  There is an historic link, because of our history, to owning property.  Home ownership is a legitimate aspiration in any country, and we had achieved more than 80%.  This figure is decreasing and no policies have been put in place to address the fallout from it.  I am particularly critical of this.</p> <p>The Minister of State's father, who served on Waterford County Council, would be aware that we had a good, solid house-building programme year in year out at a time when the fiscal position was no better - and for many years worse - than it is today.  However, we committed to building houses and provided tenant purchase schemes so people could acquire them.  I established a housing co-operative in New Ross which brought together people in council houses with people on the council housing lists and dealt exclusively with them.  In two schemes, we accommodated 25 people.  People who were on the priority list and who had not been able to access home ownership were able to do it.</p> <p>I would like to return to the debate because the time allocated is inadequate.  It is a very important issue and I commend the Labour Party on proposing the motion.  I hope, by the end of the evening, we might decide to adjourn the debate to another evening when more time could be given and people can talk more.  We must address the issue and concentrate on constructing local authority houses.  There is a waiting list of 90,000 and at the current rate of 3,000 per year it will take 30 years to accommodate some of those people.  We have an issue in the private rented market.  I have reservations about rent supplement.  I have seen how it has escalated and become a burden on the Exchequer and I am not sure it is not a major contributory factor in rising rents.  It needs to be closely examined.  I am conscious that I am in injury time.</p></speech>

In the 1980s in my town we licensed a developer to build on land the council owned and sell the houses.  The council played a part in ensuring the prices were affordable.  Many of these issues that could be pivotal in trying to address the existing crisis, and, let us face it, it is a crisis.</p></speech>

It is important we keep it on the agenda.  Housing remains a key priority for the Government and for the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, which I am sure he will say himself.  The supply of affordable houses in areas where they are needed is also a key objective.  The Government has been reformist in its housing proposals with the Construction 2020 strategy and the introduction of legislation that deals with three major strands of housing policy.  The legislation provides a legislative basis for the housing assistance payment.  We all know how it worked initially.  It has been introduced, I can see it working already and it is welcome.  The legislation also provides for the new tenant purchase scheme for local authorities and the reform process for the termination of local authority tenancies.  This important housing legislation has brought one of the most radical reforms of public housing support, which has been badly needed for decades.</p>  <p>It has long been accepted that the rent supplement system was not fit for purpose and it has changed.  Construction 2020, which was announced last year, contains 75 initiatives.  For many reasons, including the economic climate, one cannot implement all the initiatives in a day and the strategy has been in place for less than a year.  The 75 initiatives will invigorate the construction sector and meet some of the demand in the housing sector where there is a major shortfall, particularly in the Dublin area.  Last May, the Government announced an additional investment of &euro;200 million.  It came from a very narrow purse that had not been available heretofore.  Some &euro;50 million was announced for social housing and &euro;35 million for disabled housing adaptation.  As well as all the negatives, we must reiterate the positive measures, which have all happened in one year.</p>  <p>Many developers are in NAMA and are eager and waiting to get going.  They did not go into NAMA by their own volition.  We are trying to get them there because they are anxious and eager to start building.  Some 35,000 units of social housing will be supplied by 2020, as the Minister said on a previous occasion.  The needs of a further 75,000 households will be met through the housing assistance payment and the rental accommodation scheme and the Government has, on more than one occasion, enunciated its plan for how to accommodate the 90,000 households on the waiting list.  The Minister might comment on the Dublin social housing delivery task force and the plans to deal with the 31,000 households that are on the waiting lists of the four Dublin local authorities and the national plan to supply the 35,000 social housing units.  In Dublin, 655 vacant units were identified.  We are working through them by the month using the refurbishment grant and 245 of them have been put back in action while the remaining 410 units will be returned to the supply over the coming months.</p> <p>That is also to be welcomed.  The &euro;2.2 billion was announced in budget 2015 to kick-start that project.  Again all this costs money.  We are bound by EU rules and have to meet our development needs in other areas also.  Supplying 35,000 units by 2020 will cost &euro;3.8 billion and we have to ensure we do that strategically.</p> <p>Senator Hayden spoke about rent caps, which have been introduced in other countries.  One has introduced rent caps in areas particularly where there is huge supply and one will not end up with a monopoly situation so that is one thing.  The Minister of State will probably comment on that.  It brings its problems as well as its values.  In recent months the average rent increased by more than 4.8% and it has increased greatly in Dublin in particular.  This is down to lack of supply and until that lack of supply is addressed, rents will increase because developers and private landowners will have a monopoly.</p> <p>New Central Bank regulations will apply a 90% loan to value limit for first-time buyers.  We need to keep an eye on that to ensure that people who want to buy can buy and that we do not have more people added to the housing lists through no fault of their own.  When I bought my house there was a limit of 2.5 times earnings.  It was unsustainable to have money thrown around like confetti when people seeking money for a house were offered money for a car as well.  We do not want to go back to that housing model that was predicated on ever-rising house prices.</p> <p>Are ten minutes gone already?</p></speech>

Waiting lists for social housing had increased but are now on the way down.  We have to ensure they are reduced further.  Again it is down to supply.  Another Senator mentioned NAMA.  NAMA has come up trumps and has, particularly in the Dublin area, offered more than the local authorities have taken up.</p>  <p>We have done something in the private rented sector.  However, the Minister of State must ensure that the private rented sector is fit for purpose and that the accommodation is fit for families.  The rent cap is important and the Minister of State has spoken about it here.</p></speech>

I thank Senators Hayden and Landy for tabling this motion.  I also thank my colleagues for the amendments they tabled which allow us to have a wider and richer debate.<br/><br/>When I first saw the motion I thought of the 150 families with children in emergency hotel accommodation, the majority of whom have been forced out of the private rental sector by spiralling rents.  Effectively they have been economically evicted.  We have to be very conscious of that reality.  Aside from the massive cost to the State, this hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation is completely inappropriate.  It is very disruptive for families and children, who may have to move schools as a result, and raises serious child welfare and safety concerns.<br/><br/>In this regard, I call on the Government to immediately child and family proof all forms of emergency accommodation, and to co-ordinate with the Child and Family Agency and emergency accommodation staff to ensure child protection concerns are addressed.  It is increasingly of concern to me.<br/><br/>Moving to the substantive issue before us today, we have an acute crisis.  It is not just a homelessness crisis but a housing crisis, which itself is creating the perfect storm for homelessness.  The current housing crisis is two-fold.  First, as several colleagues have said, there is a shortage in the social housing sector with 90,000 individuals and families on local authority waiting lists across Ireland.  Second, there is a serious lack of affordability and security of tenure in the private rental sector, exacerbated by an absence of rent regulation, a rent supplement scheme completely out of sync with actual rental prices in urban areas, and an absence of legislative measures to prohibit landlords from discriminating against tenants in receipt of rent supplement. <br/><br/>I welcome the commitment under the Social Housing Strategy 2020 to deliver 35,000 social homes over the next five years.  However, I remain concerned about the adequacy of this response since I understand that we need a minimum of 10,000 new social housing units annually to meet both the growing demand and extensive backlog.  I do not understand how the Government plans to deliver 75,000 secure homes in the private rental sector since that sector too is in serious crisis with too much demand, too little supply, and insufficient security of tenure.  In the absence of any rent regulation it is essentially a monopoly market with rents and market rates being dictated exclusively by landlords.<br/><br/>Considerable attention has been paid to the recommendation of the DKM Economic Consultants' report on rent stability in the private rented sector, prepared on behalf of the Private Residential Tenancies Board in September 2014.  It stated that the introduction of rent control in Ireland would have a negative impact on tenants and the sector in general with tens of thousands of rental properties exiting the system.<br/><br/>This contention has been rejected by a number of organisations working in the housing sector and the economist, Professor P.J. Drudy, from Trinity College Dublin, who argue that there is no evidence of a mass exodus of landlords from private rental systems in European countries such as France, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and Holland, where second-generation rent regulation has been in place for many years.  I am not speaking of rent control which is arbitrary and disproportionate.  I am talking about rent regulation, which offers protection and security to tenants while allowing landlords to earn a reasonable profit.  In that regard Senator Craughwell has tabled an amendment.  While he used the term &quot;rent control&quot;, I believe that may be changed.  I indicate to the Cathaoirleach that I am willing to second his amendment if the changes are accepted.<br/><br/>Another option is third-generation rent regulation where rent is linked to the cost of inflation or the consumer price index with scope to increase rent in line with improvements to properties.  The standard of private rented accommodation is extremely low.  Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government statistics found that 47% of private rented accommodation nationally was substandard and in one county 100% of properties did not comply with the standards.  The difficulty here and with the introduction of any form of rent regulation is agreeing the starting point market rate since the current market rate is extortionate.<br/><br/>Those proposing the introduction of rent regulation do not contest the position, often cited by Government, that arbitrary and disproportionate rent control would be unconstitutional as per the judgment in Blake <i>v</i>. the Attorney General 1982.  However, we do argue that there is no constitutional impediment to the introduction of rent regulations since property rights can be proportionately restricted in the interests of the common good where there is a pressing social need.  This is supported by the report of the constitutional review group 1996 and the DKM report, if it is proportionate.  That is what we are arguing for.<br/><br/>The Supreme Court in the Blake case acknowledged that the Oireachtas would have to legislate to fill the gap.  There was an attempt to do so through the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill 1981, which was referred by the President to the Supreme Court and struck down as unconstitutional because it repeated the failings highlighted in the Blake case that any permanent freeze on rents amounts to an arbitrary and disproportionate interference with property rights. <br/><br/>Particularly for young people, including couples, living in Dublin and other urban areas where house prices are continuing to rise, the new mortgage rules on minimum deposits will exclude many from buying their own property.  For them, the only viable option is to rent.  We must amend the Residential Tenancy Act 2004 to ensure greater security of tenure for these people.<br/><br/>Under the provisions of the current Act, tenants enter into a Part 4 tenancy after renting for six months.  This should provide them with security for four years before going back to scratch.  However, in reality landlords can end a Part 4 tenancy in a number of ways including: if a tenant cannot meet a rent increase; if a landlord intends to sell the property within three months; or if a landlord intends to change the use of the dwelling.</p> <p>I rented for three years in Belgium.  The only way my landlord could get me to vacate the property is if my landlord needed the place to live there personally.  We need rent regulation and the Government must re-examine the concerns it says it has on it.  Its members must go out and talk to people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-11a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Moloney" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015021100032#XX00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take our motion today and Senators Hayden and Landy for spearheading this on behalf of the Labour Party.  The fact that we are in government does not mean we do not use any available opportunity to highlight an issue that has become a crisis.  I want to speak on the issue of rent allowance and HAP and the dependency of the unemployed and low-paid workers on rent supplement or the rent allowance.  Without such support from the Government, there is no way they could afford private rental accommodation.  Rent is going up all the time.  People simply cannot afford it.</p>  <p>At the moment approximately 71,000 people are in receipt of rent supplement.  The Government allocated &euro;344 million to rent supplement in 2014, with a commitment of &euro;297 million for rent supplement in 2015.  That is in addition to the &euro;20 million funding that has been given to the Minister of State's Department for the HAP scheme.  Having said that, and others have spoken about it here, there are areas of the country where the cap is just too restrictive.  I can speak about this because I come from Killarney, where private rental accommodation is very expensive.  There is a demand within the private sector and landlords know they will get the rent from those who are working and who can afford to pay it.  They can shove people in receipt of rent supplement out in the cold.  These people are then forced to go out into rural areas, where the rent is lower and may be within the cap.  That could entail the children moving school, which is a big issue if a child is settled into a school.  The child might be in fourth or fifth class and have to move.  The parents might have to move and might not want to tell the children why, that they simply cannot afford the rent in urban areas.  It means they probably have to get a car, which they would not really have needed if they continued to live in the town.  They are in and out because of after-school activities the children are involved in.  There is a huge increase in cost for people having to move out the country.</p>  <p>By having the cap so low in areas like that, we are encouraging under-the-counter payments to landlords because people want to stay in a house.  They know that if they had another &euro;50 a week, they could meet it, so they give it in cash and clear the cap amount for the rent supplement.  That is why I welcome the movement to the HAP scheme.  It is a housing issue, and it should all be within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  As I have been a spokesperson on social protection and this comes under that, I have been keeping a close eye on it.  I have often raised it at the Oireachtas committee with regard to the caps and it seems to be falling on deaf ears among the officials in the Department, but rent supplement is one of the biggest deterrents to taking up employment for its recipients.  Who can blame them?  Taking up employment would result in the loss of their rent supplement, making them believe they are better off unemployed.  That is why I welcome the move to HAP, because this operates as a differential rent scheme, just as if one were in a local authority house.</p>  <p>I have been following the progress of HAP in the areas where it has been rolled out and I will give an update on what I have found out about the HAP.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 was enacted on 28 July 2014.  HAP was being introduced on a phased basis.  Subsequently HAP wave one commencements took effect from 15 September in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council, and from 1 October in Louth County Council, Kilkenny County Council, South Dublin County Council and Monaghan County Council.  To date, 783 customers have transferred to HAP.  Numbers are increasing at a significant rate following an initial settling-in period for the local authorities.  There is a target to achieve 8,400 HAP cases in 2015, as set out in the Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform.  A HAP homelessness pilot was commenced on 18 December 2014.  Dublin City Council will administer the pilot on behalf of the other Dublin local authorities and will specifically target homeless households.  For the information of Members, I have a breakdown by county of the HAP recipients: Cork County Council has 123, Kilkenny County Council has 188, Limerick City and County Council has 270, Louth County Council has 73, Monaghan County Council has 29, Waterford City and County Council has 76 and South Dublin County Council has 34, which is a total of 783.  We need to move a little faster and roll this out to all the areas around Ireland.  I want it in Kerry and I am sure other Senators want it in their counties and their areas, because people can go back to work and not be in fear of losing their rent supplement.  They will pay their rent according to their income.  This is a great idea and I wish we could roll it out to as many counties as possible.</p>  <p>I would like to mention just one small issue, if the Cathaoirleach would indulge me.  I have a number of women who are subjects of domestic violence and have had to leave their family homes.  While they will get the rent supplement because the officials are a bit lenient and can use some discretion, they will not get a local authority house while their name is still on the family home and we are forcing them to give up their right to the family home.  It is an issue that is probably for another day's debate, but I would like to bring it to the attention of the Minister of State.</p></speech>

It is something that should be looked at from a housing allocation viewpoint.  Tonight's motion is very important.  Like Senator Walsh, I commend the Labour Party on tabling it.  It is a crisis in our time when we hear of people being unable to pay the rent bill at the end of the month and remain in their own house, particularly here in Dublin.  According to CSO medium-term projections, 10,000 additional families will be living in Dublin every year, with only 2,000 additional housing units.  That is a net shortfall of 8,000 units per year.  Even if we do nothing, there will be a lack of supply.</p>  <p>I was looking through figures on Ireland's history in developing housing policy, from Independence back in 1921.  The figures are interesting because it shows that when we broke from Britain in 1921, Irish housing policy focused predominantly on providing social housing based on the British model, but the difference was that we provided our social housing on an asset welfare basis.  In other words, while the house was provided, the objective was that it would ultimately lead to home ownership.  In addition, the majority of those houses were built in rural areas and a perceived value for money was obtained.  We broke from that tradition, unfortunately, four or five years ago, when the focus was on the urbanisation of social housing.  There is a real need for housing in Dublin and urban areas, and I will get to that in a moment, but it was a retrograde step to break from that policy and not to allow people the opportunity of building a home in rural areas.</p> <p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has now effectively adopted the British policy, where all of the focus for the provision of social housing is in urban areas.  While this may deal with the issue of equity, it does not deal with efficiency, for example, in cases where an individual has a plot of land that could be made available for building.  A house or houses could be built more cheaply on that land than in an urban area where the land must be bought by the local authority.  The Department needs to look at this option.  We no longer have the old council cottages as councils do not receive funding for them and applications are no longer accepted.  This is an option the Minister of State should consider making available again.  These cottages are, on average, approximately 50% cheaper to build than an urban or town-based house.</p> <p>In the context of urban areas, one of the issues was touched on by Ronan Lyons recently, namely, the value for money for houses.  The situation changed from that of perhaps 1996 when a house might have been valued at &euro;115,000 or &euro;120,000 to a situation where the same house was valued at &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000 in the middle of the boom.  Suddenly, there was no longer any concept of value for money in regard to the building of a house.  An individual might have questioned costs if the house was only valued at &euro;100,000 or &euro;115,000, but when the valuation tripled, nobody questioned the doubling of construction costs or the issue of costs rising by 120%.</p> <p>Therefore, the challenge now for the Government and taxpayers is to try to return to a level where we are building houses that represent value for money.  However, the Government appears to be going against the wishes of the taxpayer through the new building regulations that have been introduced, which are pushing up the cost of building houses.  Until this challenge is taken on squarely by the Government and until there is a row back on the increased costs associated with building houses, individuals will not build houses.  I know many young couples who are now questioning whether they will build and they are continuing to rent because of the additional costs introduced by the former Minister, Phil Hogan, through the new building regulations.  There are other challenges also and issues about the unionisation of the construction sector and the cost of materials.  These issues all add to the cost of building, whether private or social housing.  These challenges need to be discussed along with the other issues under discussion.</p> <p>In regard to the objective of building 10,000 units over the next three years, I do not believe this is an ambitious objective.  Between the years 2000 and 2007, some 46,926 social houses were built.  Now we have a national crisis, but the plan is only to build 10,000 over three years, while there are 90,000 people on the waiting list.  The waiting list is up by one third since the Government came into office.  There are money issues and it is great that the Government has announced it will build 10,000 units over the next three years, but it is not dealing with the cost issue of building those houses.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Walsh and hope this debate will be extended.  It is important we have this debate and discuss the issues calmly and rationally.  We must try to come up with solutions, instead of taking political shots at each other here.  That will not achieve anything.  We must have a calm and rational debate on the issue and must support the Minister of State.  He will get support from this side of the House, but we need to delve into the issues further.  For that reason, I believe we need a longer debate on the issue so as to deal with crisis facing us.</p> <p>I did not discuss the issue of the homeless.  I was listening to Fr. McVerry today and was very interested in what he had to say.</p></speech>

I thank all who have contributed to the debate.  They are right that this is an important opportunity to discuss the challenges society faces in regard to housing provision.  As Minister of State with specific responsibility for the private rented sector, I have listened carefully and look forward to further contributions from Senators.  All constructive proposals and suggestions will be considered carefully.<br/><br/><b></b>Everyone in this room is well aware of the challenges facing us in the private rented sector.  However, we must also acknowledge the progress we have made in recent years.  More people are renting now than ever before.  In the decade since the passing of the Residential Tenancies Act, we have seen huge strides in the development of the private rental market and it is largely unrecognisable from its position at the turn of the millennium.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012, which I hope to bring back before this House shortly, will build on what has been achieved by the 2004 Act and, in particular, by the Private Residential Tenancies Board.<br/><br/>One of the most fundamental reforms the Bill will deliver will be the extension of the Act to the approved housing body sector.  This will extend the same rights and obligations that are currently afforded to landlords and tenants in the private rented sector to those in the approved housing body sector.  The establishment of a deposit protection scheme, which I intend to provide for on Committee Stage of the Bill in this House, will eliminate the unjustified withholding of tenants' deposits and represents a further fundamental reform in the operation of the private rental market.  At this point, I should mention Senator Hayden, who has worked tirelessly in support of this project for some considerable time.<br/><br/>The implementation of the housing assistance payment, HAP, is a key Government priority, a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020 and another major reform in the private rented sector.  The HAP scheme will eventually result in all social housing supports provided by the State coming under the aegis of local authorities.  The first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council.  HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan county councils from 1 October.  Subsequently, on 18 December, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households, as provided for in the action plan to address homelessness.<br/><br/>There are now 784 households in receipt of HAP across the seven local authority areas taking part in the pilot scheme, which is an increase of almost 300 households on the position at the end of December 2014.  Significant numbers are moving on to the scheme each week and their number will continue to increase in the coming months.  The target which has been set for 2015 is 8,400 HAP recipients by year end and consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of the movement of further local authorities on to the scheme in the context of the planned full roll out of the scheme which is scheduled to begin this year.  I am very pleased with the progress we have made so far.  Not alone will the implementation of HAP remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment, it will provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income and will also improve the standard of the rented accommodation being supported significantly.  A good suggestion was made here earlier that we should consider the certification of properties in regard to standards and we may elaborate on that in the future.<br/><br/>The standard of rental accommodation has improved considerably in recent years.  The setting aside of a portion of PRTB tenancy registration fees for the enforcement of rental standards resulted in an exponential increase in the number of rental standards inspections carried out by local authorities after 2004.  While there has been some criticism of inspections and the lack of inspections, there have been significant improvements in this area.  Some 2,000 inspections of rented dwellings were carried out by local authorities in 2003.  Ten years later, in 2013, that figure had increased to over 21,000 inspections.  We are, therefore, seeing considerable improvement.This has contributed to a significant improvement in the standard of rental accommodation available to tenants today and the final implementation of the 2008 standards for rented houses regulations in 2013 continues that work.</p> <p>I am conscious that we have more work to do.  In the short term I intend to promote best practice in the enforcement of the standards for rented accommodation, including the adoption of risk-assessment, across the local authorities.  The possibility of shared services across local authority areas is also an area to be explored.  I intend also to carry out a review of the rented standards regulations to ensure that standards continue to reflect the requirements of a modern rental sector.  The review, which will be carried out this year, will address not only the content of the regulations but also their implementation by local authorities with a view to disseminating best practice.  We will consider the feasibility of introducing a certification system, as called for this evening by Members. <br/><br/>While we are moving forward with fundamental reforms in the areas of deposit protection and the HAP scheme, I am also very conscious that the level of housing supply, especially in Dublin and the larger urban centres, is less than what is required.  This has led to rising rents, even homelessness in some cases, and is a significant concern for this Government.  Rising rents and prices are a concern not just for the families who are finding it difficult to access suitable homes but also put at risk our competitiveness as an economy and our attractiveness as a place in which to live and to do business.  As a society, we cannot tolerate homelessness and the Government is fully committed to addressing this issue.  Under this Government there has been a focused and co-ordinated approach to tackling homelessness across Departments and agencies.  On 4 December 2014 the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and I hosted a special summit on homelessness to reaffirm this Government's commitment to end involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.<br/><br/>A number of actions arising from the summit were formalised into an action plan to address homelessness and substantial progress has been made in implementing<i></i>it.  Among the actions was an increase in emergency bed capacity in the Dublin region to ensure that people sleeping rough would have a bed available to them should they choose to avail of it.  In addition, a range of measures are being taken to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  Having said that, emergency accommodation is not the solution to homelessness.<br/><br/>The housing-led approach, advocated in the Government's statement on homelessness policy, has been accepted as the appropriate approach to ending long-term homelessness.  The efforts are to ensure that long-term sustainable accommodation with appropriate supports is provided for those in emergency accommodation.  On 27 January, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, issued a ministerial direction to a number of local authorities on prioritising homeless households and other vulnerable groups for housing in their respective areas.  Successfully tackling homelessness demands that a higher priority be afforded to homeless households and this needs to be translated into homeless households being allocated actual houses and not just a number on a priority list.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, one of the effects of the lack of supply in the market has been an increase in rents, particularly in the Dublin region.  According to the most recent rent index from the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, for the third quarter of 2014, rents were 5.6% higher nationally than in the same quarter of 2013.  In Dublin, which is seeing the highest rates of increase nationally, overall rents were higher by 9.5%, although the rate of annual increase was down slightly.  The figures for the fourth quarter of 2014 which will be available towards the end of March will be telling and we will be monitoring them closely.<br/><br/>This motion notes with concern the difficulties caused by rising rents and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and I share those concerns.  These difficulties are particularly prevalent at the lower end of the market which houses our most vulnerable tenants, many of whom are in receipt of rent supplement.  The rent supplement scheme, administered by the Department of Social Protection, provides support to approximately 70,700 eligible people living in private rented accommodation.  Expenditure on the scheme in 2014 was approximately &euro;339 million.  The rent supplement scheme, together with the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, funds about 34% of the private rented sector market.<br/><br/>The Department of Social Protection has put measures in place to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers who are at risk of homelessness due to rising rents are addressed by providing for increased flexibility within the rent supplement scheme.  All community welfare staff have been reminded of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy.  In addition, the Department of Social Protection agreed and implemented an interim tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin region homeless executive, the four Dublin local authorities and Threshold, with the support of Dublin Simon and Focus Ireland.  The protocol applies where families in receipt of rent supplement are in danger of losing their tenancy.  Since the launch of this protocol in mid-June 2014, over 340 families in Dublin have had their rent supplement payments increased by the Department of Social Protection.  The Department of Social Protection continues to monitor the measures in place to ensure the appropriate supports are in place for rent supplement recipients.  The interim tenancy sustainment protocol was extended to Cork city from 26 January 2015.<br/><br/>There have been calls to raise rent supplement limits in response to rising rents in urban areas and I can understand why this is so.  There are legitimate concerns that raising rent limits may not be the solution to the current market difficulties as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not just on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students.  The Department of Social Protection is a significant player in the private rented sector and therefore not only has a responsibility for persons in rent supplement tenancies but also to the market as a whole.<br/><br/>I can understand the calls being made for rent regulation as a solution to this problem.  However, as with raising rent supplement limits, it is important that we look at rent regulation in the context of policy for the sector as a whole.  As such, I am cognisant of the possible negative impacts of rent regulation, particularly the impact on supply and the potential for black market transactions.  The private rented sector is fragile with a sizeable number of landlords indicating their intention to exit the sector.  In a recent Red C poll carried out for the PRTB, 29% of landlords stated they intended to sell their property as soon as possible.  That is indicative of the sector.<br/><br/>According to Central Bank data, 38,000 buy-to-let mortgages are in arrears - that is 27% of all buy-to-let properties.  My overriding objective on rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.  In this regard, I am monitoring the rental market closely and considering all options in regard to achieving greater rent certainty.  The options put forward in the recent report, Rent Stability in the Private Rented Sector, commissioned by the Private Residential Tenancies Board and published in Autumn 2014, form part but not all of these considerations.  I have listened to what Members of this House and other commentators have had to say.  We are monitoring rent levels very closely and will consider all options to assist in achieving rent certainty and stability in the current market.<br/><br/>It is also important that tenants are aware of their existing rights under the Residential Tenancies Act.  The 2004 Act provides that rents may not be greater than the open market rate and may only be reviewed upward or downward once a year, unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review, that cannot happen.  However, a recent poll for the PRTB found that only 64% of tenants were aware of their rights under the Residential Tenancies Act.  Having regard to this, the PRTB is developing a new communications strategy, which will include increasing awareness of existing rights and obligations under the legislation, and the first element in the strategy, a &quot;Do You Know&quot; campaign, commenced in the national press last month.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, the main cause of rising rents is a lack of supply in the market and the solution, to both homelessness and rising rents, is to increase the supply of homes.  Social housing is a key priority for the Government, evidenced by the additional &euro;2.2 billion in funding announced for social housing in the 2015 budget.  The Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform<b></b>published last November, sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.  The Fine Gael and Labour parties in government are under no illusion about the challenges we face but we have ringfenced the funding and put in place the strategy.  We have to implement and deliver on that strategy.  I would expect considerable progress on that when engaging with local authorities and approved housing bodies in the coming weeks.</p> <p>The total targeted provision of more than 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of 75,000 households through HAP and the rental accommodation scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.  In committing to provide these 35,000 new social housing units, at a projected cost of &euro;3.8 billion, the strategy marks a fresh start for social housing in Ireland.  Deputy Landy said earlier that this is the first major social housing programme in a generation.  It should be welcomed by both sides of the House.</p> <p>In 2015, we will provide a total of 15,800 social housing units.  This will be made up of 7,400 new social housing units and 8,400 HAP units.  The total housing provision for 2015 will result in an investment of almost &euro;800 million across a range of housing programmes, of which &euro;119 million will be self-funded by the relevant local authorities.  In addition, the implementation of the range of actions under the Government's Construction 2020 strategy will support increased supply in the wider housing market.</p> <p>I wish to address the issue of affordability of houses, which Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised.  It is something on which policy-makers, builders and developers can reflect as well as on the cost of building a housing unit from planning to occupation.  We all need to reflect - I include the industry stakeholders - on the margins and profits expected from land and for professional services.  Government and local authorities must look at the cost of development charges and other charges which may occur.  We need to drive down the cost of providing houses because if we do that and if we increase the supply, we will lessen the demand and the problems we face currently.</p> <p>It is also key that we look at the private rented sector not in isolation, but as a key component of the wider housing market and the economy as a whole. As the motion sets out, the private rented sector now represents almost 20% of the housing market and a well-balanced housing sector requires a strong, vibrant and sustainable rented sector.  Both Construction 2020 and the social housing strategy recognise the pivotal role to be played by the rented sector in our housing market and commit to the development of a national policy aimed at increasing investment in and supporting the supply of good quality, secure and affordable rental accommodation.  The development of this national policy will be progressed through the social housing strategy with a planned completion date of Q4 of this year.</p> <p>As I stated, we face significant challenges in the rented sector.  We must consider from where we have come and the context of why we have this problem.  We have just come out of one of the worst economic crashes in the history of our country.  We are seeing many repossessions and many accidental landlords who are under pressure to sustain their mortgages.  All of this happened against the backdrop of past governments abdicating their responsibility to build social housing.   As Senators said, it is a perfect storm but that means we must respond with a strategic approach, provide funding and ask all stakeholders to assist Government in achieving more housing units for our society.  </p> <p>However, this is also a time of opportunity, a time to develop new and progressive policies that will guide the development of the rented sector into the future.  The housing crisis has given us an opportunity to reassess our attitudes to housing and to reflect on home ownership and the rented sector.  The emergence of rented housing as a viable housing option is part of this reassessment.  This will mean looking closely, and in a new way, at issues such as standards, security of tenure, rent certainty and regulation and investment.  We have an opportunity now to reform our rental market and make informed and progressive policy decisions regarding its future and I look forward to hearing further contributions from Senators.  It is very important that we consistently engage in this type of debate.  </p> <p>As I said, no Minister or no Government has a monopoly on wisdom or on all the solutions and I will always listen to contributions from people who are looking for solutions and not just problems.  God knows, we know the problems are there but let us find ways to address them, to meet the challenge and to deliver for our society.</p></speech>

I would like to address very briefly news reports from this evening on comments made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, who called on social justice campaigner, Fr. Peter McVerry, to be more positive in his comments on the housing and homelessness crisis.  However, as we are all aware, Fr. Peter McVerry, who works at the coalface, knows more than most the reality of this crisis.  Sometimes it is not easy to sugar-coat what is a dire situation.  It is important that we, the Government and the Minister recognise that comments made by such campaigners are constructive, with people's best interests and well-being at heart and the desire to find a long-term sustainable solution.  It is important we remember that and I, for one, would like the Seanad to distance itself from some of those comments made this afternoon.</p>  <p>However, in the vein of remaining positive, there is nothing negative in what the Labour Party has stated in its motion.  While it succeeds in outlining some of the problems in terms of the housing and homelessness crisis, it proceeds to use the motion to perhaps self-congratulate itself and give itself a pat on the back.  </p>  <p>I would like to touch on some of the issues at hand.  Much has been said about the private rented market, an issue on which I would like to touch, as well as the strategy in regard to it.  We must remember the private rented market will not alleviate this problem, which is deeply entrenched.  A number of Senators mentioned that the State, through local authorities, has far too low a stake in housing and has failed miserably a section of society  for which the private rented market is unwilling or, indeed unable to provide.  Private landlords are not in the business of renting rooms out of the goodness of their hearts and to believe so would be naive.  </p>  <p>Of the 7,400 homes promised by this Government, it is clear that approximately 5,000 will come from the private market.  The plan, for the most part, is not necessarily to build or acquire homes for rent by local authorities but to provide access to 5,000 private homes through long-term leasing or shorter term arrangements with private landlords.  It is important to be aware of the realities of the private market.</p>  <p>As many Senators mentioned, we have more than 200,000 people in need of housing in the State and many are children who are living in emergency accommodation, sleeping on couches and sharing beds, very often in houses essentially not fit for habitation, whether damp or otherwise.  I cannot count the number of friends who have struggled and have had to settle for extortionate rent rates for very poor quality accommodation.  I am sure we all have stories about people queueing outside an apartment for almost an hour only to be turned away before they could view it.  From where will these 5,000 private rented properties come?  If they are not delivered, what will happen next?  What is the alternative?  What is the contingency plan?  There has not been enough building or refurbishment of many of these homes.</p>  <p>As was mentioned, the crisis is continuing to escalate with almost 90,000 people on the social housing waiting list, and at a time when rents are rapidly increasing and the number of homes available is decreasing.  The statistics show that.  The solution will not be a case of waving a magic wand but it will be very multifaceted.  The two main prongs of it are relatively simple.  We need to build more social housing, through local authorities, by investing in local authority housing and supporting local authorities in creating arm's length trusts that can raise finance to build, as needed.  The plan currently is to subsidise further private landlords and developers who are already getting &euro;0.5 billion per year.  We are hoping they will build thousands of houses for rent, despite their failure to do so to date.</p>  <p>As mentioned by many Senators and the Minister of State, some type of regulation of the rental market is required.  This would set a market rate not purely based on the desperation of renters to have a roof over their heads but on the quality of accommodation and the consumer price index.  It would limit the ability of landlords to raise rents to a certain percentage between and during tenancies.  These measure would foster a more secure rental market and encourage more responsible and professional landlords into the private market.</p> <p>The evidence to date clearly shows the only solution is more housing and cheaper housing.  It is the responsibility of the Government of the day to deliver such housing.  We subsidise the private market by nearly &euro;0.5 billion a year.  Therefore, we need to make sure we provide housing and that the vast bulk of funding is invested in real social housing to be provided by local authorities.  That is my contribution.</p></speech>

Much has been made of the constitutional nature or otherwise of rent regulation.  However, some limited rent regulation already exists in the 2004 Residential Tenancies Act.  Recently legal advice offered, thanks to Senator Hayden, by a practising barrister, on rent regulation stated there is no constitutional impediment to rent regulation.  The barrister stated that rent certainty was constitutional and in the interest of the common good and social justice.  A solution to the problem of huge sudden increases in rent is to tie rental increases to the rate of inflation as determined by the consumer price index, CPI.  This would ensure a more steady approach to rents as they would be linked to the cost of living in the country rather than on sudden swings in the property market.  This would give tenants more certainty but should also guarantee landlords a steadier income flow.</p>  <p>I want to be fair to both sides.  It is important that we take on board some of the concerns of the landlords.  I know property owners will argue that regulation will result in insufficient income to maintain standards, their properties will fall into disrepair and overall there will be a reduction in accommodation available.  They have stated that an analysis of the supply impact shows that, potentially, between 52,000 and 89,000 rental properties could exit the sector over time due to the impact of net yields for landlords.  Rents tend to be higher the greater the contraction in supply due to black market transactions.  In light of this, any regulation must bring with them certain guarantees for landlords and those guarantees must form a part of regulation that is brought forward.</p>  <p>Another argument put forward by property owners against rent regulation is that such regulation destabilises rental markets and have a negative effect on labour mobility.  The solution is to have an efficient, fair and swift judicial system.  I have seen evidence from landlords and property owners where people have walked away.  I have seen one landlord left carrying the can for &euro;65,000 in unpaid rent across his properties.  I can understand there is a need for swift action where there are deviant tenants.  I fully support the move while calling for regulation at the same time.</p>  <p>With rent regulation there must be a review of the unfair and inequitable tax treatment which is driving investors out of the private rental sector.  Investment in property is a business after all; it is not a hobby.  Buying a property in order to rent it out is a fairly major undertaking.  There must be a realistic approach from a tax point of view.  Landlords must be allowed to claim 25% of interest paid to purchase or renovate a property and that is a reasonable request.  The local property tax for landlords should be allowed to be offset against tax also.</p>  <p>Security of tenure is a serious issue.  One year leases must stop if we are talking about long-term solutions for families because a family could move into a property and a year later find themselves on the street.  A major weakness in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 is that landlords can vacate a property on grounds such as required for a family member, intending to refurbish the property or selling the property.  The notice of termination of lease is wholly inadequate for tenants, with some tenants who have lived in properties for more than two years given only 56 days notice to vacate the property.  With a shortage of rental properties on the market at the moment, many families are faced with an impossible dilemma of finding a similar property in the same location at a similar rent to what they were paying.  This has a detrimental effect on families with children who attend schools in a particular area.  Only last week Fr. McVerry contacted my office to inform me about a case where a young single mother with a three-year old child was made homeless and lived on the street who goes to his premises at night seeking accommodation.  That woman has to report to a Garda station each night in order to receive emergency accommodation.  </p>  <p>I compliment the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, on the marvellous job they have done with respect to the people who sleep rough.  That accommodation is now full.  I compliment them both on the measure but we have got to go a little bit outside that initiative.  </p>  <p>I am concerned about the properties that were purchased originally as buy-to-let properties.  They are now being repossessed by banks and the banks are absolutely heartless.  The receivers move in and their job is to take the property back and take ownership of the property.  With respect to deposits and things like that there is no requirement for banks to refund deposits.  We must protect tenants who are in properties that are owned or repossessed by banks.  If tenants are paying their rents and are good and obedient tenants there is no reason they should be asked to leave a property. </p>  <p>The next issue is standards in rental properties.  I note the point the Minister of State made in his speech.  Standards in rental properties have increased over time.    In terms of the inspection system that is operated at the moment, I have received complaints from landlords that minor problems result in the lack of certification which causes all sorts of problems.  We need a realistic approach to the inspection regime.</p>  <p>Bedsits are another issue that has been raised with me.  I am not talking about the dingy hovels that we used to have years ago.  In Waterford city, which is not far from where the Minister of State comes from, there are a number of what I call bedsits on the old Cork Road or the Cork Road, if I am not mistaken and they are located on either side of the road.  It is where elderly people can rent a room with bathroom facilities and all amenities are in one room.  If he has not seen them then I ask him to take a look at the accommodation.  It is an excellent solution where somebody does not want to find themselves meeting the costs of a single apartment.  </p>  <p>In conclusion, I thank the Minister of State once again for taking the time to listen to me and I appreciate the Cathaoirleach allowing my amendment.</p></speech>

We need a magic wand to resolve the issue.  However, we need to be realistic about where we have come from and where we want to go.  Let us remember that three or four years ago we were borrowing &euro;18 billion.  The fact that the Government has put a plan in place to start to correct this problem is a huge initiative in itself.  There have been claims that public representatives are unaware of the housing crisis.  As public representatives, and I have been an elected representative for over 20 years, we hear about the crisis every day of the week and it is not news to us.  The question is how does one resolve the problem.  One must get to the stage of getting money in order to invest in housing and we must try to solve the problem in a variety of different ways.</p>  <p>In regard to the homeless issue, I heard a priest in Cork say that he knew 25 to 30 homeless people who unfortunately wanted to live on the street, and irrespective of what accommodation he could provide them he could not get them off the street.  That is a challenge.  It is a sad situation but it is a fact and is true.  When we look at this problem we can see that, historically over a long period, we built no houses.  Therefore, it should come as no surprise there is a housing shortage.  When we arrived into this crisis in 2011 we did not have any money to build houses and that is a fact.</p>  <p>I welcome the motion that was tabled tonight.  </p> <p>I welcome the initiative by the two Ministers and think they are doing a fine job in a short space of time.  We have a lot of work to do to pull this together.  I would like to see the housing assistance payment scheme being rolled out in as many counties as possible as quickly as possible.  We have a crisis in my town.  We have a difficulty with the banks which are not going to give money to builders - I am talking about the ordinary fellow who was building 30 or 40 houses - to start schemes.  We have serviced land available - a couple of hundred acres - but an ordinary builder cannot a the loan to start.  I am talking about affordable houses worth &euro;140,000 or &euro;150,000.  There is, therefore, a need to address the banking side of the issue, as well as the needs of the private builder, if we want him or her to come on board, but it seems the banks just do not want to raise the funds needed to restart development.  Many young couples would still buy houses and 25% to 30% would actually come off housing lists.  There are working couples who just cannot find a house and have to rent privately, although they would buy, if they could find one.</p> <p>I fully support the motion and the Minister of State's initiatives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-11a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015021100037#CCC00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is the most important issue facing us and we have to learn the lessons of the collapse.  In this regard, the banking inquiry is coming to terms with some of the problems that arise on a daily basis.  </p>  <p>We lost the building society movement.  Historically, that was the way people were able to acquire houses and there was a very high rate of home ownership.  The building societies, however, began to change their investment and invested in commercial properties, lending to the property sector, not to individuals who were hoping to buy a house.  In this regard, I think of the Educational Building Society which broadly was philanthropic.  With it teachers could buy a house on 2.5 times their income.  We lost this and I do not know if it is possible to bring back the building society movement, but it did play a role.  Because they are dependent on short-term finance, banks are particularly unsuited to meeting the long-term commitment required in the housing market.  I hope, therefore, that we can interest pension funds in entering it.  The banks created the bubble and caused the crash.</p>  <p>The aspiration people had - our parents and grandparents - of buying a house on 2.5 times their income is now beyond the reach of so many.  Why are people in negative equity, with huge house prices and so on?  Mr. Brendan Burgess appeared before the finance committee a while ago and estimated that regulations and the cost of planning and so on added about &euro;67,000 to the cost an average house.  Mr. Ronan Lyons, my colleague at TCD, has pointed to some of the planning rules being too strict in the context of apartments, although we do not want to go back to the days of the bedsit Senator Gerard P. Craughwell described.  Let us not do things which in some contexts might seem worthwhile but which push up the price of houses.</p>  <p>I commend the intervention of the Central Bank on the issue of the 20% deposit, as it was the correct decision.  The lower the deposit required the higher the rate of house price inflation.  There is a massive rate of return on the equity of owners, which diverts money from normal savings towards property.  A house is somewhere people live; it is not an investment.  There should be a much stricter rate of capital gains tax on the equity gained from the appreciation in house prices.  I have seen advertisements stating, "This house is a snip at &euro;10 million".  That probably means it could be sold for &euro;12 million in 18 months time, making &euro;2 million without any taxation.  We do not want such people in the housing market.  If capital gains tax could be introduced for flipping houses in such a way, it would take the pressure off.</p>  <p>I remember the headline on an article by Mr. Anthony Downs from the Brookings Institution in Washington, "Too much capital for housing".  If there is an inelastic supply of housing and too much capital is pushed in, the impact is on price, not supply.  We conducted that experiment at serious cost to so many young people who are in negative equity and in terms of the destruction of the banking system and the property sector.  Massive damage was done.</p>  <p>On the rented sector, to which other speakers referred, particularly as regards buy-to-lets, we have to get across to investors that when they buy a loan book from a financial institution, they are buying a flow of incomes.  Their case is against the landlord or the owner of a buy-to-let - "landlord" may be too pompous a title for those who bought an extra house for their pension and were not in the property sector in a professional capacity - not the tenants.  We had good discussions with the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, while he was still in office, to the effect that we needed a Bill of Rights for tenants.  That is why there is a much bigger rented sector in very prosperous countries such as Germany and Switzerland where tenants feel they are protected by the law.  The price people pay for the loan books reflects the property rights and entitlements of tenants.  We should make it clear that as a Parliament we stand with the tenants.  Investors are not allowed to expel tenants because it is the person who took out the mortgage who is broke and their action is against that person, not the tenants.  Tenants need to have rights.</p>  <p>We should aim again to have finance available on 2.5 times a person's income, as was the case in the past.  Although real incomes have increased, house prices have risen so much faster.  </p>  <p>On the issue of social housing, there was an extremely good report produced by a committee chaired by the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  We had problems with social housing.  First, it cost too much.  According to the Lord Mayor at the time, Mr. Gay Mitchell, maintenance costs were extremely high and it was very difficult to collect rents, even when people's incomes increased.  About 20 years ago houses were sold off at a huge discount.  As a consequence, we do not now have the stock of social housing we need to deal with the homelessness problem the Minister of State has been addressing.  Reorientation is under way.  A house is a place in which to live; it is not a vehicle to avail of tax breaks or make tax-free capital gains.  If that is where we place the emphasis, debates such as this will prove to be very worthwhile.  This House should assist the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, in dealing with the problem.  It is a privilege to be able to do this.  The get-rich-quick by flipping houses strategy did serious damage to the economy and the banking system and deprived us of investment in other areas.  Not repeating the mistakes of the past has to be our goal.</p></speech>

I support the Labour Party Private Members' motion on the subject of housing to which Senators Aideen Hayden, Denis Landy, Marie Moloney and other colleagues have spoken with great eloquence.  Having listened to Senator Sean D. Barrett, we would all agree with him on the adverse consequences for Irish society of the commodification - in fact, the fetishisation - of property to be bought and sold, rather than used as a home, somewhere we live.  During the boom years not enough attention was paid to this aspect of the housing bubble.</p>  <p>There is a serious issue following years of neglect.  There was the absence of a social housing construction programme during the boom years.  Because of this, we are now facing the very serious issues addressed in the motion of rising rents, long waiting lists for public housing and the scandal of families being left homeless.  This is a legacy issue which the Government has to tackle.  A good deal of it is down to the lack of housing supply in particular areas where there are long waiting lists, as Senator Denis Landy and others discussed.  It is very positive to see a social housing construction programme being announced, for which I commend the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  We all welcome the social housing strategy which aims to deliver 35,000 social homes, with a further 75,000 homes in the private rented sector by 2020.  There is to be a large capital investment programme.  There is no doubt such a programme is long overdue and the sort of investment we should have seen when money was available.  It will have a tangible effect in tackling what is a serious problem, although there are other measures that need to be taken, including, in particular, providing some protection for those in the private rented sector.</p> <p>Other measures need to be put in place and in particular we need some form of protection for those in the private rented sector now.  Some form of rent regulation is a necessity and I agree with all of those who raised that issue.  </p> <p>Finally, I welcome the Government's very quick response to the homelessness issue through its resourcing of homeless services in Dublin.  This has been a very particular issue of which we are all aware.  We are all aware of the tragedies and deaths of homeless people and it is good to see initiatives like the night caf&eacute;s being rolled out so swiftly.  </p></speech>

Numerous Governments over many years have made very positive advances in the context of housing.  In fact, the very first Cumann na nGaedhal Government in 1922 introduced the &pound;million plan, which was the first extensive social housing programme of the Free State and subsequent Fianna F&aacute;il governments introduced very significant social housing programmes.  It was the former Deputy Bobby Molloy who put in place the Commission on the Private Rented Sector and a Fianna F&aacute;il Government that brought in the 2004 Residential Tenancies legislation, the Planning and Development Act and improved rental accommodation standards.  This Government has progressed a lot of those earlier strategies very significantly.  There has been a huge commitment to bringing these strategies forward.  Mistakes have been made; there is no doubt about that.  As far back as 1973 the then Government started to abolish rates for the provision of local authority housing and it was a Fianna F&aacute;il Government in 1977 that finished that programme, which effectively made the local authorities dependent on central government for all of their housing funding.  We have paid a big price for that.</p>  <p>I very much welcome the promised introduction of a deposit protection scheme.  A lot tenants have been made homeless or have had to remain in unsuitable accommodation because they have not been able to get their deposits back.  I also welcome the Minister of State's comments on the HAP scheme.  It is a long overdue development that the system for dealing with the issue of social housing and social housing provision through other supports was brought under the aegis of a single Department.  In the context of accommodation standards, I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to examining the feasibility of introducing a certification system.  I have long believed that this is the best way to ensure that we have appropriate standards in the rented sector.  </p>  <p>On the issue of homelessness, the ring-fencing of a supply of accommodation for people coming out of homeless services is an important development.  I have been involved in the area of homelessness for many years and one of the major problems for people coming out of homelessness has been their inability to access to social housing supports.  That is the way to end long-term homelessness.  I must say that I do not agree with Father McVerry recent comments, although I fully respect him as a colleague.  I believe that the housing-first approach and the measures this Government has put in place to ensure that a housing-led approach is on the agenda is the way to deal with homelessness.  The commitment that half of all social housing allocations in the Dublin region and in Cork will go to those in homeless services is the way that long-term homelessness will be resolved but it has taken many years to come to that position.  </p>  <p>I am taking the Minister of State's comments on rising rents in a positive way because he said that the Government is prepared to examine "all measures" to deal with the problem, including examining the issue of rent certainty.  It is very important to distinguish between rent control and rent certainty.  Rent control is categorically unconstitutional and was deemed to be so in 1981.  I am not referring to rent control but to a modern-day version of that which is prevalent in almost every developed country with a significant private rental sector and which is about limiting the extent of increases in rents to a reasonable level.  Nobody is suggesting that landlords are not entitled to a reasonable return on their investment but having looked at the Irish housing market over many years it is clear that we have engaged in boom and bust cycles that are no good for anybody.  Regulating the level of rent increases and decreases will help to stabilise the overall housing market.  I conducted research in 2003 into the idea of investment by institutions in the rented market, the conclusion of which was that they wanted to see better regulation and wanted to have some security in the context of rental yield.  I believe that regulating rent increases is the way to go in that regard.  Recently someone who was involved in the Commission on the Rented Sector asked me why the legislation at the time regulated rent increases only for a period of one year.  The reason was that at the time the standard in the market was a one-year lease; had the standard been two- or three-year leases, we would have had two- or three-year rent certainty models.  There is no reason we cannot revisit this.  </p>  <p>I thank all of my colleagues who contributed to this debate.  I have taken very extensive notes and if I had the time, I would respond to many of the issues raised.  I will make a number of comments on the counter-motions that were tabled this evening.  While I understand the spirit in which they were put forward, we are moving towards a new system of social housing provision whereby we are not looking at a quantum of &euro;2.2 billion but at a sum that will lever further investment.  I sit on the Dublin City Council Housing Strategic Policy Committee, SPC and am aware that the council has sought expressions of interest from the market for a housing scheme under which the council would provide land for housing.  It is seeking partners to augment its investment and that is the way forward.  In fact, that is what is happening at a European level at the moment with the Juncker plan.  I want to see a new model of social housing provision because the old model does not work.  As has already been alluded to by Senator Barrett, it does not pay for itself and is not the way forward.  We gave houses away in the 1980s because they cost more to manage and maintain than they did to deliver.  </p></speech>
