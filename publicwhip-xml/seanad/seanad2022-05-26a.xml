I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, to the House.  The Minister of State was always very strong on educational matters.  The matter I raise this morning relates to St. Teresa's Special School in Ballinasloe, County Galway.  Last November we were very proud that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education and others came to Ballinasloe and gave the go-ahead for a new school for St. Teresa's.  St. Teresa's has been based at the enterprise centre in Ballinasloe on Creagh Road for a number of years.  It is very cramped.  It is very hard for them to do their daily work.  </p> <p>It is a special school with 36 enrolled, all of whom have special needs.  Indeed, in September 2022 another class will be added to the school.  It was a great day and a great announcement.  This morning I want to find out from the Minister of State and the Department where it stands.  It was great news when the announcement was made in Ballinasloe.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There were great celebrations in Ballinasloe but it is very important that we now move the project forward.  There are 16 special needs assistants at the school.  There are also nine teachers, one care assistant, one nurse and nine bus escorts.  The school is under the patronage of Ability West.  I compliment Anita O'Reilly, who is the principal.  She does Trojan work, as do all the staff.  They are committed to the students.  They give more than their daily hours to the job to ensure all of the students and their parents and families are looked after.  The announcement of the new school was unbelievable news for them.  I am sure the Minister of State has an update for me.  I hope he has some good news on the project because it is very important that it moves ahead as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I will outline to the Seanad the current position on this major building project.  It is included in the Department's construction programme, which is being delivered under the national development plan as part of the Project Ireland 2040 framework.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment up to 2025.  This will allow the Department to move ahead with projects such as St. Teresa's Special School.  This investment will build on the good progress being made throughout the country to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs.  The investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p> <p>The Senator is aware of the extensive site identification and assessment exercise, as he was in constant contact with the Minister during that time.  This was to identify a permanent site location for St. Teresa's Special School.  The Minister can confirm that agreement in principle has been reached with the vendor on a 4 acre site at Parkmore, Creagh, Ballinasloe, for the provision of the permanent accommodation for the school and the legal work is at an advanced stage.  The major building project for St. Teresa's Special School will be delivered under the Department's accelerated delivery of architectural planning and tendering, ADAPT, programme.  The ADAPT programme uses a professional external project manager to co-ordinate and drive the design team to achieve the best possible timeframe for the project.</p> <p>The tender process to appoint a project manager has just been completed.  The first step to be undertaken by the project manager will be the tender competitions for the appointment of design teams for a number of school building projects.  This will include the appointment of the design team for the St. Teresa's Special School project.  The Department will shortly be in touch with the school authorities about further developments on these appointments.  Upon appointment, the design team will proceed to stage one of the architectural planning, which is preliminary design, and in which the design team will assess the site and prepare initial sketch schemes.  The brief for this project is the construction of a new eight-classroom special school with significant associated ancillary accommodation on a greenfield site.  The school has an enrolment of 36 pupils and a staffing of principal plus six special classes.  The Department also approved additional interim accommodation of two temporary classrooms for the school in 2021 to cater for immediate needs.</p> <p>I thank Senator Murphy.  I know from sitting in parliamentary party meetings and speaking to the Minister, Deputy Foley, he has been incessant in speaking about this project and the need for it.  Much credit goes to Senator Murphy for pushing the project through the stages and to the Government's commitment to special education, which is very important for all of us.</p></speech>

His response is quite positive and I am delighted with it.  The Minister of State mentioned the temporary classrooms which were put in place in the not-too-distant past.  The school principal is very happy with that accommodation for now.  As the Minister of State said, it is on the move and it is most important that things are happening.  As the Minister of State said in his reply, contact will be made with the school in the coming weeks, I hope in the next month or two, to proceed further with the project.  It is very important.  I cannot stress enough the commitment and dedication of the principal and teachers.  They put in a huge amount of work.  The children are very well looked after.  They days can be difficult with 36 children all with special needs.  We can appreciate this.  All of the staff work together to make the days better for the children and their families.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Garvey and the Minister of State know, the Government is dedicated to looking after the needs of such children.  I welcome this very much.  It is long overdue and it is happening now.</p></speech>

T&aacute; a fhios againn go l&eacute;ir gur ceart bunreacht&uacute;il ceart an bhunoideachais sa t&iacute;r seo agus is ceart an-th&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; sin.

This is happening and it is going through the normal stages.  There is money behind it.  It can happen and will happen.  Senator Murphy is speaking about the constitutional right to education.  As a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister of State I am very proud that it was put in our Constitution in very dark days in the late 1930s.  There is a constitutional right to primary education.  Everything we do, particularly with regard to primary education, needs to be with this constitutional right in mind.  It is a very important constitutional right.  It is the only socioeconomic right that is clear-cut and specifically written into the Constitution.  Everything we do should be focused on it.  The success of the State, and the State has been remarkably economically and socially successful since independence, has been down to our focus on education.  Of course it is an ancient Irish trait.  We have always been focused on education and learning.  We have really put it into practice since independence.  This constitutional right and this success must be spread to every child, including the children in Ballinasloe about whom Senator Murphy has spoken.</p></speech>

Over many years many people in housing estates throughout the county have raised this and it does not seem to be unique to County Clare.  We have private housing estates built by developers and construction companies that went bust.  The housing estates have been left to their own devices.  In particular I want to ask what is being done for housing estates such as Westcoast View, Annagh, County Clare.  The people there have been waiting many years for the estate to be taken in charge.  At this stage they have been waiting nine years.  It has its own wastewater treatment plant and the position of Irish Water is that it is not responsible for taking in charge of developer-provided water services infrastructure.  Clare County Council can no longer legally take a private wastewater treatment plant, WWTP, in charge as it is no longer a water services authority.  How will we remedy this situation?  From doing lots of research and from many emails over and back it seems a number of estates in west Clare are in the same predicament, as they also have their own wastewater treatment plants.  They seem to be falling between two stools.  There is a disconnect in the legislation and private developments with developer-provided wastewater infrastructure cannot be taken in charge unless the legislation is changed to fund or legislate or both for Irish Water or local authorities to take the infrastructure in charge.</p> <p>There are more layers to this with the bond companies.  There seems to be a bond for estates when they are abandoned by a developer or construction company.  Often it takes years for the bond to be released to the local authority to use the money to do the work.  Often the bond is a fraction of the costs needed.  We have to wait years to get the bond for the local authorities to have the money to do the work and when they finally get it, perhaps eight or ten years later, it is a fraction of the costs needed.  This is very frustrating for me and I am the least of those involved.  There are the people living in the estates and the local authorities themselves.  The county council would like to be doing what it needs to do for these houses but it is not its responsibility and nor is it the responsibility of Irish Water.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> It remains to be seen how the taking-in-charge issue will be resolved.  As there are other counties with similar to ourselves so maybe this issue will be addressed.  The matter needs to be addressed nationally.  What will be done?  It seems we are in limbo because we have changed the powers of local authorities and given the powers they had to Irish Water, but nobody takes responsibility for these housing estates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-26a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052600002#C00175"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo a ard&uacute;.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue and providing me with the opportunity to address it, on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Unfortunately, he cannot be here to address the issue.</p> <p>Local authorities, as planning authorities, lead the taking in charge process of housing estates.  The taking in charge of housing estates by local authorities is provided for by the Planning and Development Act.</p> <p>A small subset of estates nationally that are not taken in charge rely on developer provided water services infrastructure for their water services.  This mainly consists of wastewater treatment facilities but a small number provide drinking water services for the estate.  This infrastructure was generally provided by the developer of the estate and is not connected to the public water services network.  They are privately owned facilities.</p> <p>In 2019, the Department introduced the multi-annual developer provided water services  infrastructure resolution programme to provide funding for the progressive resolution of these housing estates with these legacy issues.  The focus of the first multi-annual programme is on estates in towns and villages where the resolution is to connect their water services to the local Irish Water network.  This will enable Irish Water to take responsibility for the ongoing operation and management of the water service in the estate once the estate is taken in charge by the planning authority.</p> <p>In September 2020, the Minister announced allocations of just over &euro;3.36 million for 26 estates across ten counties with almost 950 households to benefit, under the new multi-annual programme, to enable the taking in charge of these estates.  A study is being carried out by Irish Water to develop the best solutions for estates with legacy developer provided water services infrastructure.  The study will help the Department with developing policy solutions, including issues around funding, for estates, such as the one referenced by the Senator, that due to distance and size are not viable to connect to the public network.  This is by considering sustainable treatment technologies either on the same site or another suitable alternative site.  I understand the study is expected to be completed by the summer.</p> <p>It will take a number of funding programmes to fully resolve these estates.  The Department is committed to progressing the taking in charge of these legacy estates through increased funding over the coming years.</p> <p>The Department is supporting the progressive taking in charge of estates with developer provided wastewater infrastructure.  Funding of &euro;68.5 million has been secured under the national development plan for this programme and lead pipe remediation to underpin this support.</p></speech>

I note that the Minister has allocated just over &euro;3.36 million for 26 estates across ten counties.  I contend that there are probably 26 estates in County Clare that need assistance.  I know that the Minister has been handed a legacy issue, but the water situation, between lead pipes, poor infrastructure and more, is appalling.  Apart from being told that a study might be completed by the summer, which could mean June or September, I have nothing to tell the residents of the estate.  I do not know how we can expedite the matter.  There is a housing crisis, but at least let the people who live in houses currently have decent water and access to water.  It is a basic human right to have access to clean water.  People ring me all of the time and they are extremely stressed because their water supply has been cut off.  The water situation is especially stressful for people who are at home so people with disabilities or people who work from home full-time or older people.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister the fact that I know he has to spend money on everything.  However, we need to get the water services right for the existing housing estates, regardless of whether they comprise six or 70 houses.  I would like to see this issue prioritised and expedited by the Department.</p></speech>

The Department has a funding programme in place to help resolve it but it will take a number of funding cycles to do so.  If there is anything else the Senator wants to say or if she has any other information, she should please feel free to provide it to the Minister or the Department and the relevant officials will consider it.</p> <p>Given the significant funding liability required to sustainably resolve issues relating to these type of estates that are dotted around the country, the Department has asked Irish Water to carry out a study to support it in developing the best solutions.  The study will be finished by the summer and will inform future iterations of the funding programme.  I hope that the Senator will tell residents that there is money available but that the work is not going to be done at once and that we are trying to work out the best possible way to spend it.</p></speech>

They protect and preserve this country's memory.  They are centres for performance and learning.  In addition, they offer citizens and residents opportunities to unlock their creative potential.  While the focus of this matter is capital allocations and progress with the Project Ireland 2040 plan, I must acknowledge that day-to-day operations and staff numbers have never recovered since the years of austerity.  Such a situation remains a challenge for many of the national cultural institutions whose staff numbers compare very unfavourably with their counterparts in Scotland, Wales and England.</p> <p>Under Project 2040, a sum of &euro;460 million has been set aside for national cultural institutions.  Those institutions are: the National Library of Ireland; Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA; the National Museum of Ireland; the Crawford Gallery; the National Archives of Ireland; the National Concert Hall; the Abbey Theatre; the Chester Beatty Library; and the National Gallery of Ireland.  The refurbishment of the National Gallery has led the way.  It is a beautiful redevelopment and shows what can be achieved when investment is committed to, put aside and delivered.  Many of these institutions have never been redeveloped although promises have been made in the past.  In many ways, the Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage plan is a political wish list.  These developments are critical not only in the context of artefacts but also to ensure universal access for all citizens and audience safety</p> <p>The reason I tabled this matter is because I want a progress report.  I do not want these Houses to be in the dark about the national cultural institutions and the current status of their redevelopment.  I hope that the statement, which the Minister of State will give on behalf of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, will detail whether the &euro;460 million is still a realistic figure.  I am sure that it is not.  What institutions are now in progress with regard to those investments?  What phase has been reached in the context of each of the national cultural institutions?  I mean in terms of a business case, investigation works, planning and contract procurement.  The Minister is the one who signs off on all of the funding, and this is the Government's plan.  In light of that, I would appreciate an update on all of the aforementioned.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im an-s&aacute;sta a bheith sa Teach chun labhairt faoin infheist&iacute;ocht t&aacute;bhachtach in&aacute;r bhforais chult&uacute;ir n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.</p> <p>Under the Government's national development plan, a programme of investment of &euro;460 million, is envisaged to upgrade and reimagine Ireland's national cultural institutions.  As the Senator indicated, this was set out in Project Ireland 2040, Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 to 2027, and reaffirmed in the most recent review of the national development plan.</p> <p>Many of the national cultural institutions are housed in historic buildings.  While this adds to the cultural experience, these buildings often require significant investment in order to keep them up to modern international standards.  The investment plan recognises the importance of high-quality infrastructure in fostering vibrant culture and heritage sectors.  That investment in our cultural heritage underpins real social cohesion and supports strong, sustainable economic growth.</p> <p>The ambitious investment programme for the national cultural institutions, as put forward in the plan, is one of the largest single commitments to investment in these institutions in the history of the State.  The investment is aligned with the national planning framework objective of ensuring that Ireland has a creative, innovative and culturally attuned society.</p> <p>Guardianship and sustainability are central to the programme for Government, the national economic recovery plan, the national planning framework and the climate action plan.  The Department's capital investment measures for the national cultural institutions will protect Ireland's tangible and intangible culture into the future.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Thomas Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These major redevelopment projects will provide a world-class network of cultural infrastructure to increase capacity, deliver improved visitor experience, and address long-standing infrastructural issues, future-proofing our national cultural institutions, NCIs, for generations to come.</p><p>In recognition of the expectation that the majority of funding for this programme would be available from 2023, my Department has, over the past four years, invested heavily in ensuring that a robust appraisal and project development process is in place for the national cultural institution programme.  This has meant that projects which were at concept stage in 2018 have undergone a rigorous process to fully elaborate the scope of the projects to be delivered, including through undertaking extensive investigative and survey works which are essential.</p><p>This has seen flagship projects move from initial concept, to appraisal, to detailed design.  As a result, the projects emerging are better designed, better meet the objectives of the Department and the Government, and are based on the best available cost information than might otherwise be the case.</p><p>Over the next few years, there are a number of key projects.  These include a project to provide a secure environmentally controlled archival repository in full compliance with internationally accepted archival storage standards at the National Archives, which is currently being tendered with a view to construction commencing later this year.  There is also an ambitious development of the Crawford Art Gallery, Cork, for which it is anticipated that the planning process will commence later this year.  Moreover, there is a phased re-imagining project of the National Library to enhance the building, visitor experience, collections and works.  Works as part of the earlier phases have already delivered a new and permanent home for the prints and drawings collection in the refurbished former seminar room of the 1827 wing and a state-of-the-art book store, which have both maximised the storage space available.  These works have also provided an appropriate environment in which to safeguard the books.  Design of the final works for the entire development is expected in 2022.</p><p>There is also a new development plan for the National Concert Hall complex, including a newly refurbished and extended main auditorium, improved musicians' facilities and a reorganisation of public facilities.  The Department is currently reviewing the preliminary business case submitted in respect of this project.  In addition, there are redevelopment and modernisation works planned at the Chester Beatty Library in conjunction with the Dublin Castle master plan of the Office of Public Works, OPW.  The Department is currently reviewing the preliminary business case submitted and it is expected that an integrated design team will be procured later this year.</p><p>The Department is currently reviewing a preliminary business case in respect of the development project at the Abbey Theatre, a flagship development that will re-imagine our national theatre, while also contributing to the regeneration of this historic and important part of Dublin's city centre.  A preliminary business case has also been completed in respect of the Natural History Museum, next door, a branch of the National Museum of Ireland, also next door, and the procurement of an integrated design team is due to commence in parallel with an investigative and preparatory works contract.</p><p>The Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, is currently at strategic assessment report stage in respect of the redevelopment of the full site at Kilmainham.</p><p>At the National Gallery of Ireland, design and investigative work is under way in respect of 88-90 Merrion Square.  This project will create a new entrance to the gallery, restore and enhance the gallery's library and create fit-for-purpose facilities for gallery administration, curation and research.  In addition, work on the preliminary business case is underway for phase 4 of the National Gallery of Ireland master plan which will provide a detailed appraisal of options and related costs for the gallery's redevelopment.  The National Gallery of Ireland redevelopment will build on the very successful reopening of the gallery's historic wings in 2017, a project, as the Senator has acknowledged, which showcased what is possible when we invest in our national cultural institutions.</p><p>The investment programme under the national development plan represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine these important public resources, which contribute very significantly to the social and cultural fabric of our society.  </p><p>Just like in the education area, I am very proud to be back in government as part of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, because our commitment and record on the national cultural institutions, on culture and the arts in general, has been very strong throughout our periods of office.  I very much look forward, as does the Senator, to seeing these particular projects which I have mentioned progress.</p></speech>

I encourage all of our political and public representatives and staff in these Houses to visit these institutions, many of which surround this site.  We can then have more champions for these projects and for the work of the institutions.  I wonder how recent announcements around inflation, and such Government announcements around paying 70% of inflation costs, affect these projects or our national cultural institutions.  I will read the Minister of State's response in more detail over a lengthier period but I welcome the fact that 2023 seems to be a key year for these projects.</p> <p>On many of the sites and the business cases for them that the Department is currently reviewing, does the Department have the resources for these?  This is a very significant investment and I wonder whether the Department has sufficient resources to deal with these projects, because time is of the essence and inflation is only going in one direction.  Promises, as I have said, have been made to the national cultural institutions in the past and I hope that the Government will keep every commitment that it makes.</p></speech>

These are very important institutions which are right beside us and having engaged myself with the National Museum before the pandemic, the museum was very keen for Deputies and Senators to be in touch with their constituents and with school groups who might be coming to the D&aacute;il, etc.  The same would apply with the other institutions and I feel that they would be very happy for us to be their champions.  We must remember that we have very important work to do here.  Everybody who works in this country has a very important job, whatever one's role in society is, but culture and the arts brings us to a different space.  Senator Warfield appreciates that, as certainly does Senator Murphy from his own background.  It is very important that we become champions of these institutions.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned the ongoing price inflation.  That is a fact and a problem.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and his officials have engaged extensively with industry and with public sector stakeholders involved in the national development plan to take steps to introduce measures to tackle the risk to the delivery of public facilities under the national development plan.  They have introduced an inflation co-operation framework for those parties who are engaged in public works contracts. </p> <p>Notwithstanding these difficulties, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the Government remain entirely committed to the delivery of the investment programme and officials in the Department continue to keep the impact of these issues under constant review.</p></speech>

I have to ask the question why these specific dates were chosen. Are letters of correspondence which came in early or mid-January to be excluded from the debate and the engagement?</p> <p>I welcome the fact that there will be engagement under this review with all board members and I suggest that they may have a great deal to say.  Who set the terms and chose these dates?  Did the CEO of Inland Fisheries Ireland have a role in this or was it just the Department?  Why is the Minister using his powers to investigate the board but not the organisation of Inland Fisheries Ireland?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was suggested in the Minister&rsquo;s note that reports of significant irregularities that have been identified, including in relation to dormant accounts funding, procurement, vehicle insurance, use of Inland Fisheries Ireland vessels and leasing of the Aasleagh Lodge property, have been previously considered and addressed in statements of internal control.  The statement of internal control did not come to any premature conclusions on these items.  Some including property lease, procurement and dormant accounts funding are still subject to investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  All of these issues were very much under active investigation during 1 February to 27 April, so why are they not included in Conleth Bradley&rsquo;s review?  Why was not the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s investigation mentioned by the Minister in the note to Oireachtas Members?  </p><p>In response to reports by ASM Accountants and ByrneWallace law firm commissioned by the board, the CEO stood down the Inland Fisheries Ireland outreach and education operation and refused to accept some &euro;800,000 dormant accounts funding in 2021.  The Aasleagh Lodge lease agreement was also ended.  Why did the board, with the agreement of the CEO, take these decisions if it did not think the concerns were serious, as outlined in the Minister&rsquo;s note?  If the Minister&rsquo;s note to Oireachtas Members states that these matters were addressed, why was there no explanation given in the note to Oireachtas Members and why is there no investigation into these matters?  </p><p>The Minister&rsquo;s 16 May note also states that it was entirely inaccurate to suggest that an angling club that exists got funding.  IFI confirmed the club has a club constitution, bank accounts and tax clearance.  However, it did not have those when the fund was applied for or when the fund was approved.  How was the funding issued to a club with no bank account?  I think it was issued through a third party and I understand that there was an email thread to this effect.  </p><p>Following thorough investigation by the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland, it was discovered that there were 16 uninsured vehicles on the road at the time of a crash involving one of these vehicles on 10 August 2021 in Donegal.  Inaccurate information was presented to the board about the failures within IFI to ensure vehicles were insured.  This is evidence of an organisation that is not able to do its basic work.  </p><p>Why, after all this, is it the board that is being investigated?  It is the board that has pursued the truth and carried out investigations into wrongdoing.  It is simply because the board did not go along with the CEO and the Department.  It was independent, as it should be.  It was not willing to bend to the CEO&rsquo;s will if it disagreed.  The Minister, to my disappointment, has agreed to investigate the board, in my view, in the hope that the board will be disbanded and a more obedient board might be put in place.</p></speech>

The Senator will have to understand that I am here on behalf of the Minister, who cannot be here.  I will simply have to be very faithful to the script in front of me.  I am sure the Senator can take up the issues further with the Minister.</p> <p>I want to thank the Senator for the opportunity to clarify these important matters which were raised, of course, in this House earlier this month and were subsequently the subject of media reports on Inland Fisheries Ireland.  These reports have suggested significant irregularities have been identified in the organisation.  On 10 May, these assertions were fully addressed in a detailed information note provided to the Senator setting out the factual position in relation to same.</p> <p>The fact is that these issues have been previously considered and addressed through the then chair's statutory statement of internal control, external audit reviews and correspondence between IFI and the Department, and the IFI board's own assessment of these matters, which my Department has accepted.</p> <p>It should be noted that the suggestion made in this House and contained in media reports that IFI grant aided, via dormant accounts funding, an angling club that "did not exist" are entirely inaccurate.  IFI has confirmed that the club in question was established before the funds were applied for, has a club constitution, bank account and tax clearance certificate and is affiliated to the Irish Federation of Sea Angling Clubs.</p> <p>On foot of the Seanad Order of Business matter on 5 May, it was also suggested in the various media reports that the Minister had appointed a senior counsel to examine these matters.  This is inaccurate.  The Department fully accepts the assurances of the former chair and the board that these issues and allegations have been addressed, are being addressed or should be entirely refuted.</p> <p>The Minister has appointed Mr. Conleth Bradley, senior counsel, under section 18 of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 to carry out a review of the exercise by the board of its functions under the Act.  The focus of the section 18 review by Mr. Bradley is quite specific and relates to issues in correspondence between the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the board members of IFI from the period of 1 Feb to 27 April.  It includes letters of 4 March and 7 April from Department to the then chair, the 22 April letter from the then chair to Department, as well as email notifications and subsequent letters from other board members.</p> <p>As part of the review and as required under section 18(4) of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, IFI board members, including those who were members between the above dates but have since resigned, management and personnel are required to co-operate with the review and provide help to Mr. Bradley.  It is likely that Mr. Bradley will engage directly with all board members on an individual basis.  The review does not in any way relate to the matters raised on the Order of Business on 5 May and in subsequent media reports.</p></speech>

The last line said the review does not in any way relate the matters I raised on the Order of Business on 5 May.  That is the whole point &ndash; it should.  It should investigate all of the matters that I have raised.</p> <p>The Minister of State is right, it states my wording in relation to the matter is there on the top, but that is not what was read out by the Cathaoirleach.  It changed along the way, and it did not change within the Seanad Office without the intervention of the Department.  There was quite specific wording given to the Seanad Office by the Department.  For some reason, it did not want this to appear on the record - irregularities within Inland Fisheries Ireland from 1 January 2021 to date.  It had the wording that I put down, yet the script it provided to the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, did not answer any of the things relating to 2021.  It related to just 1 February to 27 April.</p> <p>The response from the office of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Department is a total whitewash.  There needs to be a thorough investigation into the matters that I have asked.  There needs to be a new note sent to Oireachtas Members regarding the inaccuracies that I have reported here today regarding its 16 May note.  I would ask that the terms of reference of the investigation be broadened to include the matters I outlined today.  I also ask the Minister to carry out a review, similar to that which was arranged for the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I ask for a full review of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  I had hoped, with a new CEO being appointed in 2020, I think it was, that we would have a new approach-----</p></speech>

It does not focus on those allegations which gave rise to subsequent media reports, nor does the section 18 review include other allegations made in an anonymous disclosure earlier this year against a senior member of IFI staff.  That is already the subject of a separate independent internal investigation in IFI and in respect of which the relevant staff member remains on suspension.  That investigation is entirely within the remit of IFI and neither my Department nor I have any role.  I want to be clear that the statutory provisions of section 18 are very specific, connected entirely with the performance of the board and could encompass in their scope the issues raised on the Order of Business on 5 May.  The focus of the review is entirely on the functioning of the board.</p> <p>Separately, I would like to inform the House that IFI is preparing a strategic plan for the consideration of the Minister, which would set out the structures and resources necessary to support Inland Fisheries Ireland in delivering its key statutory role of conserving, protecting, developing and promoting Ireland&rsquo;s precious inland fisheries resource.</p></speech>

It is a very important day for Ireland and Croatia.  I welcome the Croatian ambassador to the House.  Every May, Croatia celebrates its national day, Statehood Day, commemorating when the first multi-party parliament was constituted in 1990.  This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the international recognition of Croatia on 15 January 1992, when all member states, including Ireland, of what was then European Community recognised the Republic of Croatia as a sovereign and independent state.  Ireland and Croatia are now members of the European Union.  On 1 January next year, Ireland will celebrate 50 years as a member of the European Union and Croatia will celebrate 10 years as a member.</p><p>Links between our two countries stretch much further back.  Count Laval Nugent, born in Westmeath in 1777, was an Austrian field marshal who also served as a member of the Croatian Parliament.  A young James Joyce, of whom we are very proud - Senator Norris, the father of the House, is the recognised national expert on him - lived with Nora Barnacle in Pula for a brief spell in 1904.  A statute of James Joyce, one of Ireland's greatest writers, stands in the city of Pula, commemorating his time there.  We are particularly proud of that.  We share a love of language and culture.  The Croatian language is an examination subject in schools here.</p><p>Although there are only a couple of hundred Irish people living full-time in Croatia, that number is growing.  There is a large and vibrant Croatian community living in Ireland, comprising more than 20,000 people who contribute greatly to Irish society.  Eight Croatian cities took part in the global greening initiative to mark St. Patrick's Day, reflecting the growing friendship between our two countries.</p><p>It was a pleasure to meet the ambassador, H.E. Mr. Davor Vidi&scaron;, and chat with him about the excellent relations between our two countries.  We wish him, the Croatian community in Ireland and the Croatian community throughout the world a happy Statehood Day.  I noticed a couple of colleagues remarking informally about my next point to the ambassador outside the Chamber.  I travelled privately - incognito, if you like - with my family to Croatia a few years ago.  It was a wonderful experience.  It is a beautiful country with beautiful people who do not exploit or damage their tourism product in any way.  It is an excellent country and it was a great personal experience to visit it.</p><p>I wish our guests a wonderful Statehood Day.  It is great to have the ambassador with us.  I will attempt to wish him a happy independence day in my best Cavan Croatian.  <i>Sretan Dan dr&zcaron;avnosti</i>.</p><p>Before I call the Leader, I welcome the young people who are in the Gallery.  It is always important to have students and other young people visit the Houses of democracy.  I also welcome their teachers, who understand the importance of them being here.</p></speech>

I wish to raise a number of items.  The first is on the decision announced last night regarding the provision of special education regional centres, seemingly across Dublin.  I was surprised and shocked when I read the level of detail that was available.  I appreciate that more is still to come.  This would involve taking children from their communities, segregating them, bringing them into the region away from their communities.  We all know that segregation is the very opposite of inclusion.  Over the past 20 to 25 years, the whole educational process for children with additional and special needs has been towards integration in order that they can learn with their siblings, neighbours and friends within the community.  The fact that this approach has been announced is a retrograde step.  As Inclusion Ireland &ndash; The National Association for People with an Intellectual Disability said, it is ten steps back on the path to inclusive education.  I believe it is a wrong decision.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has said that she would act on section 37 to make sure that local schools would provide adequate places.  The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and I worked hard in the last D&aacute;il on the then Joint Committee on Education and Skills to make sure that was put in place.  I think that process has been initiated too late.  In terms of school planning I cannot understand why places must be looked for so late in the day.  We need to have a debate in this regard. </p><p>I also want to raise the new professional body for early childhood and school age professionals, Professional Educators and Managers Ireland, PEMI.  It was officially launched yesterday in Buswells Hotel by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman.  It is important and represents a significant milestone in the drive to professionalise the early childhood and school age profession.  All professions have a professional body that can represent members and act as stakeholders.  This is first time for those in early education.  It is a positive move and I look forward to further engagement with PEMI. </p><p>Finally I welcome the commitment of almost &euro;7 million to County Kildare from the Minister for Health.  That will go in particular to Monasterevin for the re-establishment of the day care centre; to St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Athy, to a 95-bed unit for older people; and &euro;500,000 will go to the health centre in Kilmeague - I know the Leader was in Kilmeague a few years ago - which is great for the community.  Moreover, a very sizeable amount of almost &euro;4 million will go to Naas General Hospital, which is badly needed for so many services there.  It is a very welcome injection for the health services for people in County Kildare.  </p></speech>

I also wish to express our solidarity with Croatia today.  Today I want to talk about accessibility.  We have come a long way in this country in recent years.  In these Houses in the past 15 years, accessibility has been facilitated in many ways but even this Chamber is still not fully accessible.  Yesterday our colleague, Councillor Vicki Casserly and her son James were here.  James has been highlighting very effectively some of the accessibility issues for wheelchair users throughout the country.  He joins a litany of other wheelchair users who have done this recently, including Paralympian Kerrie Leonard who has been very good at this as well, particularly in the context of sports.</p> <p>I want to raise an issue in my own area.  One of my neighbours, Owen Stubbs, is a 23-year-old wheelchair user who lives in Knocksinna in Foxrock.  He and his father Graham now have to take a local developer to court over the effective extinction of a right of way that was available to Owen previously which shortened his journey to a bus stop nearby.  The laneway that he would use is now being replaced by the developer, Richmond Homes, with a series of steps.  It is a nonsensical and unfair step by the developers.  It was not done unknowingly, because I know the family took great pains to ensure the developer was aware of it.  The particular development has caused untold difficulties for people in that area, not the development itself but the access routes.  It now goes through a quiet residential road to Newtownpark Avenue, which will create traffic problems instead of accessing directly the N11.  We are told that is because of regional planning guidelines.  I know we do not have time to go into that.  The notion that any developer or body would essentially reject the expressions of a local resident who is going to be massively discommoded by steps being put into a place like that is perhaps indicative of further overreach by developers but also a failure of local authorities to enforce this.  Part of the planning conditions for this development was for that lane, which is a public right of way, to remain fully and publicly accessible to the public.  Steps are still accessible to people who are not in a wheelchair but the public includes everybody in the public.  You cannot have a situation where a mechanism is put in place that excludes some members of the public and not others.  I want us to make it very clear that we support accessibility measures and do not accept situations where any individual, entity, local authority or State or Government agency is taking steps to reduce accessibility.  I support Owen Stubbs in his campaign to make sure that this remains a properly public and accessible right-of-way.  I hope he is successful in that regard.  I hope everybody involved sees the sense in removing steps and ensuring we have a properly accessible facility for everyone who lives in that area, including those in wheelchairs. </p></speech>

I have been informed that in order to be allowed to accede to associate membership of ICTU, the  Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, must go to the courts.  This is a human resources issue, an IR issue, not a legal issue.  I fail to understand why we are compelling RACO to go to the courts.  I ask the Leader to engage with the Minister to have it dealt with through the conciliation and arbitration scheme that is available, rather than go to the courts.</p> <p>Over the last few sessions I have alluded to the search and rescue operations and the rejection of the 415-page submission by the Air Corps.  Freedom of Information requests, FOIs, have been coming into me over the last few days.  I am going to share every document I have with every Member of this House because there is a level of arrogance coming from the Department of Transport - an unintelligent consumer of the service - which is unbelievable.  The level of bias, dismissing highly qualified professionals who put forward a 415-page submission, is not only wrong but it will cost this State &euro;400 million over the life of the contract that we should not pay.  I do not care if the Air Corps never gets it but I want an intelligent consumer to oversee this. </p> <p>The other piece of madness in this country which I had the privilege personally to look at was in Derrybrien, County Galway, at the weekend.  Some 70 turbines producing enough electricity for 50,000 houses were decommissioned, stopped in their tracks because of something that happened in 2003 regarding an environmental impact assessment.  There is a claim about a mudslide.  I saw where the mudslide was.  It is completely taken over again by nature.  That is what nature does.  There are miles of roads and fibre-optic cables in Derrybrien.  There is an electric grid going into Derrybrien.  There are 70 turbines in Derrybrien sitting idle, which cost this State &euro;70 million.  If they are to be decommissioned it will take two and a half or three years to get planning permission to decommission them.  We will never be able to restore Derrybrien to what it was before the turbines were put in.  For God&rsquo;s sake, in the middle of an international energy emergency, can we not go back to the EU and say we need to put this right?  I believe that particular establishment made over &euro;11.8 million for the State in one year.  In the month of January alone, &euro;1.8 million was returned to the State in profits.  I fully accept planning permissions must be followed through legally.  However, it has been in operation for 20 years and nobody has said a word.  Over those 20 years only two people have shown an objection.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

I think the Minister needs to come to the House to speak on the matter.  We need an open and honest debate on Derrybrien.  We need to decide what is more important in a national emergency - energy or an environmental impact assessment that was not completed and must be retrospectively completed.</p></speech>

We know the devastating impact and consequences of gambling addition on individuals and families throughout this State.  We have discussed and debated it.  We have heard very passionate contributions from Members.  In terms of protecting the integrity of this House as we prepare to debate very important and necessary gambling regulation legislation, a policy of no comment is no longer sustainable and acceptable.  It is important that the space is created for colleagues who are referenced in the media to address the very legitimate and understandable concerns that are out there.</p> <p>Finally, on the points raised today and the issue of passports, I note and welcome the increase in coverage of the passport issue in the media in recent times.  However, I wish to make a fundamental point and observation.  We can change the name of certain services.  We can ask for a junior Minister.  I would like to hear the arguments for that.  I am not saying I am opposed to it.  Unless we get to the point where we are investing in proper services where people can interface and engage directly with the passport service, we are not going to deal with the issues that I am sure all of us right across the House are dealing with all the time.  The vast bulk of people I deal with will accept that there will be a delay in obtaining their passport.  Their biggest frustration and problem is the total absence of any information.  I am sure that like me, the Leader and her constituency colleagues have spent hours on the phone trying to get through to someone on behalf of families who are waiting anxiously to find out details about their passport applications.  We need to light a candle as opposed to curse the dark, as it were.  The Government needs to understand that this policy of hoping the issue will settle and balance out at some stage is not cutting it.  We can see that it is not working.  We need proper investment.  We need facilities, offices and services that people can engage with, to enable them to access a human being, speak to someone and get information that they can then absorb and understand.</p></speech>

It is a glaring and worrying omission from the soon-to-be published Bill that people who are involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 will not be afforded their human rights.  As Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Mental Health, over a period of months I have chaired meetings as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021, which will reform the Mental Health Act 2001.  The Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021 and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021 are linked and are both hugely important in progressing and realising the rights of people with psychosocial disabilities, rights which they have under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  I am seriously concerned that the Government will miss this opportunity to meet the State's obligation under the UNCRPD by extending rights around capacity to people with psychosocial disabilities.  I am also concerned that we have undertaken pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021 and that two of the Department of Health amendments will require the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021 to be amended.  In the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, there is a commitment to commence the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to abolish wardships.  This is necessary to meet our obligations under the UNCRPD.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021 went to Cabinet last Tuesday.  It is now expected to be rushed through both Houses within a month.  The target is for a commencement date of 20 June for the decision support service.  It is very unlikely that that target will be met.</p> <p>During the very brief pre-legislative scrutiny for the Bill, Mental Health Reform and others highlighted that people involuntarily detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 were excluded from the provisions of the 2015 Act.  The Government's mental health policy, Sharing the Vision, is person-centred and underlined by principles of human rights and recovery.  Yet, involuntary patients do not have the right to have their advance wishes about treatment respected.  People who are detained in hospitals for mental health treatment are specifically excluded from legally-binding advance healthcare directives.  It is very worrying that they have no legal right to have their advance wishes respected, even though they had capacity to make decisions about their mental healthcare and treatment at the time of making their directive.  There is no other group of individuals that is specifically excluded from this legal right.  The exclusion is contrary to international human rights standards, including the UNCRPD.  I ask the Minister to address the House to provide clarity on the exclusion of people detained under the Mental Health Act from the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021.  The omission risks undermining Ireland's commitment to UNCRPD compliance and creating discordance between the legislation and the general scheme of the The Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021.</p></speech>

I welcome that and look forward to it becoming permanent.  I agree with the points made by colleagues in relation to RACO.  It should now be given the same opportunity to represent its members.  The dilly-dallying needs to stop.  It is important that it happens, and happens immediately.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Finally, I wish to discuss passports.

Like Senator Wilson, I would have hoped that someone like her could have done my intermediate certificate examination for me and wish her well.  She is a very brave young woman who deserves our huge admiration and praise.  I join with Senator Wilson in expressing my congratulations to the Georgian people and their ambassador on the anniversary of their independence day and birthday.  It is a pity that we could not acknowledge these events here on the exact date but that is another matter.</p> <p>The Road Traffic and Roads Bill to legalise e-scooters has been delayed, which is a pity.  Senator Horkan and I are members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  We have done a lot of work on pre-legislative scrutiny around the regulations concerning the use of e-scooters.  It is regrettable that the Minister for Transport has said that it will be at least 2023 before the long-awaited regulations are introduced.  As we know, the capital city of Dublin and cities like Cork have been left behind while every other big city in Europe has introduced e-scooters, and had them legalised and regularised.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the House for an urgent debate on the regulation of e-scooters and to discuss the new Road Traffic and Roads Bill so that the legislation can be teased out in here in an informal way.  We must also allow local authorities to begin to plan for the shared e-scooter schemes.  We have seen the success of these shared schemes for e-scooters in many European cities and we have expressions of interest in this country from a number of users.  I hope that we can see what is now called powered personal transporters, which is a wonderful name for e-scooters, being regularised.  I hope that the Leader will facilitate a debate on the use of e-scooters prior to the summer recess if we do not have legislation ready.  E-scooters are currently being used illegally in Irish cities and cause great angst.  An e-scooter is a wonderful way to get around and a sustainable mode of transport.  It is important that we have a debate, as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I say well done to Senator Ahearn and Ms Darmody.</p> <p>This week a site notice has gone up in the Laytown area regarding temporary planning permission for a period of five years for the development of an emergency temporary accommodation campsite on a site of 15.8 ha near the Laytown train station.  The development will consist of 569 two-bedroom single-storey homes.  This emergency accommodation campsite will house around 2,300 Ukrainian refugees in a village with a population of only a couple of thousand people.  Needless to say, the plans have raised a few eyebrows and it does not sit easy with me.  I am 100% against the development of any more direct provision-style housing or camps.  I believe that an even spread of refugee intake according to the ability of a local area to adequately care for them is the best way forward.  The development seems to be a solution born of convenience and is not for the Ukrainian people who find themselves here but for the Government, which wants to keep them all in one spot to make it easier to deal with them.  Last week or a few weeks ago, I asked in this House for a centralised response to the crisis but I did not mean that we had to centralise the people themselves.</p> <p>Under delivering is a natural result of over promising.  The Government&rsquo;s policy of an uncapped intake of people fleeing the Russian invasion will result in reduced quality care and services for those who end up in this country.  Ireland must do all that it can to help but we must have a serious conversation on how far we can go.  We owe it to the refugees that we have taken in to treat them properly and putting thousands of them into a custom-built segregated site falls short of that.</p> <p>All that being said, if the Government insists on pursuing this course of action, then it should throw up a few more temporary houses for every person in direct provision.  If we are going to pay the fixed costs anyway, then we might as well make a few more units and treat all of our refugees equally.</p> <p>There is a 150-acre site at Thornton Hall in north County Dublin.  The State paid &euro;30 million for the site but it is being rented out for &euro;200 a month.  Surely to God one does not need to be a genius to come up with solutions and find ways to build sustainable, long-term housing for people who need it, not only for refugees but people on the social housing lists and people who seek affordable housing.  The Government has a site that is ready for people to build a small town on.  I recommend that that is done as I firmly believe that practical solutions need practical ideas.</p></speech>

I congratulate her and wish her all the best with her examination.  She is a very brave young girl and I say fair play to her for doing the junior certificate maths paper.</p> <p>I wish to mention the offers of support and accommodation made by members of the public to Ukrainians who are coming into the country.  Recently I have had a number of calls from residents, especially in the Limerick area, who told me that they had received a text or acknowledgement of their offer of accommodation but heard nothing since.  The Irish Red Cross is involved but people do not know whether local authorities or who else are involved in providing support.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on how we can move this matter forward because there is a lot of confusion among people.  People were so good to offer support and I understand that the offers were overwhelming but now we must tell the people who made the offers what is happening and update them.</p> <p>I have received communications from a number of people in the Caherconlish area of Limerick as it has been announced that the postmistress will retire on 4 June and the local people will be left with no post office.  An Post has advertised the post but nobody has come forward to date.  Caherconlish may be an outlying village but its population is growing.  The village has a shop, a petrol station, one or two pubs and a community centre.  The post office is vitally important especially for older people in terms of meeting their neighbours and collecting their pensions on a weekly basis.  I ask the Leader to raise the issue with the relevant Minister.</p></speech>

I believe that the Leader may have a child doing the leaving certificate examination this year.  These students have had a difficult couple of years with Covid in terms of their learning environment.  This week there have been a lot of graduation ceremonies, masses and various other events and the examinations will start in a couple of weeks but I do not wish to panic anybody.  Most sixth years are finishing this week and, therefore, we should acknowledge that they have had a difficult time.  They are leaving second level education and will head out into the world.  I wish them all well with their exams and their future.  Equally, I wish their families, friends and everybody who has been involved in their education well.  I thank everyone in the school community, including the teaching staff and the ancillary staff, including secretaries, caretakers, coaches and grounds people.  These are all of the people who make education what it is.  During the pandemic people appreciated how hard teachers work because they experienced what it is like to teach.  Students were at home all day and every day while their parents or guardians tried to run their own lives and work lives yet simultaneously try to keep people involved with education.  I pay tribute to this year's sixth year students who will shortly head out into the world.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I wish them the best and I encourage them to try their best; that is all they can do.

Mr. Collins was chairman of Cork County Council and he had a unique style of representation.  He had no mobile phone, computer or social media.  He held his clinic by sitting on the wall outside the church in Midleton every Saturday and yet in the 2019 local elections he topped the poll.  Perhaps there is a lesson in that.  I wish him well after 55 years of loyal service to the people of Cork.</p> <p>I would also like to welcome Cara and her parents to the Gallery and I congratulate her on what she is about to embark on.  I admire her courage and determination and she is welcome to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>As the Leas-Chathaoirleach will know, AsIAm is the charity that supports people with autism in this country and it is running a survey to establish the number of people with autism who are not in appropriate schools, who are not in schools at all or who are travelling long distances to get to schools.  There is no proper database available that people can readily access on people with autism and their access to education.  Education is a right in this country but unfortunately and sadly, it is not a right for all families.  It should not be down to AsIAm to establish the facts surrounding this; rather the Government needs to lead on it.  However, I would encourage every family that has a child or young person with autism who is not accessing appropriate education to fill out the survey, which will enable AsIAm to campaign effectively for more resources, including targeted resources, and to ensure the resources are focused in the right direction.</p></speech>

One of the things that amazed me as I was getting into this issue this week is that Caherconlish has doubled its population in the last decade to 1,500 people so it is hard to understand how a post office there would not be viable.  It would be great if the Leader would be kind enough to write to the Minister to see what else can be done to support the people of Caherconlish.</p> <p>The key issue I want to speak on today is housing.  I found it chilling to hear that last Monday in Limerick alone, some 80 eviction notices were received by the homeless action team there.  From speaking to colleagues, this is not uncommon across the country and there has been a huge rise in eviction notices.  The people we are speaking to who deal with housing in Limerick have never been more concerned, and that is saying something given the last few years we have been through.</p> <p>The following point is not party political; I hope it is just a common sense point.  We need to declare a housing emergency and put a ban on evictions.  Things are already extremely bad and despite the best efforts in spin, things are getting worse and not better.  If one takes the time to speak to officials, particularly the officials in Limerick, they will confirm that.  We have a perfect tsunami of massive evictions and a 15% rise in rents in Limerick, and we have a ridiculously low threshold such that if one earns more than &euro;32,500 one does not even qualify for social housing.  People are trapped in a rental market that is getting ever more vicious with the rise in rents.</p> <p>We have a terrible situation with the Shannon Arms property with 150 people, including 60 families, being made homeless by landlords.  They say they will do up the properties on a big scale but we also see that when they have gotten rid of tenants they have brought new ones in at even more extortionate rents, particularly exploiting foreign nationals.  This again points to the fact that we do not have proper tenant rights in this country.  I would seriously ask my Government colleagues what it is that they see wrong with Irish tenants that they will not give them the same rights that are enjoyed across most of Europe regarding security of tenure.  We are in a housing emergency and I am calling for an urgent debate on the matter.  I am genuinely concerned at what we will say to people in the coming weeks in Limerick.</p></speech>

I heard her on the radio this morning and well done to her.  She should not have to be making all the efforts she is making but she is doing a great service to children all over the country.  They will all be proud of her and I am sure they are cheering her on.</p> <p>I would like to raise the provision of abortion care.  As we all know, it is four years since the vast majority of people in Ireland voted to repeal the eighth amendment and for the provision of abortion care.  However, today only one in ten GPs are offering abortion care, in 50% of our counties there are fewer than ten GPs offering abortion care and only 11 out of the 19 maternity hospitals are providing abortion care.  This means that women in a distressed situation who are vulnerable have to travel long distances.  This is adding to their stress and vulnerability and it is also creating an urban-rural divide.  There is a difference between the care potentially provided to a woman in Dublin and a woman in Longford and Carlow, and we all know that is wrong.</p> <p>To be fair to the Minister for Health, no other Minister for Health has done so much for women's health.  Some &euro;31 million is ring-fenced this year alone for women's health, including for the following: the provision of free contraception; free period poverty measures; endometriosis and menopause clinics; and significant capital funding for the Rotunda Hospital in my constituency of Dublin Central.</p> <p>There has also been the creation, for the first time, of a real and secular national maternity hospital on the site of St. Vincent's University Hospital, which will provide all women with healthcare services, free of any sort of religious interference.  It would be helpful for the Leader to write to the CEO of the HSE.  We all know the review of the legislation is taking place.  When it comes to the operation of the services, we should ask the HSE what actions it is taking to support GPs and our maternity hospitals to ensure that abortion care is freely available to women in every community in our country.</p></speech>

It is great to have them here and they did a wonderful interview on the radio this morning.  I congratulate them and they are more than welcome.</p> <p>I will address a theme that the Leader and the Leas-Chathaoirleach are well aware of and that I have often spoken about, that is, dyslexia services.  We have an issue in that many schools are doing something called Drumcondra tests, which most Members are aware of.  That basically means that the end-of-year assessments go to the Department.  Many students use technology to help them read, particularly in subjects like English, but more importantly at times, for mathematics as well.  We have some schools that do not know whether or not the technology should be allowed for those Drumcondra tests are not.</p> <p>I was contacted by a woman during the week who informed me that her child's school's proposal is to do two exams, one with the technology and one without it, and that they would then see where her daughter is after that.  I had another lady on to me in the last half an hour and the technology was just taken away from her child for the exams.  There is an awful lot happening here and it is not just the mental stress of it but there is a lack of policy from the Department.  The Department does not know how to deal with technology and it does not know where it is appropriate and where it is not.  If anything, it is putting its head in the sand for the last three or four years and it has not come forward.</p> <p>I have continually raised this issue and we need to get clarification when it comes to these State exams for primary school students who are using technology every day of the week.  Can they use it for their State exams in these Drumcondra tests?  To me, it is like taking glasses away from a person who needs them to read and making them do an exam.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is appalling and is causing such stress on the children and families and, in some regards, on the teachers also, who are completely frustrated by the lack of direction from the Department.  </p><p>I ask the Leader to write to the Department of Education to bring clarity to this issue and to give direction to the principals of the primary schools of Ireland because at the moment, 10% of our primary school population have no direction on this issue.

I ask the Leader for a debate on radon gas.  Overnight, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, published a report with shocking figures.  It says that there are 17,000 houses at risk from radon gas.  It talks about the link, in particular, to various cancers but, in particular, to lung cancer.  Radon gas is a serious public health issue around this country and it needs to be addressed.  I have suggested today at another group meeting that we should look at a building energy rating-type certification for every property that now comes on the market in respect of a test for radon gas.  All sites where new housing is being built should also be tested for radon.  It should be mandatory over a phased period of possibly five years, in that there should be a radon certificate for every single home in this State.  The evidence is clear and is sharply linked to a major increase in lung cancer.  The EPA posted all of this information on its website this morning.  More importantly, it has posted an interactive map of the entire country which I looked at this morning.  One can put in one&rsquo;s Eircode and can identify one&rsquo;s home or site as to its potential exposure to radon gas.</p> <p>I am also calling that these maps would be interactive with county development plan maps at some point in the future.  In the meantime, they should be on display in all of our 31 local authorities because people need to know about them.  We need a public campaign on radon gas based upon facts that have been released and are now published on the EPA website this morning.  We need to tell people in their communities right across this country that they can go on to these interactive maps today, as I have gone on one already, and can see and identify the potential exposure to radon gas where they live.</p> <p>This is an important issue upon which we need to have a debate at some point.  I know that there are other issues around problems with particular sites so this is a very big issue.  We need to look at it and to have a reasonable debate based upon the facts in respect of radon gas and the serious challenges that it is now causing and will cause to public health.</p></speech>

I believe it is in fact earlier than the publication of last year&rsquo;s plan.</p> <p>There are a number of projects noted and, as we know in regard to capital projects, they are slow burners in many cases.  I renew my call for a debate on the capital plan for health across the country.  There are enough issues of concern and which we would like to see expedited.</p> <p>In Merlin Park University Hospital, I welcome the appraisal of a plan to develop a new cystic fibrosis unit as well as a ground and first floor outpatient department with 50 consulting rooms.  These are replacements for facilities that will be impacted in University Hospital Galway, UHG.</p> <p>I also welcome the appraisal for a third endoscopy unit and the provision of a new helipad and medical laboratory building to house all existing facilities which are currently located in prefab accommodation, as well as a site appraisal and associated health planning assessments for a trauma centre in UHG.  </p> <p>I also welcome the new emergency department with a ward block for maternity and paediatric inpatient beds, totalling 30 new and 190 replacement beds.  This project has been knocking around for a great number of years and I will continue to maintain the pressure to see this advance towards planning permission, which it is hoped will be seen this year, according to Mr. Paul Reid, CEO of the HSE.</p> <p>I also welcome funding for the development of a new 40-bed unit at St. Anne's community nursing unit in Clifden as well as in Clifden District Hospital, which is being replaced.  A commitment to the upgrade of St. Anne&rsquo;s was made to HIQA in respect of the enhancement of the privacy and dignity of residents, who have multi-occupancy rooms at present with shared sanitary accommodation, to almost exclusively single en suite rooms.  This is very important.  </p> <p>The new build will also seek to provide for emerging needs by the inclusion of a ten-bed dementia unit and rooms that can accommodate bariatric residents.  The new build is on two levels of the dementia unit.  Ten short-stay beds are planned for the ground floor and 20 long-stay beds for the upper floor.  </p> <p>I welcome the progression of that very important plan for St. Anne&rsquo;s and for the Clifden District Hospital which are areas of great importance.  It is a long way from Clifden to Galway city, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows, and it is important that we continue to provide services for short-stay and long-stay residents within the region.</p></speech>

It is a great honour for me coming from Ballinalee in County Longford to welcome the sixth class pupils from my own local national school, Scoil Samhthann, and their teacher, Ms McCormack, and the vice-principal, Mrs. Farrelly.  I hope they enjoy their stay.</p> <p>The name "Samhthann" comes from an abbess at a Christian site in our community that was founded by St. Patrick.  There is a great history which goes back to there.  I have to say that it was that school which gave me my grounding and learning, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the school.  My three children are in the school and it is a fantastic facility with great supports.  I could not praise the staff half enough, to be quite honest.</p> <p>I take this opportunity to wish Mrs. Farrelly well as she is retiring in the next couple of weeks, having served - she will probably give out to me for saying this - her full term in teaching life in our school.  I can remember the very first day, which I was chatting about earlier on, when she came to our school and opened our eyes to games such as basketball, rounders and various sports which we had never played before.  She has been a fantastic teacher for all of the children who went through the school and one will not meet any pupil who will say anything but positive things about her.</p> <p>I also wish Ms McCormack well.  It has been announced in the past number of days that she will be the next deputy principal in the school and I wish her well.  I thank them both for all they do for the children in my community.  </p> <p>I also want to wish the children very well as they go on to secondary school.  They are a fantastic bunch of children and will do very well in life.  I wish them well and it is an honour for me to be here and have them come to visit.  I am just the second person from my community to serve in the Oireachtas, the last being the late General Se&aacute;n Mac Eoin who served in D&aacute;il Eireann for over 40 years.  I hope our visitors enjoy their day.</p></speech>

I welcome Senator Carrigy&rsquo;s class here today.  It is a very proud thing to have one&rsquo;s own primary school come to visit Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Senator Carrigy does a great deal of work for and on education in this Chamber and when he talks about it, he is thinking about the school in Ballinalee.</p> <p>I thank my colleagues for acknowledging the presence of Cara Darmody here today.  She is one of the most amazing young people one is ever likely to meet.  She is an 11-year-old and is here with her parents, Mark and Noelle.  It is important to acknowledge them and I am grateful that people have welcomed them here today.  There are two other people, Neil and John Darmody, who would also love to be here.  Cara is here to raise awareness of autism and to fight for services that her two brothers need, as do many like them across the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->She has raised &euro;17,000 already.  The money has been raised by means of her plan to sit the junior certificate maths paper next month.  People do not know this, but she announced last week that, as a sixth class student, she will sit the leaving certificate paper next year.  She is a phenomenal individual.  We are very proud of her in our parish.  Everyone in the parish is right behind what the family is doing.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Josepha Madigan, for meeting the family this morning.  They have a busy schedule today.  We had a really productive discussion on autism services and on what needs to be changed.  The Minister of State was very open to what Cara, Noelle and Mark put forward, and I thank her for that.  It is a brilliant story.  What Cara has done is amazing.  However, she should not have to do it.  There is a greater good, namely, getting services for Neil and John.  It is important to state that none of this money is going to them.  Rather, it is going to Scoil Chormaic in Cashel and to Ardfinnan National School.  None of the money is for Cara or her brothers; what she is doing is about raising awareness.  I wish her well; she is an inspiration to us.  I would be grateful if the Leader could meet the family following the Order of Business.  She would be very impressed by them.</p><p>On a separate note and while we are talking about education, I spoke yesterday about Grange National School.  I want to inform the House at the extension has been agreed and funding has been provided to the primary school.  The principal, Marie Keating, and the board of management are happy with that.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

The example she is setting is phenomenal.  I welcome her and wish her every success in her exams in the next couple of weeks and in the task she will be taking on next year.  We talk a lot here about the stress that our leaving and junior certificate students go through.  From the smile on her face since she arrived into the Chamber this morning, it seems that Cara does not need to be stressed at all.  I congratulate her and her mum and dad, who are incredibly proud of her for the example she is setting.  I send her every good wish.  She is very welcome here this morning.</p> <p>It is very clear that Senator Ahern has pull that the rest of us do not have.  I congratulate him on his success this week.</p> <p>Senator Kyne spoke about the capital plan and called for a debate.  The email that came into all of our inboxes this week was very welcome.  There is a need for a debate on the projects that will be advanced.  We can all champion them, but we should have a chat about those that are not on the list.</p> <p>Senator Carrigy welcomed visitors from his local school in Balinalee.  I congratulate Mrs. Farrelly and wish her a happy, healthy and long retirement.  I am sure all Senators will agree that the teachers who paid an extra bit of attention to us in school, whether that was in respect of hockey, basketball, music or rounders, remain in our minds for years to come.  Mrs. Farrelly probably had thousands of children through her good hands over the years.  I wish her a healthy and happy retirement, and thank her for her commitment to her community.</p> <p>I read and heard the reports on the matter mentioned by Senator Boyhan.  It is shocking that something so dangerous is lurking in practically all of our communities and nobody knew anything about it.  I will certainly arrange a debate on that.  It is very informative of him to raise the matter because while the EPA posted information, all of those who did not read a newspaper or listen to RT&Eacute; this morning will still be blissfully ignorant of what is happening.  A national and local authority campaign would be very welcome.  Let us see if we can follow up on that.</p> <p>Senator Lombard spoke about the inconsistencies around how test young children with dyslexia in primary school.  I will write to the Minister for Education and her Department to seek clarity on the use of IT equipment in order to give those children the aids they need and to provide them with the best opportunity possible when they go into secondary school.  We will send that letter today.</p> <p>Senator Fitzpatrick asked that we send a letter to the chair of the HSE requesting information on the support he is providing to GP and maternity services around the country.  I can certainly do that.  I very much welcome the review of the legislation that is due to happen in the next number of weeks.  We will debate the review once it has been issued.</p> <p>Senator Gavan gave us a shocking statistic, namely, that 80 eviction notices were issued in the confines of Limerick alone last Monday.  I will try to organise a debate because if his officials are telling him that - I have no doubt it is true - it is something that is not unique to Limerick and we will have to examine the issue.  I will come back to him on a date for such a debate as soon as I can.</p> <p>Senator Conway wished Councillor Noel Collins a very successful, happy and long requirement, which is something we can all echo.  We all seem obsessed with communication and have so many ways to communicate with people who come to us with issues.  Yet, a gentleman sitting on a wall on a Saturday can top the poll every time there is an election.  I and others may be a bit OCD about that.  I wish him very well.</p> <p>The Senator also spoke about AsIAm and the autistic register with regard to the deficits in the provision of services .  He is correct; we should not need a charity to do that.  It should be something that is done by the State.  I will raise the issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.</p> <p>Senator Horkan wished all of our sixth year leaving certificate students every success in the weeks ahead.  He is right; I have one at home.  He is finishing school tomorrow and could not be happier about it.  I look forward to the sunshine we will get once the exams start, please God, because we have not had much of it in the past couple of weeks.  On a serious note, I wish them all well.  They have had a very difficult number of years.  Some children did not do the junior certificate and have had a difficult time.  I hope the stress levels are as minimal as they can be and that they enjoy a very long, happy and, sunny summer.  Please God it will work out for them.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne's comments were echoed by Senator Gavan.  She asked me to write a letter to the Minister with regard to the prospective closure of a post office.  I have heard all week about the financial supports on the way for our post offices, but we need to make sure that happens before there are closures.  The Senator referred to small rural communities, and Senator Gavan pointed out that these communities are growing.  Post offices are vitally important for communities.  People from larger towns and cities do not really appreciate how important post offices are in smaller communities.  We need to support them and ensure they maintain their businesses.</p> <p>Senator Keogan raised the issue of planning permission for 569 houses in south County Meath.  As is the case for me, a number of people have contacted her.  I have made inquiries with the Minister regarding the nature and type of, as well as the infrastructural amenities required for, such a community.  Once I have that information, I will come back to the Senator.  I take her point about Thornton Hall.  It is a site I pass every single day.  It has the best roads, light, facilities, water and sewerage, yet it is a town waiting to be built.  I am not sure what we are waiting on.  That is another days work.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on the road traffic Bill, in particular with regard to e-scooters.  I will organise that as soon as I can.</p> <p>Senator Wilson spoke about Independence Day in Georgia.  I wish the Georgians well.</p> <p>The Senator also mentioned the inclusion of RACO in ICTU negotiations and the upcoming public sector talks.  It needs to be included and I hope the issue is resolved today because I am quite aware that the Minister's intention is to include it.  We should do that today.  He also suggested that we have a passport office in the north west, something echoed by other colleagues in the past number of days.</p> <p>Senator Black is looking for a debate on an incredibly important issue.  It is one that is somehow slipping between two stools, namely, pre-legislative scrutiny of the mental health legislation and the capacity Bill that is currently being drafted by the Minister.  We have to ensure that people's civil and human rights are upheld.  Anybody who makes his or her expressed wishes known for medical treatment, whether it be mental or physical health, when in the whole of his or her health, and had the capacity to do so, has to have his or her wished honoured.  That should be enshrined in legislation.  We will organise that debate as quickly as we can.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile welcome to the coverage, albeit negative, regarding passports in the past couple of days.  He asked for clarity on the information people receive when applying for passports in order to ensure that they will not be obliged to wait weeks.  That is a view we all share.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have talked in the last couple of weeks about how successful it can be, with people making applications and receiving a passport in the post three or four days later.  Other really unfortunate people have waited for months, which is far too long, and the Minister needs to address it as quickly as he can.</p><p>Senator Craughwell mentioned two issues.  The first was about RACO, which he has spoken about all week.  He received more information from freedom of information requests about the search and rescue tender, which he is going to publish.  He is seeking a debate on Derrybrien in Galway, which I will organise as soon as I can.</p><p>Senator Ward spoke about Owen Stubbs and the bizarre reinstatement of a public right of way that does not actually give a right of way to people in his constituency.</p><p>Senator O'Loughlin opened this morning by seeking a debate on the new special educational regional centres announced by the Minister this week.  She welcomed a new organisation for early educators called PEMI.</p></speech>

They both seek to address the inclusion of online content by which a person bullies or humiliates another person in the list of non-offence specific categories in the Bill.  Both amendments aim to achieve a similar end, but go about doing so in different ways.  Amendment No. 145 seeks to delete the inclusion of &quot;online content by which a person bullies or humiliates another person&quot; in the list of non-offence specific harmful online content.  This particular amendment is a straight deletion of the definition of &quot;harmful online content&quot; as it stands, which is defined as &quot;online content by which a person bullies or humiliates another person&quot;.  In my view, the definition currently provided in the Bill is vague and ill-defined, to such an extent that it is unsuitable for inclusion in legislation.</p><p>It is not clear from the existing definition what sort of content would constitute bullying or humiliating content.  As a result, this provision creates a huge potential for overreach by social media platforms.  For example, will they be so concerned about being stung by this regulation that they will overcompensate by removing all potentially humiliating content from their online platforms, or will they begin to remove posts where citizens ridicule the decisions of policymakers and legislators for fear that the language being used is too humiliating?  The vagueness and subjectivity of this term makes it completely inappropriate for a legislative provision.  By making this provision, we risk granting social media platforms an inappropriate level of discretion over what sort of speech they allow on their platforms and what sort of speech they suppress.  It would be reckless of us as policymakers to include such provisions in important legislation, which will grant powers to social media providers to limit the free speech of users.</p><p>Additionally, no clear division is created here between the content which is acceptable criticism and that which is unacceptable humiliation.  One fundamental principle of which we should be mindful when creating laws is that the people the laws apply to should be able to understand and correctly interpret them.  I do not think this is possible if we maintain the inclusion of a vague definition.  This is a serious civil liberties concern.  It is unclear what threshold is being created in the Bill given that the wording is so ambiguous.  Is the threshold on bullying or humiliating behaviour?  Does criticism of a person in authority count as humiliating behaviour?  This wording sets worrying foundations whereby we could find public figures who exert enormous power over politics and the economy seeking to make themselves immune from ridicule or criticism.  There needs to be a clear and more well defined threshold by which we can easily separate out criticism and even ridicule from behaviour which is actual bullying.</p><p>We are all interested in preventing bullying online.  It is clear that is a common goal we all share, but we cannot do this with such a broad and crude provision in the Bill as it stands, which does not seek to give bullying behaviour a proper definition.  I stress again that this wording is in conflict with the principles we should follow as legislators, that is, that people should be able to read the law and know how to follow it.  The way this section is currently drafted, it is not clear that someone would be able to read this provision and know whether they are breaking the rules by ridiculing a powerful person online.  In my view, it either needs to be removed from the Bill, as amendment No. 145 would achieve, or be further clarified, as amendment No. 146 seeks to achieve.  Alternatively, it could be clarified by the Minister and the Department by means of the introduction of a ministerial amendment on Report Stage.</p><p>Amendment No. 146 is an alternative to amendment No. 145.  It seeks to replace the language in section 139A(3)(a) with:</p> <blockquote> 	&quot;online content by which a person sends repeated, abusive communications to another person, to an extent that a reasonable person would conclude constituted intimidating or bullying behaviour.&quot; </blockquote> <p>In this way, we can seek to create a clear threshold that would separate legitimate criticism and disagreement online from actual bullying behaviour.  This amendment, rather than simply deleting the vague definition of bullying or humiliating content, seeks to replace the definition with a stronger one that is less open to interpretation.  This amendment seeks to create a clearer and less ambiguous threshold, which would allow online providers to actually identify the kinds of bullying content which the original definition seeks to capture.  This amendment defines bullying content as &quot;repeated, abusive communications&quot;.</p><p>This makes sense as, for example, we would not want social media platforms to simply remove messages that legitimately criticise the decisions made by people in positions of authority.  We must be conscious of the fact that the way in which people engage with the issues of the time has changed.  A significant portion of our communication takes place online or on social media platforms and while certain language that can be directed at people in positions of authority might sometimes not seem like the kindest, sometimes it is an absolutely legitimate expression of political dissatisfaction.  To ask online providers to suppress this kind of speech would be a gross overreach.  I am sure that everyone here in the House has been subject to messages of criticism online, but just because the language invoked by an individual in this way might cause offence to us as individuals, that does not mean that we should legislate for people not to be able to express their frustration or dissatisfaction in this way.  By inserting the new definition, the legislation would instead identify bullying behaviour as behaviour which consists of repeated, abusive communications, which a reasonable person would believe constitutes bullying.</p><p>It is my hope that this clearer definition would fulfil the intended aim of the original provision, which is to put a stop to bullying behaviour online without unintentionally creating a chilling effect, whereby social media providers overcompensate by removing all negative, critical posts from their platforms.  Again, we all wish to restrict bullying behaviour online, but we cannot simply discard civil liberties concerns in order to do so.  This amendment creates a much clearer threshold in this Bill whereby the average person would clearly understand that bullying behaviour is unacceptable, while legitimate criticism and dispute is fine.</p></speech>

The current definition in section 44, inserting section 139A into the Broadcasting Bill 2009, was arrived at through extensive consultation and engagement with the Office of the Attorney General.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It refers to online content by which a person bullies or humiliates another person and subjects that definition to a risk test regarding risk to a person's life or risk of significant harm to a person's physical or mental health where the harm is reasonably foreseeable.  The proposed amendments would have the effect of replacing the current definition with a narrower definition focused on repeated abusive behaviour and to subject that definition to a reasonable person test.  In this regard, I believe that the content intended to be covered by the amendment is covered by the category of offence-specific content which refers in turn to the updated offence of harassment under the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, Coco's Law, under section 45 of the Bill inserting Schedule 3 into the 2009 Act.</p><p>The category of harmful online content regarding cyberbullying is intended to be broader than the matters covered by Coco's Law but subject to the risk test.  I do not believe it would be desirable to limit the definition of cyberbullying in this manner and I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

Bullying is an objective test.  There is a repeated element of bullying where there may not be a repeated element to humiliating.  When we put those things together we have to have a clear definition of what humiliation means in this context.  Someone can be subjectively humiliated but how do we even begin to measure that?  Bullying is a little more straightforward because we have definitions in law about objective testing of bullying versus humiliation.</p></speech>

By the end of today, the Minister will have been in the Chamber for 16 hours dealing with many aspects of this Bill.  We agreed not to subject it to a guillotine because of its importance and that we would go through the Bill.  I would hope that during today's discussion that brevity and concise contributions would help.  However, if we debate many issues in depth at this Stage, I would ask that when we come to Report Stage, we do not re-debate all the issues.  The Minister has given a commitment to reflect on some of the views here.  I express sincere thanks on behalf of those of us who have dealt directly with the officials and the Minister to try to come up with some suitable wording on this. Given the debate here, I hope that we do not revisit all the issues on Report Stage and that if colleagues have issues, they would consult with the officials in advance of that.</p> <p>Those of us who sat on the joint committee dealing with this faced the challenge around what was awful and lawful.  Where do we draw the line between somebody throwing a couple of nasty comments and a process of harassment?  I would say to Senator Ruane that if one reads section 139A(3) in conjunction with 139A(4), as the Minister said, it makes it fairly clear what the threshold required is.  I am quite sympathetic because it was one of the things the joint committee struggled with.  The other thing is that it is quite subjective.  Something might be water off a duck's back to me, if someone was trying to bully or humiliate me, but someone else could find it much tougher in a different situation.  It is difficult but I think it is covered by the definitions in the section.</p></speech>

An obvious omission here is disinformation or false information.  Ms Frances Haugen appeared before the joint committee in February and agreed that disinformation should be included as a type of harmful content.  I think we are all aware of the dangers of harmful content.  Many people in Ireland, particularly those who were vulnerable and isolated, fell victim to online disinformation during the height of the pandemic.  In the United States, we saw the effect of false information around presidential elections and there have been devastating consequences in Myanmar and Ethiopia.  There will be a gaping hole in the Bill if disinformation is excluded and, therefore, I hope the Minister will consider the amendment.  The joint committee recommended in its pre-legislative scrutiny report that it be included in the Bill.  The Department's response referred to the Digital Services Act.</p></speech>

I do not propose to accept the amendment for a number of reasons.  Disinformation and false information intended to mislead is being tackled on an EU-wide basis through a number of mechanisms, including the Digital Services Act, political agreement on which was agreed on Friday, 22 April.  The Government has decided that Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will be the digital service co-ordinator which is the primary regulator under the Digital Services Act.  My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has led Ireland's negotiations on the Digital Services Act.  </p> <p>The EU code of practice on disinformation is a Commission initiative which has involved a range of online platforms, leading social networks, advertisers and advertising industry players to sign up to self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation.  It is the Commission's intention that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act.</p> <p>In addition, the Commission has also established the European Digital Media Observatory, which has a hub in DCU and which has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code.  While I note the intent of the amendment, the matter will be addressed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department in the context of the legislation necessary to give effect to the implementation of the Digital Services Act in Ireland.  I do not believe it would be useful to cut across this work at this stage.</p> <p>Senators will be aware that in March the Government decided that once established under the Bill, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n would act as the primary regulator termed the digital service co-ordinator under the Digital Services Act.  It made the decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and the approaches of Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n and the digital services co-ordinator, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise for implementation and enforcement.</p> <p>The Digital Services Act is still undergoing negotiation on a number of technical matters.  The final text of the regulation is not available.  Should the code of practice on disinformation evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act, as proposed by the European Commission, I would expect that Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n would have a role to play in its capacity as the digital services co-ordinator.</p> <p>There is a very specific problem with disinformation which is designed to influence the results of elections and referendums as these processes are at the heart of our democracy.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government, and Heritage asked the Attorney General to prepare proposals for inclusion in the Electoral Reform Bill around the protection of our electoral process against disinformation, with a view to bringing amendments to that Bill which, I understand, is due to commence Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il next week.</p></speech>

As it stands, the Bill provides at section 44 - inserting sections 139B and 139C into the Broadcasting Act 2009 - that it is within an coimisi&uacute;n's sole discretion as to whether it considers making a proposal to the Minister for a further category of harmful online content.  No specific role is provided for the Minister, the Government or indeed the Oireachtas joint committee at that point of the process.  The reason for this was to safeguard the independence of an coimisi&uacute;n, particularly regarding a matter as sensitive as proposals for further categories of harmful online content, and to ensure that the process for making a proposal under these provisions was separated from the political process.  In this regard, the directive sets a high bar regarding the independence of regulatory bodies and requires member states to ensure that they are both legally distinct from the government and functionally independent of their respective governments and of any other public or private body.  In light of these considerations, I am not proposing to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

The amendment would require an coimisi&uacute;n, when undertaking a public consultation on a proposal for a new category of harmful online content, to publish the draft proposal four weeks before the consultation begins and to require that such a consultation should be at least four weeks.  I do not propose to accept the amendment as it appears to be overly prescriptive.  In the first instance, it would be more usual for a public body to give notice that a public consultation was commencing, rather than that a public consultation would commence within a specified time.  I do not see the value in an coimisi&uacute;n publishing a draft proposal for a new category of content without at the same time or shortly thereafter commencing its consultation period on the proposal.  I also do not foresee circumstances where an coimisi&uacute;n would seek to artificially foreclose or artificially shorten a public consultation.</p></speech>

I do not accept this amendment as I do not see a substantial difference between the meanings of reconsider and review in this context.

This was discussed in one of our previous meetings with the Department and it seemed interested by this approach at the time.  I am not sure if this still the case.  Section 139D of the Bill defines a separate category of &quot;age-inappropriate content&quot;, which is not the same as harmful content but rather something which adults can be safely exposed to but children cannot.  In the Bill, it is defined as including pornography or representations of violence.</p><p>This is a very helpful category to define within the Bill.  We need to acknowledge that there are some types of content to which adults can be safely exposed, while children cannot.  It is strange to me then that this category of content is defined but is barely used at all in any of the later mechanisms set up by the Bill.  The only place it seems to be used is when issuing guidance materials by the commission.  There it has the option of having regard to the risks of exposure to age-inappropriate content.  </p><p>Since the Bill already goes to the trouble of defining this special category of material that is suitable for adults but not children, we could better use that definition by expanding it and perhaps adding further mechanisms later in the Bill whereby that type of content should be limited automatically by platforms.  </p></speech>
