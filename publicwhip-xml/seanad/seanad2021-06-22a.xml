I commend the Minister of State for the work undertaken in this area to date, specifically in the preparation of the White Paper on ending direct provision, which was published in February of this year.  We are all aware of the inadequacy of the current direct provision system which has, as the Government has acknowledged, failed to respect the dignity and human rights of individuals and families within the system.  Any new system for reception and integration must address those deficiencies and ensure that the human rights and dignity of those seeking protection from conflict and persecution are upheld.  </p> <p>The Irish State has relied too heavily on the private sector for the provision of direct provision accommodation over the last 21 years and this overreliance has failed people who so desperately need our care and support.  The White Paper is ambitious in many areas and it goes some distance in terms of addressing the inadequacy of the direct provision system.  I welcome many of its contributions, including those relating to women's health and period poverty, providing access to financial support equivalent to child benefit for families, and ensuring greater protection for unaccompanied minors.  I also welcome the White Paper&rsquo;s commitment to ending shared intimate living for families and to providing greater privacy for individuals within the system of accommodation.  </p> <p>My concern relates to the tendering process for the provision of accommodation for individuals and families seeking protection and refuge in Ireland.  The White Paper emphasises the role to be played by the not-for-profit sector in the provision of accommodation.  However, it does not explicitly state how or when this will be achieved.  We presently do not have a timetable for the implementation of the new tendering process, nor are we aware of the steps which will be involved in the process for interested parties.  My fear is that without a clear timeline and roadmap as to how this process will be implemented, not-for-profit organisations and social enterprises will be placed at a disadvantage in the tendering process.</p> <p>Entering a submission for a tender is an expensive, time-consuming and risky process and not-for-profits and social enterprises are, by nature, less well-resourced than for-profit entities and more risk averse.  As a result, my concern is that the new multistrand system for the provision of accommodation will ultimately favour for-profit enterprises, leaving us in a situation where the dignity and human rights of vulnerable people continue to be disrespected for the sake of profit.  </p> <p>I ask that the Minister of State provides an update regarding the timeline for implementation of the multistrand system for the provision of accommodation, and clarifies which strands are likely to be available at different stages throughout the implementation of the White Paper.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the progress made in terms of the new procurement process and the steps involved for interested parties, if possible, at this stage.  Traditionally competitive tendering processes are best suited to the private sector and in other instances, non-profit organisations have entered into service-level agreements with State bodies, such as the HSE and Tusla, to facilitate their involvement in provision of services.  Has the Minister of State explored a service level agreement, SLA, process, rather than a tendering process?  Additionally, I ask if the Department has considered the possibility of piloting a not-for-profit-owned or accommodation scheme while the implementation of the White Paper is under way?  In implementing a pilot model, a not-for-profit or social enterprise could demonstrate the immediate viability of a better standard of care for those seeking refuge here in Ireland.   We do not have to wait until 2024 to demonstrate that an alternative to the current model exists.  I would encourage the Minister of State to consider this, if the Department has not already done so.  While the promised winding down of the current system for reception and integration by 2024 is a welcome commitment, it is too far away for those individuals and families whose dignity and human rights are being pushed to their limits in direct provision today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-22a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021062200002#A00700"><p>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, who cannot be here.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue. </p> <p>Officials at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are currently developing a tender process to secure additional accommodation for families with children, couples and single people seeking international protection.  That process is still at a relatively early stage.  There are a number of issues around the precise tender design and specifications that still need to be worked through.  Nonetheless, all is going well.  It is expected that a call for tender will be issued before the end of the summer.  It would not be appropriate for me to anticipate the precise details of the tender specifications at this stage.  However, a number of points are worth making by way of context.  A key element of the work for 2021, that is set out in the White Paper to end direct provision, is to undertake a systematic programme to move away from reliance on emergency accommodation.  As the Senator will know, the Department currently has 24 emergency accommodation centres, at various locations around the country, providing accommodation for 1,187 people.  A successful tender process will enable the Department to move away from this reliance on emergency accommodation. </p> <p>The provision of accommodation for applicants seeking international protection is a demand-led process, with the vast majority of applicants arriving in the State spontaneously.  While the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a decrease in the number of applicants seeking international protection, demand for accommodation is expected to increase significantly once the current travel restrictions ease.  Under the recast asylum reception conditions directive, which Ireland opted into in 2018, the State is legally obliged to provide accommodation to international protection applicants who need it while their claim is being determined.  It will be necessary to put in place a process which allows the Department to respond flexibly to increases in demand as they arise.  The new tender process aims to put in place a flexible approach to enable the Department to meet its accommodation needs on an ongoing basis, pending the full implementation of the White Paper.  It is intended that, as far as possible, any new accommodation that is secured during the interim period will be broadly aligned with the approach set out in the White Paper.  The aim is to improve the quality of accommodation and services offered to international protection applicants.  The current tender process is aimed at securing additional accommodation for international protection applicants to ensure that the Department moves away from reliance on emergency accommodation and to ensure that it has adequate capacity and can respond flexibly to increases in demand as they arise.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is no degree of urgency to this.  As a consequence, the Department has no plans to run any pilot projects as part of the process.</p><p>The Senator referred to the not-for-profit sector and I understand non-governmental organisations and the not-for-profit sector are being looked at.  The Senator asked about the criteria to be used and I will bring those concerns to the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-22a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021062200002#B00200"><p>I note the Minister of State indicates the Department does not plan to look at a pilot project.  I am a little concerned that we are at the early stage of the tendering process, and such processes can take a long time.  I am aware that the Minister of State has said the senior Minister plans to release that tender before the end of the summer.  It sounds like there is a tight turnaround on the tendering process.  I am aware of a number of different not-for-profit organisations that are ready to go with own-door accommodation and it feels like an awful shame when so many people are living in such cramped, unsuitable conditions while there is an option or alternative in the interim.  I ask that the Minister of State communicates this to the Department so it could consider some of those options if there are further delays in the tendering process.</p></speech>

As I have said, there is an urgency to this exercise; while demand remains relatively low, it is likely to increase once the current travel restrictions are eased.  The State has a legal as well as a moral duty to provide accommodation to any applicant for international protection who needs accommodation; a claim is being determined but it would not be appropriate for me to speculate about the precise details of the procurement process, who might bid or about what tender submissions might be successful.  The Department will run its tender process in compliance with public procurement law and it will be open to all eligible parties to bid, in the normal way, when the time comes.</p> <p>I will bring the comments made by the Senator on the not-for-profit organisations, which are interesting, back to the Minister.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-22a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1684" speakername="Mark Wall" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021062200002#B00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We all looked in shock last Saturday week at the distressing scenes at the soccer match between Finland and Denmark when a young and fit international footballer dropped to the ground, suffering a cardiac arrest.  The medical team on-site jumped into action and with the aid of an automated external defibrillator, AED, the player was stabilised and a life was saved.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this is not the first time we have seen or heard of this happening on our playing pitches, whether it is in an international soccer stadium or local sports club grounds, or even in the many great communities we have on this island.  The key to the survival of Mr. Christian Eriksen and so many before him was the availability of an AED and, just as important, the training of people in knowing how to use it.  The Irish Red Cross estimates there are between 8,000 and 10,000 publicly accessible defibrillators in Ireland but the emergency services may only know approximately 25% of these locations.  The key word is "estimates" and hence my reason for raising this on the Commencement today.</p> <p>What we need in the country is a national central register of all available defibrillators and, like in other countries, an app to help in the speed and convenience in finding them.  We must include and expand the terrific Community First Responders we have in this country.  They are embedded in their communities and committed to saving lives.  In my home town of Athy they respond to approximately one cardiac event each month and in our bigger towns, that number could be doubled or even trebled.  These volunteers still have to fundraise by holding annual table quizzes, for example, to ensure there is continuous training for members.  We need to fund this community organisation so it can provide training within their communities and so these community-based groups can ensure AEDs in their areas are working and particularly that batteries and pads are in working order.</p> <p>As a public representative in south Kildare I hold fundraisers and been delighted to launch AEDs in every community there.  However, it is vital that all these AEDs be registered and checked regularly to ensure they are in working order.  There are examples of community groups using an app to register AEDs and this could be used on a national basis.  One of those is the Enniscorthy defibrillator initiative, called PulsePoint, and it seeks to register all defibrillators in the town.  Another is the work of Dr. Peter Naughton in County Laois mapping the location of all AEDs in the county so the emergency services could advise frantic callers in their hour of need of the nearest device.  My colleague, Councillor Paul O'Brien in Wicklow, has proposed that a provision for AEDs should be included in all new major housing builds, which is an excellent idea and another way of providing safer communities in all our counties.</p> <p>I have been made aware that in 2019, according to the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest register, there were 2,564 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, or 54 per 100,000 of our population.  The report also indicates that defibrillation was attempted in 25% of these cases before the arrival of the emergency services.</p> <p>Of course, there is the great work done by the National Ambulance Service and its staff, who take those emergency calls in the first place, assisting even those not trained in the use of an AED.  Where one is available, a call to the emergency services should always be made.  We need investment in a national register and app by the HSE.  We need investment in our Community First Responders to assist in their training and the training and assisting of people in clubs, shops and schools that hold an AED in the community.  Such a register would save lives and ensure that a life-saving machine is working when it is needed most.  It will continue to build support for a community-based initiative that is already making a difference and saving lives in the State.</p></speech>

This strategy was developed by an interdisciplinary steering group, led by the Department of Health, which had the aim of increasing the number of people who survive an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Ireland, using national and international experience to address all the elements in the chain of survival.</p><p>The HSE has since established an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest strategy implementation group to progress this work.  The group is led by the National Ambulance Service and actions are being progressed by partner organisations, including Dublin Fire Brigade, the pre-hospital emergency care council, the Irish Heart Foundation and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>In line with the Senator's question, one of the projects currently under way is a work stream to develop a national AED register.  Currently, the National Ambulance Service has a list of locations for over 2,000 AEDs on its national computer-aided dispatch system, which it can use to advise emergency callers in AED retrieval and use, if appropriate, while the emergency response is <i>en route</i>.</p><p>Currently, the implementation group is examining how a national AED register would better support existing emergency response systems in an integrated way.  This includes the development of advice and support that may be required in the community setting on maintenance requirements and other practical concerns, for example.</p><p>I am happy to confirm to the House that the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest implementation group has received funding of &euro;650,000 in budget 2021 to progress this important work as part of the overall implementation of the strategy.  In addition, it is important to again stress the services already provided at community level in the area of cardiac response, and the Senator has rightly cited the work carried out by the National Ambulance Service and Community First Responder groups in that regard.  Community First Responders are trained volunteers who are co-ordinated and dispatched by the National Ambulance Service to attend actual or potentially life-threatening emergencies.  As these volunteers are professionally trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of defibrillators, they can respond to certain medical emergency calls in the community in that important first few minutes prior to the arrival of an emergency ambulance.</p><p>As highlighted by the Senator, our National Ambulance Service actively works with Community First Responders to advise and support on the importance of maintenance for their AEDs to ensure that they are operational at all times.  The additional funding provided in 2021 in support of the work of the implementation group will facilitate progress on the AED register and other initiatives aimed at reducing cardiac arrest response times and improved survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I note what the Senator said about how these have been mapped in Wicklow, Enniscorthy and County Laois.  I saw it after that the awful incident last week in Sligo.  People were putting on Twitter and Facebook where AEDs were.  It is the same in Boyle and I have seen it there.  I am sure that is happening around the country.  We cannot have enough of that information because when one is in an emergency it is great to have it.  Even I have looked to find out the nearest one to me and I am sure that has happened in many households around the country.  I thank the Senator for raising this.</p></speech>

The sum of &euro;650,000 allocated to the OHCA is a positive step forward in this regard.  As the Minister of State said, there are a number of initiatives.  I referred to one in Enniscorthy in Wexford, what happened in Laois and the initiative by my colleague, Councillor Paul O'Brien, in Wicklow.  I ask the Minister of State to take those on board.  Every minute makes a difference, and the Minister of State has acknowledged that.  We must ensure there is a national register.  These AEDs are located in schools, shops and sports clubs.  However, as every minute makes a difference, when people and, most importantly, the National Ambulance Service receive a frantic call, they need to know where the AEDs are located.  I welcome the fact that work is being carried out on formulating a national register.  I ask that it be expedited given what has happened and the fact that people are talking about it at present.  Now is the time to ensure that everybody knows where there is an AED, and I call on everybody to share that information as much as possible.  I welcome the information given today.</p></speech>

It is my expectation that the funding provided by the Government in 2021 will result in real progress in the development of an AED register, and the HSE is already making progress on some of the practical elements that need to be considered in that regard.</p> <p>In addition to this element of the strategy, I highlight the broader implementation work under way by the HSE and other agencies, as this will also support the dedicated work of the network of community first responders and the National Ambulance Service.  Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a significant source of mortality and morbidity, with a wide variation in reported incidence and outcomes.  Research shows that "it takes a whole system to save a life" and this is why a planned, strategic, whole-nation approach to improving OHCA survival is essential.  On that basis, I am confident that the investment in the work of the OHCA strategy implementation group will achieve real and continued progress in survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-22a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021062200002#C00500"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  On Sunday, 30 May, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, visited China for a bilateral meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr. Wang Yi.  It did not surprise me that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, did not exactly bang the tables or lay down the law with the Chinese about human rights, the Uyghurs and so forth.  Given the nature of the Government&rsquo;s attitude and behaviour to China for the last decade, this was never likely.</p><p>However, a couple of things did surprise me.  For example, for some reason the Department of Foreign Affairs waited for two days after the meeting before issuing a press release about the fact that it had taken place.  Needless to say, the propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist Party, CCP, did not wait for two days to comment.  It immediately stepped into the breach to spin its line on the nature of the meeting with the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  The Minister was quoted by the CCP, and this is a direct quote in the Chinese media, as follows: &quot;He praised China&rsquo;s firm stance on multilateralism and spoke highly of China&rsquo;s role as rotating president in the UN Security Council.  Ireland is an honest friend of China in the EU and is ready to be a reliable partner, Coveney assured them&quot;.  That is a direct quote attributed to our Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Indeed, it is of a piece with what I quoted here last week from the book, <i>Hidden Hand: Exposing How the Chinese Communist Party is Reshaping the World</i>.  In May 2019, Deputy Coveney said that the deepening relationship between the two countries would help Ireland to reach out to the European Union to advance China's interests in the EU.  That was at the launch of a pro-Chinese Government think-tank, Asia Matters.  The former Fine Gael Party leader, Mr. Alan Dukes, was closely involved in that, if I am not mistaken.</p><p>The Chinese state media continued: &quot;Wang stressed the importance of mutual respect for the differences in the two countries' histories, cultures, stages of development and social systems.&quot;  The phrase with regard to respect for the differences in history, culture and social systems is the Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s standard euphemism and doublespeak used to spin and excuse its violent suppression of democracy and basic human rights.  It genuinely believes that the fact it has a different culture and history from the West somehow gives it a free pass.  This phraseology is now used in a summary of a meeting involving an Irish Minister.  The Department of Foreign Affairs eventually released its account of the meeting, in the usual emollient tone to which we have become accustomed.  In fairness, the Minister raised the case of Richard O&rsquo;Halloran, the Irish man being detained in China, as well as the treatment of the Uyghur minority.  The statement said: &quot;Minister Coveney outlined Ireland&rsquo;s position on the treatment of Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang&quot;.  That is not exactly strong stuff.  Tellingly, the statement mentioned Ireland&rsquo;s beef exports to China before it mentioned the Uyghurs, showing the priorities.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to address the following questions.  What was the background to this meeting?  When was it arranged?  At whose instigation did it take place?  What other countries were invited, and why that choice?  Were they the countries that China perceives as most friendly to its interests, including Serbia and Hungary if I am not mistaken?  Why did it take two days for the Department of Foreign Affairs to issue a press release about the discussions that took place, allowing the Chinese propaganda arm effectively to put words in the mouth of an Irish Minister?  Was this timeline of statements agreed or choreographed in advance?  Finally, was Taiwan discussed at the meeting?  It certainly was not mentioned in the Department&rsquo;s press release and, needless to say, it was not mentioned in the Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s puff-piece.  I wonder if the Chinese insisted that it could not be discussed.</p></speech>

The meeting took place in the context of Ireland's membership of the UN Security Council and had an extensive agenda covering bilateral relations and EU-China relations, as well as issues on the agenda of the UN Security Council.  As a permanent member of the Security Council and as a major partner for both Europe and Ireland at a bilateral level, engagement with China is necessary for progress to be made on a wide range of key issues.</p> <p>In the context of Ireland's membership of the UN Security' Council, the Ministers, Mr. Wang Yi and Deputy Coveney, discussed a number of topics facing the council, including the situations in Syria, Ethiopia and Myanmar.  We must engage with all members of the Security Council, especially permanent members, if we wish to see an effective response to these issues, and China is an important partner in this regard.</p> <p>In terms of bilateral issues, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, again pressed the case of Mr. Richard O'Halloran with his Chinese counterpart with a view to achieving an early resolution of the matter.  As I am sure Senator Mullen will understand, it would be inappropriate to comment further on the details of an ongoing consular case.  Additionally, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, also discussed restoring access to the Chinese market for Irish beef.</p> <p>EU-China relations were covered at length, with both Ministers expressing a wish to have stronger co-operation in areas of mutual interest.  However, it was also recognised that there are several areas where Ireland and China disagree.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, outlined Ireland's position on the treatment of Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang and raised concerns at the introduction of the national security law in Hong Kong and the implications it has for the "one country, two systems" principle.  Ireland has consistently made its voice known on these issues, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora.  Indeed, we have supported a joint statement at the Human Rights Council in Geneva, outlining our grave concerns regarding the situation in Xinjiang and in Hong Kong.</p> <p>On Taiwan, as the Senator already knows, in common with all EU member states, Ireland maintains a One China policy.  Although Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it is free to engage with Taiwan on an economic and cultural basis.  To this end, we recognise the benefits, for all parties concerned, of a peaceful and stable situation across the Taiwan Strait.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Colm Brophy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2427"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2427&amp;amp;pid=ColmBrophy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister, Deputy Coveney, discussed the value of co-operation between the EU and China, and the need to develop a common approach on global issues, such as responding to the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change.

I spoke in this Chamber last week about the mounting evidence that our foreign policy lacks any moral core, because there is so much evidence of that recently.  Days after returning from China, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, correctly said that the Belarusian President lacked democratic legitimacy.  However, with him having recently returned home from a friendly meeting with a totalitarian communist dictatorship, it makes you wonder.  The Minister then had a friendly meeting with the foreign minister of Iran, a country that supplies the rockets which Hamas were firing at civilians in Israel.</p> <p>In 2019, the foreign minister in question, Mr. Mohammad Javad Zarif, supported and defended the executions of gay people in Iran, and thousands of gay people have been executed there since the 1979 Islamic revolution.  Last week, pride flags were ripped down in Waterford, and Fine Gael MEPs and councillors were up in arms, took to the airwaves and, of course, got great support from the media.  However, there was not a peep out of any of them when the deputy leader of their own party met with an Iranian minister who has publicly supported and defended the execution of thousands of gay people, which is a real abuse, a real injustice and a real outrage.  Deputy John Paul Phelan was the only person to protest about it and, as far as I can tell, he got no support from his party colleagues.  This tells us something about the attitude in Government.  Do human rights mean something or are they just a pretext for virtue signalling here at home, the better to allow us to cower and doff the cap abroad in the interests of trade, primarily.</p></speech>

It is in light of that membership that the engagements take place, which the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been engaging in.  It is through constructive engagement that we find solutions to many of the problems that face us.  Senator Mullen seems to be advocating that you should never talk to anyone with whom you disagree.  Such opportunities are of equal importance in allowing the frank discussion around issues of disagreement and for sincerely held views to be directly raised and pursued.</p> <p>The Ministers agreed on many things, but there were several questions which Ireland and China did not agree on, as I said in my opening contribution, such as on a whole host of global issues, including climate change, the pandemic, and humanitarian challenges in Syria, Ethiopia and Yemen.  It is not possible to develop effective responses without including the government that represents nearly one fifth of humanity, that has the second largest economy in the world and is a permanent member of the Security Council, which we currently have the privilege of being a member of.  To that end, engagement with China is now, and will remain, necessary if we are to make meaningful progress on these issues.</p></speech>

A friend of mine contacted me about a month ago because of issues she was having registering with the Teaching Council.  We had an interesting conversation.  She then reached out to her peers and asked them to contact me about their experiences.  To say that I was inundated with correspondence from teachers throughout the country is putting it mildly.  They contacted me with problems, issues and challenges they have had with the Teaching Council in relation to their registration.  It is clear to me, from the stories I have heard and the experiences of those I have listened to, that the Teaching Council needs to be reviewed and reformed.  The stories and anecdotes about ongoing problems when trying to register include a general lack of support and shifting of the goalposts.  One teacher said that is took her longer to register with the Teaching Council than it took her to become a teacher.</p> <p>As we all know, it is vital to retain and attract high-quality teachers from home and abroad.  I am concerned that many people&rsquo;s experience with the Teaching Council is deterring them from choosing to come to or return to Ireland for teaching.  One person who contacted my office spoke of his experience in trying to return to Ireland from the UK to take up a teaching post.  The registration process took 270 days from start to finish.  He was met with nothing but roadblocks, was not offered support or guidance, and spent many months chasing and following up with the Teaching Council, to no avail.  He was out of pocket to the tune of &euro;7,428.07.  The problem was that because he was not registered as a teacher with the Teaching Council, he could not be paid as a teacher and was on a non-qualified substitute rate for that period.  This gentleman had a postgraduate education from the University of Edinburgh, one of the top universities in the world.  He is highly qualified and is a passionate advocate for education.  He is exactly the type of person we should be supporting and welcoming with open arms into our education system.  His experience is not an isolated occurrence.  Many teachers, young and old, are being met with roadblock after roadblock.  In situations where candidates do not get approved to teach a particular subject, there is no support and no guidance.  Many teachers feel the Teaching Council is not fit for purpose.</p> <p>We need to review the Teaching Council and its processes.  Of course, while maintaining teaching standards is of vital importance, we need to ensure teacher who are qualified are not deterred from choosing to come back to Ireland to teach.  Bureaucracy is a roadblock to people coming back to teach in Ireland.  We cannot afford to sacrifice talent for bureaucracy and that is what is happening at the moment.  There is a particular problem with overseas teachers relocating to Ireland, because of the registration issues.  There is a requirement for vast amounts of documentation on every individual course taken.  No flexibility is afforded.  There is a lack of empathy and feedback, and a lack of timelines in responding to emails and phone calls.  I rest my case.  I hope the Minister of State takes what I have said about the Teaching Council on board.</p></speech>

The Teaching Council Acts govern membership of the council, funding, accountability and the council's relationship with the Minister for Education.  The council consists of 37 members.</p> <p>The council has responsibility to operationalise the provisions of the Acts, including the development of organised structures and collaborative strategies for the regulation of the teaching profession, and it is responsible for the conduct of its affairs.  Under section 55 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, the council prepares and publishes an annual report detailing its activities and proceedings.  The council provides the Department of Education with a copy of the report and the report is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The annual report documents how the Teaching Council has implemented the Teaching Council Acts and progress of the council's strategic objectives.</p> <p>Responsibility for the development and implementation of policy on education, including the performance of teachers, rests with the Minister under the education Acts 1878 to 2015.  The Minister may seek advice from the Teaching Council under its enabling Act.  As a body under the Department of Education, the Teaching Council adheres to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The agency governance framework is in place between the Department and the Teaching Council.  This agency governance framework was established in 2018 in accordance with applicable statutory provisions, relevant national strategies, Government policies and the code of practice for State bodies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Colm Brophy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2427"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2427&amp;amp;pid=ColmBrophy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The agency's governance framework is due for review and renewal in 2021.</p><p>I acknowledge the important role the Teaching Council has played to support the supply of teachers over the past year during Covid-19.  Following engagement with the council, the higher education institutes, HEIs, providing post-primary professional master of education programmes introduced flexibility in their course delivery to increase the amount of time which student teachers on school placement could provide for supervision and substitution, outside of their placement hours.  In addition, the council has communicated with professional master of education students, through the HEIs, encouraging them to register with the council and to register also their availability with Sub Seeker, the recruitment portal which matches teachers with substitutable vacancies.  The council has reassigned resources to this task to ensure applications for registration arising from this measure are processed as quickly as possible.</p><p>As an additional measure for 2020 and 2021, the council made a regulation allowing teachers who had qualified outside of Ireland to complete their induction here.  This measure will again be put in place for the coming school year on a time-bound and exceptional basis.  There are almost 109,000 teachers on the Teaching Council register.  During the peak period of applications for registration between May and September 2020, almost 5,000 new registrations were processed.</p></speech>

For the 109,000 teachers who are registered, there is a &euro;65 fee, so there is quite a substantial amount of money going into the Teaching Council every year.  However, the Teaching Council is not serving the teachers.  I have a full file on those who have contacted me and that is just the tip of the iceberg in the issues they have had.  I am sending that to the Minister for Education and I have also asked the Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to take up this issue of a review because it is very important.  The significant delays I have outlined have caused a lot of problems and challenges for teachers, from a financial perspective as well as the possibility of them getting and keeping a job.  Once they start, if teachers do not have their Teaching Council number, they are not allowed to apply for that job again, which puts them back in the jobs market.  There is a lot of work to be done in reviewing the Teaching Council's function.</p></speech>

It is always nice when you try to bring up a local issue that there is a Minister of State present who knows the area quite well and who knows the road I will be discussing.</p> <p>The N24, as most people would know, is the main road from Limerick to Waterford.  It is the one road in the country connecting two cities which is in real need of upgrade.  It has had a history of getting to a certain stage in design, development and consultation but not in delivery.  Anyone who lives in the area will remember that in 2004 and 2005, we went through the consultation process but in the end it was not delivered.  We have seen huge developments in infrastructure in other areas since then.</p> <p>We are at a key juncture where the road is divided into two sections.  There is the section from Limerick to Cahir, which is slightly ahead of the section from Cahir to Waterford.  This is a critical point because we have a public consultation at 3 p.m. on Friday and I would encourage anyone to go and see what route options there will be and to see what the development of this project will be.</p> <p>This is part of the national development plan, NDP, which the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, is reviewing.  This project is a key part of the NDP and the worry for us in Tipperary is that the project will not continue.  There are a number of elements to the project that are a real concern.  This is a priority route between Limerick and Waterford.  It is a major connection between the two cities.  It goes on to Rosslare Europort and it has a connection to Europe from there, which is very significant post Brexit.  However, 80% of this road goes through Tipperary and it has a knock-on effect for the economy of the county.</p> <p>Later today, the chief executive of Tipperary County Council, Joe McGrath, the vice chairperson of Tipperary County Council, Mary Hanna Hourigan and I are meeting the T&aacute;naiste to discuss the development of Tipperary from an economic point of view and to discuss where it can go from the point of view of his role as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  This is a significant part of that development.  The people in Tipperary want that commitment from the Government and from the Minister for Transport.  In fairness, he has been good at meeting groups and councillors to discuss this but we need to make sure that project stays on the NDP.</p> <p>It is a major project for the region but for Tipperary in particular.  There is an element to it which is significant for the people of Tipperary town, which is for the town to be bypassed.  Anyone who knows the area knows about the amount of traffic that goes through Tipperary town every day.  They have been sent up the hill before with a promise of a bypass and the congestion in the town centre being solved.  We need to make sure we deliver on it this time and that part of this project includes a special arrangement to facilitate the bypass for Tipperary town.  When the review of the NDP happens next month, it is important the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, specifies that the bypass of Tipperary town will be a priority, in conjunction with the full N24 project.</p></speech>

I would like to explain that once funding arrangements have been put in place through the Department of Transport under the Roads Act 1993, the planning, design and construction of an individual national road is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the local authorities.  Overall, TII is responsible for the delivery of the national roads programme in accordance with Project Ireland 2040 and the NDP.  In that context, TII provides the Department with regular updates on its delivery of the national roads programme.  Within the timeframe given in the lead-up to this debate, the following information is the most up-to-date information available to me.</p> <p>Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed to underpin the successful implementation of the national planning framework, NPF.  This provides the strategic and financial framework for the national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027.  The focus of TII's activities is, accordingly, being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes that are included in the NDP, along with the maintenance of the existing national road network.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to bring forward the review of the NDP from 2022 and to use that review to set out an updated NDP for the period out as far as 2030.  The review of the NDP will be aligned with the NPF and Project Ireland 2040 and work is under way within the Department of Transport to contribute to this review.  I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight that all projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision to the NDP, require statutory approval and compliance with the public spending code.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Colm Brophy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2427"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2427&amp;amp;pid=ColmBrophy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> As the Senator said, the N24 is a national primary road connecting Limerick to Waterford, running through Tipperary town, Cahir, Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel.  The proposed N24 Cahir to Limerick junction project would consist of approximately 35 km of road improvement works between Cahir in Tipperary and Limerick Junction.  The study area associated with the project would include bypasses of Tipperary town and Bansha.  As someone with an uncle who ran a business in Tipperary town for many years and who is familiar with the congestion in the town, I fully understand the Senator's concerns.  The proposed N24 Waterford to Cahir project would consist of approximately 60 km of road improvement works.  The strategic value of these projects would address a core priority under the NPF, which is to enhance and upgrade accessibility between urban centres of population and their regions.</p><p>The project benefits include the provision of more reliable and safer journeys.  Both projects would aim to enhance regional accessibility and improve connectivity between Limerick and Waterford.  The N24 Cahir to Limerick Junction project would also provide better connectivity with public transport through direct access to the train stations in Cahir and Limerick Junction, which would encourage the use of public transport in the area.  Improved journey time certainty would act as an enabler of economic growth and urban environment improvements would have positive social benefits.  In addition, the proposed N24 Waterford to Cahir project would improve the quality of life of commuters and local residents, through improved journey times and would connect to the Kilkenny greenway, which would run from New Ross to Waterford city.</p><p>On the proposed N24 Cahir to Limerick project, technical advisers were appointed by Tipperary County Council and are undertaking early planning and design work.  A public consultation on the project&rsquo;s constraints was carried out by Tipperary County Council in the first quarter of 2021, informing the options.  The selection stage with the shortlisted transport corridors is expected to be unveiled in mid-2021.  Tipperary County Council has advised that it will be going to public consultation on the project on 25 June until 6 August.  On the proposed N24 Waterford to Cahir project, Arup was appointed by Kilkenny County Council as technical advisers.  Option selection has commenced and a virtual public consultation on constraints commenced on 4 May 2021, running until 1 June 2021.</p></speech>

The second public consultation is starting this Friday on routes for the first section between Limerick and Cahir, which is hugely important.  I welcome what the Minister of State said about public transport and rail routes.  The route from Clonmel to Waterford is hugely significant and the Minister can play a key role in that project.  I ask the Minister of State to get the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to reply to me on this matter.</p> <p>The Taoiseach spoke a number of weeks ago about the bypass in Tipperary town and he created a certain level of confusion because he spoke about a separate bypass south of the town.  That goes against the overall plan for the N24 because the routes would have to be north of Tipperary town, due to the layout of the region.  I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Department of Transport or speak to the Minister and provide some clarity on whether the bypass of Tipperary town will be part of the N24 and not a separate bypass.  It has to be done in conjunction with the full layout of the road.  That is critically important.  The people of Tipperary town have been waiting almost 20 years to get congestion off their roads and this is the opportunity to do it.  It is key that we get it done.  It is important for the people of the area and I urge the Minister for Transport to commit to it next month.</p></speech>

I am here specifically representing the people of County Mayo.  This issue mainly affects north Mayo, specifically Belmullet, Killala, Ballina and areas in between.  To say people are experiencing significant mental anguish is probably an understatement.</p> <p>I understand the Government has committed to putting in place a task force or working group comprising stakeholders from across all the counties affected.  I welcome this action.</p> <p>I reiterate how important it is that we get 100% redress for the homeowners affected by this issue.  I have visited homes in Mayo and seen the cracks in walls.  I could put my hand through them.  I cannot imagine how difficult it is for people to sit in their homes and wonder when the wall will crumble, whether it is safe, if their kids are going to be okay and what they will do to rebuild their homes and lives.</p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware that there were schemes elsewhere in the country in which 100% aid was granted to homeowners.  We expect parity and equality for the people of the west and north west.  We want this Government to deliver 100% redress for the people affected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-22a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1633" speakername="Niall Blaney" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021062200002#F00600"><p>I will put on record how we can get the current scheme up to 100% redress.  There are seven issues involved.  The first relates to insurance companies.  In the past, insurance companies have been asked by the Government to give lump sums towards redress in the area of health.  We are asking the Government to contact the insurance companies and ask them to give a lump sum over the next ten to 20 years, or whatever is necessary, towards making up that 10%.  Similarly, Home Bond could make that contribution over the next ten to 20 years, as could Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, with which I, Deputy Calleary and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, met a few weeks ago.  It is much easier to do that over a ten or 20-year period than pay a lump sum.</p> <p>The fourth issue is VAT.  The Minister could look at a VAT exemption for the necessary materials, which would not cost the Government anything.  Fifth, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland should give out grants towards insulation.  Sixth, the Government should provide a ten-year bond or guarantee.  I would like to talk to the Minister more about that.</p></speech>

It is not mica but pyrite and we too want to be included in the scheme.  We will not accept anything less than 100% redress.  I have visited the homes affected and to say the homeowners are devastated by what is happening is an understatement.  Their walls are crumbling and their lives are decimated.  The State needs to stand behind them.  I understand that a working group has been established with representatives from the mica action group in the north west.  I ask that the Department also appoint somebody from the Clare action group to join that committee, in order to give an insight into a similar problem that is different in nature.</p> <p>I join colleagues in recognising that others need to participate in this redress scheme.  There is evidence that the defective blocks used in Clare came from a Roadstone quarry.  That company is part of a very large multinational organisation and it is right and fitting that an organisation like CRH would contribute to redress.  That should not be for the homeowners to deal with.  That is an issue for Government.  The Government now needs to come forward and set out a clear plan to provide 100% redress.  If others have to participate in funding that plan, such as Roadstone or CRH, that can be dealt with by the Government, not the homeowners. </p></speech>

I acknowledge that they had very limited time in which to make their contributions.  I know they would have liked to make more substantial contributions on this but could not do so on foot of the rules governing Commencement matters.</p> <p>The issue of defective concrete blocks, DCBs, is particularly emotive for households and I sympathise fully with all those caught up in this very distressing situation.  The goal of the grant scheme is to help a restricted group of homeowners who have no other practicable options to access redress.  It is not a compensation scheme but a mechanism for the State to help ordinary homeowners with no other way out of a situation that is not their fault.  Homeowners are engaging with the scheme and already 448 have applied for grant assistance, 296 of whom have received stage 1 confirmation of eligibility.</p> <p>Rigorous analysis was carried out in respect of the circumstances that led to the DCB issue.  The grant scheme was informed by the work of an expert panel and finalised in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the relevant local authorities and homeowners.  The aim of the scheme is to remediate the issue of the DCBs and return buildings to the condition they would have been in had they not been affected by the use of such blocks.  The scheme does not prevent homeowners upgrading their homes to 2021 building standards but it does require that homeowners pay for the marginal cost of those upgrades.  The decision to go with a grant scheme, as opposed to the type of scheme provided by the Pyrite Remediation Board, was intended to give homeowners the flexibility to manage their own projects and allow them to deal directly with their appointed contractors.  The Department is engaging with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to explore whether the owners of homes built using DCBs are eligible for SEAI grants.  In addition Government has committed to exempting these homeowners from local property tax, LPT, liability.  Currently, the grant scheme only applies to the counties of Donegal and Mayo but additional counties are seeking admittance to it.  Any extension to the scheme will require the same rigorous analysis as that carried out prior its roll-out in Donegal and Mayo.  It would also have to be the subject of budgetary discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>On the issues being raised by homeowners, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has proposed a time-bound working group, involving representatives from his Department, the local authorities and homeowner groups, to review and address any outstanding issues regarding the operation of the grant scheme, including issues such as grant caps, homeowner contributions, engineering and allowable costs, etc.  It is intended that the review will be completed by 31 July and that it will inform any changes or improvements to the scheme as may be required.  Following receipt of the report of the working group and the ensuing collaboration with ministerial colleagues and, in particular, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Attorney General, proposals will be brought to Government.</p> <p>The scale of this problem is shocking and the impact on people unimaginable.  I want the affected homeowners to know that Government is committed to supporting them as much as possible in the remediation of their homes.</p></speech>

I will be taking the full-time as Senator Dooley has left to attend a committee meeting.  I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  We really welcome the moves by the Minister regarding the SEAI.  Over and above the issues I mentioned, I wish to discuss the ten-year Government bond I mentioned.  There is a fear among homeowners that if they do some remedial works on the outside of their houses, the problems with pyrite or mica will return.  The ten-year Government bond is about addressing that.  If the Department has a look at the matter, the bond will ensure that people do not simply push and drive; instead they may need to step over the advice of engineers who seek to have their houses demolished when there is no need for that.  It brings the assurance that they need.  I thank the Minister of State very much for his contribution.  We look forward to engaging much more with the Department on this matter.</p></speech>

Last week, we had world blood donation day.  This is a very important day when we get to highlight the importance of blood donation and thank all of those who give blood.  The theme was to give blood and keep the world beating.</p> <p>I want to highlight inequality and inequity in the system.  At present in Ireland, gay men must abstain from sexual contact for a minimum of 12 months before they meet the criteria for donating blood.  The same criteria do not apply to heterosexual blood donors.  This is completely wrong.  The best available scientific evidence and advances in testing technology mean the 12-month deferral period imposed exceeds what is required to maintain the safety of the blood supply.  This is according to HIV Ireland.  In Northern Ireland, the 12-month period was reduced to three months on 1 June 2020, bringing it in line with the rest of the UK.  At least 17 countries have no restrictions whatever, including Italy, Spain and Hungary in the EU.  This requirement is completely wrong and needs to be addressed.  I would appreciate if the Leader would raise it.</p> <p>The Bog of Allen in Kildare is unique in its scale and holds the potential for wonderful experiences.  Last week, seven local and national environmental organisations presented their proposal for a major new 7,000 ha national peatlands park in Kildare and Offaly.  The proposal is to rewild and restore cutaway peatlands, creating a national park similar to the Lake District in the UK, which raises billions of pounds for the UK economy and create tens of thousands of jobs in the community.  The designation of this national park would be absolutely wonderful.  The plan has already been presented to Departments and Kildare County Council and I would like the support of the Seanad for it.</p> <p>The annual Women's Aid report was launched yesterday and, unsurprisingly, it showed an increase of 43% in contacts from those suffering domestic violence.  Family law is particularly burdened and underresourced at present and I know we will face a tsunami.  It is important that we get ahead of it as Covid eases, and it is particularly important that we get a second judge in Kildare to hear family law cases.</p></speech>

Her calm confident way of dealing with the emergence from Covid-19, and particularly antigen testing, is a credit to her and all of us in the Seanad, and I thank her for presenting such a positive note.</p> <p>Speaking of Covid-19 and hospitals, I will speak about something that may annoy some people, namely, the wearing of hospital uniforms in supermarkets and while walking around the streets.  It has long been a bone of contention of mine that people who work in what should be fairly sterile areas appear in supermarkets wearing scrubs on their way home from work.  I have read a number of studies on this.  What has caused me to look at it is that last weekend, when I was in Dunnes Stores, a woman appeared in hospital scrubs and an elderly lady turned to me and said that we were in the middle of a pandemic, for God's sake, and asked what was going on.  This is a discussion we need to have and it needs to be about not just the ordinary workers in hospitals but hospital consultants.  The ties worn by hospital consultants apparently carry more bacteria than is good for any of us.  Can we not get back to the days when people wore clean uniforms, which should probably be supplied by the hospital in the morning when staff arrive in work, and when doctors wore some form of white coat if they were not wearing scrubs?  Patient protection has to be the key for all of us.  I know it is a sensitive subject to bring up at this time but it is probably the right time to have this discussion now that we are emerging from a pandemic.</p> <p>I want to discuss the exit survey carried out by the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO.  It is heartbreaking to read about senior and military officers who have retired early and who all loved the job they were doing but simply could not continue for family or income reasons.  They are being driven out the door.  This issue has to be addressed.  We cannot wait for the commission on the future of defence to report.  We will have nobody left if we do not deal with the issue at this stage.  I know the Leader has tried a number of times to have a debate on defence and I ask her to expedite this so we can have the debate before the summer break, if the Minister will come to the House to discuss these issues.  I thank the Leader for her time.</p></speech>

In her previous role as Minister with responsibility for social protection, she did great work on school meals.  This has been built on by the current Minister, Deputy Humphreys, with the announcement yesterday of an extension of free school meals.  That has to be very much welcomed.  We need to go a lot further in the provision of free school meals.  Every DEIS school in the country should receive free school meals.  We need to aspire and work towards this as quickly as possible.</p> <p>I was very troubled to read the contents of the Women's Aid report yesterday with regard to the increase of 40% in calls to its service during the pandemic as a result of domestic violence.  This is a further very tragic consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Work needs to be done after Covid on how to reduce these figures.  I have said previously that we need to reconstitute the very good committee we had that looked at public interest issues.  The Cathaoirleach did great work on the committee with regard to sign language.  We need to reconstitute the Seanad Public Consultation Committee and I propose that the first work the committee would do is a report on domestic violence.</p> <p>Long Covid is becoming a big problem and we need a strategy for dealing with it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need a strategy on long Covid.

It would be nice if we could organise it before the summer recess.  If not, it needs to be organised in early September because we need a strategy which needs funding.  We need clear targets in terms of that.  There are people whose sense of smell has not returned and are suffering chronic fatigue and have little, if any, energy.  The support structures and services are not there to assist them.  We have a body of work to do on that.  We need that debate in this House.</p></speech>

The hurling was absolutely brilliant to watch.  It was also great to see the uachtar&aacute;n of the Camogie Association, Hilda Breslin, a proud Athy woman, present the cup to the victorious Kilkenny captain, Meighan Farrell.  Coupled with the great performance of Leona Maguire on the US LPGA tour, it reinforced for me the very positive and welcome participation of women and girls in sport over the past few years.</p><p>The recent 20x20 campaign entitled If she can't see it, she can't be it, helped a great deal.  It was a campaign about creating a cultural shift in our perception of girls and women in sport.  This campaign ran from 2018 to 2020 and had three aims: 20% more media coverage of women in sport; 20% more female participation at player, coach, referee and administrative level; and 20% more attendance at women's games and events.  The 20x20 concept originated from and was developed by Sarah Colgan and Heather Thornton and driven by their agency, Along Came A Spider.  Together with the Federation of Irish Sport, all of Ireland's leading sporting organisations came together to pledge their active participation and support.  </p><p>There can be little doubt about the findings after the campaign, with very encouraging results: 80% of the population is more aware of women's sports than before the launch in 2018; 61% are more likely to support women's sport more than they did in 2018; 75% of men said the 20x20 campaign change their mindset positively towards women in sport; and 42% of women said they are participating in more sport and physical activity due to the awareness of the 20x20 campaign.  We now face challenges to this forward momentum.  A recent UN paper highlighted that the progress and attention gained in women's sport may be undone due to Covid-19.  It stated.</p> <blockquote> 	The pandemic of COVID-19 now threatens to erase this momentum as the sport world has been forced to cancel or postpone events, schools have closed, and people are staying home.  Existing gaps between women and men, girls and boys in both elite and grassroots sport may widen if governments, sport organizations, sponsors, civil society, athletes, media and UN agencies do not put women and girls at the centre and address their specific needs in response and recovery plans. </blockquote> <p>It is critical we do not allow the progress that has been made in female participation in sport to be lost.  We need a new plan that engages with females of all ages and builds on the success of the previous campaigns.  I hope we can discuss this with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and would appreciate if the Leader could arrange such a debate in the House. </p><p>In the few minutes remaining to me, I want to support Senator Craughwell on the urgent need for debate on our Defence Forces.  The Leader had arranged that debate but it had to be cancelled.  Given the recent report from RACO it is now time that we discussed in the House the urgent need for assistance for our Defence Forces.</p></speech>

As I cycled to the convention centre from the Liberties, something I have done since last July, I noticed how much the city has changed from full lockdown to opening up again.  I had to cycle around a couple of trucks and vans.  Things have changed a lot.  I noticed that the quality of the air has vastly decreased.  I was struck by the difference this morning.</p> <p>It led me to consider how instead of people we seem to have prioritised vehicles, and the bigger the vehicle the more people can break all of the rules and park wherever they want, even if it is only for a couple of seconds.  I am on a bike and can get off and walk around on footpaths, but I am thinking about older people, people with disabilities and people with buggies.  It is a nightmare.  </p> <p>It should no longer be socially acceptable for big delivery trucks and vans to stop wherever they want as close as possible to where they need to deliver something.  God forbid they should park in a loading bay around a corner, take stuff of a truck and wheel it around a corner.  It is no longer acceptable for them to pull up right outside the shops where they need to deliver to.  That social norm which we have been putting up with for years needs to stop.  Not all of them do it, but it is happening all over the city every day.  I see it in my home town in Clare.  It is a social norm that we have accepted that larger vehicles are prioritised over people. </p> <p>We need to design for our people and for not trucks and cars.  There is a town where pedestrian crossings are 1 km apart.  That does not serve people who need to cross roads safely.  We have seen a significant increase in car use.  We all got to experience roads as quieter places during the pandemic.  We do not expect to go back to that, but it made us realise how much space we give over to vehicles.  There may be three lanes for cars and a narrow lane for bikes.  People think it is okay to park in a cycle lane despite the space allocated to vehicles, but they would never stop in the middle of a road for cars and block them.  </p> <p>A cyclist means there is one less car on the roads.  That person could have driven instead.  We need to change the narrative.  It is not a case of bikes versus cars; there are just people.  Today I had to cross a lane and a lad in a Merc let me out.  We smiled and went on our way.  It was grand.  We were two people sharing a space and being polite with each other.  We need to examine how we design spaces. </p> <p>There are some really good road engineers all across Ireland, but the name gives it away.  They have been designing roads for years.  We do not have good urban designers and architects who put people first.  Why does there need to be a big campaign to get a playground anywhere?  Why it is so hard to get a pedestrian crossing or water refill station?  I have been working for two and a half years to get one in place in Clare.  Why are these things which are basic and should be prioritised for humans so difficult to get?  We need to examine that because we have best practice in certain places.  That should be the case across the board in every county in Ireland.</p></speech>

While Pride is for many rightly a month to celebrate, and businesses have increasingly joined in the celebration of LGBTQI rights, the fight for full equality and justice continues.  In some federal states in the US and in EU countries we have seen a rise in anti-LGBTQI legislation.  Closer to home, we have witnessed online attacks on gay politicians, the repeated burning of the Pride flag in Waterford and homophobic graffiti appearing on Capel Street.  Last weekend when a church in Ballyfermot flew the Pride flag to show it was a welcome house for the queer community, it was subjected to a backlash.</p> <p>Last week, a report from BeLonG To outlined the impact lockdown has had on young LGBTQI people.  Young people have been trapped in homes with families who do not fully accept them, which increased their feelings of depression and loneliness.  Today I would like to remind all of us who are allies that we must remain vigilant to any rise in homophobia or transphobia in Ireland.  We have to call it out when we see it.</p> <p>I would also like to raise a second report, which was also mentioned by others.  The Women's Aid report shows the level of fear, desperation and isolation experienced by thousands of women across the country last year.  A lot more could be done to help those women.  Two years ago, the then Government ratified the Istanbul Convention on Violence Against Women.  Of course that move was welcomed by everyone. </p> <p>However, two years have passed and there are still nine counties in this country that do not have a single refuge space.  More must be done to reform the family courts so that women can access justice and get support.  The successful passage of my HAP Bill shows that action can be taken quickly when the Minister is pushed.  We do not know to date how many women and children have been made homeless after fleeing their homes to escape abuse.  In the first six months of the last year, 506 women and 706 children were discharged from refuges.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Sinn F&eacute;in has called for these figures to be published monthly, in conjunction with the figures on homelessness, so we can know the scale of the problem we face and what needs to be done to fix it.</p></speech>

When I drove in this morning, I listened to a podcast by two inner city lads.  I listened not because I was unfamiliar with the story - I am very familiar with it - but because I was interested to hear an update on it.  The podcast was about Terence Wheelock and the Wheelock family.  The family has called again for an independent review into Terence's death.  I first became aware of the Wheelock family when they lived in my estate before they moved into the inner city many years ago when we were children.  Later on I became good friends with Terence's brother, Larry, who died some years ago.  Larry died without seeing what he felt was real justice for his younger brother, who was arrested for something he did not do, who was not seen awake again and who died a few months after falling into a coma.  As I listened to the podcast, I remembered the discrepancies relating to the case and why an independent review is needed.  It also got me thinking about the wider issue of policing, even after all these years, and especially for me as I was growing up.</p> <p>I have avoided this issue time and again.  For the past two hours, I have really tried to think about why I am avoiding the subject and why I avoid talking about police violence.  It is not just about the use of force and restraint in a necessary way, it is the use of real violence against people in communities that are over-policed.  To be honest, in the short time I spent thinking about why I do not speak about the matter this morning, I recalled the many occasions when I have tried to speak about it and when I was met with a love fest of all the things the garda&iacute; are great and good at and people recounting the great experiences they had with this or that garda.  The latter completely dismisses the experiences of communities which are over-policed and which do not have the same luxury of that experience.  Then we go silent.</p> <p>One of my most extreme memories dates from when I was young and involves a garda chasing one of the young men from my estate.  I can only describe the scene as like the scene in the film "American History X".  If people have seen that film, they will know the violent scene to which I refer.  I remember as a young girl watching the scene and what the garda did to that young lad.  I was only a child, maybe about ten.  When I wrote my book, I went back to the man involved I asked him if he could tell me if I remembered it correctly.  Sometimes these memories are so extreme I think that it could not have happened like that, but it did.  I would have experienced violence at the hands of garda&iacute;.  Nobody's positive experience with authority should ever negate the negative experience of other people.  They can both exist within the same institution and in the same space.  We need to be able to talk about this matter.  I ask the Leader for a debate on policing, but not in its broadest sense because this is when the negative experiences are flushed down.  Can we have a real conversation about the unnecessary use of violence within the police force?  I would very much appreciate that.</p></speech>

I have been speaking with the chair of the Licensed Vintners Association and I have been in contact with the chief executive of the Restaurant's Association of Ireland.  Along with many other people who operate businesses in Dublin city, they are very concerned that certain parts of Dublin city are getting out of control at particular times of the day and on certain days of the week.  They are very concerned about the lack of resources and garda&iacute; available to deal with organised groups who come into town to cause trouble and to annoy people who are dining, shopping or drinking outdoors.  People are just getting back to enjoying their city after so many months of 5 km and 2 km restrictions.</p> <p>People who work in the sector Dublin do not want to say that it is a bad situation, but they must.  They want people to come into the city, but it has reached the stage where they are really crying out for extra resources.  Maybe a short, sharp intervention is needed to tackle this matter, but definitely it would seem to be very organised groups doing this.  They may not be large in number but the impact of their behaviour is felt large in certain parts of the city, especially in Temple Bar, O'Connell Street, and South William Street, areas in which much of this activity appears to be concentrated.  It is spreading out, however.  Hopefully, the more that businesses reopen, the more people will come back into town and the more diluted this activity will become.</p> <p>Anyone who looks at Twitter will see videos of the type of activity to which I refer.  It s not just happening by accident because somebody has had too much to drink: this is organised and it is dangerous.  While we may not need a debate on the activity in question, I call on the Leader to arrange a call to the Garda.  Whatever about the regulations relating to drinking, and we all understand that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is only acknowledging the laws and rules that are there, this issue must be tackled for the future of Dublin, as a city.  We need our tourists back and we need our people to be safe on our streets and in our towns.  This matter needs to be dealt with swiftly.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the council had a joint collaboration yesterday, which was two years in the making, whereby Limerick city is now identified as a gateway city of the Wild Atlantic Way.  While the Wild Atlantic Way has been a great success, urban tourism destinations like Limerick city were losing out.  That it has now been included shows that Limerick has much on offer for tourism and culture.  What has happened will encourage people to come and use Limerick city, use hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, use the different venues and visit restaurants and so on.  Visitors to Ireland will use Limerick city as a hub when visiting many of the tourism destinations within easy reach of it.</p> <p>Also in Limerick yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, came to visit the women's caucus of the council.  Limerick City and County Council set up the first female caucus within a local authority.  More than &euro;60,000 has been announced for female caucuses in local authorities.  I welcome this because female caucuses play a key role in development and in putting forward policies.  I welcome that they will now be able to access funding from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  That they will be supported is the right thing to do.  I wish all the female caucuses in the local authorities the very best going forward.</p></speech>

I find it perfectly understandable, however, given the dominant cultural attitude in the State, that people would want a national maternity hospital that provides services completely free from any Christian or other religious influence.  That is where many people are at and it is the main attitude of the State.  The way to achieve what the State wants is through compulsory purchase of the site from the Religious Sisters of Charity or from whomever they have left in charge or to establish the national maternity hospital elsewhere.  The notion that the religious or the people they have put in charge of the campus might seek to exercise a restraining influence on the worst excesses of the new secular ethos is really illusory.  People like Dr. Peter Boylan and various Members of the Houses have stoked these fears.  They have referred to things such as abortions and gender reassignment surgeries that might not take place.  As I see it, the real tragedy is that the sisters, or those to whom they have entrusted their business, have put us in a situation where something as grotesque as late-term abortion could in the future be carried out under the nominal patronage of St. Vincent.  We would be bad enough to gift the site to the people of Ireland for such purposes, but it would be just as bad - perhaps worse - that those procedures would go on under the nominal patronage of St. Vincent.</p> <p>The repeated insulting of religious-inspired healthcare has not been challenged but it needs to be.  It was the Religious Sisters of Charity who established the first women's hospital.  It is the religious ethos that many people look to, people of faith and people of no faith, to have both excellence in medicine and also an ethical approach.  Dr. Boylan mentioned abortion and gender reassignment surgery in recent days.  When we consider what has gone on in other jurisdictions under these headings, and how people's lives have been ruined in some cases, we are reminded that some doctors are just glorified mechanics, highly skilled technical people who can cure one or kill one, depending on what the law provides and where the money trail leads.  This is where some medical professionals are at.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many people see a value in having diversity in healthcare and that there would be at least one maternity hospital in this country where, for example, people with a conscientious objection could train.  They could pursue excellence without necessarily providing procedures that many consider ethical or controversial.  In a pluralist society, the third of the people who voted against abortion and the many others who might have concerns about ethos-free medicine should be entitled to that option on the menu of health provision in this State.</p></speech>

There is a myth that would be expensive and the rail journey would be slower than the journey by bus or car.  A report carried out by consultants and published by the Department of Transport last December concluded the case for the reopening of the disused line was weak and would be extremely expensive.  However, West-on-Track, a community group that has been engaging and campaigning for many years for a rail corridor down the Atlantic seaboard connecting Waterford and Rosslare to Cork, Limerick, Galway, Mayo and Sligo, commissioned an independent report.  It was carried out by the former Economic  and Social Research Institute, ESRI, research professor, Dr. John Bradley.  It counters the key findings of the Department&rsquo;s previous report, as Dr. Bradley argues it would cost half of what the original report claimed and journey times from Claremorris and Tuam to Galway would be considerably quicker, certainly quicker than the journey by bus and quicker than the journey by car during peak hours.  Dr. Bradley found the journey times from Claremorris and Tuam to Galway would be 58 minutes and 38 minutes, respectively.</p> <p>The Limerick to Galway line via Athenry was reopened a decade ago, as the Cathaoirleach will be aware.  Despite negative sceptics at the time, it has proven a major success in the years since then.  The line carried more than half a million passengers in 2019.  Investment in improving our transport, whether it be road or rail, is a long-term one and almost inevitably one that will prove worthwhile.  We must expand and enhance our rail network.  Doing so has a wide range of benefits, including assisting with housing as more people are willing to live rurally if they have access to reliable transport lines.  Certainly that has been enhanced with the pandemic.  I would be grateful if the Leader would invite the Minister, Deputy Ryan, into the Seanad for a discussion on this topic.</p></speech>

It is ridiculous to think they should take out the windows and doors of their houses that may be ten, 15 or 20 year old and hold on to them.  There appears to be some shift in Government policy on this issue, which I welcome.  I support my colleagues on this issue.</p> <p>The Government launched a programme to research the potential and impact of a four-day working week.  I welcome the fact we could move at some sage to a four-day working week.  I ask that the Government include in that report the way provisions such as the two weeks&rsquo; sick pay, the two weeks&rsquo; redundancy payment made by employers and the living wage in context of a four-day working week would affect the country in terms of the economy, inflation and the cost of living.  The Government should investigate those issues in the programme launched today.  I would like the Leader to bring that request to the Government's attention.</p></speech>

When we are talking about the national maternity hospital and religious ethos, it is worth pointing out that only nine of the current 19 maternity hospitals provide abortion services that two thirds of the people voted for.  We still have a very long way to go to get the abortion services two thirds of the people voted in favour of.</p> <p>I want to highlight briefly again the fact the Student Universal Support Ireland pandemic unemployment payment issue has not been resolved.  I have raised the issue on a few occasions in the House.  At this point I think it will probably not be resolved.  That is very frustrating for the students and families affected by this.  I wanted to raise the issue again today.</p> <p>I highlight, as was mentioned, a four-day working week pilot programme launched today.  The campaign for a four-day working week was organised by F&oacute;rsa, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the National Women&rsquo;s Council, Friends of the Earth Ireland and a number of other groups.  The evidence shows a four-day week can provide positive results for businesses and for employees with respect to a work-life balance.  I very much welcome the fact the Government has agreed to fund a call for research to assess the economic, social and environmental impacts of a four-day working week in the Irish context.  The past year has provided workers and employers with an opportunity to consider the way we work, leading many to reflect on the way we do things.  I hope the Government will come to the table in a positive way on this issue, as it is something many people would want to see happen.</p> <p>On a final note, it is Pride week.  For those of us who are members of the LGBT community, people ask us why we still celebrate Pride, and it has been highlighted here.  There was the burning of flags in Waterford last week.  Anti-trans, homophobic, abhorrent, exclusionary, cruel stickers popped up all over the country.  Irish LGBT youth faced increased mental health struggles during the lockdown, as indicated in a BeLonG To survey that was carried out.  Thousands turned out for the Warsaw Pride march against the rising tide of homophobia in Poland in the form of LGBT-free zones.  There is an enormous way to go.  While it is Pride week and we will be out celebrating safely in our way, we should remember there is an enormous degree of struggle we still have to go through.</p></speech>

I was delighted a number of the projects are in my county, in particular in my town of Navan where the town walls project received funding and a project to carry out work on Babe&rsquo;s Bridge, which is the oldest arched bridge in Ireland dating back to 1216.</p> <p>However, a project of major national significance in the town that needs immediate assistance is the former St. Patrick&rsquo;s classical school, which the Leader would know well as it is located beside the old County Hall in Navan.  That building, which is of national architectural significance with its unique duck egg shape and roof, saw its magnificent roof collapse in on itself last week.  It needs immediate assistance.  I saw some comments on social media from former students from the 1950s and 1960s.  They were delighted the roof fell in and were only sorry the walls did not fall down as well because of their negative experience in the school during that period.  I can understand those remarks but this is a building of national importance.  It has been designated as such.</p> <p>I pay particular tribute to Meath County Council and its director of services, Dara McGowan, who has led the conservation effort and appointed consultants only last week to lead that effort, to bring it through the planning stage to development stage and to create a county museum and archive in that building.  It has been in receipt of urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, funding to allow this process to take place.  It will be seeking further URDF funding to allow the development to take place.  A great deal of work has been done.  I pay tribute to the council.  I have spearheaded this project for a number of years.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to join me in my request and to write to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, requesting emergency funding to help that particular aspect of the conservation process of the roof.  Each tile that has come in has to be individually numbered and the beams have to be individually taken down.  It is a costly process.  I ask for the Leader's assistance to work with the Minister of Sate, Deputy Noonan to assist Meath County Council in this worthwhile project.</p></speech>

He was a Liberal MP and Victorian political thinker.The main premise of his argument was he who knows only of his own side knows little of that.  His main point was that for your argument to have any validity, it had to be tested in the court of public opinion against someone else&rsquo;s argument.  That is the only way you could be certain your argument was either correct or right, when you heard the other side.  When we bring that argument forward to the modern day era, we have the problem of the spread of disinformation, online conspiracy theories and people retreating into echo chambers where they only hear people who agree with them.</p><p>I pay tribute to Finland and the work the Finnish department of education is trying to do in this area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What it has done is interesting.  In 2014, the Russian Government attacked Finland with advertising through Facebook and other sites to try to destabilise it.  As a result, the Finnish Government introduced classes for primary schoolchildren on critical thinking and how to identify misinformation and disinformation online.  It was visionary and became a part of the Finnish curriculum in 2016.  It is a wonderful concept for Ireland to consider.  I would appreciate a debate on what the Department of Education intends to do in terms of educating primary and secondary level children on how to identify and deal with misinformation online and be more critical thinkers.</p></speech>

Homophobia and transphobia seem to be on the rise.  This year, I am thinking about the folk in Waterford and across the island who are standing up and resisting homophobia and transphobia.  It is an important and inspirational show of strength from our community and our allies.  Pride is a moment to stand together, share experiences and break silences.</p> <p>HIV stigma affects people with and without HIV.  Does the House know that people who are on effective treatment cannot pass HIV on to their sexual partners?  People should stand up to stigma and know their status.</p> <p>We must listen to young people who are telling us that they are not getting sufficient relationships and sexuality education, RSE.  RSE should be age appropriate but it should also be holistic and inclusive, empowering and protective of all young people.  Change is urgently required in this regard.  I hope that we will not be here next year still waiting on that change.</p> <p>I wish everyone a safe, happy and healthy Pride and I look forward to getting back on the streets with our community and our allies and sharing our love with the city because an army of lovers cannot lose.</p></speech>

The report is stark and says that, if we follow the Climate Action Plan 2019, we will only achieve a 2% reduction per annum, far short of the programme for Government's commitment of 7%.  This shows the importance of passing the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, which is before the Seanad this week.  Only by putting in place new plans and carbon budgets will we achieve what we need to, not just in terms of the planet, but also for our children, who have been calling for climate action for years.  It is our duty to ensure that the months spent scrutinising the climate action Bill are taken into account and that we put in place the necessary plan by the end of this year.  It is essential at this stage.</p><p>I wish everyone a happy Luxembourg day for tomorrow.  I was an <i>au pair</i>in Luxembourg.  I have been there many times.  It is a beautiful country.</p><p>It appeared on my feed today that I was in Oslo for Pride two years ago.  The wonderful celebrations that we had then and every year in Ireland are being felt differently this year.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, went to Waterford yesterday.  He had a good reception because the majority of people in Waterford and elsewhere in the country respect diversity.  It is time for us all to stand in solidarity with members of the LGBTQ+ community.  I am certainly doing so today.</p></speech>

His wife and three children, all of whom are Irish citizens, live in Elphin, County Roscommon.  I commend the Leader because when, with the House's support, she gave the Seanad a commitment to bring the matter to the Department of Foreign Affairs, she did so.  I appreciate that.  However, it is with a heavy heart that I express my disappointment with the Department, which has virtually left this woman and her three children on a desert island.  They have no more flares left to send up to notify people of where they are.  The oldest son could not complete his leaving certificate in recent days.  He has pulled his applications to two universities in this country.  The children's loving father has been taken away and it has devastated the family.</p><p>I supported many politicians on this island when they spoke in favour of the Belarusian journalist, Mr. Roman Protasevich, who was horribly and wrongly thrown in jail with his fianc&eacute;e.  I am asking Irish politicians of all persuasions to have a heart.  I am asking everyone who is a parent to have a heart.  This woman has a United Arab Emirates driving licence that she cannot use to drive in Ireland, yet she cannot get a theory test.  This is all a total failure of the State.  I understand diplomacy.  I am not asking the Department to poke its finger into the Iraqi Government's affairs, but will everyone in this Chamber, journalists, officials and politicians please take note of what I am saying and try to lend a hand to a distraught family?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-22a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021062200002#O00600"><p>I condemn in the strongest possible terms the recent instances of homophobia seen in Dublin and Waterford.  Pride flags have been removed, straight pride posters have been erected and disgusting graffiti has been scrawled near a gay bar.  The people behind these acts do not represent us.  Their acts are shameful and wrong and we must stand firm against them and their prejudice.  We have made progress in recent years, but we still have a long way to go.  That is why it is important that we stand in solidarity with our friends, colleagues and family in the LGBT+ community.</p> <p>I will turn to another issue, that of social housing and the criteria used by local authorities to determine the house type for which a family qualifies.  From examining the issue, there seem to be large discrepancies between local authorities.  Some use section 63 of the Housing Act 1966, which defines "overcrowding", to decide for what house type a family unit qualifies.  The issue with this is that couples or lone parents with two children of the same sex or below the age of ten years are only being considered for two-bedroom properties whereas couples or lone parents with children of the opposite sex or over ten years of age are being considered for three-bedroom properties.  This seems inexplicable.  I have raised the matter with the Department, which says that the flexibility to address the matter lies with local authorities.  However, local authorities say that the issue lies with the Department.  Either way, the problem needs to be resolved and there needs to be consistency across the country.  As a result of this restrictive practice, lists in local authorities for three-bedroom accommodation are much shorter than lists for two-bedroom properties.  This will continue as time passes, given that more three-bedroom than two-bedroom properties are being built.</p> <p>It is great to be able to raise this issue because of our social housing output, which increased dramatically from 2013 to 2019.  It is often not recognised, but we increased social housing output from 1,800 units in 2013 to more than 10,000 units in 2019.  The Government will continue building on that success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-22a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1653" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021062200002#P00100"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and colleagues.  Senator Cummins raised an issue that beggars belief.  First of all, I do not actually believe we are building very many two-bedroom houses in our social housing stock.  It makes no sense to put two small children, whether they are the same sex or not, in one bedroom when one knows full well that in a number of years that bedroom will not be sufficient for them.  We will end up having to move families from a house or home, or an area in which they have settled, into another area, which beggars belief.  I will raise the issue with the Department and revert to the Senator.  I believe this needs much more of a debate than this medium this morning.</p> <p>I cannot even begin to tell Senator Murphy how disappointed I was to hear him raise the issue this morning of Mr. Robert Pether.  To read the article yesterday, however, in which Mr. Pether's wife stated that her husband is getting more support from the Egyptian Embassy than he is from ours, is really and truly heartbreaking.  I understand and appreciate that the gentleman himself is not an Irish citizen but his wife and children are.  They are the ones who are severely impacted by the fact he is being detained illegally in a foreign country.  I will contact the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, again today to see what help we can give and revert to Senator Murphy.</p> <p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly raised the report of the Environmental Protection Agency which highlights just how long a road we have to travel.  We are all very cognisant of the fact that we do not have very long to travel that road.  A 2% emissions reduction year-on-year will do absolutely nothing for nobody.  Obviously, there are people in the country who will tell us that 7% is not enough and we probably need to be at 10%.  We all know the challenges around that, however.  We certainly cannot suffice with 2%.  We have an awful lot of work to do.  I thank the Senator for raising that issue.</p> <p>A number of colleagues today and yesterday raised the issue of the homophobic behaviour we have witnessed in this country over the last number of weeks, not only in Dublin but also in Waterford, which is genuinely surprising.  I said this yesterday but I will repeat it again today.  First, it is a time for us to be happy and celebrate that Ireland is such a warm, open and loving country.  We recognise that love is love and it does not matter what shape or size a person is; that is his or her right in this country.  A small number of people, however, will try to build back up again those walls that have been torn down.  We certainly will not allow it.  It is, therefore, important for us to continuously state that we are very happy and proud of the nation's response in treating all our citizens with equality and respect in the last number of years.  We need to keep saying that loud and often.</p> <p>Senator McGahon spoke about John Stewart Mill.  I tend to find that I get my opinions tested every single time I tweet something on Twitter or speak on a radio station.  It is, therefore, certainly not an echo chamber in which any of us are living.  I totally appreciate the point, however.  It is a very innovative move for the Finnish Government to start its teachings in its primary school sector.  I will ask for a debate but it will most likely be in the autumn, just to let the Senator know.</p> <p>Senator Cassells brought up some emergency funding that is needed for St. Patrick's classical school, which is a beautiful building and historically very important to the town.  I obviously know it very well.  I will write to the Minister today and request the funding.  Perhaps we might even try to arrange a meeting for the local representatives to see if we can impart how important it is and how urgently funding is needed.  I will do that today.</p> <p>Senators Hoey and Paddy Burke raised the issue of research that is being funded by the Government regarding a four-day week.  It is not necessarily just a novel idea.  It is something that will probably happen and be accepted, or become acceptable far quicker, because of what the country and our work force has gone though in the last 16 months.  It would, however, be very worthwhile and would massively change people's quality of life, as we believe home working and remote working will do.  I very much welcome the funding that has been put towards that report and look forward to reading it.</p> <p>Senator Paddy Burke made a very valid point, however.  We are striving to make sure that we give as many employment rights as we can to people who do not have them through sick pay, automatic enrolment in order that they will have pensions when they eventually get to retirement age, supplementary payments that will come from both the State and the employers, and indeed, the living wage.  Businesses have been through the mire for the last 16 months, however.  A tremendous amount of them are only surviving and reopening because of the financial supports that are being given to them by the State.  We cannot, therefore, put so much on businesses' shoulders all at once so that they will not be able to stand up.  We need to make sure that we support them but also ensure that we extend those rights to employees over the coming years.</p> <p>Senator Crowe raised the issue of the western rail corridor, as did his colleague, Senator Chambers, yesterday.  I find sometimes that when reports are commissioned by certain groups or individuals, the outcome of those reports tends to suit their narratives, as happened with the State a number of months ago.  Professor John Bradley's report has shown just how inaccurate an outcome can be, or how many sides of the story there actually are, when we are speaking about making investments in and improving people's quality of life.  It is a no-brainer that the western rail corridor should be reopened.  I wish the Senator success and support him in that ask, as all his local colleagues are doing.</p> <p>Senator Mullen raised the issue of national maternity hospital ownership.  As I suggested to colleagues yesterday, I am attempting to table a debate on that issue in the Chamber in the next number of days.  Once I have secured the debate and the Minister has time in his diary, I will let the Cathaoirleach know and we can all arrange for speaking time.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke yesterday about a really welcome announcement for Limerick city, which will now be the gateway city to the Wild Atlantic Way.  We all know how successful a tourism project the Wild Atlantic Way has been in recent years.  It is very welcome to see Limerick included.  I genuinely congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, on the work he did with the Limerick Women&rsquo;s Caucus and the funding that was announced yesterday.  We should have a caucus in every single county.  Women need to support each other.  That is not a twee thing to say.  Women have a different experience in political life than men.  We certainly need at least the support of each other, as well as our male colleagues, to make sure we have a proper balance of men and women in our public discourse.</p> <p>Senator Horkan this morning spoke about a need for extra resources.  In one respect, social media is a huge blessing because it gives us access to information we might not otherwise know about or see.  To see the fight - or scrap - that happened on Dublin's O'Connell Street at the weekend, however, was the most unedifying thing I have ever seen.  It defies logic in my head, although perhaps that is just the way my parents raised me, as to why gangs would organise to come into town to look for trouble as if there is absolutely nothing else to do.  We have a serious issue because it seems to be an activity that is not just taking place in our city centres.  We saw it recently in Howth and Malahide, and we had trouble in Skerries over the weekend.  We definitely need a debate on resources.  I said to the Cathaoirleach yesterday that perhaps if our garda&iacute; were not doing some of the things they were asked to do over the last year, they might have more time and resources.  It definitely needs to be looked at, however.</p> <p>In contrast, Senator Ruane this morning raised the need for a debate on the other aspect of the issues we have in our Garda and policing force.  She is absolutely dead right to say that just because 99% of what the Garda does is to be applauded and supported, and garda&iacute; are courageous in the aspects of the work they take on and are absolutely supported by us all, there are not bad apples in every single profession in every walk of life.  I believe, therefore, she is right to ask for this debate.  Again, I will try to arrange that in the autumn.</p> <p>Senator Boylan spoke about Pride and the rise in LGBT legislation across Europe, which is something we should all be very mindful of and work towards unravelling.  The European Union should be front and centre on this.  Again, she raised the Women's Aid report, which is shocking.  We spoke about that in this Chamber yesterday.</p> <p>Senator Garvey spoke about people-centred towns and was a rock of sense this morning.  If we are designing roads, we are not really designing them to be shared; we are designing them for cars, trucks and buses.  Perhaps, therefore, we should take a different approach and look at things.  One thing of which I am absolutely aware, both from personal experience and from my family, is the respect, or lack thereof, that we have for cyclists on our roads, particularly certain types of cyclists who go out on a Saturday or Sunday morning.  We all need to remember that everybody is somebody's son, brother, mother, sister or friend.  We all pay road tax because most people who are cyclists on the road have cars or access to public transport anyway.  We need to be respectful of each other in a far more meaningful way.</p> <p>Senator Wall spoke about and highlighted the much-supported, albeit by a smaller group than would support male sports, return to women's sports, particularly camogie and women's football.  I will take this opportunity to acknowledge the equal funding to women and girls in GAA announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, only a couple of weeks ago, which will hopefully make a massive difference.</p> <p>Senator Conway raised the extension of the hot meals programme for schools by the Minister for Social Protection yesterday.  It is very welcome and will maintain some of those families over the summer period until they can come back to school.  I would like to see the expansion of the hot meals programme not just to every DEIS school in the country; it has an equal impact on every child.  If a child is given a hot school meal during the daytime, he or she will have a better educational experience.  That is true of all children, no matter where they live.  The Senator is correct when he says we need a strategy for long Covid, however.  I will try to arrange that debate as soon as I can.</p> <p>Senators Craughwell and Wall both raised the RACO report.  We were due to have a debate on that issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We had to postpone it because of the Palestinian-Israeli torment that arose.  I will try an arrange to have a debate as quickly as I can.  The RACO report is very worrying and should leave a lot of people worried as to future of recruitment to our Defence Forces and what they are they going to do.</p><p>Senator O'Loughlin opened proceedings by talking about World Blood Donor Day.  The inequitable treatment of people from the LGBTQ community in Ireland versus how they are treated a couple of miles up the road and in most other European countries not sustainable.  I will write to the Minister for Health to ask him to review the guidelines and come back to us.</p><p>I welcome and give my full support to the call for the new national park that is being sought to be created in the Senator's lovely county of Kildare around the Bog of Allen.  It would be wonderful to have a new national park located so close to Dublin city where people could go.  That would be a wonderful attraction for the area.</p></speech>

Given the nature of these provisions, the Houses of the Oireachtas has decided they should be routinely reconsidered.  As Minister for Justice, I am required to lay reports before the Oireachtas on the use of the relevant provisions in the two Acts.  Reports covering the 12 months up to 31 May 2021 were placed in the Oireachtas Library on 18 June.</p> <p>The House will be aware the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 contains a series of amendments to the Offences against the State Acts to respond to the threat from certain groups.  It will be recalled that this robust legislation was enacted by the Oireachtas in the wake of the horrific murder by the Real IRA of 29 innocent people in the bombing at Omagh in August 1998.  That atrocity demanded a resolute response from the State, and the legislation enacted then was a necessary and proportionate measure to defend the desire of the vast majority of law-abiding people to live in peace on this island.</p> <p>The report laid before this House on 18 June includes information provided by the Garda Commissioner on the use of the provisions in question over the past 12 months and a table setting out reported usage figures for each of the years since the Act came into operation.  The report also provides a brief assessment of the security situation.  Regrettably, despite the enormous progress made towards a lasting peace on this island, there remains to this day a real and persistent threat from those same paramilitary groups that have set their faces against peace.  We know these groups are vehemently opposed to peace and seek to attack the institutions of Northern Ireland.  Their callous targeting of PSNI officers underlines the morally vacant path which these dissident groups seek to follow.  There was a recent incident where the child of a PSNI officer was put at risk by a device, which, thankfully, was disarmed.</p> <p>As Minister for Justice, I pay tribute to the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their colleagues in the Police Service of Northern Ireland who work tirelessly and co-operate closely on an ongoing basis to counter the threat from paramilitary organisations.  Sadly, this ongoing work is all too necessary.  The benefits of that co-operation are obvious from successful joint operations between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, such as Operation Arbacia, and the recent joint cross-Border investigation targeting organised crime.</p> <p>The report also notes the clear view of the Garda Commissioner that the Act continues to be an important tool in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism.  While the 1998 Act was a response to a domestic threat, as an open democracy it is important we do not lose sight of the threat from international terrorism.  Ireland is not immune from this threat, and many provisions of the Offences against the State Acts form part of the response to that threat.</p> <p>The House will be aware an independent expert review group, under the chairmanship of former Court of Appeal judge Michael Peart, has been established to review the Offences against the State Acts.  This is an important and timely process as it is nearly 20 years since these powers were last subject to a detailed review.  I am grateful to the expert members for giving their time to this important work.  The chair of the group has confirmed to me an interim report is being finalised by the group and I expect to receive that in the near future.  That report will detail the work already undertaken by the group, along with its assessment of the time required to bring this substantial body of work to conclusion.  In the meantime, the report laid before this House notes the clear view of the Garda authorities that the Act continues to be one of the most important tools in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism.  In these circumstances, my conclusion is that these provisions continue to be required and that they should remain in operation for a further 12 months.  By that time, I expect to have the benefit of the group's final report.</p> <p>Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 is also the subject of a motion before the House.  It refers to a small number of serious organised crime offences that are set out in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Section 8 of the 2009 Act makes these scheduled offences for the purposes of Part 5 of Offences against the State Act 1939, which means trials for these offences are to be heard in the Special Criminal Court, subject to the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to direct that the offences be tried in the ordinary courts.  The purpose of this provision is to guard against the possibility of interference with jury trial by ruthless criminal groups.  Trial by jury should be preserved to the greatest extent possible.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that organised crime groups have shown a particular viciousness in their activities, including attacks on witnesses and the intimidation of jurors.</p> <p>The report on this section that has been laid before the House includes information provided by the Garda Commissioner on the use over the past 12 months of the provisions in question and details of the offences in question.  No one can be under any illusion as to the threat our communities and the entire criminal justice system face from organised crime groups who will stop at nothing in pursuit of their criminal activities.  The Garda authorities are working intensively to bring immense pressure on these criminal groups, to disrupt their activities and to seize their drugs and cash.  The Garda deserves praise for the considerable successes it has had against these groups, which have been remarkable in the past year.  With the Government's support and with the support of this House, that work will continue.  The views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are set out clearly in the report.  Its view is that the continued operation of this provision is required.  It is my view, therefore, that section 8 should continue in operation for a further 12 months.</p> <p>As set out in the two reports I have laid before the House, it is the clear view of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the provisions of the 1998 Act and the 2009 Act continue to be necessary and effective in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism and serious organised crime.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Heather Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On the basis of the information set out in the report and the advice of the Garda authorities, I propose that the House approves the continued operation of the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act and the 2009 Act for a further 12 months commencing on 30 June.  </p></speech>

As her constituency colleague, I formally welcome her to the House and congratulate her on her additional responsibilities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-22a.99" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021062200002#T00200"><p>I support the motion.  The Minister has set out a very clear basis for continuing the Special Criminal Court.  At the same time, I do not want to suggest that I think the Special Criminal Court is a good thing.  It is a blunt instrument that tramples on the right to trial by jury.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say she supports the notion that we should have jury trials to the greatest extent possible.  However, the reality is that the Special Criminal Court is a necessary evil.  It is something that must be there because of the existence of certain types of criminals in the system and certain types of trials that must take place.</p> <p>There are those who oppose the Special Criminal Court - a non-jury court - and seek to have it abolished.  Many of the groups that oppose it do so legitimately on human rights grounds and I accept their bona fides.  There are other groups that challenge it on political grounds and out of self-interest.  These groups are associated on one level or another with people who are coming before the court and want it removed for that reason.  I do not accept their bona fides.  This is a real problem when it comes to the debate on this court.  While we can acknowledge that there are problems, we must acknowledge the necessity of this court and the necessary fact that it is there to deal with particular types of criminal, particularly in the areas mentioned by the Minister such as terrorism and organised crime, because we know certain groups that come before the courts have the capacity to interfere with the justice system, juries etc.  The Special Criminal Court is the State's response to that kind of criminal, accused person and crime.  </p> <p>As I said, I am not 100% comfortable with the Special Criminal Court.  It is a blunt instrument.  Nearly a year ago, I suggested in this House that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, should not be the body deciding who gets prosecuted in the Special Criminal Court when we are not involved in one of the prescribed offences under Act.  I listened to what the Minister had to say on this.  The DPP is part of the prosecution and, therefore, is not a disinterested party in any criminal trial.  I look forward to the report of the Peart commission and what Mr. Justice Peart and his commission will have to say about this issue and the Special Criminal Court as a whole because they can deal substantially with the issues raised by people opposed to the court, both those who do so legitimately and those who do so out of self-interest.  </p> <p>As for the motion, it is very important that we look at the report laid before the House by the Minister, the basis for her suggestion that this continue and why this motion should be supported.  The Special Criminal Court exists for a reason.  It is not something that is done on a whim.  It is not something the State has put in place for fun.  It is there for a very clear and distinct reason.  It is necessary to tackle exactly the kinds of crimes and criminals outlined by the Minister.  The reality is that people are still committing these crimes at a very high level, are intimidating juries and have done so in the past.  Consequently, it is entirely appropriate that until the Minister, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or another arm of the State can show us that this is not happening and that there is no longer a threat of jury intimidation or of attempts to otherwise pervert the course of justice from people who come before the courts, the continuation of the Special Criminal Court will remain a necessity whether we like it or not.  </p> <p>There are groups like the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, with which I have discussed this issue, that raise legitimate issues about this court.  They raise questions that I hope will be answered by the Peart commission.  However, we should never approach this motion without an eye on those who do it for self interest - those parties that are really doing it because of the people with whom they are associated who are coming before the court and not for legitimate human rights or constitutional reasons and issues relating to the rule of law but quite the opposite.  They seek to pervert the course of justice.  The very people who are coming before this court come before it because there is a demonstrable concern that they are going to interfere with and pervert the course of a legitimate criminal trial.  That is the eye through which we must regard this motion.  In considering how to vote on this motion, we must consider whether the court and its continuation are necessary.  On the basis of what the Minister has said, the report that has been laid before the Oireachtas, including the views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the DPP, it is clear to me and to the Fine Gael party that its continuation is necessary until such time as we can say otherwise.  </p></speech>

I take her observations and those of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the need to continue the Special Criminal Court in its current form very seriously.  This court is there to protect Ireland and its citizens from organised terrorism from criminal gangs and dissident republicans.  Unfortunately, until such time as these issues are dealt with and these groups are no longer a threat, the Special Criminal Court will be necessary.  This is my eleventh year standing up supporting this legislation.  There can be no room for political equivocation when it comes to supporting the Special Criminal Court.  It is there for a reason.  It is there because it must be there.  Nobody likes the fact that it is there but we have a duty and a responsibility to protect the citizens of this country.  Dissident republicans have not gone away.  We all know that.  Organised crime gangs in this city have not gone away.  We know that.  Domestic terrorism has not gone away and there is an increased risk from international terrorism.  We need the Special Criminal Court to ensure people serving on juries are not intimidated.  Unfortunately, that is the reality.  I am calling on all parties in this House to nail their colours to the mast and support the Special Criminal Court, which is an important institution in this country's legal system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-22a.101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021062200002#T00400"><p>The Minister is very welcome.  I support the motion before us today as I have done on each previous occasion on which it has been before us.  On the whole, the Special Criminal Court has been an effective tool against subversive elements and in recent years, organised criminal gangs and for this reason, it is worth retaining.</p><p>However, the case for its retention is far from unanswerable.  I am broadly in agreement with much of what Senator Ward has just said.  We need to be clear that the ultimate aim of the Oireachtas is for there to be a time when the shutters can be brought down on that court.  To believe it should exist permanently would be to admit that jury courts are incapable of operating effectively and that would be wholly wrong.  </p><p>There is a lot of hypocrisy and posturing around this issue.  I noticed that Senators Ward and Conway were very reluctant to name names but I am not so reluctant.  I do not for a moment accept the position of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party on the existence of the Special Criminal Court, even if it appears to have moderated that position in recent years.  Sinn F&eacute;in's opposition to it has morphed from resentment over the fact that the court is so successful in convicting many fellow members of its movement to a <i>faux</i>concern for human rights and the philosophical values of trial by jury.  I do not think anybody buys into that metamorphosis for a second.  Equally, I do not buy into the absolutist position of many.  I think Senator Ward would acknowledge that there are many in his own party who have a more absolutist position in favour of the Special Criminal Court and seem to view its existence as some kind of <i>sine qua non</i>for a society that values law and order as if the court was a thin blue line standing between ourselves and Babylonian chaos and disorder.  In their eyes, any criticism of the court's existence is seen as being somehow soft on crime, criminal gangs and subversive organisations, which is simply not the case.  There are many legitimate criticisms to be made of the existence of the Special Criminal Court.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The right to trial by jury of one's peers has existed since Greek and Roman antiquity and it should not lightly be cast aside without acknowledging just how serious a step that always is.</p><p>We should not pretend that the Special Criminal Court is somehow an ideal forum which produces the right results every time and is free from external influence or interference.  We recently marked the 25th anniversary of the capital murder of the late Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  As we know, reduced charges of manslaughter were brought by the State in that case because it was feared that murder convictions might not be secured because of the intimidation of key prosecution witnesses by persons connected to Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA.  While the Special Criminal Court by its nature prevents the intimidation of juries, it has clearly not prevented the intimidation of witnesses.  It is an imperfect solution to a very serious problem.</p><p>It has also been documented that in the days following the killing of Detective Garda McCabe, his murderers were put up in a safe house in the Border area where they were met by the late Martin McGuinness, a man spoken of in this House, on RT&Eacute; and elsewhere in recent years as if he were Mahatma Gandhi.  When those murderers were released from prison, they were met by a Sinn F&eacute;in TD, then Deputy Martin Ferris, which all goes to show the layers of hypocrisy involved here.  It is important that we do not forget the origins of Sinn F&eacute;in's opposition to this court.  It is important that we are honest at all times, even while we welcome new developments, attitudes and processes.</p><p>On the question of civil liberties, we should always be vigilant about them and the rights of accused persons.  I say this in light of the proposed Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na powers Bill 2021, which seems to propose a massive and radical increase in the powers of the Garda and could expose entirely innocent individuals to prosecutions and heavy penalties for doing nothing other than defending their constitutional right to privacy, the right to silence and the presumption of innocence.  I have grave concerns about the kites that have been flown in relation to this proposed Bill.  These have been criticised very well in print by my colleague, Senator McDowell, Dr. T.J. McIntyre of UCD and others.</p><p>The power to seek passwords for phones and so on for all persons and all suspects, and connected persons, regardless of circumstances would be huge in its scope and has not to date even been sought by the Garda.  Why is this being floated?  To be clear, there are circumstances - a narrow set of crimes - where there is that power to demand passwords, etc., but the proposal that garda&iacute;, when carrying out search warrants, could demand of people their passwords or personal identification number, PIN, numbers, to require them to biometrically unlock their phone or tablet using their fingerprint or face if they are a suspect, a relative of a suspect or a person living with a suspect, and that that requirement could be made on the spot without a person having access to a solicitor, seems draconian.  It is worrying that this is being proposed.  It reminds us that the freedoms we take for granted are not always safe, even in societies that view themselves as democratic.  It is a reminder to us that we need careful scrutiny of what government proposes from time to time.  It is a reminder to political parties that, even though they might have the majority in government and might be in a position to vote everything their Government wishes through and to limit opposition through mechanisms such as the guillotining of legislation, they really should not do so as there is an awful lot at stake.</p><p>On this particular issue, we must not forget that, in a free and open democracy with a written constitution, and which values the rule of law, the idea should always be that we must restrict people's rights and liberties only in the most minimal way possible and in ways which are aimed only to bring about the safety and security of everybody in society.  As matters stand, the existence of the Special Criminal Court is a legitimate abrogation of the right to jury trial but the proposals that I am reading about in these days in the proposed Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na powers Bill go way beyond what could ever be acceptable in a democracy.</p></speech>

I congratulate her on her new-found responsibility in the Department of Justice.  I wish her well in that Department.</p> <p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak in this important debate.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party totally supports the motions, which provide for the continuation of certain provisions under the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and also the continuance in operation of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.</p> <p>We fully agree with the continuation in operation of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, which is a central provision in the battle against dissident republican groups engaged in terrorism.  This Act was introduced in 1998 by Fianna F&aacute;il in response to the Omagh bombing.  The State must remain vigilant at all times in the face of a continuing threat from dissident republican terrorist groups which refuse to recognise the legality or existence of the State.</p> <p>Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 is a vital tool in the battle against organised crime.  The Act was first introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Section 8 allows for the prosecution of individuals before the Special Criminal Court without a jury for directing a criminal organisation, participating in or contributing to the activity of a criminal organisation for the purposes of committing or facilitating the commission of serious offences, and-or the committing of an offence for a criminal organisation.  This was a necessary legislative provision to rebalance the justice system's approach in favour of the Garda in the fight against organised crime.</p> <p>I look forward to the day when there will be no need for a Minister to come to the House to renew this legislation.  Senator Conway stated this is the ninth or tenth year that he has had to stand up and support this legislation, and rightly so, but we look forward to the day that there will be no need to do that.</p> <p>The relevant provisions of the Act will be in force until 30 June this year.  If they are to remain in force, they will need to be renewed before that date.  Renewal of the provisions requires the passing of resolutions in both Houses of the Oireachtas and we are here in the Seanad to do that today.</p> <p>The Minister outlined clearly the need that for this legislation to remain intact.  Unfortunately, dissident republican organisations and organised crime gangs are running rife in the State.  That is a depressing thought but in order to protect our citizens, we have no choice but to continue with this legislation.</p> <p>I compliment the Garda on its ongoing work to deal with all areas of criminality in the State.  I acknowledge the major successes it has achieved in this regard and wish it continued success in the future.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this legislation will have to remain in place for the next 12 months but it is only right that it is being reviewed.  Last year, the Minister indicated there would be a review of this legislation and I very much welcomed that.  It is important that we shine a strong light on the laws of the land so that citizens can be protected in the best way possible.  The Minister stated the review would be published shortly.  I look forward to having an opportunity to examine the recommendations included in that report.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il is delighted to support this legislation.  As I said, I look forward to the day when there will be no need for any of us to come into this Chamber to discuss this topic.</p></speech>

Like other colleagues, I have spoken for a number of years now on these motions as they come before us.  I also have a particular interest in this, having practised for several years in the Special Criminal Court in different trials as a defence practitioner.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While I am not opposing the renewal, I am, and have been, very critical of various aspects of the framework of the offences against the State legislation and these motions.  I have always made the case for strong and rigorous Oireachtas scrutiny of these renewal motions.  I welcome the expert review chaired by Mr. Justice Michael Peart and I am glad to hear the Minister confirm that the interim report is due shortly and that by next year we are likely to have the benefit of the full report of the expert group.  That will be very important, particularly as the last such comprehensive review, chaired by Mr. Justice Hederman, was published in 2002.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was very strong in recommending that a similar comprehensive review was urgently needed.  That is why we have the current review, which is very useful.<br/><br/>It will also be of great value to the ongoing review that since the 2002 review there have been a number of scholarly books published and a great deal more academic research carried out on the practice of the Special Criminal Court and the operation of the Offences against the State Acts.  There have been books by Ms Alice Harrison, Mr. Fergal Davis and most recently a book edited by Mr. Mark Coen of University College Dublin, UCD, <i>The Offences Against the State Act 1939 at 80: A Model Counter-Terrorism Act? </i>Without going on too much about it, I have a chapter in that book.  There is a number of different chapters and the book offers a series of different critical perspectives on the legislation, which I hope will be of use to the review.<br/><br/>I also remind colleagues that, last year, we debated the renewal motions in an extraordinary context, just four hours away from the deadline at which the sunset clauses would have lapsed.  That was due to the long drawn out Government formation negotiations and the context in which a number of sitting Senators had taken an action in the High Court over the constitutional status of the Seanad.  On this occasion, we have more time to consider the motions and we are doing so in a somewhat less urgent setting in that the sunset clauses are not due to lapse until 29 June.  However, last year's context shows some of the difficulties with this framework, that it was so close to a deadline for expiry within which we were having the debate.<br/><br/>The expert review and we, as legislators, must take notice in a more measured and considered way of a number of crucial issues with the renewal motions.  First, as others have said, we must be mindful that the offences against the State legislation has now become so entrenched in our criminal justice system that it has assumed a type of <i>de facto</i>permanency.  We have to be careful that we do not become so used to this that we become, as Ms Justice Iseult O'Malley has said, over habituated to the abnormal.  We must remember that the framework encroaches on fundamental due process rights, notably the right to trial by jury, and that it has been condemned nationally and internationally by human rights and civil liberties bodies over many years for its encroachment on these due process rights.  Ms Justice O'Malley pointed out that the risk of becoming over habituated to the abnormal is best countered by constant insistence on constitutional due process.  As legislators, we must remind ourselves of the need to have constant insistence on due process.  Indeed, the courts have ruled in a range of cases on aspects of the provisions in the legislation and have brought that constitutional scrutiny to bear.<br/><br/>When we are scrutinising the annual renewal motions under both the 1998 and 2009 Acts, there are two particular areas we must examine.  First, we must look at patterns of usage and non-usage of separate distinct provisions, as outlined in the reports with which we are provided.  In previous years I have made the point that there are some sections, for example, in the 1998 Act, that never seem to be used.  This year, sections 3, 4, 6 and 17 have not been used in the last 12 months.  As regards sections 6 and 17, I have noted a long pattern of non-usage.  Where we see such patterns we have to ask, and the review will be asking, whether those provisions should simply be repealed if they are not used.  I believe all will agree with that.  Similarly, if there is a consistent pattern of usage and if provisions have clearly become an important part of the package of measures available to the Garda, what is the purpose of the sunset clauses if we are simply almost routinely renewing them because we see they are being used routinely?  These are questions that must be answered, and I hope the review will take them very seriously.<br/><br/>My final point refers to an amendment that the Labour Party tabled in the D&aacute;il in 2019 dealing with a real concern we have about these renewal motions.  In each year we are asked, in accordance with Article 38.3.1&deg; of the Constitution, to make a determination as to the inadequacy of the ordinary jury courts to try certain offences in accordance with law.  This standard, we argue, therefore requires that we would have evidence before us that the ordinary courts are not appropriate or not adequate to try certain offences.  Our concern is that we have never had sufficient evidence to make this determination in a sufficiently rigorous fashion.  I contrast the lack of information before us with the information supplied to legislators when we are making considerations under the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  We are being asked to exercise a determination in what might be considered an evidential void.<br/><br/>We are not being given sufficient information to determine, for example, whether there are intermediate measures to protect jurors where there is an issue with intimidation of juries and where that is the basis on which the Government says ordinary courts are inadequate.  Are there intermediate measures, such as screening, anonymising or locating the jury in a different place?  Such evidence would be very valuable to legislators when we come to make these determinations annually because, as we must remind ourselves, we are making determinations that effectively interfere with one of the most basic rights we all have as citizens when we come before the courts, which is the right to be judged in open court by a jury of our peers.  This is a crucial consideration for the expert review group, and it is something we must always be mindful of as legislators when we bring our parliamentary scrutiny to bear on these motions.  I ask the Minister to convey those considerations and concerns to the expert group.</p></speech>

We had great times.  The two of them were always very unequivocal when it came to being heard when speaking out against violence.</p></speech>

I have a difficulty with this motion and I am most reluctant to support it, but I will because the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is obviously relying on intelligence in her Department.  Senator Bacik said that she was a practitioner in the Special Criminal Court for many years.  I have been there as well as a practising barrister.  Symbolically, it was in Green Street, which was isolated from the rest of what was then the Four Courts.  A former Member of this House, Ms Mary Robinson, commented that this was unfortunate.  The voluminous nature of the published law reporting from that court in the early days, because it was verbal, did not help.  A very small number of senior counsel were involved, the then Senator Robinson said.  There were Mr. Paddy McEntee and Mr. Seamus Sorohan, two wonderful senior counsel.  Mr. Sorohan is since deceased.  There was the level of security in Green Street and the fact that retired judges could serve on the Special Criminal Court, as could ex-military in the old days.  All lent itself to a court that was clearly not rooted in common law.</p><p>At its heart was an admission that the ordinary courts were inadequate.  However, the ordinary courts and jury trials are a cornerstone of our justice system.  The UN Human Rights Committee has said one should only dispense with a jury trial in very exceptional circumstances.  They are extraordinary courts for an extraordinary time.  The question is, as Senator Bacik said, whether the evidence is there to continue.  I am concerned about the rubber-stamping nature of this every year, without exceptional scrutiny to ensure they do not gain a <i>de facto</i>permanency.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P. Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=VincentPMartin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The minority view of the committee to review the Offences against the State Act came from the late Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman, Professor Dermot Walsh and Professor William Binchy.  They expressed the view, with which I concur, that trial by jury is a cornerstone of the criminal law system as it ensures that the innocence or guilt of a person charged with an offence is determined by 12 randomly chosen members of the community, each of whom brings to the process the benefit of his or her life experience and individual perspective.  Lord Devlin, in typically colourful language, said that trial by jury is the lamp that shows that freedom lives.</p><p>It is only in the most exceptional circumstances that I would support dispensing with the constitutional right to trial by jury.  The Constitution contains many rights which would point to only getting rid of jury trials in the most exceptional circumstances.  Therefore, I find the implied narrative contained in some contributions today to be slightly troubling and unfair.  It has been suggested that those who express reservations about continuing with the practice of holding non-jury trials and with discontinuing such a basic fundamental right are somehow soft on crime or have sympathies or affiliations with a political party that may have friends or colleagues who found themselves in the position of being an accused before that court.  I would take a leaf out of Senator Bacik's book here and point out that our Constitution guarantees equality before the law, including the right to equal protection of the law.  We have a situation where two citizens of Ireland are tried for the same serious offence in two different formats; one is entitled to a jury trial while the other is not.  The one who does not have a jury trial also faces weaker evidence tests, albeit closely scrutinised, where opinion evidence and a different interpretation of the right to silence are tolerated.  These would not be tolerated in a jury trial.</p><p>There is a guarantee in our laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.  We have a duty to uphold the rights of citizens and must do so and this includes the right to a fair trial and a jury trial.  The test is whether there is an alternative in this day and age, especially with the advent of Covid-19.  Can we screen juries?  Can we have remote hearings?  Can we keep the names of jurors out of the public domain?  Can jurors remain anonymous?  Hopefully, with the help of God, we will all be back here next year and I will bring this issue up again.  I will be seeking succinct and cogent evidence that those tests have been met before I support another renewal.  I appreciate, as the Minister said, that the report by recently retired Mr. Justice Michael Peart to be published imminently might be a signpost.</p><p>Human rights organisations, not just in Ireland but throughout the world, would say that only in the most exceptional circumstances should non-jury trials be conducted.  The Minister is in the Chamber today to guide us as legislators.  She has said that her intelligence is that this is absolutely and 100% necessary and in that circumstance I must, very reluctantly, support the recommendation.  Her bona fides are not in doubt.  She is acting in the best interests of the security of our country but I hope we will remain open-minded for the next renewal.  We should never go down the road of the rubber stamp because we are depriving our citizens of such a fundamental right with this legislation.</p></speech>

This is my first opportunity to engage with Deputy Humphreys in her role as Minister for Justice.  I welcome her to the House.  Today's debate provides us with an opportunity to assess the current state of the capacity of the Oireachtas, the judicial system and the policing system to deliver on the most fundamental objective of all three institutions, that is, the protection of the public in their homes, communities, places of work and businesses.  The State has many responsibilities to the public that it serves but its principal, if not primary, objective is to be a guardian of the public's welfare and well-being.</p> <p>On this primary objective of protecting the public, Sinn F&eacute;in is crystal clear that it must be protected with the full resources of the Oireachtas, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Judiciary.  These three agencies are interdependent, one on the other, in their responses to the challenges they face by organised criminals.  Last year, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed an amendment which drew support from Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party, the Social Democrats and some Independents in the D&aacute;il, calling for a review of the emergency powers contained in the Offences against the State Act, in keeping with the Government's Good Friday Agreement commitments.  The Government agreed to do so and established a review panel earlier this year, as mentioned by a range of colleagues.  Submissions to that panel must be made by 9 July and it is expected that the panel's findings will be brought forward later this year.  This is an important advancement on the annual discretion that took place heretofore.  Today's motion will pass through the Seanad unopposed by Sinn F&eacute;in because the party has an eye to the findings of the review panel due later this year.  </p> <p>All parties in the Seanad should turn their minds to the future and to bringing forward sensible proposals to ensure that society is fortified with a framework of effective laws passed by the Oireachtas and implemented by the police and the courts.  I do not see how laws crafted in the 1940s can be fit for purpose today.  The shocking cyberattack on the HSE last month is a very good example of the level of sophistication that today's criminal class is employing.  We should all be seeking 21st century laws to tackle 21st century criminality.  We want An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Judiciary to have the power to bring peace, security and certainty to the people.  We want to see those involved with criminal gangs at all levels removed from the streets and put behind bars.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals provide peace, security and certainty for the State's institutions and the public at large.  They will make it easier to use our law, police service and courts effectively to arrest and imprison criminals, provide more police on the beat and protect jurors and those giving evidence against wrongdoers.  In the battle to overwhelm, isolate and imprison lawbreakers, as legislators we must ensure our legislation is stronger and our courts are more effective.  Our courts system must be amended to protect jurors and witnesses and garda&iacute; must be given the tools they need to do their job to the best of their ability.</p> <p>Let us end, as others have said, the annual debate about the Offences against the State Act and replace it with a seamless and impenetrable system that has the citizen at its centre, surrounded and protected by the Oireachtas, the courts and the police.</p></speech>

I thank, in particular, those who are supporting the motions.  As I said earlier, terrorist groups remain a threat to the people on this island.  They are opposed to the benefits that have flowed from the peace process and are determined to undermine it.  The State must retain in its laws the capacity to defeat them and we have a duty as legislators to ensure that is so.  Likewise, the renewal of section 8 of the 2009 Act is an important contribution to the overall framework of measures aimed at tackling organised crime.  We are all well aware of the appalling damage caused by organised crime, particularly by the drugs trade, to individuals, families and communities.</p> <p>By renewing these important provisions, this House is sending a loud and clear message that this State will not tolerate the activities of terrorists and organised crime groups and is committed in its resolve to see them defeated.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Heather Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I note the concerns of Senators and I am satisfied these will be taken into account as part of the review by the independent expert group.

Senators should make their views known to the group.  This is an important piece of legislation and I consider its renewal as being essential to the protection of the citizens of this island.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senators for their support in this matter.</p></speech>
