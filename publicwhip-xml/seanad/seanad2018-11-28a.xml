I am concerned about the provision of eyesight tests for children in primary and secondary schools, especially given that nowadays children spend an awful lot of time on consoles, iPads, phones and other forms of digital media.  According to a report launched recently by a cancer society, there are concerns that children are developing digital myopia or short-sightedness as a consequence of the amount of time they spend on digital platforms.  The Government needs to consider this because, as the old saying goes, one's health is one's wealth.  One's eyesight is of particular importance.  When I was going to school, people did not think about their eyesight very much.  The issue was never highlighted.  People did not realise there were concerns about the importance of eyesight.  Something needs to be done to make sure children will receive all of the care and attention they need to protect their eyesight.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-11-28a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018112800002#A00700"><p>I thank the Senator for focusing on this important issue and giving me an opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Health, to address the issue of eye-testing for primary school children.  A child's vision continues to develop until about the age of eight years.  Vision surveillance and screening are conducted by hospital paediatric teams, public health nurses and general practitioners, depending on the stage of development, to identify children with a visual impairment or eye conditions that are likely to lead to visual impairment in order that a referral can be made to an appropriate eye care professional for further evaluation and treatment.  Vision screening is carried out under the guidance of the HSE's national screening and surveillance programme, Best Health for Children Revisited.  Children have their eyes checked at birth by the paediatric team in the hospital.  Their eyes are also checked by a public health nurse during the neonatal visit and the GP during the two and six-week visits.  Children have universal access to an ongoing vision surveillance programme provided by the public health nursing service until they commence school.  The purpose of the vision screening children undergo when they enter school is to detect amblyopia, the reduction of visual acuity in one or both eyes, usually in an otherwise normal eye.  It needs to be identified and managed before the age of eight years.  A child who has a vision issue detected during preschool or primary school screening receives a HSE service provided by community ophthalmic physicians or a hospital until the age of 16 years.  All children are eligible to have an eye examination and receive treatment until the age of 12 years.  If the parents of a child have a medical card, the child will be eligible to have an eye examination and receive treatment until he or she is 16 years.</p> <p>The HSE published the report of the primary care eye services review group in June 2017.  The review group determined that there was a need to move from the management of all referrals by community ophthalmic physicians to a model centred on primary eye care teams.  The report recommends that such teams be based in primary care settings, with optimum accommodation, facilities, equipment and resources.  Each team will provide services along care pathways, as set out in the report, for children and adults and work in an integrated fashion supported by an IT patient management system.  This will ensure hospital services are focused on patients who require more specialist diagnostics or treatments.  </p> <p>Further to a recommendation made in the review group's report, the HSE is in the process of agreeing an addendum to the community ophthalmic services scheme to allow children aged eight years and over to be seen by their local community optometrist.  The HSE is in the process of establishing primary eye care teams in south and west Dublin and further developing a team in north Dublin.  The report recommends that all routine sixth class screenings, including the colour vision test, be discontinued as there is little clinical evidence for providing visual screening for children in sixth class.  Data have shown that very few or no new cases of eye diseases such as amblyopia are detected at that stage.  Most countries no longer undertake school exit screening.  Instead, screening is undertaken at an earlier age to ensure children with eye diseases are identified at the earliest possible stage and can access treatment services.</p></speech>

While I understand what he has said, I continue to be concerned about the amount of screen time to which children are exposed.  The cancer society has shown that screen time is linked not only with short-sightedness but also cancer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This issue must be kept on the agenda because children are destroying their eyesight.  There should be an awareness campaign or other measure to highlight to children and parents the damage caused by excessive screen time.  Screen time should be limited because it is affecting children's eyesight.  The report was published in 2017, but all Members would agree that screen time has increased since then.  I have seen many children sitting in a corner for hours on a phone or playing games on a screen while their parents are otherwise occupied.  That needs to be monitored.</p></speech>

When discussing the matter, I always point out that adults must be aware of their own screen time and the example they set for children in the home and elsewhere.  I accept the Senator's point that it poses a risk to children's eyesight.  Screen time may also affect children's social, language, communication, typing and writing skills and even their dexterity.  It presents a myriad of challenges.  It is an ongoing challenge in my area of mental health of which I am very conscious.  The discussion of the issue in any forum, be it here in the Seanad or elsewhere, is always welcome as it affords an opportunity to make parents acutely aware of its potential physical, mental and holistic dangers.</p> <p>I recently met representatives of Facebook regarding screen time and they told me that Facebook is moving towards making children aware of the amount of time they spend on screens.  Many of us receive updates on our phones regarding our daily screen time, which is a welcome step towards acknowledging the problem.  Some people would be frightened by how much time they spend staring at a screen.  Physical eyesight will suffer as a result of such excessive usage.  I am not aware of any links to cancer and would need to see concrete evidence of a relationship in that regard before pursuing the issue further.  There is no doubt that screen time poses a challenge in terms of eyesight and other areas of which we must be aware.  I thank the Senator for highlighting this issue.</p></speech>

I raise a very important issue relating to education in Ennistymon, County Clare.  The debate on a community school for the area has been ongoing since I was in school there in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  There are three schools in Ennistymon, namely, the CBS, the vocational school and Scoil Mhuire, all of which do an excellent job in providing educational opportunities to young people.  I and others of my generation went to school there and did exceptionally well.</p> <p>The problem relates to the schools' infrastructure.   The buildings are many decades old.  Pupils must commute from one school to another in order to optimise their choice of subjects and ensure they have the opportunities available to other students.  That is done in inclement weather conditions such as those currently being experienced in County Clare, where it is pouring rain.  The children must move from one school to another in order to study subjects such as history, science, woodwork and so on.  The pupils of the three schools are criss-crossing the town of Ennistymon.</p> <p>I was delighted at the Government announcement in 2013 or 2014 that funding for a state-of-the-art, purpose-built community school to amalgamate the three schools was being provided.  An amalgamation committee of which I was a member was in being for several years prior to that.  It included Oireachtas representatives for the area and the trustees, boards of management and principals of the schools.  Since the funding announcement, the project successfully went through the planning process.</p> <p>People want to know when building will commence and when students will be able to enrol in the new facility.  The process has been going on for a long time.  The money is available and planning permission has been granted.  When will construction commence and when can enrolment begin?</p></speech>

The project will deliver a new post-primary school to cater for 650 pupils, as well as a new primary school on the site.  It is currently at stage 2b, which is detailed design of architectural planning and includes the application for statutory approvals and the preparation of tender documents.  Planning permission has been received for the project.</p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills has recently given authorisation to commence the pre-qualification of main contractors and reserved specialists for the mechanical and electrical works with the aim of establishing shortlists of appropriate candidates who can successfully undertake the respective works.  Pre-qualification usually takes between eight and 12 weeks to complete.  When pre-qualification is complete and the stage 2b report has been finalised and approved, the project will be progressed to tender stage.  Tender stage usually takes between seven and eight months to complete.</p> <p>This school is being delivered as part of a wider batch of projects which benefit from using a professional external project manager to co-ordinate the respective design teams on each building project.  This method combines traditional delivery with project manager support using existing design team procedures, careful and rigorous programming and constant review to achieve the best possible timeframe.  The Department meets the project manager monthly to review the progress of all of the projects.  The normal quality and cost control requirements inherent in the design team procedures and the Department&rsquo;s design guidelines continue to apply and design teams must meet those established standards.  This project is included in the six year programme to go to tender and construction in 2019 to 2021.</p></speech>

When that is completed, the tendering process and identification of a suitable contractor will take seven to eight months.  Is it reasonable to expect that construction will begin on the site in 2019 and the first enrolment of students will be in September 2021?</p></speech>

I cannot give a definitive timeframe because one must always consider events, dear boy, events.  I am very familiar with such projects.  Clonakilty Community College is on my doorstep and is slightly ahead of the project in Ennistymon as the tender is about to be opened.  It has been through the stages that the Ennistymon project must undergo and in that case the two stages took two or three months more than the estimated 12 month period.  This project may be lucky but, realistically, construction will begin in 12 to 15 months based on the information I have been given, subject to the caveat that unforeseen events may arise.</p></speech>

I raise the issue of social media and its responsible use.  As all Members are aware, social media is a great enabler of mass communication in the modern world.  We are able to keep apprised of events from all over the globe.  We are awash with communication options such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Youtube and everything in between.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Friends, families and neighbours are able to stay in contact over what were previously insurmountable distances.  People from anywhere can connect with anyone to share their interests and ideas.  A video put up on YouTube in Cavan today can be admired around the globe in seconds.  The sense of global connectedness is the wonder of our age.  Social media has also been a great benefit to many entrepreneurs and small businesses who can advertise to markets they never knew existed while not breaking the bank.  The cost of maintaining a social media presence is minimal.  If one chooses paid advertising, one can spend as much or as little as one&rsquo;s budget allows.</p><p>However, social media clearly has a darker side.  We have seen the effect of foreign social media in election campaigns.  Anyone can create a fake account.  Many people believe they can say or do anything without being traced.  This has opened the door to cyberbullying, racial and misogynistic abuse, threats, intimidation and slander.</p><p>I want to raise the case of Eamonn Mulvaney who goes by the stage name of Eamonn Jackson.  In the past, he was a director of his family&rsquo;s dog-breeding business.  This is a properly licensed and regulated state-of-the-art establishment, creating employment in County Cavan.  As a result of a television documentary regarding a puppy farm, allegedly in County Cavan, this up-and-coming country and western star with no connection to that particular business has become the target of an orchestrated campaign to destroy him and his family.  Venues where he was due to play have been contacted by individuals using various forms of social media.  They have been intimidated and, in some cases, threatened.  This has resulted in hundreds of Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s performances being cancelled at short notice, including a recent tour of the United Kingdom.  This has cost Mr. Jackson hundreds of thousands of euro and put in jeopardy the livelihoods of the ten people employed by him in the music business.</p><p>An example of the type of social media messages he receives personally every day consists of a banner with a special offer of a free necklace.  However, it shows two nooses.  They have caused Mr. Jackson not only financial loss but significant mental strain.  This innocent man, trying to establish himself in the country music industry, and his family are suffering.  Despite his many attempts to contact the social media outlets and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, he continues to receive these types of messages.</p><p>I do not like raising issues like this and naming people in the Chamber.  However, Mr. Jackson asked me to do so.  He has made contact with me, as well as my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, to highlight what is going on with the hope that something will be done about this before it has serious consequences and not only financial ones.</p></speech>

Today it is hard to imagine a world without the Internet or smartphones.  With all of the benefits that the online world brings, we are all becoming increasingly conscious of the risks it presents for ourselves and our children.  It is noteworthy that of the three Commencement matters being taken this morning, two relate to this issue.</p><p>Online safety is a priority for the Government.  The online safety and security of all citizens, especially of the most vulnerable groups, including children, is one of the most important challenges we face as a society today.  In July, the Taoiseach launched the Government&rsquo;s first Action Plan for Online Safety for 2018 to 2019.  This document presents a whole-of-Government approach to the issue of online safety.  It contains 25 actions to be implemented or substantially progressed by the six key Departments, namely the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Justice and Equality, Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Children and Youth Affairs, Health, and Education and Skills.</p><p>Some examples include in the area of mental health, examining the feasibility of hosting online therapeutic interventions and creating a pilot mental health hub in a primary care centre to provide remote online counselling services; requiring schools to consult on the use of smartphones; developing and publishing a resource on <i>webwise.ie</i>for schools to deliver Internet safety awareness evenings to parents; developing online safely resources for parents of preschool age children; developing guidance on appropriate amounts of screen time for each age group; and implementing the revisions to the audiovisual media services directive which will require video sharing platform services, such as YouTube, to have measures in place to protect all users, but especially minors, from harmful audiovisual online content uploaded by users.</p><p>A sponsor group, with membership from the six Departments involved, will oversee implementation of the plan.  The group is finalising its first progress report.  We have also established the national advisory council for online safety, chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for natural resources, community affairs and digital development, Deputy Canney, with membership from a wide range of stakeholder groups, including NGOs, industry, academics, Departments and Government agencies.  The council has held two meetings since being established in September.  It is tasked with providing advice to the Government on online safety issues; identifying emerging issues where Government intervention may be warranted, including in future iterations of the Action Plan for Online Safety; and inputting to the development of clear and easy to understand online safety guidance materials for all Internet users, including targeted material for children and young people, persons with learning disabilities, parents, and older people.</p><p>The council will publish a progress report, which in subsequent years will become its annual report in advance of Safer Internet Day on 5 February 2019.  The action plan also commits the Government to working with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to explore the issues arising in the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017.  The committee has commenced its detailed scrutiny of the Bill and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment attended the first hearing on 25 October 2018.  Departmental officials also attended a subsequent hearing on 6 November 2018.</p><p>The Minister expressed the view at the meeting of 25 October that self-regulation of online platforms may no longer be appropriate.  However, for the Oireachtas to legislate in this space, we will have to ensure the legislation is robust, effective and meets the urgent public policy need to protect all online users, especially children.  The Minister has sought the advice of the Attorney General on the legal issues which the Bill presents and he has also asked his officials to examine the Bill in detail.</p><p>There are several legal issues with the Bill, as currently drafted, which would need to be overcome, including the lack of a definition of harmful digital communications and the proposed extraterritorial role for the Irish courts.  I welcome that the committee has indicated that it intends to engage with a broad range of national and international stakeholders as it considers the draft legislation.  Online safety is an incredibly broad and complex area with a diverse range of stakeholders involved.  The risks which the online world presents vary from the most serious form of criminal behaviour to harmful or hurtful comments, sometimes perpetrated by children themselves.  The Action Plan for Online Safety takes account of the fact that no one single action can mitigate all of these risks and, in some areas, better or more easily accessible guidance and resources for parents or teachers will be more appropriate and effective than seeking to impose legislative measures.  The Government is committed to delivering on all of the actions in the Action Plan for Online Safety and to the preparation of the next action plan, preparations for which will commence before the end of 2019.</p></speech>

While I appreciate he could not refer to the case I outlined as he was not aware of it, I ask him to take what I have said about it back to the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  I assure him that my party will support the legislation when it is brought forward.  It is important that it be speeded up and brought before us as soon as possible.  On the particular case, I will continue to raise the issue in this House until a satisfactory conclusion is reached.  There are between 200 and 260 people involved.  If necessary, I will name them and give their IP addresses publicly in this House, if that is what it takes, but I do not want to go down that road.  I will also send a letter to the Garda Commissioner containing the documentation I have available, including screen shots of the foul messages sent and threats made, including to his life, to the man in question, Mr. Eamonn Jackson.</p></speech>

As such, I will not comment on it.  All of us, as politicians, both personally and professionally, are aware of the issue.  Most of us have experienced it on a personal level.</p></speech>

Some politicians are known more widely than others, but I understand many have endured it.  Exactly as the Senator said, we have encountered victims of online bullying.  People can hide behind their anonymity, parade behind various guises and engage in a free-for-all.  I have spoken previously about this matter and believe strongly every publication should have a person responsible and that everybody needs to be identified in some shape or form.  If I was to send a letter tomorrow to the editor of any local newspaper and decide to take aim at anybody, I could remain anonymous by having it stated underneath "name and address with the editor".  However, the editor of the publication would have a responsibility to know who I was and could not allow the letter to go through without it.  Likewise, most politicians are aware that when someone talks to a radio station, it must always ring the contributor because it is responsible.  While I could talk on a show as Joe from Drumcondra, even though my accent might me give away, or use any name I wanted, and while I would be entitled to my anonymity, the provider of the platform would have to know who I was and take responsibility.  We have it in the radio and newspaper space for all publications, but we do not have it in the online space.  I have had good engagement on this issue with the Data Commissioner.  One of the biggest challenges, from a legislative point of view, which is what the Senator is talking about, is that there are no boundaries.  It would, therefore, be difficult to enact effective legislation, even if one could achieve an EU-wide consensus on the issue, on which I have engaged with the commissioner, because of the nature of the worldwide web, but I am sure we could do more than what we are doing.</p></speech>

She was very generous in giving us her late husband, Se&aacute;n, who, as the Cathaoirleach said, was a thorough gentleman and a good friend to many of us in the House.  I had the pleasure of knowing him.  We shared office space in Leinster House 2000 and we had many a chat over a cup of coffee.  He was a very helpful, courteous and professional gentleman.  Mrs. Ardagh's daughter is continuing the good public service in this House as leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il group.  We thank Mrs. Ardagh and remember Se&aacute;n Ardagh today.</p></speech>

A garda has been injured.  It is not fatal but he had very serious injuries to his head and limbs.  I convey my sympathies and those of the Fianna F&aacute;il group to the family of the victim who was fatally injured and to the garda in question.  It is a serious, crazy tragedy.  The details are unbelievable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The second issue I wish to raise concerns a Barnardos report, according to which 37,000 children are on waiting lists across the country for various treatments, including mental health treatment, disability treatments, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy.  I met an alliance of DEIS school principals from the Ballyfermot area.  They stated categorically that such treatments needed to be provided in schools if they were to benefit children directly.  I call for a debate on DEIS school funding.  The DEIS model was introduced by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government, specifically by my colleague, former Deputy Mary Hanafin.  The model has been successful.  In the 1980s the primary school retention rate in disadvantaged areas was only 80%.  It is now over 90%.  Despite its success, the model is outdated.  Funding for DEIS schools has not increased and their pupil-teacher ratios have not improved, even though they have in mainstream schools.  Alongside the debate about the DEIS model, we should discuss providing treatments such as speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychological support in mainstream schools in order that children can have direct access to them, instead of the system relying on their parents to bring them to appointments.</p><p>I congratulate our colleague, Senator Ruane, on winning the non-fiction book of the year award at the An Post Irish Book Awards last night.  It was a major achievement.  More than 100,000 people cast their votes for her book.  I congratulate her on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group.</p></speech>

As the Bill is due to be voted on this evening, it is fingers crossed.  The visas would come from the unused portion of the 10,500 E-3 visas currently allocated to Australia which has never used its full allocation.  It could allow us up to 5,000 visas per year in perpetuity.  As under the current law, the spouses and children of the new visa holders would not count against the cap.  Their spouses would also be allowed to work.  The Bill would require visa holders to have a third level education or its equivalent.  It is a two-year renewable work visa.  Ireland has been disadvantaged since the Immigration and Nationality Act 1965 which inadvertently choked off Irish emigration to the United States.  The last time Ireland received a new visa allocation was in the early 1990s under a scheme initiated by former Congressman Bruce Morrison.  There has been disappointment on immigration legislation previously, particularly in 2007 and 2013 when we came very close to having it, but I am cautiously optimistic in welcoming the new Bill, given that the President, the homeland security chief, Speaker Ryan's office and Congressmen Jim Sensenbrenner and Richard Neal are pushing it forward today during the lame duck session.  Deputy Deasy and I have been working tirelessly in the background with Democrats and Republicans to ensure there is complete and bipartisan support for the initiative.  It is my ardent hope that, in addition to creating a future flow of Irish emigrants to the United States, many of the undocumented Irish will also qualify for the scheme.</p></speech>

I hope she will have a nice day.  </p> <p>On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in team in the Seanad, I congratulate Senator Ruane on her wonderful achievement.</p> <p>Most of all, I wish to discuss broadband provision.  The Cathaoirleach referred to meeting a French delegation.  I hope he congratulated the delegates on the fact that a French billionaire owned our national telecommunications company which was sold off by the people sitting to my left.  First, we had the Australian spectators.  Now, we have a Frenchman, all of which has left us in this state.  We must ask a couple of questions.  Will the State be open to a legal challenge because of the debacle that is the tender process, for example, the 18 meetings held and the way in which the process has been conducted?  There is also the fact that 300,000 households were hived off to Eir, rendering it more difficult for the rural broadband programme to be viable.  While I do not disregard the report, it does not cover everything.  As it is not a legal opinion, we need to get one.  Above all, we need to know when the process for the 542,000 households without broadband will start and finish.  We, in rural Ireland, are fed up with the semantics and announcements.  Last night I started to count the number of announcements of broadband services.  I gave up at 76, but I am sure it could have run into the hundreds.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael-led Governments have announced broadband services time and again, but they have never delivered.  I am not just raising the issue because of the people and businesses without broadband.  I am also raising it because of the thousands of jobs we have lost during the years because we do not have proper broadband or telecommunications infrastructure.  We have a Minister for Rural and Community Development who announces every LEADER programme grant going, in which he had no hand, act or part and who portrays the illusion that everything is wonderful and fantastic in rural Ireland-----</p></speech>

It was remarkable.  There was a large crowd of people who were respectful and dignified.  It showed the significance of the Irish reaction.  Those who threw red paint over a war memorial and wreaths were stupid and ignorant.  It is pretty much as low as one can get.  The response of the people was interesting.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In light of the fact that it drew out this response, it was a good thing.</p><p>Regarding broadband, I am glad and interested in the fact that Deputy Naughten has been completely vindicated and cleared, as it appears.

I knew her late husband, Se&aacute;n.  He was a gentleman and in opposition would always offer a smile and a "hello" and was always very helpful.  Mrs. Ardagh should be very proud of her daughter, Senator Catherine Ardagh, who is well regarded in this House.  It is great to see that line continuing.</p> <p>I also congratulate our colleague, Senator Ruane.  We are all very proud of her.  She represents our House in a unique way.  The literary award she won last night was a great achievement for her.  It was also a great night for the Seanad.</p> <p>I listened to Senator Lawless's contribution and I thank him for all the work he has done on Capitol Hill.  It is hugely important and relevant.  The Senator, Deputy John Deasy and many others have articulated the issue of the undocumented Irish in their own way, in a nice way, behind the scenes and without escalating the matter.  I appreciate that and I hope their efforts work out.</p> <p>I listened to Senators talking about broadband.  The will make an observation, although I normally do not enter into political discussion.  Sinn F&eacute;in is an all-Ireland party and any time I go across the Border I cannot get 2G, 3G, 4G or 5G.  I get general packet radio service or GPRS.  While we have done a great deal on broadband, we can do an awful lot more.  I would like to know what the difference is in connection rates between the Twenty-six Counties and the North of Ireland, where Sinn F&eacute;in is in government.  It is easy to blame people.  I could be proved wrong, but any time I go across the Border I wonder why I can only access GPRS because we stopped using it here 15 or 20 years ago.  Perhaps we should stand back and think before we say these things but perhaps I am wrong.</p> <p>The Hauntings Soldier in St. Stephen's Green was an absolute joy and galvanised the opinion of a great number of people in remembrance of the relatives of the 200,000 Irishmen who served in the First World War.  It was wonderful to see.  While we have a memorial garden in Islandbridge, perhaps now is the time to have a permanent statue of a smaller size of the Hauntings Soldier in St. Stephen's Green.  I saw a recent poll showing that up to 60% of people thought that would be a good idea and were in favour of it.</p></speech>

I understand he is a family man with two young children and was at work when the tragedy happened.  I can only for a minute think what that family is going through at present and the pain and suffering that lies ahead of them.  The time of year and the fact that he leaves behind young children make it even more heartbreaking.  I am sure the thoughts and prayers of everyone in both Houses are with the family at this difficult time.  I also extend my best wishes to the young garda who was involved in the incident and is very fortunate to be alive this morning.  He was very brave in carrying out his duties and put his life on the line doing his job.  This illustrates yet again the dangers the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na face daily.  There is probably no other occupation whose members put their lives on the line every time they put on their uniform, and we are all deeply indebted to the Garda.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the garda involved and all other garda&iacute; in County Monaghan.  I hope he makes a speedy recovery.</p> <p>The other issue I wish to touch on briefly was raised by Senator Lawless.  I refer to the undocumented in the US.  I compliment Senator Lawless on the great work he has done in this regard.  He has been a fantastic ambassador for all our Irish brothers, sisters and cousins who find themselves undocumented over there.  They go through great pain and suffering, particularly when a loved one passes away and they have a big decision to make as to whether to go home for the burial.  I compliment Senator Lawless on the work he has done and the many other political voices from across the political divide who have worked on this area.  I hope the vote this afternoon goes well and there will be hope for the people in America who would like to legalise their position and be able to come home whenever the need arises.</p></speech>

My focus is on how we will get on with building these houses but, more important, the Land Development Agency.  In September, the Government announced it would establish a land development agency but as of today we have no underlying legislation or funding for this major initiative.  We do not even have a memorandum, schedule or general scheme setting out what will happen.  Will the Leader find out from the Minister what the intention is regarding the Land Development Agency?  It is an important body.  City and county councils are asking what is happening with the agency in the context of tackling the five pillars of Rebuilding Ireland.  It is therefore important we have a progress report on Rebuilding Ireland because it is an ongoing process.  I would like a particular focus on the Land Development Agency and the legislative arrangements surrounding it.</p> <p>I take on board what Senator Ardagh said about the Barnardos report.  We all received a copy of it yesterday or today.  It is an important report and the facts it points out are shocking, particularly in the very detailed infographic attached to the report.  If we are to have a debate, however, I would like if we could broaden it out to include the very positive Government strategy for young children and their families which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, circulated today to every Member of the Oireachtas.  While we can acknowledge there are shortcomings, we must also look at the very positive things in this document, which will have arrived on everyone's desk today.  There is a lot of meat and positivity in it.  It is a longer plan for the next five to ten years, but we should have a debate both on the Barnardos report and the Minister's views on this visionary document.</p></speech>

It is now imperative we drive on to see delivery of high-speed broadband on the ground.  What we are attempting here is unprecedented in terms of State intervention to ensure that all households have access to high-speed broadband.  I ask that the new Minister be invited to the Chamber to set out how we will proceed from here.</p> <p>I raise one significant point in this regard.  Affordability for households must be at the heart of the new national broadband plan.  If householders cannot afford to pay for the broadband service once the Government rolls it out, it will be a disaster.  It is in the Government's interest that every household avails of a broadband service.  The reason I caution the House in this regard is that Eir has rolled out and offered broadband to 200,000 households under its commercial rural deployment plan, which comes under the national plan for the roll-out of high-speed broadband, but only one in seven of these households has taken up the offer.  If we do not make broadband affordable for households, we will not have broadband and we will waste billions in taxpayers' money.  This is an essential element of the broadband we need to deliver in the future.  I ask that the Minister be invited to the Chamber as soon as possible in order that all these issues can be clarified.</p></speech>

It is a significant achievement and it is absolutely right that it should be recognised in the Chamber today.</p> <p>I rise once again, more out of despair at this stage, to raise the issue of University Hospital Limerick.  I have raised the appalling industrial relations situation at the hospital on several occasions over the past several months.  As a result, I get more and more correspondence from hospital staff who are in despair.  Yesterday, one nurse told me in a letter which touched me that nurses are running out of the hospital.  We all know how hard it is to hire nurses.  However, nurses at this hospital are actively seeking employment elsewhere and are leaving in droves.  The reason is the complete lack of people management from the human resources department in the hospital.</p> <p>The nurse told me in her letter that she rang six different people in human resources but none of them would help her as they said it was not their area.  She tried to raise a grievance regarding other issues with her line manager but she would not acknowledge them.</p> <p>The week before last the hospital also recorded the 10,000th person on a hospital trolley.  It has the worst hospital trolley crisis anywhere in the country.  We have a hospital management which does not function or is not fit for purpose.  It consistently fails to address bullying, turning a blind eye to it and, as a result, the hospital is losing skilled nurses.  Three colleagues of the nurse who wrote to me have already left over the past few months.</p> <p>I am calling for a specific debate on University Hospital Limerick.  Surely we should all be able to agree that this situation cannot continue.  It goes beyond funding and is due to a complete incompetence at management level.  It needs to be addressed.  We cannot keep waiting for something to fix itself.  It will not.  Matters continue to get worse by the day.  We urgently need action on this issue.</p></speech>

That is the sweet part of my message this morning.  The second part is sour, however.</p><p>On Monday, the first tranche of &euro;100 million for the urban regeneration and development fund was announced.  Of that, &euro;6 million was announced for the new pedestrian bridge that will form a key part of the north quays development in Waterford city.  This is a development which will alter the face and the infrastructure of the city, providing housing, jobs and renewable energy for an urban centre which has long been neglected.  While this investment is welcome, it is considerably less than the &euro;20 million requested by Waterford City and County Council.  While discussing this issue with constituents and other interested parties, all agreed that Waterford could not hope to claim such a high proportion of the total disbursement due to the political optics of such a decision.  Understandably this has been met with distress and concern in the city this week.  People are concerned that if funding can fall short from particular revenue streams, it could endanger the entire project.</p><p>Considering the size, scope and importance of this development, incorporating significant changes to Waterford city&rsquo;s transport, energy and other infrastructure, do we need to reconsider how such large-scale projects apply for funding from central government?  Waterford City and County Council has made applications for co-financing to other funds, including the climate action fund.  We are optimistic about a positive result.  However, does the Government think that large-scale strategically important projects such as this need a dedicated investment fund to access?  It would be a fund that would include funds for transport infrastructure, climate and energy adaptation and more.  In order to provide greater funding certainty, the administrative burden of application could be lowered to ensure such co-funding can be delivered in a coherent and strategic manner rather than in an <i>ad hoc</i>way as we have seen.</p><p>The regional assemblies could, with some modification, be the perfect bodies to consider and apply for such an approach, especially under the metropolitan areas strategic plans.  Considering the extreme disappointment and concern the drip-drip funding approach has created in Waterford, I would like to hear from the Leader and the Government how the existing system could be better adapted to such projects to enable them to succeed with certainty and efficiency.</p></speech>

Businesses in Murroe have closed down.  With this construction project, a significant number of jobs will be created in the village.  The village will also be developed as the driver of the area.  The all-weather pitch will benefit all the villages in the surrounding area.</p> <p>We have further investment in urban regeneration developments.  Funding has been given to the Georgian area in Limerick to get people back living in the city centre.  It will assist in getting Limerick to be the driver for the mid-west.  All of these announcements are positive.  The fact they have been announced for different towns, villages and urban areas around the country is to be most welcomed.  It is not a gimmick but part of the Ireland 2040 project.  During the recession many of our towns, villages and urban areas were decimated.  We have to drive forward and develop them.</p></speech>

We are very proud of her.</p> <p>I welcome Senator Ardagh&rsquo;s mother to the Gallery.  We are all proud of her as she does a great job as Fianna F&aacute;il leader in the Seanad.  Maire herself was a councillor and mayor of south Dublin.</p> <p>I want to impress on the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for older people that the Government is not doing enough for the elderly.  Will he and the Department address the challenges in properly meeting the care needs of our oldest people?  It is failing to deliver a sustained and significant increase in home care support.  This week a Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; motion was put forward in the D&aacute;il.  It was based on what I and my party colleagues are hearing on the doorsteps from families of older people who are struggling to provide care for their loved ones.</p> <p>Long-term demand for care is continuing to grow.  We now have the scandalous situation of 6,200 people waiting for their home care packages to be approved.  I know from speaking to families that they are being put through great hardship in applying for and also getting the packages.  Another area which I constantly raise is the carer's allowance application.  People can wait from between three to eight months for the allowance which is unacceptable.</p> <p>We need to have proper support in place as we are living longer.  We need to be helping older people and those with disabilities, affording people if they wish the opportunity to grow old and remain in their own homes.  Last week, Fianna F&aacute;il published the Housing (Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability) Bill 2018.  The Bill will provide for a decision to be made on a housing adaptation grant within four weeks from the receipt of an application to a local authority.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is crucial.

I also acknowledge a guest of mine in the Gallery.  There is a daughter of a former Senator here in the Gallery.  Denny Owen O'Sullivan was a Member of this House from 1965 to 1969 and I wish to acknowledge the presence of his daughter and his grandson here.</p> <p>We have seen significant investment by the Government, in particular, in the past week, and it is important that we should acknowledge it.  The rural regeneration fund, the urban fund and, today, the climate action fund are all important steps forward in Ireland's goal towards rebuilding itself to the proposed Project Ireland 2040 model.  On the rural regeneration fund, &euro;2.1 million has been made available in my home town of Kinsale for a library.  It is significant funding for a worthy cause.  That is the kind of investment that we need to see come into towns.  It is the funding that we have lacked for the past decade.  It is an example of the vision of the Government.</p> <p>This morning saw the announcement of the significant climate action fund.  Something I have been chasing for a long time is the significant investment required for the electric vehicle charge network and this morning we saw considerable movement towards that.  With ESB Networks and its partners, &euro;10 million is being put in place for a significant roll-out of electric vehicle charging points throughout the country.  That is an example of the ambition, drive and potential that the Government has shown in the past few months and it is important that we should acknowledge it.  Unfortunately, there has been somewhat negative commentary in the House today.  It is important that we go forward and promote these projects and come up with further new innovative projects for society in order that we make sure, on the climate change issue, that we become carbon friendly but from the rural regeneration point of view, that we can reinvigorate our towns, which is badly required.</p></speech>

I thank all who dropped in and said, "Hello".  I acknowledge the Ministers, Deputies Ross and Eoghan Murphy, who spent a considerable amount of time with them in the dining room yesterday, all in our efforts to win them over to help us support the Homeless World Cup team and the Irish street leagues to bring the World Cup to Ireland in 2021.  Yesterday constituted our unofficial request, I suppose, to the parties and to the staff in the Departments who can support such a bid to bring the Homeless World Cup to Ireland.</p> <p>The Irish street leagues have operating for more a decade.  They have played a significant contribution to the re-integration of those who have often been ostracised within their own communities and have experienced homelessness and addiction.  Last year, when I went to watch the women try out for the Women's Homeless World Cup team, I was struck by the fact that I noticed some familiar faces who played alongside me in Sundrive Park when I played for Lourdes as a kid.  In growing up in working-class communities and experiencing addiction and other challenges, their amazing talent was sidelined and they never got to fulfil their full potential as the amazing footballers that they were.  I acknowledge the teams that visited yesterday.  Hopefully, we can get behind the bid to have the World Cup here.  We do not need the Aviva Stadium as it is a street league.  A football and Smithfield will do but we need to raise significant funds.  I acknowledge them and how well they did in the World Cup, winning the bowl.</p> <p>I thank everybody who has congratulated me today.  Last night, I was quite shocked to hear my name.  I was in a category with former President Mary Robinson and thought there was no way I would win.  The book is not only about me.  It is about my community, stuff that we have experienced and stuff I thought would not be accepted by wider society.  I thought I would have a fight on my hands.  It was not only acceptance of me and my story but a considerable win for my community to have our experiences, narrative and story as told by someone like me, who felt a huge responsibility to tell it in a respectful way, to have the book acknowledged and to have our histories acknowledged in this way.</p></speech>

I saw on Senator Ruane's Instagram this morning that she is feeling a bit delicate, and rightly so.  The Senator has earned it.  I hope all of our congratulations and commendations at least go some way to help the Senator.  Well done, and fair play.</p> <p>I will start by expressing my disappointment at yesterday's decision by the Cabinet to allocate the State's two additional European constituency seats to Dublin and Ireland South.  The House will be aware there has been a longstanding request that the two additional seats would be allocated northwards.  There is no legal or constitutional impediment on the Government taking that decision.  It would stand by and affirm the Taoiseach and the Government's commitment that citizens in the North would not be left behind.</p> <p>We have all agreed on a cross-party basis that we must be steadfast, clear and coherent in ensuring that there is no diminution of rights as a result of Brexit and no undermining of the Good Friday Agreement.  This would have been an ideal way, certainly, the first opportunity in a practical and tangible way, and probably, when all is said and done, in quite a modest way, for the Government to live by that commitment.  Given that the existing seats in the State would not have been undermined, I do not see where anyone would have any political or even electoral opposition to that.  I am very disappointed.</p> <p>The Government should review this decision, particularly in the context of the clear legal advice that there is no barrier to such a decision.  Quite a number of states across the EU allocate panels and constituency seats to citizens outside of their particular jurisdiction.  There will be much disappointment.  The House will remember just a few weeks ago that over 1,000 civic leaders from within Northern nationalism wrote to the Taoiseach again and pleaded with him not to relent and to remain steadfast in defending our rights.</p> <p>The most disappointing aspect is that while these seats have been taken away from us, this vote has been taken away from us. We can all agree that the most basic entitlement of any citizen is the right to elect representation.  While that has been taken away from us by the British Government, it seems by the decision taken at Cabinet yesterday that the Government here is rubber-stamping that decision.  It is an unfortunate decision.  It is the wrong one.  Hopefully, the House may, through the Leader, have an opportunity to hear directly from the Taoiseach on the issue of Brexit and the next steps before the end of this term.</p></speech>

"Where will this woman stop?", is the question I ask.  It is a fair achievement for any politician to be able to write a book with no fiction in it.  I have read the book and it is a wonderful read.  Senator Ruane has come from very difficult circumstances to achieve so much in such a short lifetime.  As I say, what will that woman do next?  Well done, Senator Ruane.</p> <p>Finally, I would like to be associated with the remarks of Senator Lawless this morning on the prospect of additional visas for Irish emigrants.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Lawless has put a significant amount of work into this through his many contacts across the USA, along with the designated special envoy, Deputy Deasy.

On a very sad note, I join the Members of the House who offered their sympathies to the young man who was tragically killed in Castleblayney this morning.  On my own behalf and that of the Fine Gael Party in the House, I offer our sympathies to his family and pay tribute to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who demonstrated, in his act of heroism, the service members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do day in and day out.  Like Senator Gallagher, I remember him and his family in our prayers and thoughts.</p> <p>I warmly welcome Marie and Savi O'Sullivan to the House and thank them for being here.  We all remember Dinny Owen O'Sullivan and the work that he did.  In a different way Marie is continuing the great service and tradition.  They are very welcome and I thank them for being here.</p> <p>On my own behalf and on behalf of the House I warmly congratulate our colleague and friend, Senator Ruane, on her magnificent victory last night.  I would love to have heard her speech.  I congratulate her on her wonderful award.  Her book is a wonderful testament to her courage, strength, perseverance and vision.  She is an inspiration to many.  I am not sure where Senator Ned O'Sullivan wants to put her in the future, but from a political point of view I hope we can keep her off our panels or constituencies wherever we run.  I wish her every success and thank her most sincerely.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of the Barnardos report that was published yesterday.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the issue.  The Government is committed to improving services and supports for all young people, especially in the area of speech and language therapy.  On Monday I and other Members of the Oireachtas met representatives of the special needs schools in Cork.  It is important that we would have a review of the Curc report in terms of the allocation of funding and the model of special needs schools and special needs education.  Significant investment is being made by the Government.</p> <p>Sometimes Members of the House accuse me of being political but they should reflect upon the decade that we lost because of the reckless management of the country, which drove people away, cut services and curtailed development.  That is the Fianna F&aacute;il legacy and they should reflect upon that.  That is the reason this Government and the previous one are investing &euro;1.81 billion in health and personal social services.  An extra &euro;150 million will be provided next year for disability services to bring the funding to almost &euro;2 billion in total for disability services, along with increased funding of &euro;2.5 million for the provision of 100 new therapy posts.  I accept we have backlogs and difficulties, but from listening to some Members, one would imagine the Government was not spending any money on people who need it.  We will continue to invest and I will continue to advocate.  We will have a debate on the report.</p> <p>I commend Senator Lawless on his work on behalf of the undocumented Irish emigrants in the United States.  Like Senators Feighan and Gallagher, I hope that today is not another false dawn and that the work of Deputy Deasy and others on Capitol Hill, on both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democrat, will bring good news.  As Senator Lawless said, the E3 visa Bill would allow us to benefit from the lack of take-up by Australians.  I hope today's vote is a successful one.  I wish all involved every success.</p> <p>Many Senators referred to broadband.  They included Senators Conway-Walsh, Feighan, Mulherin, Lombard and Gavan.  I remind Senator Conway-Walsh that in all of the contributions the Sinn F&eacute;in Party made about broadband, never once did it offer a solution.  Sinn F&eacute;in Members go back to the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il sold Eircom, which we all agree was a mistake, but they never put forward a solution as to how we arrive at full broadband coverage.  I have always found Senator Gavan to be fair minded.</p></speech>

The desecration of the monument was a disgrace.  I agree with Senator Feighan that we should erect a memorial of some type of scale and I concur with the remarks made by both Senators this morning.</p><p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of Rebuilding Ireland and the Land Development Agency.  The Bill is going through pre-legislative scrutiny and the Minister aims to publish it by year's end.</p><p>Senators Mulherin, Byrne, Lombard and Grace O'Sullivan raised the issue of the urban regeneration and development fund totalling &euro;2 billion that was announced last Monday.  The fund will ensure that large urban towns located outside Dublin are rejuvenated.  As many as 80% of the projects and 85% of the moneys have been allocated to the regions and beyond Dublin.  The first phase of the allocations have been announced.  I understand the frustration expressed by Senator Grace O'Sullivan because I know that a number of projects in Cork were not included in the scheme.  I am heartened by the fact that a new phase will begin in February.  As Senator Lombard referenced, an announcement was made today about the rural regeneration fund, climate action fund and disruptive technologies innovation fund and is part of Ireland 2040.  I confirm that Ireland 2040 seeks to create, in a climate-friendly way, sustainable development in all parts of the country but, in particular, outside of Ireland.  Today's announcement of a climate action fund amounting to &euro;500 million will drive many projects.  I assure Senator Grace O'Sullivan that I will invite the relevant Minister to come to the House to discuss the fund.</p><p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of the University Hospital Limerick.  He will appreciate, notwithstanding my next comment, that I do not have a role in industrial relations and neither does this House.  A Commencement matter might be the way forward for him.  In terms of the points that he made, and I have made my point before, one cannot tolerate or condone bad work practices.  I am not saying that everything that he has said is as presented and I am sure that the management concerned would have a different viewpoint.  I am not familiar with the issue but there are industrial relations mechanisms within the State that should be utilised.  Again, it is important that we have the debate.</p><p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised a very important issue concerning older people.  However, she did not recognise the additional 550 care packages that have been announced by the Minister for Health and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly.  She did not recognise the extra &euro;4 million in aids and appliances that is being made available.  She also did not recognise the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, hosted a very important conference on housing for older people at Farmleigh House in Dublin last week.  I am happy to invite the Minister for Health to the House to discuss the matter. </p><p>For the benefit of Senators Grace O'Sullivan and Lombard who raised the matter of climate action, I intend to invite the Minister to come here next week to discuss climate change and I shall confirm the date.  I assure them that the Minister will come to the House to discuss climate change.</p><p>I commend Senator Ruane on her very positive initiative that occurred yesterday.  I am sorry that I could not be in the House on that occasion.  It is important that we recognise that sport brings people together and gives them an identity whether they are homeless or soccer or international rugby players.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the issue of the additional constituency seats in Europe.  I find it ironic that Sinn F&eacute;in seeks more seats when its party members will not take their seats in Westminster or go into government in the North.  He failed to recognise that the Government established an independent commission, chaired by Mr. Justice Haughton, and made a recommendation to Government.  As Senator Gavan knows, in terms of electoral boundaries for local government, D&aacute;il or Europe, the independent commission is comprised of many eminent people including the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, Clerk of the Seanad and others, to name but a few, and they sit independently to make a recommendation.  I do not believe that I have ever seen a Government reject an independent review or report, and I did not think it was going to happen yesterday.</p><p>I think I have addressed the remarks made by Senator Ned O'Sullivan and I hope I have not left anybody out.  Again, I welcome our distinguished guests to the Gallery.  I thank everybody for their warm words of acknowledgement and affirmation for Senator Ruane.  We are very proud of her and congratulations. </p></speech>

I will ask the Minister a simple, factual question.  As I understood it, a procedure was recently put in place whereby judges who were interested in promotion to vacancies which were arising or had arisen could inform either the Secretary to the Government or the Attorney General in writing of their interest in being so promoted in order that their names would be put before the Cabinet.  Is it proposed that this procedure be discontinued from now on as amounting to some kind of canvassing or will it continue under this legislation?  If it is proposed that it be discontinued, there would be certain implications arising from that.  It is an informal arrangement with no legislative basis, which seeks to address the problem of sitting judges writing long letters to politicians extolling their own virtues.  I have no problem with that.  Members of the Judiciary do not have to do a sales job on themselves to members of Government.  For this reason, the new arrangement under which they indicated to the Secretary to the Government their willingness to serve in a position which was vacant or about to become vacant was put in place.  Is this system still in existence?  If so, will it be ended if the requirement that every judge apply to the judicial appointments commission for every promotional vacancy comes into place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-11-28a.144" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1392" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018112800002#T01000"><p>The first two amendments in the group, amendments Nos. 78 and 79, narrow the criteria an applicant must satisfy to be recommended for a judicial position.  The amendments also remove references to courts higher than the High Court to accord with the subsequent amendments concerning senior judicial officers.  Amendment No. 90 is more comprehensive.  It reintroduces the Government's original section and extends the senior judicial appointments process to ordinary members of both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.  It codifies the procedure the Government has adopted in respect of recent senior court appointments and it follows that this process should continue on a statutory basis.  These proposed amendments are fundamental to safeguarding against the weakest elements of the Bill in its current form, which, as currently drafted, would involve 16 members of the judicial commission appointing the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the High Court and all ordinary members of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal.</p> <p>The process of appointment by the Government to all the aforementioned positions in the past two years or so has been to include the president of the appellate court, the Attorney General and the chair of the top level appointments committee.  This process has been used to appoint the current Chief Justice, new ordinary members of the Supreme Court, the President of the Court of Appeal and new ordinary members of the Court of Appeal.  For most litigants, the Court of Appeal will be their last opportunity to have a case heard, with only cases of exceptional importance ending up in the Supreme Court. </p> <p>The High Court, District Court and Circuit Court are bound by the decisions of their superior courts.  This includes the Court of Appeal with regard to the Supreme Court.  Decisions made by the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal are of fundamental importance to the rule of law in this State, and the officeholders of these courts bear enormous responsibility as to how the law is both interpreted and applied.  The Government in its wisdom deemed that it was appropriate at a bare minimum for the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal and the President of the High Court, all of whom are members of the Council of State, to be appointed by a separate senior judicial appointments committee.  This proposal was voted out of the Bill in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Government proposes that the Chief Justice, Attorney General and chairperson of the judicial commission recommend the appointment to these offices rather than the 16-member judicial commission, which is how the law will currently operate if enacted as the version passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If the Government accepts the principle that the appointment process for the roles of Chief Justice, President of the High Court and President of the Court of Appeal requires a more finessed consideration than the process involving a motley crew of 16 commission members where all of these officeholders are either members of the Supreme Court or <i>ex officio</i>members of the Supreme Court, it is difficult to see why it would object to ordinary members of these courts also forming part of the separate senior judicial appointments committee process.  It is essential that such a senior judicial committee not comprise a sitting member of a court, for example, the Chief Justice, having a role in appointing his or her successor or a person to serve alongside him or her on the Supreme Court.  The same consideration should apply for the Court of Appeal, where the President of the Court of Appeal should have no role in appointing his or her successor or members to serve alongside him or her.<br/><br/>It is clear, therefore, that the senior judicial committee must be broadened so that, at all times, there are existing senior judicial officeholders capable of providing an assessment of the capabilities of a particular candidate for these exceptionally high offices, allied to the Attorney General and the lay representatives, such as the chairperson of the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC.<br/><br/>Another essential component of these grouped amendments is the plainly obvious proposal that persons deemed suitable for recommendation to the High Court ought to have an appropriate knowledge of its decisions and appropriate knowledge and experience of its practices and procedures.  It would be a nonsense to appoint people who had no knowledge, practical experience or wisdom in these matters.  It is obvious that they must.  It is unfathomable how the Government could view these qualities as unnecessary components for a 16-member judicial appointments commission to consider when recommending candidates for appointment to the Judiciary.  These are the core skills that a suitable judge might possess.<br/><br/>I wish to point out my great disappointment that there are more members of the public in the Gallery than there are Senators in the Chamber during the passage of this extremely important Bill.  I would like to welcome our visitors.  They can see now the way the process goes - it is the same two or three Senators all the time on every Bill.</p></speech>

Under the Bill, the proposal is that there will be one route and that each applicant for a position will go through the appointments commission, not in the manner that obtains with the JAAB, where sitting judges do not go before it.  I acknowledge that under the new regime, the President of each court will not only be a member of the commission but will also have a very influential role in the deliberations of the committee.  What I am giving consideration to, as I said on the last occasion, is having a senior appointments commission that would deal with what Senator Norris described as exceptionally high office.  He is right because they are positions of exceptionally high office.  I have a difficulty with Senator McDowell's amendment in so far as subsection (7) is concerned.  What the Senator intends to achieve under the amendment is broader than what was mentioned previously and would go beyond what I am keen to explore.  I also understand from Senator Norris that he might regard the parameters of subsection (7) as being somewhat broader than he might envisage.</p></speech>

In the amendment Senator McDowell wishes to encompass all senior appointments or all appointments that might be regarded as senior, which would be too broad.  I want to reflect on the matter further.  I want to give it scrutiny, which is what I have been doing, and also want to take advice on it.  I am keen to frame an appropriate amendment to the legislation on Report Stage which would allow for the type of senior officials' committee that worked particularly well in the case of the recent appointments of the Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal.  It is a vehicle that could also be used in the case of the President of the High Court.  They are the three most senior positions and the three exceptionally senior positions mentioned by Senator Norris.  In its current guise, I am not prepared to accept amendment No. 90 which I regard as being the amendment within the group that carries a broader array of reforming changes than previous amendments and that carries more weight.</p></speech>

To me, there is absolutely no excuse.  Senator Bacik has just arrived in the Chamber.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For her information, I point out that the Minister has clarified that once the Bill comes into operation, it will be prohibited for a member of the Judiciary to communicate to the Government his or her willingness to accept promotion or appointment to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court and the only method of communication with the Government by a sitting judge regarding a willingness to serve in that way would be by making an application to the commission.  I believe that is manifestly unconstitutional.  The Government has not merely a right, but a duty to consider all people, particularly sitting judges, who are eligible to serve and willing to accept an appointment to one of those courts.  It is manifestly unconstitutional to set up an advisory commission, which turns into a censorship device such that the Government is prohibited from knowing that a particular judge is willing to serve on either of those courts.<br/><br/>One of the fundamentals of the Constitution is that it is an executive function of the Government to advise the President on such matters.  It is not merely a right; the Government has a duty to do so.  The Government must consider its options, but in order to do so it must be informed of what those options are.  One cannot state it will have discharged its function if the only way under this new regime that it will become aware that Mr. Justice Michael McDowell, a member of the High Court, wishes to be considered for a vacancy in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court is via Mr. Justice McDowell making an application to the appointments commission, which then decides whether the Government is made aware of that name having been put forward.  According to the Minister, the commission, including the Attorney General, will be prohibited from telling the Government that a judge applied but was not included on the shortlist.  A first year law student in King's Inns would know that is unconstitutional.  One cannot do that to the Government.  One cannot state that the only names it will be lawful for the Government to be told are the names chosen by people outside of Government, the majority of whom are not judges, although that is irrelevant, and that the choices will, therefore, necessarily be curtailed.<br/><br/>The fig leaf saving this Bill from manifest unconstitutionality on another front is that it is accepted in the Bill that the whole procedure does not prevent the Government from appointing an eligible person off its own bat.  However, that fig leaf does not apply if the legislation provides that the Government cannot know the identities of wiling candidates other than the three put forward on a shortlist.  Given the Government attitude to my amendment, I am being asked to assent to legislation which is manifestly unconstitutional.  I have no doubt on this matter.  There are occasions when lawyers query the constitutionality of various matters.  As I have stated, I do not claim infallibility on this issue.  However, this is manifestly unconstitutional if it has the meaning for which the Minister has contended.  This House should not be asked to accept legislation that, in the view of its Members, is unconstitutional.<br/><br/>It is a forlorn hope, but I would love to see a memorandum detailing the Attorney General's reasons for this being constitutional.  His opinions are never circulated and, having been Attorney General, I see good reason for that, but I would love to see the arguments as to why the provisions for which the Minister is contending comply with the Constitution.  I would love to see set out in writing why the points I am making are wrong because, to me, they are manifestly right.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope the Bill will be tested by the Supreme Court on an article 26 reference because these issues are such that on ordinary <i>locus standi </i>rights to challenge legislation, it would be difficult to work out who would challenge it.  Are we inviting a disappointed High Court judge to take a legal action pointing out that he or she was not recommended or appointed and is disappointed with the process?  Perhaps a case will be taken by an ordinary citizen who thinks that the Judiciary would be improperly composed if this legislation should come to pass and that a decision of the Court of Appeal was invalid by reason of the improper constitution of the court.  An Article 26 reference would be entirely appropriate in this case.<br/><br/>The Minister's stated that I am being overly broad in stating that ordinary positions in the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court should be comprehended by a special process.  Let us remember one fundamental fact mentioned by Senator Norris - I am glad he reminded me of it - namely, that every member of the High Court is<i></i>capable <i>ex officio</i>of functioning as a member of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal and every member of the Court of Appeal is capable <i>ex officio </i>of functioning as a member of  the Supreme Court.  That does happen.  I have been in court when judges have been, so to speak, brought up to make up numbers for particular reasons.  If that is the law as things stand and the Bill does not seek to change that, it is amazing that a judge cannot be a permanent member of the court but can be a temporary member for a particular case and be entirely suitable for that purpose by virtue of being a High Court judge without having been recommended by this external group of people.</p></speech>

It is hard to imagine how a shortlist could be composed by a group of people whereby those on the list do not merit inclusion.  When one moves on to subsection (2), one sees that when selecting and recommending persons for appointment, &quot;regard shall be had&quot; by the commission to the objective that the membership of the Judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women.  This is a criterion that the commission is obliged to consider when filling a position in the Supreme Court, for example, which is odd.  Regard should also be had to the objective that the membership of the Judiciary should, where feasible and practical, reflect the diversity within the population as a whole.  Reference is also made to the Irish language.  However, these are not the criteria by which the Government would necessarily decide to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court.  If a liberal-minded woman member of the Supreme Court was retiring, the Government might decide that it wants a liberal-minded man, whom it has identified, to sit on the Supreme Court in her place, or <i>vice versa</i>.  There has been an enormous transformation in the composition of the legal profession from the ground up and among the Judiciary, from the least senior courts up.  The number of women judges now, relative to the number of senior persons in other professions, is far healthier than in the past.  The Government is, on occasions, conscious of gender and gender balance but it is also, on occasions, conscious of other issues such as liberalism, conservatism and so on.<br/><br/>What this comes down to is that the entire purpose of this Bill is to create a situation in which the Government will effectively only know of the desire of persons who are recommended by the commission to be appointed and will be prohibited from knowing that there were other choices, other willing candidates, available to it, which is absolutely unconstitutional.

This was quite clear from the Second Stage reading and the in-depth Committee Stage debate on Part 2, to which he now refers.  It was also dealt with in the context of the discussions on sections 27 and 28.  The Senator is right about the confidentiality aspect of the Bill.  He is also right when he speaks of the need for the commission to deal with all applications.  However, he is not saying anything new, as though this has suddenly dawned on the Seanad by dint of an answer that I gave half an hour ago to Senator McDowell.  This was well known.  This is the basis of the Bill but the crucial point is that nothing in the Bill interferes with or diminishes the ultimate power of the Government to make an untrammelled recommendation following due consideration.</p></speech>

This is the logic of his position but it must be clearly understood.  If this Bill goes to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution, it must be clear what the Minister intends, in case someone suggests that this is a fanciful construction of the Bill.

There could not be anything starker as an unconstitutional proposition than that.</p><p>With the original Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, the word &quot;advisory&quot; meant what it said, in that the Government was taking advice from a body.  In this legislation the word &quot;advisory&quot; is dropped because the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, thinks that this commission is more than advisory in nature.  Perhaps it is more than advisory because under the proposed terms of the Bill, it will be the keeper at the gate as regards the information going to the Government.  The Minister says that it is clear that the power of the Government under the Constitution to appoint somebody unrecommended remains untrammelled, but it is not untrammelled if the Government, through this legislation, is deliberately kept in the dark as to its choices.  It cannot be that the Government's constitutional power still exists if it is playing blind man's buff, trying to work out what other judges might be interested in being appointed to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court.</p><p>It is not that this is a sudden revelation to me but it is now starkly before us as to where we are going and where we are being led with this legislation.  We are being asked to walk into an unconstitutional cul-de-sac<i>.  </i>The Minister should at least accept the fact that I said on many occasions that when we reached amendment No. 90, I would be proposing a different way of doing business which is designed to save this Bill from being deemed unconstitutional.  It is designed to stop members of the Judiciary having to engage in a beauty parade before the judicial appointments commission to be appointed to courts where they are <i>ex officio</i>capable of serving without any such process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is unconstitutional, in my view, to have a group of people vet the applications of judges by reference to criteria by which the Government is not bound if, at the same time, the law is that the Government cannot be informed, either directly or indirectly, of the willingness of those judges to accept office in a more senior court.  I make no apology for wanting to extend this provision to ordinary judges of the High Court because those judges can be asked by the Chief Justice to serve in the Supreme Court for a particular case.  The same applies to the Court of Appeal.  One may be brought up, sat beside these judges and asked to serve.  What business does this proposed appointments commission have in telling the Government that somebody who is capable, by virtue of the fact that he or she serves on the High Court day in, day out, of functioning on the Supreme Court, should or should not be selected to these positions?  As a group of people, all High Court judges are entitled to serve in those courts if called upon to do so.  The provision is inexplicable and it is wrong.<br/><br/>The Minister has said that he is considering bringing in some amendment in this area on Report Stage.  We know what happened.  He had a special committee in the D&aacute;il which effectively took this proposal off the table by leaving the section in place and providing that everything goes back to the judicial appointments commission.  If the Minister is merely telling us that he is a bad loser in the D&aacute;il and wants to put back in a provision the D&aacute;il rejected, that does not deal with the points this amendment deals with, which is the idea that ordinary judges of the High Court who are <i>ex officio</i>capable of functioning as judges of the Supreme Court should, notwithstanding that fact, submit themselves for scrutiny of their suitability for appointment by a body which is not the Government.  One of the problems I have with the Minister saying that he might deal with this on Report Stage and that he may take advice on this - in effect, saying that anything could happen - is that it leads to uncertainty, which is unsatisfactory.  If this goes to the heart of the Bill and the heart of the issue of its constitutionality, which I say it does, the idea that we are being told that the Minister is contemplating going some way back towards recovering the position he lost in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is not good enough.  The problem with Report Stage is, as we know, that unless the section or the amendment is recommitted to Committee Stage, we will have a process in which there are a few contributions and the whip will be imposed and the proposal will go through.  That is not satisfactory either.<br/><br/>I am not minded to be bought off with the statement that the Minister, as was said, might think about it for longer and that he might do something about it on Report Stage.  This is too serious for that.  He cannot say that he may do something about it and that he will tell us what he is thinking of doing later, but not today.  If the Minister is serious about a Report Stage amendment, he should tell us what it would be.  If he does not, I cannot see why anyone in this House would withdraw his or her objection to the Bill as it is currently drafted.</p></speech>

I do not agree with the Senator.  I do not accept at all that the issue is one of protection of the Government.  Rather, it is an issue of protecting the candidates themselves.</p> <p>I want to refer briefly to a point which Senator McDowell has raised again.  It is an important point.  It is about the architecture, which was to be a senior appointments commission.  I do not come back with this on the basis of it having been defeated in the D&aacute;il or otherwise.  I come back to this House to attract support for something which, to my mind, meets the issues of concern as raised by Senator McDowell, albeit not in the comprehensive and wide-ranging way he intends.  I invite Senator McDowell to agree with me that what was proposed in the D&aacute;il is more desirable than the current framework in the Bill, having regard to the issue of senior appointments raised by Senator Norris.  Senator McDowell wishes to have the best and worst of every world, which is his right as a Senator. However, there comes a time when I would ask Senator McDowell to agree that ultimately, if there are parts of this Bill that can be improved upon, that we should do so.  I invite Senator McDowell to agree with me on the construct of a form of senior appointments group.</p> <p>Senator McDowell makes such a play about the State losing out on the expertise and experience of current serving members and future members of the Judiciary, or about people not applying, because they cannot make direct contact with Government in order to inform it of their intentions.  In response to that I would point to the content of section 39, which states clearly that any of these members of the Judiciary will be in a position, and will be required, to submit their names to the commission for consideration.  This is the means by which the appointments procedure will be undertaken.  The fact that they will not be in a position to express an interest to a Minister or publicly should not act to their detriment because they will be encouraged to apply under section 39(1) in the same way as anybody else who wishes to have his or her name considered for appointment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-11-28a.225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018112800002#Z00900"><p>The more I hear about this the more alarming I find it.  First, let us deal with the invitation the Minister gave me, which was to indicate that his senior appointments committee would be better than what we have here.  I am very loath to do so because, if he simply brought us back to the position at which this Bill had us in the D&aacute;il, it would still be unconstitutional for the reasons I have mentioned.  I am not going to say that one unconstitutional version of this Bill is better than another unconstitutional version.  Unless the Minister deals with the constitutional issues I am raising, then both versions are equally bad in my view.  The fact that one may look prettier or be more polished than another does not save it from ultimately being judged as to whether it is constitutional or unconstitutional.</p> <p>I invite the Minister to tell me what is wrong with the present arrangement whereby the holder of a position in the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court who seeks to be considered for a more senior position is invited to intimate to the Secretary General to the Government that he or she is so willing.  What is wrong with that?  Does it somehow embarrass the Government to know who is interested in a particular appointment?  Does it produce worse results?  Does it amount to a form of canvassing which is reprehensible in some way?  Of the 40 or so High Court judges - I am not sure how many there are, it is 40 or thereabouts - if 20 would, if asked, serve in the Court of Appeal why should the Government not know that?  Why should it not know who they are?</p> <p>By the way, I am absolutely sure that some judges of the High Court would not like to be appointed to the Court of Appeal, notwithstanding the slightly larger salary that goes with the appointment, because being a member of the Court of Appeal requires great intellectual endeavour and industry in terms of written submissions, preparing written judgments and the like.  Some judges might feel that, having done ten or 15 years in the High Court and having dealt with defamation actions and this, that and the other, they frankly do not want to specialise as a points of law judge from now on.  That is a perfectly respectable point of view.  It is not to be assumed that every member of the Judiciary would like to be on the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court.  Yes, the term "promotion" can be used and it is doubtless that all of them would consider it an honour of sorts, but some might say that if they have another five or ten years to serve as a judge they might prefer to spend it on a mixture of cases rather than hearing points of law cases for the rest of their lives.  </p> <p>Likewise, it is very definitely my view that many judges might like to be on the Supreme Court but might not like to be on the Court of Appeal.  Such judges would be minded to make an application for one, but not for the other.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I can well imagine men and women on the High Court Bench saying that they would not like to be on the Court of Appeal but that they would like to be on the Supreme Court if asked by the Government.  That is a perfectly reasonable, rational frame of mind for somebody to have.  </p> <p>When the Minister asked if I would not consider that what he had in the Bill before it was amended in the D&aacute;il was better than what we have now, I am dubious about the proposition because at least the constitutional flaws in this legislation are more obvious, even though they were present in the original version of the Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If the Minister wants to reverse the decision taken in the D&aacute;il on the presidencies of the Court of Appeal, the High Court and the Supreme Court, why did he not put down an amendment on Committee Stage in this House so that we could discuss it in the proper way?  Why is he holding back until Report Stage to come forward with his proposals?  I do not see why that should be.</p><p>To have a special procedure for the presidency of the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court suggests in some sense that those positions are of much greater importance than the ordinary membership of those courts.  For example, in many respects the Chief Justice is the titular head of the Judiciary.  One Chief Justice does not outvote two ordinary members of the Supreme Court, however, and it is not as if they are qualitatively different or have greater clout by virtue of being on one side of an argument rather than another in a collegiate decision.  I do not accept the proposition that we should provide a wholly different mechanism for somebody to be appointed an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court from the mechanism we provide for the appointment of somebody to be Chief Justice.</p><p>I have a postscript, if one likes, to these remarks.  I am not as convinced, as many judges are, that they are in the best position to tender much advice on these matters.  I shy away from the idea of a self-perpetuating, self-appointing or self-recommending Judiciary.  The Government is the body that makes the decision-----</p></speech>

We only have to look to America.  It was not the appointment of a chief justice that caused President Trump to get into such a state of high excitement but rather the appointment of an ordinary member because he was affecting the complexion or balance within the court.  This distinction between the presidencies and the ordinary membership of the various courts is of doubtful value.  The amendment we have tabled seeks to look at the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court ordinary memberships and presidencies in an equally serious light and protect the Government's rights in the process.</p> <p>The Government is always free to look for advice, have advice or set up procedures to advise it on such appointments, and I have no problem with that.  I object when the so-called advisory body is portrayed, as it has been by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, as a means whereby politicians would no longer have a say in making judicial appointments.  That is manifestly false.  It is unconstitutional and wrong.  Elected politicians who are part of the Government have, as I said, the right and duty to make appointments of judges to the best of their judgment.  They can take advice from other people as to the qualities of potential candidates but it is their judgment, for which they are responsible and for which the Constitution holds them accountable and gives them discretion in advising the President.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-11-28a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1402" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018112800002#AA00400"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and take his point about the senior level judicial appointments committee.  He has indicated his willingness to take on board some of the points that have been raised about that matter in the context of this debate.  I will briefly address the point raised by Senator McDowell and which will be dealt with by amendment No. 90, which is currently under discussion.  He proposed a new subsection (8) to a new section 44, which shall require the committee to make a report to the Government, including the names of persons who have expressed an interest in appointment to judicial office, as well as the names of the persons whom the committee recommends.  I still do not see why there is a difficulty with requiring the committee to provide what Senator Norris has described as a "longlist" of candidates to the Government.  Following the debate, I cannot see where the problem lies in giving the Government that list of names.</p> <p>Like Senator McDowell, I am against the idea of a self-appointing or self-perpetuating judicial appointments process, where judges simply appoint people in their own mould.  I have already spoken of the dangers of affinity bias and so on and I will not repeat all that.  I do not see where the difficulty lies in having the committee supply the longlist to the Government.  In keeping with Cabinet confidentiality, that would not be published anywhere else.  It would be outrageous if it were to be published anywhere else.  That is not the proposal, which is simply to make a report of those names to the Government.  I will not labour the point but I still do not see where the difficulty lies in making that provision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-11-28a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1392" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018112800002#AA00500"><p>The Minister was rather disingenuous in his response to the subsection (7) element of Senator McDowell's amendment No. 90, which indicates that the committee shall "inform all members of the Superior Courts of the vacancy and invite any such member to express an interest in being appointed to the judicial office mentioned in subsection (2)".  The Minister's response was to point to section 39(1), which states, "Subject to subsection (2), a person, including a person who is for the time being a serving judge or a relevant office holder, who wishes to be considered for appointment to judicial office shall make an application to the Commission in that behalf (specifying the judicial office concerned); that application shall be in writing or in such other format as may be specified in the selection procedure."  That does not answer Senator McDowell's amendment.  The Minister is firmly placing responsibility back on the shoulders of the applicant, whereas Senator McDowell's amendment has a requirement to let the members of the superior courts know a vacancy is to be filled.</p> <p>I imagine that the overwhelming majority of members of the superior courts would probably have a bloody good idea if there was a gap in the Judiciary.  They would know this almost instinctively because there would be gossip around the robing chambers and all that kind of stuff.  Is the Minister suggesting judges should be grateful for not having been actively barred from seeking appointment, or promotion as I would call it?</p> <p>I am glad to see the Government side has been replenished by somebody who probably does not want to be here but there was a period of five minutes when no Government Member was present.</p></speech>
