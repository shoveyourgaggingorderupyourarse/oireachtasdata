It is a tremendous organisation.  In the most recent year, it has supported over 400 families across Donegal.  Most of those families are self-referred by word-of-mouth.  It is a safe space for parents who are struggling and parents who are separated but still have responsibilities to be parents to their children.  A range of professionals, including judges, teachers, social workers, counsellors and healthcare professionals, refer people to this service.  I know the Minister is passionate about this kind of community-led approach.  That is why I appeal to her today.  I appreciate that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has corresponded with my colleague, Councillor Albert Doherty, and it has made it clear that it has tried to increase the supports within limited resources.  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, tried its best to support ParentStop, but what is missing here is a multi-agency or a cross-departmental approach.  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures is the framework to do this.</p> <p>The board of ParentStop has put together a really powerful statement with testimonies from families who have used the service.  It is hugely respected across the spectrum in Donegal.  It is passionate, but unfortunately it has had to put its team of workers on protective notice every year because of insecure funding from different sources.  It is never multi-annual or guaranteed for a defined period.  ParentStop is always vulnerable and always under threat.  These are really passionate and committed people, but they cannot be financially reckless.  This is a charity and it has responsibilities.</p> <p>I understand the Minister has made a commitment but I urge her to meet with the board of ParentStop.  She will be hugely impressed by them as they are her kind of people in terms of being community-led, empowering communities, professional and diligent.  I also call for a cross-departmental approach.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In fairness, the Ministers for Justice and Equality, Education and Skills, and Health, together with senior officials in those Departments, could work with the Minister's officials to share the financial burden.  A proposal has been submitted by the board of ParentStop, which refers to a pilot project in Donegal, based on the learning of ParentStop, which will hopefully result in the continuation of the work of this organisation on a three-year, multi-agency, cross-departmental basis.  This has been submitted to the Minister for Education and Skills.  This is a tremendous initiative, which has been in place for almost 13 years now.  Some 400 families have been supported this year and I have heard nothing but good reports back.  It is a very private, safe and healing place for families to be good parents and to look after their children.  I appeal to the Minister to meet the board of ParentStop and try to work towards a solution on a cross-departmental basis to try and get this organisation back on the road again.</p></speech>

ParentStop is one of many voluntary and community organisations across the country, funded by Tusla and other State agencies, which provide valuable supports to parents and children.  Over the past 15 years, as the Senator outlined, ParentStop has supported families in Donegal in a complex range of situations and across the continuum of care. </p> <p>Services offered by the organisation include one-to-one sessions for families with complex needs, intensive supports for children and brief intervention supports for children and families.  ParentStop has assisted families dealing with range of issues, including separation, addiction, financial worries, online safety, obesity, mental health concerns, bullying, stress, and peer pressure.  The contribution of ParentStop to supporting parents and their children in Donegal over the past 15 years has been immense.  Thousands of families have benefitted from the services provided by the organisation and the growth in the number of families availing of its services over the past number of years reflects how much its services are valued by families themselves and people working closely with children and families in Donegal.</p> <p>As one of ParentStop's core funders, Tusla has been aware of the organisation's financial difficulties, particularly those arising from the decision of the northwest regional drug and alcohol task force to withdraw funding in 2018.  Under Part 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla funds a range of organisations that provide services to vulnerable children and families, including those providing parenting supports.  Tusla must assign its resources to the areas which it perceives to be in greatest need, ensuring the best outcomes for children and families.  The agency seeks to fund those services in the most beneficial, effective, efficient, proportionate and sustainable manner to improve the outcomes for vulnerable children and their families.  Recognising the value of the supports provided by ParentStop to parents and families in Donegal, Tusla has taken a number of steps in recent years to assist the organisation reach a sustainable financial position.  Between 2016 and 2019, annual funding provided by Tusla to ParentStop increased from &euro;31,000 to &euro;68,625.  In 2018, Tusla provided an additional &euro;7,000 to ParentStop to address its recurring annual deficit.  The agency provided a further exceptional annual increase of &euro;24,000 to ParentStop in 2018 following withdrawal of funding by the northwest regional drug and alcohol task force.  In 2019, the agency provided further once-off funding of &euro;18,640 to assist the organisation to invest time and resources to develop a sustainable funding model.</p> <p>Unfortunately, despite the support in recent years, ParentStop has decided that it cannot continue to operate within the funding allocations available from its core funders.  Tusla and the HSE have been working together in recent weeks to develop a joint proposal for the continuation of the organisation in Donegal.  This includes a commitment by all parties Tusla, HSE primary care and HSE health promotion and improvement that funding for ParentStop would be maintained at the existing level for 2020, together with a review of services with a view to developing a strategic plan for the organisation's future, and an exploration of potential additional funding streams.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Katherine Zappone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Tusla will continue this engagement with the HSE to see if the closure of ParentStop can be prevented.  I will also be meeting Tusla and ParentStop later this month to discuss the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-11-05a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1400" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019110500002#D00200"><p>I welcome the confirmation that the Minister is working with the HSE to find a funding solution and that she is going to meet the board of ParentStop later this month.  I acknowledge that Tusla and the Department have tried their best to sustain the services but I feel other agencies and Departments have failed ParentStop.</p> <p>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures is a very good framework.  ParentStop is an example where, clearly, its responsibilities in working with over 400 families across Donegal, from one end of the county to the other, are cross-departmental and cover all spectrums, particularly in regard to education, health and the Minister's own area of responsibility, namely, children and youth affairs.  The problem has been that other agencies and Departments have not stepped up, despite the forbearance of the Minister, the Department and Tusla, and they have not matched the funding.  My concern is that the Minister's statement refers to maintaining the existing level of funding which, at &euro;68,000, would not be enough for this organisation in 2020.  I have corresponded with the HSE in Donegal and asked whether it can put some money on the table to make it sustainable in 2020.  Does the Minister agree we need more money from the HSE on the table, with the funding from the Department, to give ParentStop a budget it can work with and then, hopefully, build the service?</p> <p>It would be unimaginable to lose this service.  We are talking about hundreds of families and about the social fabric of society.  These families have given testimonies that they are in a very bad place and, through the help and support provided, these adults and, more importantly, these children are getting the environments they need, which is better for all of society.  This is one we have to win.  I appreciate the statement, which is positive and encouraging, but I would like to see more on the table from the HSE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-11-05a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019110500002#D00300"><p>I thank the Senator.  I know a little about the centre and I answered a question on this in the D&aacute;il recently.  As I said in my statement, I have been very impressed by its work and that has been represented, at least initially, by the stepping up to the plate, not only in terms of what Tusla has contributed over the last couple of years, but also the willingness to bring together the HSE and the different forums that are currently ongoing.  That is certainly a demonstration of our desire to ensure ParentStop sustains itself.  I understand how important this is, I really do, and the Senator speaks eloquently about what it has done for the community, the children and the families.</p> <p>The second point is that what is going on now is the putting together of plans for a sustainable funding model.  As the Senator would appreciate, every community and voluntary organisation is responsible to do that for itself.  However, because of the work ParentStop has done and the particular issues it is faced with now, Tusla and the HSE are stepping in to try to support it, and they are very happy to do so.</p> <p>I have spoken with the Minister, Deputy McHugh, in regard to the pilot project which the Deputy referenced.  I do not know what the figures are and I would have to check before I commit, but I will certainly go to the HSE on this matter.  However, we are aware of the challenge that is facing the organisation and the great contribution it has made.  We are in planning mode.  I look forward to meeting the representatives of ParentStop towards the end of the month.  I hope that, ultimately, this will put them on the sustainable path that it sounds as if they deserve.</p></speech>

There was a flood and then a fire that affected more than 30 independent traders in Douglas Village Shopping Centre.</p></speech>

Engagement with the insurance companies has been complex and requires a solution from the point of view that not all of them have paid out.  As the Minister of State knows quite well, the majority of the people have coverage to protect them from unexpected events.  This fire was an unexpected event.  To say the least, there has been obfuscation, foot dragging and a less than complete outcome in terms of payment to the traders.  It has been piecemeal and laborious.  This is a very complex matter because the shopping centre owner is dealing with his issues and the individual traders are dealing with theirs.  There is also the issue of the insurance companies telling the traders many different things.  The important point is there is a need for the insurance companies to pay out to the individual traders under the business interruption charge so if a business is closed for a period of time a mechanism is available.  Cork City Council has waived the fees and rates for those businesses that have shut down.  The business interruption charge is about the traders being able to have that money paid out to them through their insurance.</p><p>Something that has been very vexing for the traders is that the insurance companies are telling them to go to the owner of the shopping centre to get a letter of comfort stating it will open on, for example, 1 July 2020, which is just a date I have picked.  As we all know, the owner of the shopping centre cannot give an exact date because there is a myriad issues.  It is just in the past week and a half that we have seen the last remaining cars removed from the roof.  This has been kicked down the road.  There is a sense that everyone is waiting for someone else to make the first move.  I hope that through his good offices the Minister of State will be able to call in the insurance industry to ask it to ensure these traders, who were vulnerable before the fire and are even more vulnerable now, are able to find a solution to their issue.  In fairness, some of them received an initial downpayment of 10%, 8% or 15% but payments need to be made and we need to give certainty to the traders.</p></speech>

I extend my sympathy to all those affected by the fire and the fact the shopping centre remains closed.  However, it is a relief that nobody was injured during the fire.  Of course, it is less than ideal to have a shopping centre such as Douglas Village Shopping Centre closed for an indefinite period of time, particularly for businesses and employees coming up to the Christmas season.</p><p>I understand there are a number of issues relevant to the centre remaining closed, including establishing the cause of the fire, the structural soundness of the building itself and other matters.  While there are active insurance claims involved, it is clear there are other issues that may need to be resolved.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Senator will appreciate that the Minister for Finance and I are not responsible for issues arising in individual cases.

This important issue involves several Departments, but it should most be heard by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which I hope will resolve it using joined-up thinking.</p> <p>In my county of Carlow, a number of services provide day and residential supports for those living with disabilities.  Many offer supports to people in local authority or private homes who need day services.  All of those using day services in some way qualify for free travel, but they cannot access it.  If they lived in Dublin, Galway, Cork or Limerick there would be no problem.  In rural Carlow, however, they fall victim to the postcode disadvantage.  The free travel scheme, which was introduced by the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, in 1967, has been a lifeline for many in urban areas but is increasingly not of benefit to those in rural Ireland who must travel just to avail of it, meaning it is not free at all.  There is no public transport link around County Carlow.  There are public bus and train services to major cities, but there is nothing internal.  A new public scheme has not even been put out to tender yet, and it may well be 2021 before there is any movement in that regard.</p> <p>In the meantime, and due to the limited amount of residential places available, individuals are being allocated local authority homes via social housing agencies in partnership with service providers and the HSE on the understanding that they can receive day care services.  Despite this, no provision has been made to get them to those services.  Many living in their own homes or supported living residential settings require support to travel to the services on a daily basis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->All of the main organisations in the Carlow area delivering day services provide limited transport to families from within existing resources, which is an ongoing struggle for them and all agree it is not sustainable and fails to meet the needs of all of the individuals who require transport support.  While these providers sometimes receive partial funding from the HSE, it is not enough and they have to stretch budgets elsewhere in to provide dignity and services to these very vulnerable people.</p><p>All of the service providers in the Carlow area that offer services to people with disabilities strive to do so in line with the national policy, New Directions so that a standardised, person-centred, quality approach to service provision to individuals with disabilities can be delivered throughout the county.  Access to transport to day services is an ongoing challenge for service users, parents and service providers and is far from a standardised and appropriate response to individual needs. </p><p>In the absence of a national policy to support individuals to travel to their chosen day service, we have an inadequate and unfair system in terms of how people are supported to travel to their respective day services throughout the country.  A clear direction nationally regarding how people with disabilities can be supported to access services, particularly in rural areas, is required and a mechanism to fund such a policy needs to be agreed and implemented as soon as possible.  This is vital to those with disabilities.  A future policy decision could consider the option of a service that is providing transport to an individual entitled to free travel being able to reclaim that cost from the appropriate Department.  People on the Aran Islands and Tory Island can use their free travel pass, yet people living on the hills of Carlow cannot.  </p><p>This Government refuses to replace the mobility allowance, a payment previously made to people with severe disabilities in respect of public transport costs for taxis and so on to enable them to get around for social and health reasons.  A memorandum on proposals for a new transport support scheme was brought to Cabinet but was later withdrawn in favour of revised proposals.  I was disappointed to hear this.  I would like to know what is happening in this regard and what the Department is doing to ensure those people who need to access transport to a therapy service can get that access.  These people have free travel passes issued by the Department.  This is incredibly unfair.  It is unfair of this Government to expect service providers to lose out in respect of service provision that is essential to persons living with a disability.  Many of our local stations are not wheelchair accessible and they have no toilet facilities.  When will people living with disabilities be treated with the respect they need and deserve?</p><p>I acknowledge that this is a matter for the HSE and the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Someone somewhere in they system needs to examine it with a view to identifying what can be done to get these people the service to which they are entitled.  The ethos of these service providers is equality, dignity, privacy, safety and respect for their service users.  We need to find a way to support them in whatever way we can so that users can enjoy the opportunity to be the very best.</p></speech>

There are currently 952,000 customers in the scheme, with an annual allocation of &euro;95 million.  The scheme permits travel for free on most CI&Eacute; and public transport services, the Luas and some 80 private operators.  Free travel is also available on cross-Border journeys and within Northern Ireland if the person is aged over 66.</p> <p>As rightly stated by the Senator, the scheme was introduced to promote social inclusion and to prevent isolation of our elderly and disabled people by taking advantage of the free space on public transport services.  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary social protection payments such as disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer's allowance, blind pension and partial capacity benefit.  In 1997, the scheme was extended to all registered blind people, regardless of whether they qualified for the blind person's pension or any other social protection payment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Blind people remain one of the few cohorts of people under the age of 66 who can qualify for a free travel pass while not in receipt of a qualifying social protection payment.  The free travel scheme was never intended as a targeted support for people with severe mobility issues.  The provision of transport services in rural areas is a matter for the National Transport Authority, which operates under the aegis of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The rural transport programme, which operates under the brand name Local Link, provides a nationwide bus service in rural areas around Ireland.  The aim of Local Link, which is managed out of 15 local offices, is to address rural social exclusion and, where possible, to integrate bus services with Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann networks.  The Department provides &euro;1.5 million in funding towards the rural transport programme to enable the development of better links between local rural transport and scheduled bus and rail services.  I am pleased to note that efforts to enhance the provision of this service are continuing.  I note that Local Link has introduced a number of new and expanded services during 2019, including services in Cork, Tipperary and Laois.  In budget 2018, a further provision of &euro;10 million was made to the free travel scheme to help more private commercial operators to join the free travel scheme for the first time, to enable existing participants to add more routes and to facilitate operators in returning to the scheme where they had previously withdrawn.</p><p>The Senator should note that under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection may separately award a travel supplement if this is warranted by the circumstances of the case.  This supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the particular circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and resources of the person concerned.  I can bring the valid point the Senator has raised about specific issues relating to Carlow to the attention of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Transport is an important part of the national disability inclusion strategy, which I chair.  If places like Carlow are not getting an adequate service, and if Senators from other counties feel that people with disabilities are similarly excluded, this is something that I will personally drive.</p></speech>

It is important to ensure all Departments work together.  In this case, the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Employment Affairs and Social Protection must work with the HSE and the Department of Health.  The Senator also mentioned the transport support Bill.  I have two drafts of two Bills on the issue of transport for people with disabilities.

He will be familiar with the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, with which he and his Department work closely.  It has raised the issue of capacity to expand and develop the wool industry.  Sheep wool is natural, renewable and biodegradable and has many uses.  There is a strong case for its usage in the greening and insulation of houses and, in particular, industrial properties, etc., to be examined.  As a material, it has enormous potential.  Work is ongoing on how we can expand the use and demand for wool, particularly Irish wool.  There are opportunities to develop the wool industry that need to be explored.</p> <p>The national sheep chairman of the ICSA, Mr. John Brooks, contacted me and provided me with various press releases and statements he has issued seeking the establishment of a dedicated Irish wool forum.  He sees such a forum as of particular importance in addressing some of the issues relating to the wool industry and makes a strong case for its establishment.  The Minister will point out that there have been many groups, subgroups and subdivisions of subgroups in the agriculture industry, but this is a particular market and should be given favourable consideration.  All indications point to an impending total price collapse for wool.  The market in Britain has totally collapsed.  We want to encourage the shearing of sheep.  In terms of animal welfare and husbandry, it is unacceptable for them not to be sheared.  There is a requirement for sheep in the meat industry, but there is also a market for wool.  Irish wool is a particularly good product.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the establishment of such a forum, to include representation of interested groups, particularly the ICSA.  Wool is an abundant natural resource, which is renewable and biodegradable.  It has many benefits.  Traditionally, we have had a wonderful industry engaged in the manufacturing of wool and wool-related cloth.  There is scope to develop it.  It needs a new focus and, as such, I am asking, as Mr. Brooks requested, that the Minister and his Department give serious consideration to the establishment of this forum or explore other options for the protection and, more important, the expansion of this industry.</p></speech>

I apologise to the House for being late.  I was engaged on the Order of Business in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>Wool production is an important component of the Irish agri-industry.  There are approximately 45,500 sheep flock-keepers registered on my Department's database.  The 2018 census returns indicate that a total of 3.73 million sheep were kept in the country at the end of December 2018, representing a decrease of 142,000 or 4% on the total number recorded in December 2017.  Approximately 2.99 million sheep were slaughtered in 2018.  On producing wool for sale, in general, the farmer outsources the shearing of the sheep and sells the wool to agents.  Officials of my Department oversee and inspect 50 approved and registered wool stores where wool is held while awaiting sale.</p> <p>Ireland produces excellent quality wool.  The factors contributing to this include Irish genetic breeding standards, sheep welfare standards and the availability of quality Irish grass, water and nutritional supplementation on sheep farms.  Irish sheep have a high animal health status, being free from sheep exotic diseases, including sheep pox, that, when present, downgrade wool quality.  In addition, Irish sheep farms adhere to high biosecurity and quality assurance standards.  The animal husbandry on sheep farms ensures that programmes are in place to control ectoparasites such as sheep scab that can downgrade wool quality if not controlled.  All of these factors contribute to the excellent quality of Irish wool.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Creed:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=259"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=259&amp;amp;pid=MichaelCreed&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In addition, while national policies such as the clean livestock policy and the Bord Bia assurance scheme for lamb focus on food policy, they impact directly on the quality and cleanliness of the wool.  The cleanliness of a fleece is related to farming practices where the sheep originates, as well as being influenced by the stakeholders along the supply chain.  All stakeholders can influence the cleanliness of the sheep fleece.</p><p>In an industry such as the wool industry, where prices tend to move in cycles, it is imperative the industry players ensure and promote a diversity of options for the product in the marketplace.  Wool is used in fabrics, carpeting, bedding and insulation.  It can also be used in gardening and makes an excellent compost.  Another possibility for the use of wool is wool pellet production, which is an excellent organic fertiliser.  The current market uncertainties should provide an impetus for the industry players to come together to see what business opportunities are out there and to try to promote the excellent product in as many markets as possible.  Based on my contacts with the industry, I am aware of huge possibilities in developing the Japanese wool trade market and to that end, I provided the wool industry with a letter of support for its Japanese contacts confirming the excellent quality of Irish-produced wool.  Market forces and market demand, as the Senator is aware, dictate price and while I understand there are issues with price at the moment, I wish to inform the Senator that at present I am not considering the establishment of a dedicated Irish wool forum as requested by him.  However, my officials and I will of course consider any proposal the industry wishes to submit in this regard. </p></speech>

He was honest and frank and I always like to hear that from a Minister.  He tells it as it is and I acknowledge that.  It is encouraging that the Minister has shared with us the possibility for developing the Japanese wool trade market.  That is something I never knew that I have learned today so I will take that away with me.  I note the Minister is not prepared at this stage to consider the establishment of a wool producers' forum, and he has set out the rationale and reasons for same, which I accept.  I will convey that message to the ICSA in following up on this.  I also note the Minister has said he will keep the door open and he will consider other proposals from the industry if they are forthcoming.  I thank the Minister for that.</p></speech>

It is an extraordinary resource and it is regrettable, given the way markets have evolved, that a product of this quality, which is a natural fabric, has been displaced in many of its traditional markets over many years.  We were probably all reared in households where there was always a ball of wool over the mantlepiece.  That day is long gone.  Synthetic fibres have displaced a lot of the traditional uses of wool.  There are niche markets there, which we can support, and there is some activity in that area.  I engaged with some people from Japan in my Department who are interested, in conjunction with Irish partners, in developing that market as an opportunity.  It is a sign of the rapidly changing times that traditional uses are being displaced and we need to look at the other uses.  As I outlined today, some of those uses may not be mainstream, such as pelleting for organic fertiliser and insulation.  We have a huge job of work to do in this country to retrofit buildings for climate change purposes.  Here is a natural product that could assist with that.  There are opportunities.  It is a question of the players working collaboratively to find out what the best market returns are, because sheep farming is a low-margin enterprise, and for many, shearing is a cost with little gain from the product shorn.  It behoves all of us to work collaboratively to try to find new opportunities for that product.</p></speech>

He was a real trailblazer not alone in his distinguished broadcasting career but in the massive influence he had on wider society, giving people permission, as it were, to discuss topics that would not generally have been discussed at that time.

In 2018, we were told in the budget introduced at that time that an affordable housing scheme would be established but it is fair to say no such scheme has worked effectively.  We have not seen many fruits from that scheme and we have seen an increase in the number of people accessing emergency homeless accommodation.  There are more than 10,400 on the list for such accommodation, comprising more than 6,500 adults and 3,800 children.  That list does not include those we call the hidden homeless who are not accessing emergency hotel accommodation but living with grandmothers or parents.  Many people are living at home, cannot afford rent and are not on the emergency accommodation lists.  Members may have seen the Focus Ireland advertisement and for those who are accessing emergency accommodation, especially children, what is portrayed in that advertisement is a real scenario in that children are living in hotel rooms in which one could not swing a cat and in which the parents cannot cook.  Parents are trying to give their children a proper childhood but it is impossible in such accommodation.  There will be major repercussions for those children, and society, down the road if we do not ensure this homelessness crisis is resolved in some way.  It is a disaster for those families, especially coming up to Christmas.  It is very upsetting for them and for all of us.  We have let them down.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like to see a lot more done.

Gay Byrne was a broadcasting legend, a husband, a father and a grandfather.  He was an extraordinary communicator across our entire country, and beyond, for 60 years.  He woke us all up and he protected us as he did it, and his talent was immeasurable.  He was a cultural and social barometer of an Ireland about to grow up across those years and face all of its responsibilities both past and present.  In the history of the State, through the national broadcaster, RT&Eacute;, he totally embodied what all great public service broadcasting aspires to, namely, entertainment, information and education across radio and television.  Most of us through our lives, if we are paying any kind of attention, can learn and are capable of learning through osmosis.  We watch and we listen.  It is how I learned from great teachers who never knew I was doing it; from great artists, great poets, great thinkers and great elders.  I learned by osmosis from those that I admired from afar when I was young.  Anybody who had any interest in the art, skill and craft of communication knew to look in the direction of Gay Byrne.  There, one would find a master.  When I became a friend in later life, that admiration only deepened and grew.  Gay Byrne's talents were enormous but he wore them very lightly and he spent most of his life creating platforms daily for all others to be great and good.</p><p>Who are the people who have changed and altered Ireland for the better?  People might name politicians from all sides, and they would be right.  Indeed, they might even name religious leaders, doctors, teachers and artists.  I name Gay Byrne, without argument or opposition.  We owe him so much.  He broke our silences and he taught us to speak out and speak up and not be afraid of what we were capable of and indeed what we needed and had to face.</p><p>In some way, there is a voice and nothing more.  Beckett believed that.  Through his voice we heard meaning.  We heard meaning because his voice always paralleled meaning.  His voice bore meaning.  His voice found meaning - ordinary meanings and extraordinary meanings, complexities and distinctiveness, a kind of kernel of our social bonds, both intimate and objective, but all the time his voice always made acoustic sense.  Across generations we inhabited the universe of his voice.  We made our way through our daily lives with his voice.  He introduced us to other voices, other music, other meanings, other media and we became intermingled with the lot, first on radio and then on television where voice is still dominant.  Progress over 50 years in Ireland in some way announced itself through his voice and his show.  In some way, Gay Byrne's voice was a sign of Ireland's life and, as such, compelling.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2390"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have lost a compelling voice away from the maddening crowd.  It is now time to carry its echo with us.<br/><br/>After the death of Seamus Heaney, I quoted his play &quot;The Cure at Troy&quot;, a dramatisation of Sophocles's &quot;Philoctetes&quot;.  Seamus Heaney was a favourite poet of Gay Byrne's wife, Kathleen Watkins.  I wish to quote lines spoken by the chorus of elders at the close of the play.  I would consider myself, after many years here, an elder of the Seanad.  I am very happy to say that because I have learned so much here.  I have listened well and I have learned from other great Senators here by osmosis.  I will end with the words of the chorus of elders, Seamus Heaney's words:</p><blockquote>Now it's high watermark <br /><br />And floodtide in the heart <br /><br />And time to go. <br /><br />The sea-nymphs in the spray <br /><br />Will be the chorus now. <br /><br />What's left to say? <br /><br />Suspect too much sweet talk <br /><br />But never close your mind.<br /><br />It was a fortunate wind<br /><br />that blew me here.  I leave<br /><br />half-ready to believe<br /><br />That a crippled trust might walk<br /><br />And the half-true rhyme is love.</blockquote><p>I say that of Gay Byrne.

Many tributes have been paid to Gay over the past 24 hours.  His easy manner and unique tone of voice will long be remembered throughout the households of this State.  For me, coming from County Mayo, one of the moments of note captured over the past 24 hours was his famous interview that led to Mr. Tom Gilmartin speaking out.  Mr. Gilmartin was the man who brought down a Taoiseach and exposed the greed and corruption in this country.  Gay Byrne and his easy style of interviewing brought that to the fore.</p></speech>

I have only just met her but I can tell instinctively that she will be a great Senator, like her predecessor from the Green Party.</p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of privatisation, which seems to be a madness spreading all over this country.  The bin services were privatised, which was an absolutely lunatic idea.  We are now paying about three times and in three separate ways for the collection of bins.  Half a dozen different bin companies are charging up and down the streets of residential areas at all hours of the day and night.  In the old days, they used to pick up the rubbish.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Nowadays they do not.

Within minutes, the seagulls had got at them and spread the rubbish all over the street.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  For the entire weekend, the street was filled with rubbish, knee deep.  It is a disgrace.  The Government should lean on local authorities and say it is time they got their act together and forgot the idea of privatisation.  As I have noted previously, such companies are not registered in Ireland for tax purposes and, therefore, we do not know anything about their profits.

I also join wholeheartedly in welcoming Senator Hackett to the Chamber and her family to the Public Gallery.  I was happy and proud to be one of those who nominated the Senator to her role, and we look forward very much to working with her.  Following discussion with members of the Civil Engagement group, she has decided that, even though she represents what is perhaps a different mandate as a member of the Green Party, she is also interested in the work we do in our civil society mandate.  We look forward to working alongside her in many interesting debates and to any new perspectives she will bring to the general work we all do together in the House.</p> <p>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, will tomorrow lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report based on work done in the Chamber, namely, an amendment of mine in respect of open and semi-open adoption in Ireland.  It was an attempt to move past the closed and secretive system of adoption that has obtained for many decades, in many cases with devastating consequences for families and individuals.  I am delighted that the amendment I tabled two years ago, requiring a review of the possibilities and potential for open adoption, has come to fruition and that tomorrow we will be given a copy of the report on open and semi-open adoption.  Crucially, post-adoption supports and post-adoption contact plans will allow children to have the widest range of appropriate and helpful relationships as they shape their lives.  I ask the Leader that when the report is laid before the House, we might have the opportunity to debate it as part of a move away from a climate of secrecy to a new, transparent and caring model for adoption.</p> <p>A debate on the use of the money message mechanism is due to take place in the other House this week.  It is relevant to us not in respect of our Standing Orders and operations but because many good Bills from many Senators have passed with full debate in the Chamber and are before the other House, awaiting a final hearing at a later stage.  I hope we can find a resolution to the issue.  Good ideas can come from anywhere and we need to ensure that any of them, whether they come from an Opposition or Government bench, will have the opportunity to reach its full development.

I have spoken with quite a number of staff members and service users of the Cuisle respite centre over the past number of days since news broke last Friday that it is to close on 29 November this year.  This decision was made by the board of the Irish Wheelchair Association.  It is really devastating and dreadful news for the service users, the 48 staff who are employed there and the local community in Donamon.  The Cuisle centre is incredibly important for people with disabilities as it allows them to enjoy accessible holidays.  It is a national centre and attracts people from all over Ireland and abroad.</p> <p>I have spoken with the director of services at the Irish Wheelchair Association about the reasons for this decision and am advised that there is a need to complete electrical works at the centre which will cost well over &euro;1 million.  I am also advised that costings were sent to the HSE, although we do not have the exact details of the business plan that was sent to the HSE.  I am also advised that a different model of care is in the process of being implemented which would involve moving away from congregated settings to more integrated holiday services within private hotels.</p> <p>I want to clearly make the following point.  I worked in the health service as an occupational therapist for eight years.  I am very aware of the needs of many individuals with disabilities and the specialist equipment, facilities and carer support they require.  I am extremely concerned that such a service cannot be provided elsewhere.</p> <p>I have listened to many people who use that service, all of whom spoke positively about the fact that they are able to enjoy a holiday within a supportive environment.  I have contacted the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, Deputy Finian McGrath, in order to explore all the options available to keep this important respite centre open.  There will be a meeting with the Minister of State at 2.30 p.m. tomorrow but it is important that this issue is raised in the Seanad because this is a national respite centre and we need to support people with disabilities to live at home for the longest time possible but also to be able to enjoy holidays within a supportive environment.</p></speech>

Last Friday, the regional manager, Tony Cunningham, called a meeting at 4 p.m. and informed the staff of Cuisle, the national holiday and respite centre of the Irish Wheelchair Association that the facilities at Donamon, Roscommon, were closing on 29 November with the loss of at least 45 jobs and the removal of a service for wheelchair users, their families and supporters, that has been there for the past 22 years.  The centre is on the grounds of the Donamon Castle which is in the ownership of the Divine Word Missionaries who have been there since 1939.  The lease of which expires in 2026.

I hope she enjoys her time here.  She is with a good group in the Chamber.  She should have spoken to us first as we would have offered better terms and conditions, but such is life.</p><p>Over the weekend, the <i>Sunday World</i>published an article about the repatriation of Lisa Smith and her daughter to this country, and the fact that the Irish Army Ranger Wing was involved.  I am asking the Leader of the House to make a statement on this today.  The release of this information during an operation, which is not yet over, was, to say the very least, poorly thought out.  I am aware that the Defence Forces management is somewhat concerned about the fact that members of the Army Ranger Wing are out there at the moment, doing whatever they do, to bring this lady home.  </p><p>Ms Smith will be brought home and the child who is allegedly hers will be brought with her as well.  We are unsure about this because we have had no insight into what testing has taken place to establish the child's true identity.  We also have a situation where the child could claim three nationalities, namely, Syrian, UK or Irish.  At the end of the day, this places us in a rather precarious position.  When Ms Smith returns to this country she will be a subject of interest for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is something that must concern every citizen.  There is valuable information to be got on how she became radicalised and finished up where she did.  I am not going to prejudge what she may or may not have been involved in as that is a matter for An Garda when she comes home.  The Government, however, must get to the bottom of who released this information.  It is unheard of for a military operation, which is ongoing, to be reported in the national media and possibly place the lives of people at risk.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

It was a wonderful day for her to see absolute heroes on the pitch, fulfilling their aspirations to qualify for the Olympics and proving a real example.</p> <p>There is a lot going on in women's sport in this country that we should be happy about.  We have the women's rugby team playing Wales, our women's national soccer team are having great success and we see record-breaking numbers attending the football and camogie finals.  However, so much more can be done.  As the saying goes: "Can't see, can't be".  It is so important for women and girls across the country that all the State broadcasters and private broadcasters increase their level of coverage of all sports, but particularly women's games at every level.  If we look at the achievements of the women's hockey team at the weekend, coming after the absolute disappointment for the men's team just the previous week, that is the example we can all aspire to.  We wish them well and, hopefully, they can repeat their success at the Olympics in Tokyo next year.</p></speech>

I hope she enjoys the pantomime that this place sometimes brings.</p> <p>I want to comment on the overcrowding, which is often described as obscene but is also insupportable.  I know the issues in Limerick are constantly being raised by Senators Bryne and Gavan, and there is also Cork University Hospital in the Leader's area, as well as the situation at the hospitals in Letterkenny and south Tipperary.  The INMO brings out statistics on a monthly basis and, obviously, the recent figure is the highest so far this year, with 679 people on trolleys.  Every year, we have the winter initiative and we know overcrowding is at its worst in February and March every year.  Unfortunately, it would seem the winter initiative needs to become a year-round initiative to try to find capacity.  We have empty wards and problems with recruitment and retention, as well as the significant increase in the population of the country, but we have not increased capacity while trying to recruit and retain medical staff.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is to meet each hospital group this afternoon.  I ask that he would come back into the House to report on what their initiatives and plans are but, more importantly, what their actions are.</p> <p>Dovetailing into this is an alarming report about the rise in the number of teenagers missing school at second level.  Tusla has launched a survey and it is the first year it has monitored school attendance.  The survey shows that 12% of referrals to its service concerned people who cannot or will not attend school due to stress and anxiety.  It is the first time this has been named and, for example, they say they cannot attend due to the school atmosphere or other pressures that are going on in their lives.  Tusla will not take a disciplinary approach but is urging parents and students to contact it with these referrals, so it can sit down in a non-judgmental way and try to work out the difficulties.</p></speech>

Gay Byrne was a national treasure and there is no doubt about it.  He had a massive impact on all of our lives.</p> <p>I want to raise an issue that came to my attention during the Halloween break.  Home buyers are being charged extraordinary money to view homes.  I have heard of people being charged up to &euro;100 just to view of a house.  According to the provider of the viewing, the money is only refundable if the applicant is successful in buying the house.  This is illegal.  The fact that it might be common practice alarms me.  I cannot decide whether it is a sinister way to weed out those with less disposable money or a cash making opportunity.  I encourage all of us to alert the public about their rights when it comes to viewing homes.  I would love to hear what the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has to say on the matter.  Perhaps the Leader will bring the matter to his attention and revert with the reply.</p></speech>

I must be parochial and single out Roisin Upton, who scored the sudden death penalty to win.  It was great to see members of the Hogan and Upton families in the crowd.  The team has given great pleasure not only to those at home in their sitting rooms but also to those present.  It is great to see women's sport on the rise as well as support for women's sport.</p> <p>I cannot let today go without raising the issue of University Hospital Limerick, UHL, which Senator Devine also raised.  A total of 679 people are on trolleys nationwide, 63 of whom are in UHL.  We are not even into the winter season yet.  Throughout the summer, UHL topped the list and it tops it again today.  It is unbelievable.  A meeting of the Joint Committee on Health took place on 2 October, which I attended, even though I am not a member.  Mr. Paul Reid, the new CEO of the HSE, attended as did the Minister.  There was a commitment on the day that the Members from the mid-west would be met within two to three weeks of the meeting to examine the various issues facing UHL.  That meeting has not happened to date.  I have written several times and asked questions about it but I have received no response.  Will the Leader follow up on when that meeting can be held?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that Members from the mid-west meet Mr. Reid and the hospital group's CEO, Professor Colette Cowan.  This is not just about the patients who are on trolleys, but about the staff and conditions as well.  We have the largest and newest accident and emergency unit in the country, yet the numbers are still rising.  Ironically, more than a third of those on trolleys today are in the west.  Mr. Reid needs to address this issue with the various hospital group CEOs, especially as it relates to University Hospital Limerick.  I await the Leader's response, whom I am sure will revert to me shortly.</p></speech>

I also welcome her husband, daughter and son.  This is a demanding role.  It is great to have a Green Member back in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>The Leader will be aware that the family of the late Shane O'Farrell brought their campaign to the gates of Leinster House today.  I do not know how many Senators took the time, or got time, to meet the family, but I did.  We all know of Shane O'Farrell's story and the family's campaign for justice for him.  The matter was brought to the Oireachtas.  There was a demonstration today at which the family issued a press release and met the media.  This is a difficult story.  The family is calling for the Minister for Justice and Equality to establish a public inquiry into the circumstances leading to the 23 year old's death in 2011.  Senators are aware of the case's background.  The family wants to know what actions State agencies took prior and subsequent to Shane's death.  In 2018 and 2019, the Houses passed motions to establish a public inquiry into these events.  The Department of Justice and Equality has instead opted for a scoping exercise.  The Minister elaborated on that in the Seanad some time back.  The exercise was to seek the family's views, but family members have said that it was an inadequate vehicle to achieve justice for their son, their loved one and their brother.  All of us can understand and empathise with those concerns.</p> <p>Will the Leader and every Senator use their connections and good offices to call on the Minister to progress the matter of a public inquiry in line with the family's wishes for truth and transparency surrounding the tragic circumstances leading to Shane's loss?  It was a tragedy, and there are people who know the facts of the real story.  The family members are entitled to a full examination of all the facts concerning the death of their dear son and loved one.  I appeal to the Leader to use his good office to see how to progress the matter.  All Senators should seek to support the family.  The House debated the issue, took a decision and demonstrated to the family our support, but words are meaningless if they cannot be pushed into action.  I am making this call on behalf of the family, who cannot be here.  The O'Farrells need help and wish to have our support.  I hope we will give it to them.</p></speech>

We miss our wonderful former colleague, Grace O'Sullivan.  We were all fond of her and worked well with her.  I do not doubt that we will work well with Senator Hackett too.  It will enrich the House to have a new Senator from the Green Party.  I wish her well.</p> <p>I share Senator Byrne's frustration with the situation at the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick.  We are all blue in the face raising such cases at this stage.  I agree with the Senator, in that it is time that Mr. Reid got a handle on the matter.  There are issues with early discharges and not-so-early discharges from the hospital.  The Minister made an unannounced visit last August.  When there was an analysis following on from that of why there were so many people on trolleys, it transpired that there was a logjam in discharges, with delayed discharges causing serious problems.  The HSE has a responsibility to explain why there are 63 people on trolleys in that hospital.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need a detailed breakdown of discharges and delayed discharges.

What happened to his car was an absolute disgrace and it has been, rightly, condemned by everybody.  There is a problem though in that four proposed direct provision centres have not gone ahead.  We have an international obligation to provide accommodation for people who come to this country seeking our protection.  I want to see the facilities in Achill Island, Leitrim and everywhere else where they have been proposed, opened.  We must have a collective conversation on this issue.  There must be engagement and consultation with communities.  It is appalling, however, that a State Department did not relocate 13 vulnerable people to Achill Island because there were concerns regarding their safety and so on.  This is not acceptable, as far as I am concerned.  I want to see those vulnerable people, who have come here seeking our support and help, located in Achill Island.  I sincerely hope that whatever the difficulties are, they will be resolved such that the ladies in question will be able to go to Achill Island, where I have no doubt the majority of the islanders will welcome them with open arms.  We have seen a deterioration in regard to this issue that is extremely worrying and, as a Member of this House and as a citizen of Ireland, I am very uncomfortable with it.</p></speech>

I am glad to say they received a tremendously warm reception.  Ken is 82 years old and Tarak is 77.  Since engaging in a peaceful protest on St. Patrick's Day, they have been on bail; their passports have been taken from them and they are unable to return home.  The manner in which they have been treated by this State is nothing less than disgraceful.</p></speech>

I regret that it was the Fine Gael Party that did not engage in support of these people.  I note my colleagues from the mid-west are here.  The good news is that there is another opportunity for them to do so this Friday at Ennis Circuit Court, where the latest hearing for these two fine, brave men will take place at 10.30 a.m.  The men are applying for their trial to be transferred to Dublin.  They cannot get a change in their bail conditions until that is agreed.  What they have met to date is postponement after postponement.  What the State is doing is, effectively, incarcerating these two fine men with a combined age of close to 160 in Ireland.  This is being done because these men stood up and said what everyone knows to be the case, namely, that there is something terrible happening in Shannon day after day.  There are US wars of aggression all across the Middle East, in Yemen, Afghanistan and Iraq and we are supporting those wars.  Nobody on the other side of the Chamber has ever stood up and announced that we are doing the right thing in supporting what the US is doing at our airport because they cannot.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is no defence for what is happening in Shannon.

I encourage Senators to come along to Ennis at 10.30 a.m. this Friday.  In common with a number of other people, I will be there to support Ken and Tarak by standing up and saying that justice should be done for these two fine men.</p></speech>

It is a happy and proud day for the Senator and her family.  I wish her well.</p> <p>I join other Senators in condemning what happened with Deputy Martin Kenny.  It is absolutely abhorrent that his car was burned and his family was frightened.  It really disgusts me.  I spoke to the Deputy earlier.  He has young teenagers who understand the danger.  It is such a difficult situation.  We have all become used to the negativity and the abuse we get online.  When it comes to our homes and our families, it is a different story.  I think we all have to speak out against that.  We all disagree on occasion - I suppose we agree on occasion - but at the end of the day, this type of intimidating criminal behaviour should not be tolerated in a democracy.</p> <p>I seek a debate on the report on State-funded contraception, which follows on from a request made by the Minister for Health.  There is a lot of detail in the report.  There has been a great deal of media discussion on what is being proposed.  People have debated whether long-acting contraceptives should be provided and what age groups should be involved.  The provision of State-funded contraception was one of the fundamental ancillary recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  Obviously, this recommendation must be a fundamental part of our efforts to avoid unwanted and crisis pregnancies.  I am seeking a debate in the House on this topic as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Senator Hackett is in very good company.  This is a proud day for the Senator and her family.  I hope she enjoys the rest of the day and the rest of her term in the Seanad.</p> <p>I wish to join other Senators in mentioning the Cuisle respite centre in County Roscommon.  I remind those who wonder why someone from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency would discuss a centre in Roscommon that the users of this facility come from all over the country.  Indeed, I was contacted yesterday by people from Tydavnet, County Monaghan, who wanted to express their sadness, disappointment and annoyance that this much-loved facility is due to close at the end of this month.  They told me of the joy they experienced when they availed of the respite services at the Cuisle facility.  They spoke about the kindness and understanding shown by the staff to the people who stay there.  This facility has given many families throughout the country their only possibility of respite.  It has specialised equipment to cater for the needs of their loved ones.  Needless to say, they are heartbroken about its proposed closure.  As others have said, this facility has been open since 1997.  I understand that issues have arisen on foot of a structural survey of the building, which appears to have highlighted a number of issues.  I am sure the Leader will agree that none of these issues should be insurmountable.  I ask him to use his good offices to ask the Minister for Health to intervene in this issue.  Between 45 and 48 people are employed in this centre.  On behalf of all the people who have had joyful and happy experiences when they have visited the centre, I put it to the Leader that the problems which exist at the centre can be surmounted with the goodwill of all parties.  I have no doubt that a solution can be worked out over time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The facility should remain in place for all the people throughout the country who avail of it.</p></speech>

This House needs to have a serious debate on this issue.  It is very easy to virtue signal on this issue and state that one is against a particular thing.  A woman stated on the radio on Sunday that she disapproves of the centres.  When asked by Brendan O'Connor for an alternative to them, she said, &quot;Well, that is the difficulty.&quot;  This country must be realistic and truthful.  We cannot, at a time of housing shortage, simply say that every applicant for asylum goes to the top of the housing list.  In the present circumstances, we cannot say that everybody who comes from Albania, Georgia or elsewhere and applies for asylum automatically becomes entitled to full social welfare.  It is naive to think that such a regime could be put in place.  We need a real discussion on what is wrong with our current system and why it is so unfair to so many people.</p><p>The real cause of injustice is that we are failing to deal in a timely manner with applicants for asylum.  It is absurd that it can take years to go through the process.  Either people are entitled, <i>prima facie</i>, to asylum protection or they are not.  The second thing about which we must be honest is the economic migrancy.  It is not the same as asylum-seeking.  Although many of us will see similarities between the plight of the Irish going on coffin ships in the 19th century and some of the people getting onto RIBs to cross the Mediterranean in the present day, we must be truthful that economic migrancy is something which must be dealt with by the law and through legal processes.  It is not a question of simply turning a blind eye to the difference between the entitlement to refugee protection and the need for the State to be clear that it is a cause of concern that so many people from places such as Georgia and Albania - both of which are trying to get into the EU and are safe countries -  have suddenly applied for refugee status.  The real reason is that it is our own fault that we have a system which entertains delay and creates the opportunity for people to pose as refugees for a long time when, in fact-----</p></speech>

I want to talk about that in the course of that debate.</p> <p>I also want to talk about what Senator Gavan said about the use of Shannon Airport to displace a lot of these people from the Middle East.  I want to talk about why the Irish Defence Forces are moving from search and rescue work in the Mediterranean and drifting ever closer towards participating in a European army.  I want to talk about all of that in the round and I want to particularly afford everybody in this House the opportunity to take a stand, like Deputy Martin Kenny, in support of people who are vulnerable and who are coming to this State to flee some of the awful devastation being inflicted upon people around the world, much of it via Shannon Airport, to our shame.</p> <p>I want to commend the latest initiative from Ireland's Future yesterday.  Over 1,000 signatories from the civic world, political life, academia, the arts and sport came together, in this State this time, to respectfully ask the Government to prepare for new constitutional horizons and not to fall into the Brexit trap of constitutional change coming about in an ill-prepared or ill-informed manner.  It is a responsible and prudent call and it is the right thing to do.  It is a conversation within broader Irish life that mirrors the conversations that are happening in board rooms, club rooms and even in this Chamber on occasion, that identify the real need to have an inclusive, engaged and informed conversation about where we want to be.  The Constitution compels us to do that and the Good Friday Agreement allows us and affords us the opportunity to deliver that for people.  T&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre, a good start is half the work.  I want today to reiterate that call from Ireland's Future through the Leader.  It was yet another impressive initiative calling on the Government to get ready.</p></speech>

When I looked at the budget this year, straight away I saw there was a 1% increase on the last budget in respect of how much would be spent on the system to move people through the asylum process.  If we were really committed to addressing people's assessment for asylum, we would have seen a much larger increase than 1%.  We need to have a conversation about this issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Not enough has been said here today about the Taoiseach's comments in the paper when let run without somebody telling him what to say.  His views became very clear on a number of issues but one of them was on direct provision.  I am not going to refer to the nationalities he spoke about but to a phrase he used in one of those sections, that we cannot give everybody free houses.  Not only is he not fixing the direct provision centre issue, he is also using a term that is coined all the time against working class people in terms of being able to access social housing.  He is purposely trying to pit direct provision against ordinary people in the housing system.  That cannot be a conversation that is allowed be had.</p></speech>

However, Senator McDowell is to be complimented for raising a very big subject here.  Before we all get into our various boxes on the left and on the right, we should pause and stand back and look at some of the points he has made.  My instinct is probably not the same as his on this issue.  We in Ireland have vast experience of being accommodated and welcomed in many countries abroad.  Certainly some of our emigrants were asylum seekers.  In the days of the Fenians we were looked after in Paris and other places like that.  However, the vast majority of our emigrants were economic emigrants.  They went to Australia, England and America to better themselves financially and we should bear that in mind as well.  Whatever I would say on the subject, I abhor totally the unlawful attack on the home of Deputy Martin Kenny, who is a fine Member of these Houses and who is highly respected.  We cannot tolerate that.  For the life of me, I am not a holy Joe but I think there is some Christianity in all of us and we have to do the best we can for people in this unfortunate plight.  I really do not understand in my heart how some people in Christian Ireland are responding - minorities really - in the way they are.  I am not saying it should be some place else.  Kerry has done well in this and we have a good record, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows.  If they come to my town, I assure the House that they will be welcome there.  Certainly keep the numbers tidy and small and have a nice separation but that is not what I came in here to say.</p> <p>I warmly welcome Senator Hackett to the Chamber and I compliment her.  It is a great honour for herself and her family to come to Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann.  I welcome her family and members of the Green Party.  I compliment her colleagues in the Civic Engagement Group, with whom I agree most of the time.  There is a certain issue in Ballylongford which I will be talking about here tomorrow and on which we cannot agree.  Senator Hackett's tenure cannot be too long but it will not be as short as people think.  My money is on around March 2021.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbainfidh s&iacute; taitneamh agus tairbhe as a tr&eacute;imhse anseo, cib&eacute; fhad a bh&eacute;as aici.

T&aacute;imid ag s&uacute;il le oibri&uacute; l&eacute;i chun leas na t&iacute;re.</p> <p>I welcome the debate that Senator McDowell so eloquently requested.  As somebody who has always supported a structured but generous accommodation not just of asylum seekers but of economic migrants, I really think it is important that we do not hear phrases like "nothing can be said in these Houses".  This debate suffers from a lack of intellectual honesty and when people are being accused of gaslighting the minute they raise an issue that others disagree with, it closes down debate.  It is extraordinarily unhelpful and colleagues are not going to persuade people who are reluctant by being so judgmental of their fears and feelings.  That seems to me to be obvious.</p> <p>If I may, I want to return to the nostalgia that many people are feeling in these days and that has been expressed in this House with the sad news of the passing of Gay Byrne.  He played a huge role in Irish life, as we all know, and in saying farewell to him, people are saying farewell to a part of their own lives and a part of our past.  For most people, the memory of times past is a memory of happy times.  There is also gratitude because Gay and his team did so much to entertain, inform and educate the nation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He was a brilliant broadcaster and communicator at a time when, all over the western world, what was previously private was rapidly being made public.  He exemplified and symbolised that new public expression.  He and his team shone a light into dark corners of our society at a time when others found that threatening.  However, we must never forget that the same dark corners existed in every society, and we still have dark corners in our society today.  Indeed, the nostalgia that people feel today reflects the fact that the Ireland that Gay Byrne explored and reflected back to itself was mostly a happy one.  I would like RT&Eacute; to consider a systematic and unedited rebroadcasting of the extensive series of episodes of "The Late Late Show", because it would make for interesting and very valuable social history. </p><p>The work that others did with the material that Gay and his team brought to light reflected various agendas, some good and some bad.  Some of that work ended injustices and some of it sadly contributed to the dark corners that exist in our society today.  However that is often the case with the legacy of great figures.  Today we pay our respects to a consummate professional, to the most effective broadcaster of his generation and to someone who affected all our lives and created so many lasting memories.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh s&eacute; and to his family our deep sympathy. </p></speech>

That debate has to be framed by the notion and the belief that diversity is a positive thing and not de facto a negative thing.  We should have our conversations and discussions in that light.  I was an economic migrant for 17 years.  I never felt like and never was a burden on the country in which I worked.  People seek asylum and flee countries for a variety of reasons.  Some are to do with wars, despots and people destroying their own people in a fashion that none of us here can possibly imagine.  People also leave for other reasons.  People left Ireland in the 1950s and went to other places because they were gay.  I know for a fact that women leave countries that are considered to be welcoming and not in difficulty because they are experiencing domestic violence.  We need to understand and have this debate in its fullness.  I pay tribute to my own home town of Macroom, which has stretched out the hand of friendship, as it rightly should, to people seeking asylum who are living in direct provision centres there.  Rural Ireland is not all one and the same.  We need to promote the positives as well as the negatives.  Once that debate is respectful, I am happy to have it.  We should not slice and dice between genuine and non-genuine asylum seekers, or pit local people facing a housing crisis against people who are coming to the country for the refuge which we rightly offer and to which end we have signed international obligations.  Once we have that understanding, I am very happy for us to have this debate.  If we do not have that, it will be a waste of time.  It will just fuel the rhetoric that can be found at times outside this House and that leads to the kind of horrible experiences recently undergone by Deputy Martin Kenny and his family.</p></speech>

It is a quite emotional time for them.</p><p>Finally, I acknowledge my predecessor, Grace O'Sullivan, who is now a Member of the European Parliament.  It was Grace who gave me my first look inside this historic building, shortly after her election to the Seanad in 2016.  I have followed her progress closely.  She has asked me for help and I have been willing to give it.  I very much enjoyed working with her and seeing how she worked with the Civil Engagement group.  She has been an inspiration to me to get involved in politics up to this level.  I also look forward to working with my Green Party colleagues in Leinster House, namely, Deputies Eamon Ryan and Catherine Martin.

She is serving not just the people of Offaly but the people of Ireland.  She has come on a huge journey as the first Green Party councillor elected in Offaly last year and I certainly hope she will not displace our Deputy, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, in Offaly in the general election.</p> <p>The vast majority of the House paid tribute to the late Gay Byrne, who tragically passed away yesterday.  Many eloquent words have been spoken by many Members, in particular Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, on the prowess which Gay Byrne had as a broadcaster.  This morning, Sean O'Rourke summed it up pretty well when he said we were all part of a national wake remembering, commemorating and celebrating the life of a broadcaster who, despite the comments of some, shone a light into dark corners, opened up a window for many in our country and gave a voice to those who were voiceless.  The letters written to radio stations from people across the country give a powerful reminder of Gay Byrne.  I remind the House that the late John Charles McQuaid had the temerity to write to RT&Eacute; to say he was in charge of what RT&Eacute; could broadcast in the context of Gay Byrne.  How we have travelled as a country.  Gay Byrne was part of that journey, along with others.  He was an enlightened man and one who gave people a voice but he was also a broadcaster.  We use the phrase "n&iacute; bheidh a leith&eacute;id ar&iacute;s ann" far too easily but it is true.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He was the first.  He was iconic.  As Senator Mullen said, there were some who agreed with him and some who did not agree with him.  That is the democracy and the Republic in which we live.  We pay tribute to him and thank him for his service to the Irish people.  We thank his wife and his two daughters for allowing us to live our lives with him.  We hope that in their time of mourning and sorrow they will remember the good Gay Byrne brought to the lives of so many people but also that they will be comforted by the prayers and the thoughts of the people of Ireland.  Ar dheis l&aacute;mh D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p><p>I welcome Senator Ardagh back to the House and wish her well in her pregnancy and remaining time with us.  I sincerely wish her every success.  She referred to the issue of housing.  It is a vexing issue.  As she knows well, in the city of Dublin, in the first six months of this year, presentations of families who are homeless have fallen by 9.5%.  One in two of the families presenting to homeless services were prevented from having to enter emergency accommodation and the number of families entering emergency accommodation has fallen by 5%.  Some 786 families have exited emergency accommodation to a home.  That is a 48% increase on the 530 exits recorded from the same period in 2018.  Of course, we do not hear some of those facts.  We accept there is an issue with housing and supply.  The Government is committed under Rebuilding Ireland 2040 to pursue that in terms of tackling the issue of homelessness.</p><p>Senator Norris raised the issue of privatisation.  Yet again, the issue of seagulls has dominated the Order of Business in the House.  The issue of waste collection is one that has been well debated and documented across every local authority in the country.  It is not my intention to revisit it.</p><p>Senator Higgins made reference to the issue of the debate on the report on adoption transparency I would be happy to facilitate that debate.  The Ceann Comhairle has ruled on the matter regarding the money message.  I will not delve into that here today.</p><p>Senators Hopkins, Leyden and Gallagher raised the issue of Cuisle.  Unlike Senator Leyden, I am aware Senator Hopkins has been in contact, had her phone answered, has had meetings and has been in here raising the matter-----</p></speech>
