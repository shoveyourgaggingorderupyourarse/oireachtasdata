It has been a difficult time for agriculture and for the Minister, given the current Brexit situation.  More than 50% of Irish beef is exported to the UK.  Irrespective of the outcome of Brexit and its impact, we will have to develop new markets for beef, as well as for other meat and the wider agricultural sector.  Reductions in the volume of beef exports are inevitable as a result of Brexit.  While it is great to have a market in the United Kingdom, there is an over-reliance on it.  Any reduction in the size of the market and the sale of beef will affect the farm gate, that is, family farm income and the people involved directly or indirectly in the beef sector, as all Senators will agree.</p> <p>Rural communities and farmers in recent times have felt threatened and vulnerable as a result of the beef crisis, which was demonstrated when they picketed.  We hope the action is now permanently suspended and I thank all the people who were involved.  I welcome the establishment of a producers' organisation, which is important, and I acknowledge the role of the Minister, his officials and his Department.  It has not been an easy time for anyone working in agriculture.  It is important for everyone involved in the industry to move on, but to do so on the basis that we recognise there must be a fair distribution, and value for the family farm and the primary producers of beef.  </p> <p>It is important that wherever beef is sold, whether in Beijing or Ireland, the product of Irish beef has a great reputation.  We have traceability, as the Minister knows.  The integrity of Bord Bia is critical to the overall strategy for marketing beef internationally.  The number of people who contacted me during the dispute about the repackaging of beef in England was disturbing.  We must never compromise the Bord Bia brand.  The breaking of seals, or repackaging or rebranding, poses questions.  I do not suggest that it is the only issue but people want to maintain the integrity of the Bord Bia brand.  We know about the traceability of Irish beef, the integrity of the brand of Bord Bia, and that the animals are primarily grass fed, which is critical.  I welcome any initiative that brings together the North and South.  The island of Ireland can work pragmatically together to promote agriculture and, primarily, the beef sector because it is so important.  As we move forward in our political maturity, we need to wake up to the fact we have a unique selling point on the island of Ireland in marketing Irish produce and beef.  </p> <p>That brings me to my question for the Minister.  What is his vision for the attach&eacute;s and their role?  I am aware he intends to reappoint people but that he will also expand the presence of such attach&eacute;s in places as far away as Mexico.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is all positive news, but it is really important that we remain focused.  We need to develop new markets for agricultural products so that ultimately we can improve the income of family farms.  When responding, the Minister might set out who is going to be appointed and the countries in which they will be based and also his strategy for the expansion and development of new markets for Irish agriculture, particularly beef.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-09-26a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019092600002#B00200"><p>The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agrifood exports continues to be an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of our agrifood sector.  This is evidenced by its placement at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade.  The need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations has been an ongoing objective of my </p> <p>Food Wise 2025 outlines the potential for growth in agrifood exports to new and emerging markets, particularly Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region.  Our efforts will be focused here for the foreseeable future.  This is not in any way to diminish our commitment to existing traditional and long established markets.  Accordingly, my Department is currently implementing ambitious plans to expand its presence globally by appointing agricultural attach&eacute;s to new key market locations.  These are informed primarily by Bord Bia's market prioritisation research and the appointments are taking place against the backdrop of the wider expansion of Ireland's global footprint, which is planned under the Government's Global Ireland 2025 initiative.  The latter represents the most ambitious renewal and expansion of Ireland's international presence ever undertaken in terms of diplomacy, culture, business, overseas aid, tourism and trade.</p> <p>In 2019, three new attach&eacute; posts have been added to the Irish embassy network in Berlin, Tokyo and Mexico City.  This brings to 11 the number of locations in which agriculture attach&eacute;s are stationed.  In addition to these new posts, we are in the process of recruiting local hires in various locations where local knowledge and specialist expertise can support our market access and trade development initiatives.  Trade promotion and negotiations, together with market access development, will make up the bulk of the activities in these new roles.  Their activities will be carried out in close co-operation with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, operating in accordance with the well-established team Ireland template.</p> <p>The development of key relationships at political and official levels, as appropriate, will also be an important part of their remit.  My experience over the past number of years on trade missions to emerging markets has been that such contacts are crucial to Ireland's efforts to gain new market access and to widen and broaden our existing levels of trade, both in value and volume terms.  These new appointments will complement and build on the outstanding work being done by our attach&eacute;s in Brussels, London, Paris, Rome, Geneva, Washington, Beijing and Abu Dhabi.  The remit across these locations varies, with the balance between trade and policy work being struck in accordance with the priorities in each location.  These appointments will be augmented by further expansion over the next few years as we refine and develop our market diversification strategy and make a further contribution to Global Ireland 2025.  Plans are being advanced to appoint a new attach&eacute; to the embassy in Seoul and other locations are at an early stage of consideration.</p></speech>

In light of the ongoing debate in respect of Brexit and our over-concentration on the UK market, with, as already stated, over 50% of our beef being exported to that jurisdiction, we have to diversify.  This point was echoed by the Minister.  He also outlined his strategy in that regard.  I particularly welcome that it is proposed to appoint an attach&eacute; with agriculture responsibility to our embassy in Seoul, Korea.  That is good news.  It is important that the Minister's officials get that news into the public domain.  In all the debate and confusion, we sometimes we lose sight of the strategic message which the Minister elaborated today in terms of the plans to diversify and seek new markets beyond Europe.  That, too, is really positive news.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House and giving us that news.  We need to get that message into publications and on websites, such as <i>The Farmers' Journal</i>, <i>AgriLand</i>.<i>ie</i>, etc., in order that people will know that new markets are being pursued.  I do not doubt that this is happening but sometimes the message gets lost among the farming community.  Nonetheless, I welcome the news and I thank the Minister for attending.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-09-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019092600002#B00400"><p>I will give the Senator an interesting statistic, which I think neatly summaries the distance we have travelled.  In 2010, the value of Irish agrifood exports outside of the European Union was &euro;1.8 billion.  In 2018, this value was closer to &euro;3.5 billion such that in a relatively short time there has been substantial progress made in terms of gaining a foothold in these emerging markets.  In regard to Food Wise 2025 and the regions referred to earlier, the Asian market in particular was identified as one where there is a growing middle-class population with increasing levels of disposable income and westernised dietary habits.  This presents opportunities for us.</p> <p>In the context of the success we are having and the impetus that is necessary in this area in light of the UK's decision to leave the European Union, I am conscious of the concerns of the primary producers in terms of where they gain in all of this.  The challenge is to ensure we sustain the edifice that has become the export value and volume of Irish agrifood in 180 different countries worldwide.  It is critical that we maintain the supply base.  We can only do that by ensuring that those involved in primary production are getting a just shake-out.  That is challenging.  We have had issues in recent days and weeks regarding the challenges in the beef sector.  I would like to think that was a watershed moment.  Business as usual will not cut it in that context.  We need to remain conscious of that as we set about creating a new framework for a partnership approach that is very different to what we have had up to now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-09-26a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019092600002#B00600"><p>I welcome the Minister.  This matter relates to the inclusion of underpasses in the targeted agriculture modernisation scheme, TAMS.  The latter, which was launched in June 2015, is a unique scheme with a budget of over &euro;400 million to fund farm investment.  There are six priorities attached to the scheme and all have been very successful.  However, the priorities at farm gate have changed.  When the scheme was launched, one of the priorities was low emissions spreading, which at the time was not an issue for farmers but is now a key driver in terms of the changes being made on farms.  There have been major changes to agricultural schemes, including a reduction in the size of dairy herds.</p> <p>I raise this issue because underpasses are a key aspect of infrastructure.  Many dairy farmers and fragmented holdings need to invest in underpasses to ensure they can develop their farm enterprises.  This is a significant investment of a six figure sum and requires planning permission.  TAMS will expire in 18 months.  I am interested in hearing from the Minister if work is underway in the Department on a new scheme and, if so, if consideration will be given making provision in it for underpasses.  I am not asking the Minister to change the current scheme because it is due to expire in 18 months.  Rather, I am asking that the new scheme that will follow in 2020 when the current scheme expires would provide for underpasses in light of the changes in terms of farm development and the scale of farms, in particular dairy farms, since 2015.  The benefits of this measure include savings in labour, increased health and safety on the roads and fragmented farms being able to reach their potential, which are key drivers of the Food Wise 2025 policy mentioned by the Minister.</p> <p>I hope that a new scheme will be introduced post 2020 and that it will include provision for underpasses, which are key items of agricultural infrastructure that will save time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would be safer for drivers and pedestrians and would increase dairy farmers' profitability.  </p><p>Where does the Minister believe the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, will go?

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-09-26a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019092600002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Lombard for raising this matter and welcome the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II.</p> <p>TAMS II is made up of a suite of seven measures.  These measures were launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-20 and are co-funded under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD.  The measures provide grants for capital investment in physical assets to assist the Irish agriculture sector to respond to a range of policy challenges.  The six measures initially launched in 2015 were the young farmers capital investment scheme; the dairy equipment scheme; the organic capital investment scheme; the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme; the low emission slurry spreading scheme and the pig and poultry investment scheme; and the tillage capital investment scheme launched in 2016.  Among the objectives of the scheme are to enable growth and competitiveness in the sector, addressing environmental and climate change issues, supporting the increased efficiency on holdings and improving animal health and welfare.</p> <p>In addition to these objectives, the young farmers capital investment scheme aims to address one of the key structural issues in the sector by specifically targeting support at young trained farmers by offering them a higher rate of grant aid of 60% compared to the standard rate of 40%.  There is a huge variety of items available under the suite of seven TAMS measures.  Under all measures, applications and payment claims must be made online, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on their behalf.</p> <p>The financial allocation in respect of TAMS for the full rural development programme period will be in the region of &euro;395 million.  To date total expenditure, including transitional expenditure, has reached &euro;169 million and we continue to pay approximately &euro;1.5 million every week.  I am delighted that the scheme has proved to be so popular with Irish farmers with over 29,000 applications submitted to date.  Of these more than 22,000 or over 75% have been approved to commence work.</p> <p>It is open to approved applicants to submit an online payment claim as soon as they are in a position to do so.  The timing of the submission of a payment claim, within the approved deadline, is entirely a matter for the individual farmer and it is up to them when they complete their approved works.  To date, 11,500 payment claims have been submitted and over 92% have been paid.  I would urge all approved applicants who have completed their works to submit a payment claim as soon as they are in a position to do so.  The position is that all outstanding approvals issued represent potential outstanding liabilities for my Department and we must have a budget in place to pay these claims.  Until these approvals mature to payment stage, or the timefrarne of the approval expires, a budgetary provision must be available to make payments.  In order to ensure the annual budget for TAMS can cover all potential outstanding liabilities it has been necessary to roll some 20% of approvals forward from tranche 13 into tranche 14 and from tranche 14 into tranche 15.  I recognise that this may be disappointing for the farmers concerned who wish to commence works to improve their holdings.</p> <p>Due to the tight annual budgetary position on TAMS, it is not possible to consider adding items, including cattle underpasses, to the comprehensive list of investment items already available under the suite of seven TAMS II measures.  I acknowledge that particularly in the dairy sector there is an issue with regard to the daily management of dairy farms which are fragmented and particularly where the cattle are crossing busy national primary roads.  </p> <p>There is intense consideration of the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and what schemes might be considered within that.  Whether underpasses will be considered there has been very significant commitment to the dairy sector under TAMS.  Of the six pillars of TAMS II dairy has probably resulted in the highest number of applications and the highest level of payments.  Through successive provisions in annual budgets there has been an incentive in the tax code for consolidation of farm holdings.  That does not always arise as an opportunity for those managing those holdings, particularly on the dairy side but it is a recognition that there is a problem.  I do not wish at this stage to say what will or could be part of a future CAP or rural development programme.  Whereas this is a niche issue for a few it is significant for them. </p></speech>

It is probably not an issue for TAMS II but it is one that we have to consider in the future.  When TAMS was announced in 2015 the low emissions spreading was not taken up by farmers but it is the biggest issue they talk about at the farm gate now.  It is amazing how priorities change over the lifetime of a scheme.  I am sure the new scheme will have different priorities and maybe when they are being considered there might be an opportunity to consider this.</p></speech>

There are other parties and authorities who have a role in respect of cattle underpasses.  Apart from the farmers there are the local authorities where it might be regarded as a public safety issue for road users.  We are aware of this but there has been very substantial support available under TAMS for the dairy sector.  I am conscious of the competing interests such as the pig and poultry sector and that the next iteration of CAP will be on climate action measures.  That will be the challenge in getting an adequate budget because there can be all the wish lists we may have and there is no shortage of requests, for example even the sport horse sector provides an opportunity for farmers to diversify because we are internationally recognised as a successful producer of sport horses.  These issues will be considered when a new rural development is put together.</p></speech>

Mental health care costs approximately &euro;8.2 billion annually.  The Mental Health Foundation's survey shows that more than 40% of employees are neglecting other aspects of their life because of work and this may increase their vulnerability to mental health problems.  Using Maslow's hierarchy of need going from the physical to self-actualisation, it makes absolute sense to prioritise mental health in the workplace.  Many people are working longer and commuting more.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are balancing various life issues, including family, leisure, recreation, work and so on.  It is extraordinary that the mental health survey found that more than one quarter of employees feel under pressure or depressed, one third feel anxious, and half feel irritable.  We might all feel irritable but we can put in place measures to help improve that.</p><p>It is important that as we deal with various competing issues in our lives, we work with the World Health Organization and organisations here to promote and protect mental health in the workplace from the perspective of raising awareness and putting in place mechanisms and measures within the workplace to inform employees of supports available and to involve them in a variety of ways, whether it is decision-making, career development or recognising and rewarding their performance in the workplace.</p><p>As a former Chairman of the health committee, it is important that I continue to advocate for the proper development and management of mental health training for all employees.  The Cathaoirleach has been involved in the farming community, and the issue of farm safety is one we have highlighted.  This body had an important report done by Senator Conway on farm safety.</p><p>Mandatory mental health training in the workplace is vital to promoting the health of employees.  It will help to create a more positive workplace and better outcomes for employees in the working environment but also in terms of family life and the home environment.  It is critical that people are provided with information and training in the workplace.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

I am taking it on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, who could not be here but who welcomes the discussion on this important area.</p> <p>We continue to discuss issues of mental health in the workplace and training for people involved in that area.  It is an area of high priority for the Government for many reasons, including those put forward by Senator Buttimer.  It is important not just for work and economic reasons, which I will deal with today, but for all the other reasons.  The benefits of looking after our mental health are vitally important.  It is important that we have that conversation regularly, no matter where we work, but in particular on behalf of employees.  The issue is rightly getting much more attention now than it got in the past, which is important.</p> <p>Mental health is a priority concern for the Government, with funding increasing from &euro;711 million in 2012 to nearly &euro;1 billion in 2019, an increase of 39%.  Training and education for employees in the mental health sector are provided by colleges through undergraduate and postgraduate courses.</p> <p>There is no obligation on employers in the wider workplace to provide mental health training to their employees.  Such training, however, can be beneficial to employees, employers and the overall economy.  A 2017 World Health Organization report found that, at 6.3%, Ireland is in the top ten countries worldwide for the percentage of the population affected by anxiety disorders.  A 2018 OECD report found that mental health difficulties cost the Irish economy &euro;8.2 billion every year, a figure to which Senator Buttimer referred.  The report states also that conditions like anxiety and depression are causing a 3% reduction in the country's GDP through stress-related absenteeism, for example.</p> <p>To address this issue, the HSE mental health division funds various partner organisations, such as Mental Health First Aid Ireland, to provide courses that teach awareness of the signs and symptoms of mental health problems and how to provide help.  These courses teach employees to recognise the signs and symptoms of mental health problems and to help colleagues and friends who might be developing a mental health problem.</p> <p>Similarly, the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, is involved in a range of training initiatives around suicide prevention and mental health promotion.  The safeTALK and ASIST suicide prevention programmes are available free of charge to all members of the community, and courses are run throughout the country.  While these courses are not specific to workplaces, under the whole-of-Government national strategy to reduce suicide, Connecting for Life, Departments and agencies have agreed to implement the action on training of staff across the civil and public service in suicide awareness, particularly those who are public facing.</p> <p>NOSP also funds NGOs, including Shine and Suicide or Survive, to provide work-based mental health-suicide prevention programmes. SeeChange is the national mental health stigma reduction partnership that provides training to workplaces.  Its goal is to help facilitate a cultural shift in workplaces around Ireland so that employers and employees can begin to feel supported and secure in starting a discussion about the mental health problems that can affect each one of us.</p> <p>A Vision For Change, the national mental health policy, is being refreshed.  The revised policy has identified early intervention and training as a main priority.  The revised policy will include recommendations to improve online training initiatives that seek to support young people in schools and medical teams in training, and that seek to target access by individuals in the workplace to individual and corporate mental health training.  In addition, the revised policy recommends training to be made available to service users, families and peer workers to support resilience building and promote prevention strategies.  All training will be augmented by Healthy Ireland promotion strategies where national health and well-being campaigns and initiatives will be rolled out locally, regionally and nationally.</p> <p>I thank Senator Buttimer for raising this important issue, which is one we have a duty to debate while encouraging the same to happen in all workplaces.</p></speech>

I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, on his work and productivity on the matter.</p> <p>The Minister of State's statement that there is no obligation on employers in the wider workplace to provide mental health training to their employees is a worry, notwithstanding the large amount of work we have done, and are doing, and the improvements we have brought about.</p> <p>Next week is Mental Health Awareness Week.  I ask, notwithstanding the work that has been done, that we would consider legislation to encourage employers to ensure that all employees receive mental health training as part of their employment.  It is something we should consider as a Government, and as the Minister of State said, it would benefit employees.  We have done a large amount of work through a variety of schemes and programmes ,but I am concerned that we are not making them mandatory.  Given the need for a work-life balance and other pressures, proper training in mental health for their employees should be mandatory on the part of employers.</p></speech>

I will bring back to the Minister of State the points the Senator has made on considering more ways to encourage best practice by employers and the need for training and discussion on this issue.  I am not sure that legislation is the way forward, but I will mention that to the Minister of State to see what is the best way to proceed.  There has been a cultural change in Ireland.  It is important that, as a Government, we are part of that movement and that we fund initiatives to help with that.</p> <p>Positive mental health is essential to fostering an open, collaborative, positive and healthy atmosphere in the workplace.  The formal training I mentioned earlier, such as the programmes offered through the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention and those offered through NGO partners are effective tools in ensuring that employees are conscious of their mental health and that of their colleagues.  It is of great benefit to employers as well as employees and will help create a healthier workplace environment.  We should encourage employers to take up these programmes wherever they can do so.  That is something we can work on in conjunction with Senator Buttimer.</p></speech>

He is very welcome.  This issue is not his direct area of responsibility but I would appreciate it if he would give us a response and convey concerns to the Minister.</p> <p>The issue at stake is State supports for those with special educational needs.  In particular, I raise the issue of the lack of supports for those students with autism and the pressure the State has put on their parents.  This is an issue of major national concern at this critical time in the school year.  The Government is failing our children.</p> <p>The most pressing issue facing children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, is the lack of special class spaces at secondary level.  Teachers encounter students every year who should be in needs-appropriate learning environments but who instead are forced into mainstream schools which cannot accommodate their needs.  I met a number of teachers over the course of the summer who have expressed real concern about the stress this causes for parents, children and teachers.</p> <p>This is an issue that comes up every year and, unfortunately, the Government has failed to meet the challenge every year.  Government policy forces hundreds of children with autism and other special educational needs to go without needs-appropriate learning environments.  Instead of receiving a needs-appropriate education, they are treated as problematic students.  They are put on reduced timetables and left with no option but to spend much of the time they should be in school at home.  On Monday, I met a parent whose child is given only one hour of schooling per day.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This position is further undermined by the lack of sufficient funding for home tuition, which is an issue that has been raised for weeks ahead of the return to school and continued to be raised weeks after the return to school.  I hope the Minister of State can clarify for us this morning if appropriate home tuition hours have been approved.</p><p>The Minister for Education and Skills has in his power since the enactment of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 to ensure that every school across this State has the appropriate level of classes for children with special educational needs.  I am puzzled as to why this power has not been used more often.  These children are locked out of their constitutionally guaranteed right to education by the simple fact that this Government is not willing to pay for their education.  There is a chronic lack of autism spectrum disorder special classes at post-primary level and an unacceptable level of geographic inequity in this provision of special classes.  For example, in Cavan there are seven special classes at primary level to every one at post-primary level and in Laois the numbers are similar.  In Dublin, this ratio is 3:1 and it is similar in Clare, Kildare, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Waterford and Wicklow.  Only one county, Leitrim, has a ratio of 1:1 and it is the least-populated county in the State.  The rest of the country faces deficits of 50%.  These numbers are not coming down and the progress that the Government claims is mostly at primary level.  This begs the question of whether Fine Gael envisages a society where half or more of our children with autism just do not continue to second level education?</p><p>This issue is symptomatic of a Government negligent in its duties.  Not only that but this is an obstructive Government that is impeding the advancement of equality enshrined in our Constitution.  Education is the keystone in the bridge to opportunity.  We have removed that bridge for too many children, unduly burdening too many parents.  This must be remedied and the solution is obvious.  There must be more classes.  The current reality unfortunately represents a total failure of the Government's constitutional obligations to these children and their parents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-09-26a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019092600002#E00200"><p>I thank Senator Gavan for providing this opportunity to have this debate on a very important area.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, as he could not make it here to take part in the debate.</p> <p>The Government is determined to ensure every child  is allocated a school place, including through the use of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 to direct schools to make a provision.  We are trying to set new targets and provide new treatments but the aim is to provide school places and there is no lack of desire on our side to achieve it.  We stand for equality of opportunity as a party and as the party leading the Government, we will carry that through.</p> <p>Every child must have the opportunity to avail of his or her right to education pursuant to constitutional and legal rights and in accordance with identified needs.  To this end, the Government will invest &euro;1.9 billion this year on supporting students with special educational needs in schools.  This includes an allocation of over &euro;300 million towards providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism.  The numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants and specialised places are at unprecedented levels and so too is the number of children receiving support across the continuum that includes mainstream classes, special classes and schools.  The greater proportion of children with autism attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required.  Some students may find it difficult to manage full-time placement in mainstream classes and so placement in a special class or special school setting is sometimes deemed more appropriate.</p> <p>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs.  This includes the establishment of special class and special school places in areas with identified need.  Since 2011, the Government has increased the number of special classes from 548 to 1,621 across the country now, of which 1,355 are autism spectrum disorder special classes.  It is an important increase and although some may argue it is still not enough, it is a serious commitment to increasing the offering that has been there over the past seven or eight difficult years.  We ensured we could prioritise education during those years, which were difficult because of financial reasons, and we also looked to prioritise special needs education in that time.  There are 124 special schools that provide specialist education for students with complex special educational needs.  These schools now provide over 8,000 places, compared with 6,848 in 2011.</p> <p>The NCSE has well-established structures to ensure advance planning is in place to ensure that there is sufficient specialist places to meet need as it arises.  Normally, places are established with the full co-operation of the schools.  There is legislative provision in place where schools refuse to make the necessary provision for children in their areas or try to avoid it.  The legislation was invoked already by the NCSE back in April when the council formally advised of the need for eight primary autism classes and 40 special school places for children in the Dublin 15 area.  This followed an intensive series of engagements by the NCSE with schools in the area.  We have since worked hard with the schools and patron bodies concerned.  We have made progress with the opening of a new special school that will ultimately provide 40 places and seven primary schools have also agreed to open autism classes.  One further class is required and work is ongoing in this regard.</p> <p>The experience in Dublin 15 demonstrates the legislation is an effective tool to vindicate a child's constitutional right to education where all reasonable efforts have failed and it may need to be used again.  However, we would naturally prefer not to use legislation and there should be a willingness from all involved in the provision of education to carry out duties in that space.  The Minister's preference is for schools to engage with this challenge on a voluntary basis because it is right for the children in these communities.  The Department of Education and Skills, together with the NCSE, will continue to work with schools, patron bodies and teachers so they can establish special classes where required with confidence.  In that way, we will continue to seek to meet the education needs of children in their local school in so far as possible.</p> <p>I note the Senator mentioned the difference between primary and secondary levels and there is a concentration on trying to meet those additional needs at the secondary level.  There are still many primary schools that are not providing the required spaces so we will continue to work on that as a Government.  As I noted, the Minister wants this done in a voluntary capacity, with people recognising their responsibilities, but if that does not happen, the legislation allows us to step in and make changes.  That is what has happened.</p></speech>

He referred to what has happened since the passing of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.  Interestingly, the Government opposed the part of the Bill that gave the Minister those powers, and it was a combination of Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party and others that had it included in the legislation.  I understand the Minister of State may not be able to answer my question and I want to be fair.  I am puzzled as to why the powers in the Act have been used so little to date.  We know there is a dearth of classes, with a particular problem at secondary level, as the Minister of State acknowledged, in fairness.  Nevertheless, the Minister has chosen not to use the legislation that may force schools to provide classes where they are needed.  I mentioned counties like Cavan, Laois, Dublin, Clare, Kildare, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Waterford and Wicklow, which have a drastic shortage of these classes.  I am puzzled as to why the Minister has not used that power.</p></speech>

I forget the history of the various amendments to the legislation but it is great if this House contributed to making the necessary changes and that Act is now working.  It is what the House is for.  We try to take on board amendments from everybody when we can and they are right.</p> <p>This part of the legislation was formally used for the first time on 18 April by the NCSE in informing the Minister of a shortage of school places in Dublin 15.  The NCSE had to make the case to the Minister that this legislation had to be used, and that is what happened in April.  The NCSE is aware of a number of children still seeking specialist places and it continues to work with schools and patrons to establish this educational provision.  The council takes the approach of trying to work with schools and parents to make this happen without the need for the provisions in the legislation.  We are not afraid to use it when the need is there, as we have proven.  The NCSE is actively engaging at a local level with schools, patron bodies and the families concerned to resolve the issues involved as soon as possible.  If, following completion of the work, the NCSE establishes there is still a shortage of places in either area, it may inform the Minister by activating the provisions contained in the Education Act 1998.  Funding for provision of home tuition is available to parents as a short-term intervention until school placement is available.</p> <p>I understand the funding is there to match need.  There are often issues but these are not always related to money.  The provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 are used when required but there is a process in getting to that.  It is not for a Minister to decide that he or she will intervene on a specific day.  It must come through the NCSE in the process that has been working well in this country for a number of years.</p></speech>

The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has warned that the economy could fall into recession next year as a result of Brexit, although we all hope that will not happen, and that an additional budget could be needed if that is the case.  If Brexit goes okay, people and businesses that have deferred decisions may all decide to put their foot to the floor, which may cause further overheating in certain areas of the economy.  It is important we all acknowledge, as we do, that Brexit remains highly uncertain, with a great deal of risk.  I do not doubt that the Minister for Finance pays attention to what the ESRI indicated in respect of the budget.  Our spokespersons, such as Deputy Michael McGrath, are involved with the Minister in advance of the budget, which will be published in less than two weeks.  There is such uncertainty and we need to be cognisant of bodies such as the ESRI when they publish reports.</p> <p>I raise the issue of moral hazard if the rainy day fund is used.  It is not so long since we debated the legislation on the fund and it would be unfortunate if almost as soon as we have invested the money, we remove it.  What the Department officials stated in their notes, namely, that using the State's rainy day fund for Brexit planning would lead to a moral hazard, is fair.  The fund was set up for very exceptional, one-off events.  While Brexit is very unusual in one way, we are now more than three years into the process and we know it will happen, irrespective of how bad it may be.  I would be more comfortable if we did not use and deplete the rainy day fund only months after we invested the initial money therein.  </p> <p>I welcome the fact that the Attorney General has granted a fresh inquest into the deaths in the Stardust fire in 1981.  The decision is welcome for the families, despite it being so long after the event.  I was only a child when it happened but I remember the wide outpouring of grief.  It was such an appalling tragedy, with 48 deaths.  Many of the families in question believed they would never get justice.  I hope the inquest will give some level of closure, albeit so belated, to the grieving relatives of so many people.</p></speech>

The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine appeared in the Chamber earlier and we discussed important issues such as diversification and the challenges facing communities.  In particular, we spoke about the beef crisis, although I do not intend to rehash all of that now.  We had a meaningful engagement and discussion.  The Minister spoke about developing and appointing new agricultural attach&eacute;s in a number of embassies.  As I was leaving the Chamber earlier, it occurred to me that the Leader might be able to arrange for the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, who has special responsibility for horticulture, to appear before the House when he has a free slot in the next month or two.  Important food related matters are traceability, quality and branding, not least in respect of Bord Bia, the expansion of new markets, and the diversification of agriculture, perhaps moving to a lesser reliance on beef.</p> <p>This week a number of gentlemen who had resided in Tuam visited me with a member of Galway County Council.  It was a harrowing and moving experience.  The men were farmed out at seven years of age to do hard labour on farms.  They were meant to consider it great charity.  One of them told me he had been left a small holding but eventually had to sell it.  The authorities did not accept that the man had been fostered.  Although it was an informal arrangement, his guardians had loved and cared for him but he had to pay all the taxes and was left with nothing.  It was very unfair.  The men told me they did not have a medical card.  They had been broken and destroyed by a system.  They wanted independent counselling they could trust - not just the assistance that was given to them - and they needed greater help and support.  They asked for health and housing supports.  Surely the State owes that to people who come from institutions where it had a primary responsibility and duty to protect them and their welfare.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, should come to the House to update us and to reassure us of what is happening, specifically regarding Tuam.  It is important that the people affected know that we in these Houses are advocating for them and will support them.  I ask that the Minister outline what the State can do in terms of providing medical cards for these people.  What can we do in terms of housing for these people?  What can we offer them in terms of independent counselling and support to allow them to get on and live their remaining years?  How can we address the issue of inheritance from people who may have been their guardians and cared for them, people who stepped in as their parents and gave them a job, even if it meant picking potatoes or snagging a few turnips at the age of eight, nine or ten?  We need to have the Minister back here to have a conversation and to be reassured that these issues are at the top of her agenda.</p></speech>

Some of us here are old enough to remember the events of 38 years ago.  There was no social media and hardly any telephones then.  As a young woman I remember listening to the news getting drip-fed through to us.  A fog of sadness and shock fell over Dublin.  There were no answers at that time.  The families and those who survived have fought for 38 years.  This is a momentous day and a good decision by the Attorney General to reopen an inquest on the basis of new evidence available.  I have raised the matter repeatedly.  This is the time to congratulate the ordinary people of Dublin.  They held steadfast and did not give up.  They want the correction of the record which has already been corrected to say that it was not arson, but the correction that this inquest will bring to honour their loved ones, ordinary working-class people on the north side of Dublin.  We need to embrace them and thank them for their tenacity in keeping the issue alive.  This is an injustice that needs to be righted.</p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of children with autism in the education system.  The right to an education is one of the few rights enshrined in our Constitution, yet we continually deny it to children who have extra needs.  I welcome the opening of seven classes in the Dublin 15 area under legal notices sent by the Minister, who is doing the right thing.  The teachers and principals have difficulty with training, capacity, space, etc.  We need to uphold and abide by the Constitution.  Payment for home tuition for these autistic children is being delayed.  Reduced hours are being offered - perhaps only one hour a day.  In one case, the parents are often called to come in and take the child.  When the child has issues and engages in acting out behaviour due to their diagnosis, the advice is to call the Garda.  This is a six year old child.  We should not be criminalising our children.  I welcome this measure, and I hope we will speedily see provision of education for all in their communities and not 100 million miles away.</p></speech>

I am one of the people old enough to remember that awful tragedy and the appalling day when we heard the news.  I was a teenager and it was horrific.  I express my utter admiration for the families who have worked so hard for so long and have been so eloquent in their advocacy for the children they lost.  It is heartbreaking to listen to them.  I am so glad the Attorney General has taken this decision on which I commend him.</p> <p>I support Senator Boyhan's call for the Minister, Deputy Zappone, to come to the House to discuss the Tuam issue.</p> <p>This morning I spoke alongside the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, at the launch of a new Women's Aid report, Unheard and Uncounted.  This is a very important report on women and domestic abuse, documenting ongoing issues and failures in our criminal justice system, notably the lack of data on cases of domestic violence and how they are dealt with through the system, and the lack of joined-up processes between the criminal courts and the family courts regarding women and children who are victims of domestic abuse.</p> <p>As pointed out at the launch, we have legislated in recent times to improve processes through the Domestic Violence Act, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act and also the Judicial Council Act which will allow for sentence guidance.  However, there are ongoing problems for women trying to achieve justice through the courts.  I ask for a debate on domestic violence looking at the recommendations in this important report and seeking to uncover where we can make improvements through legislation and where we can get commitments from the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, on improvements to processes.  I seek that debate as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>Yesterday during our very stimulating debate on the Blasphemy (Abolition of Offences and Related Matters) Bill, Senator Ned O'Sullivan pointed out the need for legislation on hate crime.  A number of us have been pressing for that for some time.  There is a good deal of research and a review is ongoing.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, referred to that review during the debate on the Blasphemy (Abolition of Offences and Related Matters) Bill.  It would be very useful for this House to debate how we might best seek to legislate against hate crime in future, building on the existing research and the work of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and others.</p></speech>

There was no consultation or review of effectiveness; it was simply a diktat.  The response among students who were getting the allowance was very strong.  They know the value and are pressing very strongly for its restoration which will not affect them.  Key is the impact on people with disabilities who are just leaving school, moving into a new world of training and, we hope, independence.  It also has an impact on people with mental health difficulties, brain injuries and others getting an opportunity to return to work.</p> <p>The programme is successful.  Students grow in confidence and learn to be independent, get a job or go on to further education.  These are people who have already had it tough, and removing the allowance is making it tougher.  The Minister for Health, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disabilities and representatives of the HSE have all said the savings being made will be allocated to day service.  Day service is a separate, distinct and necessary programme; it is not either-or.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, said the abolition of this allowance was about equality and equity.  We need to remember that the disability allowance is an allowance to keep body and soul together for these people.  The rehabilitative allowance is to respect and support the commitment of people to undergo learning to move into employment independence in the community and away from reliance on the disability allowance.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State to the House as soon as possible to explain his perverse notion of equality and how he justified robbing one group of people with disabilities to plug a funding gap in this year's budget.</p> <p>In a related, but more hopeful and joyous development regarding disability, today is Make Way Day.  Last week, the Garda assistant commissioner with responsibility for roads policing, David Sheahan, joined the Disability Federation of Ireland to ask that drivers consider the needs of people with disabilities.  He went on to make some very pointed remarks.  Footpaths are for pedestrians.  Drivers who pull up on footpaths are breaking the law as well as blocking the path for people with limited mobility.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Someone in a motorised wheelchair must either go home or risk his or her life on the public road getting around a parked vehicle.  Neither is acceptable to the Garda.  Disabled parking bays are for people with disabilities and able-bodied people parking on them is against the law.  These bays assist disabled people in going about their daily business.  The Garda roads policing unit will increase its vigilance and lower its tolerance of footpath parking and parking in disabled bays not only for Make Way Day but for all 365 days of the year in support of the campaign.</p><p>I commend the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Garda roads policing unit, the local authorities, councillors and a range of public and private bodies who have got behind this.  People with disabilities are out on the streets today to claim and reclaim their streets and pavements and to do that freely and easily. </p><p>I was not here the other day when the Leader spoke about the death of my beloved brother, Jim, and I thank him for that.</p></speech>

Partisanship and populism risk poisoning politics in western democracies and do little to serve the needs of citizens in a time of mounting global challenges.</p> <p>I ask colleagues to be mindful of these troubling political developments and to ensure the public interest remains at the heart of politics in this country.  It is critical that Irish politics is not lured in the direction of petty populism and deceit.  As a candidate in the forthcoming by-election in Cork North Central, I pledge that decency in politics will be a central theme in my campaign.  Debate based on passion for issues is a healthy part of any democracy.  It is important that proper debate is never confused with some of the false propaganda creeping into political discourse elsewhere.</p> <p>All of us in this House may have different ways of arguing a case or delivering on policy but we are all here to try to better the life of every citizen in the country and we should never deviate from that and certainly never go down the road that the two most established democracies are now travelling.  I ask people to keep that in mind and protect the democratic system in this country over the next few months when we face a very challenging time with what is being proposed for the UK leaving the European Union.  Now more than ever we need to protect the livelihood of every citizen in this country.  It is an extremely important issue and we, in this House and in all the structures of the democratic system in this country, need to be mindful of that over the next few months.</p></speech>

Farmers have designated special areas of conservation and protection on their land and are calling on the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, to properly compensate them for the restrictions placed on them.  In a time of unprecedented biodiversity and habitat loss, the 35,000 Irish farmers with set aside private farmland to be designated as SACs or special protection areas are giving this country an invaluable gift not just for now but for generations to come.</p> <p>This comes at a cost to farmers, not just the opportunity cost of not using the land for farming but unseen costs.  For example, banks will not accept designated land as security.  If the land is sold, the new owner must be notified, and full planning permission is needed for normal farming activities, such as fencing.  The scheme is heavily monitored by the National Parks and Wildlife Service with patrols visiting every two weeks, which must be facilitated and there are serious fines and a jail sentence of up to three years where restrictions are not adhered to.</p> <p>The farmers are simply looking for a fair scheme of compensation from the Minister.  While negotiations have been going on in good faith for over 18 months, the farmers have lost confidence in the Minister's commitment to delivering a workable deal.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to advise it of where negotiations stand now.</p> <p>There is something terribly wrong when a group of people occupy a building in order to try to force a Minister to come to meet them.  We should never get to that stage.  I believe the Minister would be willing to discuss and negotiate.  I am not sure how it got to the crisis stage it got to a few days ago.  Would the Leader please invite her to come to the House in the near future? </p> <p>This brings me to Greta Thunberg's address to the United Nations last week.  I cannot let my first utterance in this House at the commencement of this session go without expressing my deep concern for that child.  That we are using a child to further the cause of climate change and sitting back quietly and watching a child break down in front of the world's media is absolutely disgusting.  A child should be in her classroom.  People have argued with me that the point she is making is that she should be in her classroom.  People blame governments.  I have had it this morning on social media, that the Government should do this or that.  Climate change is at the feet of all of us.  Every one of us has to change our lifestyle.  We cannot force Government to force me to stop switching on my central heating or driving my car or doing any of the other things.  That child is being exploited for adult purposes and adults need to step up to the plate.  If people do not like what the Government is doing in respect of climate change, they should do something about it the next time they have an opportunity but for God's sake let us stop using children.  I wonder how that girl will be reintegrated into normal life when she goes back to her school.</p></speech>

We have particular added challenges with respect to Brexit, Mercosur and climate change, all of which will affect this sector more than any others.  Farm income in this sector is not sustainable.  Farmers cannot continue producing cattle at the current low price levels.  Suckler farmers are the lifeblood of rural Ireland but we are losing them.  Who will manage this land in the future if the activity of farming continues to mean that farmers have less money at the end of the year than at the start of it?  What young farmer will consider entering that sector with such low price levels?</p> <p>There has been much debate in recent months particularly on improving transparency in the beef market and we absolutely need to see progress on that.  We have seen the first producer group set up on a legal basis but that needs to work for farmers in order for them to receive better prices for their animals.  We need to have confidence that there is a fair distribution of the value of a beef carcase.  The beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, is worthwhile but it is disappointing that not all the farmers who could have subscribed to it have subscribed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maura Hopkins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2478"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2478&amp;amp;pid=MauraHopkins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Like Senator Mulherin, I would like to see an extension of the closing date for the scheme to ensure that the maximum number of farmers can benefit.  We should be paying farmers to keep a number of cattle based on farm viability and environmental sustainability.  There is a huge concern in regard to a carbon tax on agricultural diesel.  This is an important point in the context of the upcoming budget.  Unfortunately, there are no electric tractors and no sign of any coming on stream soon.  Any increase in agricultural diesel will have a huge impact on farmers.  I ask the Leader to have the Minister, Deputy Creed, come to the House to discuss all these important issues, particularly the beef and suckler sector.</p></speech>

First, Jim Power, with whom I do not usually agree, made the point that we do not know the profits in the beef industry because a number of the key companies are private unlimited companies.  Second - I say this hand on heart - any time we tried to secure a decent rate of pay in those factories, the workers concerned were sacked.  The beef factories are gangsters.  I speak from first-hand experience.  It is a pity that the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, did not work with SIPTU at the time it was trying to organise.  It is a pity for all of us, particularly the sector.</p> <p>This morning, I attended an impressive presentation by early years professionals, highlighting, once again, the appalling plight of our childcare workers in terms of low pay and insecurity.  Thousands of them have to sign-on each summer because they only get 38 weeks work.  One in two of these workers is leaving or planning to leave the sector.  The attrition rate is 25%.  One can imagine the impact of this in terms of care and continuity of care.  This is the third year in a row that they have asked the Government to introduce a living wage such that every worker in the childcare sector would get that wage as a minimum.  I welcome that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has publicly supported that proposal.  The ball is now in Fine Gael's court.  This can be done.  Sinn F&eacute;in has costed it in its submission for the upcoming budget.  It can be easily done.  What is lacking is the will on the part of Fine Gael to do it.  I was delighted to see Fine Gael representation at the meeting this morning.  I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue and, more importantly, I call for action in that regard in the upcoming budget.  Let us make sure that childcare workers in this country have a decent future, decent pay and decent conditions.</p></speech>

Yesterday, Ryanair announced that effective January 2020, it will not be operating flights from Shannon Airport to Bristol, East Midlands and Ibiza.  January 2020 is only a couple of months away.  In December 2018, I raised the issue of European connectivity at Shannon Airport with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  Shannon Airport is the only international airport in Ireland that is not Brexit-proofed in terms of a European hub.  The Heathrow hub is effective but post-Brexit, unlike Cork Airport which has the Amsterdam and Charles de Gaulle hubs, and Dublin Airport which has a multitude of major European hubs, there is no European hub in Shannon Airport.</p> <p>At a meeting between the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Shannon Group on 6 February, which I arranged, the Minister asked the group to make a submission to his Department on the establishment of a major European hub at Shannon Airport.  This took place on 21 March and discussions have been ongoing.  In terms of Project 2040 and strategic regional development in Ireland, post-Brexit Shannon Airport must have a major European hub in place.  The hub up for consideration is Frankfurt, to which Shannon Airport operates flights in the summer months.  My view on the matter at this point is that it is imperative that this hub is put in place.</p> <p>In 2005, Dublin Airport had 72% of the air traffic.  It now has 87%, Shannon Airport has 4% and Cork Airport has 5%.  It is imperative for the employees of Shannon Airport and the people of Limerick, who I represent, that Shannon Airport is in a position to service the large multinational base of companies.  While Shannon Airport has only 4% in terms of inward passengers, the Shannon, mid-west and western region has an exponential number of multinational companies, well above the norm for Ireland Inc.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the House with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on aviation policy in Ireland.  We cannot allow a situation in which Dublin Airport only continues to grow.  I accept the need for a strong capital city, but Dublin Airport is chaotic at times.  The capacity of Shannon Airport is 4.5 million passengers.  Currently, approximately 1.8 to 1.9 passengers pass through that airport, which means the airport is only operating 40% capacity.  Given the size of this island, why are we not considering divesting air traffic to Shannon?  I have been working on this matter with the Shannon Group, the Minister, Deputy Ross, and his Department for the past year.  We have reached the time when the critical decision has to be made.  Shannon Airport must be given support to establish a major European hub such that whatever happens in the context of Brexit, about which there is much uncertainty right now, it is secure in terms of European connectivity.  Shannon will continue to have the Heathrow hub, but the Frankfurt hub would remove any uncertainty and ensure it can service the large base of US multinational companies and others based in the mid-west and western region, which have located here because of our excellent workforce.  Shannon Airport must have connectivity to a major European hub.  I reiterate my call to the Leader to arrange a debate in the House with the Minister, Deputy Ross, on aviation policy in Ireland and I call on the Minister and his Department to expedite the decision and to work with and support Shannon Airport to establish a major European hub to ensure it and the region are Brexit-proof.  </p> <p>As I said, I have been working on this project for the last year and will continue to work on.  We must have a definite decision on this matter, which has to be agreement to establish a major European hub at Frankfurt, to promote balanced regional development, to support the multinational base in the region and the tourism sector.  We must ensure that Project 2040 is implemented in the correct manner such that resources are spread throughout Ireland.</p></speech>

Danilo, a Brazilian gay man, was saying goodbye to his boyfriend after a night out in town at around 3.30 a.m. when a gang of two women and four men, having seen him kissing his boyfriend, set upon him and battered him with a steel bar.  He managed to get to his apartment where he called emergency services.  He also rang the Garda in Kilmainham but no Garda showed up and it may now not be possible to find the culprits.  The ambulance service showed up and Danilo was treated.  He has confirmed that he is fine and has received a lot of support from friends but told <i>dublinlive.ie</i>that it is important that people know that this type of crime is happening and that he was not the first person to be attacked and, unfortunately, he will not be the last one.</p><p>Danilo is right that these attacks are still common.  My own experience is similar.  I have raised similar attacks in this Chamber but they often go unreported.  In this case, Danilo had to go to Kilmainham Garda Station to make a statement.  On numerous occasions, I have called in this House for robust hate crime legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Yet for some reason the Department of Justice and Equality has been sitting on its hands over the last term, despite this issue being the LGBT community's number one priority.  We know this because the majority of LGBT people said as much in a comprehensive report which was launched by Deputy Stanton a few years ago.  He is now the Minister of State, alongside the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, responsible for doing something about this.  How many times do I or others have to come in here and talk about these attacks?  How many more attacks must the LGBT community face?  I raised this during a Commencement matter with the Minister of State a few years ago, which was reported on by Marie O'Halloran in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He stated at that time that other countries with hate crime law have major problems, but that we do not.  We have problems, and he has both the responsibility and the power to deal with them rather than sitting on his hands.  I want to see action.</p></speech>

It is a huge day for the families that have campaigned for many years.  Hopefully the inquest will go some way to addressing the issues on which they have been seeking answers.</p> <p>I also join with my colleagues who raised questions about childcare workers.  When I attended the briefing this morning I was aware that there were issues, because as my party's spokesperson on children, I have much interaction with stakeholders in the area.  It is hugely important that workers in this area are paid properly.  They are often very well-educated and the Government has introduced a scheme to incentivise that, though I have heard anectodally that it is not always passed on to individual workers.  However, a more fundamental issue is how we as a society want childcare to be and how we wish our young people to be taken care of.  The years during which early childcare workers care for children are the most important years in a child's development.  We have heard that individuals are finding it very difficult to make ends meet, which was not news to me because I often interact with people who work in the area.  They are being paid a very low wage relative to the important work they do, so I hope extra funding is allocated for this.  It is important to say that many good schemes have been put in place over the last number of years and over consecutive budgets.  I and others in Fine Gael have tried to prioritise this area and we were the first Government to put a Minister for Children in place.  There have been improvements and while it is important to recognise them, we need to take further steps to improve the overall sector.  Improving the wages and job satisfaction of those workers and making them feel valued for the work they do is fundamental to improving the overall system.</p></speech>

Much of the commentary and critique around young women such as Greta Thunberg has focused mainly on her mental health and her Asperger's syndrome.  As the mother of a young, passionate and purposeful woman with Asperger's, I can say quite confidently that the only thing that ever negatively affects her mental health is when the world responds to her in the way many people have to Greta Thunberg, claiming she is being used or manipulated and that she should still be in school.  That young girl will achieve more for this world through her activism than she ever will by sitting in a classroom on a daily basis.</p></speech>

Her mental health will always be in a good place as long as people facilitate and support her, and acknowledge the big impact she is having on the world, instead of resisting, trolling, and questioning her abilities as a young woman.  My daughter became passionately involved in the area of suicide and suicide ideation when she was 12, and instead of telling her where her place was I facilitated her as best I could.</p> <p>Some of these comments are coming from a Senator who supported extending the voting age to 16, yet he is now saying that this is adults' work.  Senator Craughwell should have some substance and consistency in what he says, before criticising a young 16 year old woman for becoming one of the biggest political activists this world has seen in generations.  Instead of attacking young girls' appearances or the green movement, he should attack the people who try to dismantle and disenfranchise young women like Ms Thunberg, because that is where his energy will be much better spent.</p></speech>

There were no blockades at their factory gates.  They are not the problem; there is a structural problem in the whole meat industry.  These people are just trying to run a business, and while they are small players in the industry, they provide valuable employment in their local areas.  Many farmers were glad to be able to go to them to get their animals slaughtered during the recent pickets.  I do not think generalised statements help at all.  We should have more considered debates, given all the rhetoric I hear about inflammatory types of speech which do not help anybody.  There are similar family meat-processing plants around the country which can stand over their situations.</p></speech>

At the beginning of April the regulator was summoned, at my request, before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to answer questions on inordinate delays in the processing of an application for a renewable energy plant, which would provide local employment at the Asahi site outside Killala.  At that meeting, the regulator stated that if a fresh application were made, it would be dealt with expeditiously as it was quite familiar with the application at that stage.  Unfortunately, though the company submitted an application shortly after that, the process is still ongoing and seems to be running into the same dead ends and unsatisfactory explanations from the regulator, which we thought had been cleared up.  I am asking that the regulator be required to make a statement on the delay in processing this application, given that it stated on the record that it would deal with such an application speedily and in a fair manner.  It had not previously done so, on which it was called out.  I regret that I have to stand here again and raise this issue.  Some common sense should prevail.  We are potentially facing fines for not achieving our renewable energy and electricity targets and yet this project is facing all sorts of issues which can be dealt with.  It is not satisfactory.  Why would private investors, which are being asked to build these power plans and invest in renewable energy projects hang around if they cannot do business in any sort of timely manner?  It is crazy.</p></speech>

I have heard some patriarchal and patronising comment in this Chamber over the years, but I raise the Senator's contribution in particular because he lauds his previous role as a representative of a teaching union.  What does he think we should be teaching children?  Is it to be slaves and not to think independently or be active?  I adhere to the school of thought that empowering and enfranchising young people is positive.  P&aacute;draig Pearse, in his innovative and pioneering essay on education, The Murder Machine, wrote that one never lowers oneself to the level of a child but one should always raise oneself to the level of a child.  With the example of Greta Thunberg, we could collectively seek to raise ourselves to the level of that child and what she is doing for the world.</p><p>I also raise an issue that featured last week at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and features again in the media today.  I call on the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to address the evident increase in immigration checks along Britain's border in Ireland.  I have noticed and raised anecdotally in the House previously the number of checks being carried out on public transport, particularly close to Dundalk.  The Committee on the Administration of Justice, CAJ, in the North and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, in the South have raised very real concerns and fears about the potential for racial profiling people travelling on buses.  The Garda appears to be carrying out immigration checks.  The CAJ and ICCL are deeply concerned and ask under what legislation these checks are being carried given that there is a common travel area and other arrangements in place.</p><p>Furthermore, what concerns me and should concern us as a society is that garda&iacute; are boarding buses and asking some people for their passports and papers but not others.  If I am asked to show my passport on a bus, I am not compelled to produce it.  Other people are being asked for passports.  That leaves the Garda, and us, on very questionable and shaky ethical and legal ground.  There is merit in having the Minister come to the House given the broader context of fears about checks on the Border and the relocation of armed response units by the Garda to areas along the Border.  Brexit or no Brexit, it seems to me and to many others, including very reputable human rights advocacy groups, that if one is an immigrant, one is already faced with a hard border in the here and now.  That should be a concern for us all and I ask the Minister to come to the House to address it.</p></speech>

This is an issue that is close to my heart.  In my part of the world, this would mean joining together the divisions in west and north Cork.  The west Cork vision is based in Bandon and the north Cork division is based in Fermoy.  It is proposed to merge the two divisions and base the new division in Macroom.  Geographically, this will mean one Garda division will cover a coastline of approximately 1,100 km.  As the Chair would know better than I would, the Garda Commissioner is proposing to have an area stretching from Allihies to Youghal in one Garda division.  This is an enormous tract of land.  Dealing with issues on our coastline depletes our resources.  Drugs, in particular, are a serious issue.  Major seizures include 1.5 tonnes of drugs found off Mizen in 2014 and six tonnes of drugs found in Courtmacsherry in 2009.  How could one Garda division police such a long coastline?  This proposal may work in theory but it does not make sense practically given that the coastline the new division would cover is 1,000 km in length.  I propose a debate on this issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality because policing our coastline is a major issue for society.  How can we have a policy of having one Garda division cover such a huge tract of country?  Drugs is a major issue and we need to have a debate on and how we effectively manage the problem.</p></speech>

We are in a serious situation where young people are giving great leadership but we owe it to them always to show that there is hope for the future as well.  That needs to come out more in the media.</p> <p>On a matter of significant public concern, there has been talk about the Government's stated intention to legislate for so-called safe access zones and to prevent any kind of even peaceful and respectful opposition to abortion from being expressed outside abortion facilities.  I am glad to tell the Seanad today that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, met a bunch of members and staff, mainly from the Joint Committee on Health, and he advised us of correspondence from the Garda Commissioner.  I am happy to say this confirms "the Garda Commissioner's satisfaction with existing public order legislation to adequately deal with any reasonable public order incident that may arise at such centres."  The Garda Commissioner confirmed the views he expressed at his recent meeting, presumably with the Minister or his staff, that protests to date at such centres had not contravened the law and had been peaceful.  He stated that "no incident of criminality has been reported or observed as a result of a protest placed at or near the vicinity of a service centre."  This tells us what we already knew. </p></speech>

The Minister, rightly, disclosed to us the Garda Commissioner's clear advice that the proposed zones are not necessary.  The Minister, nonetheless, clings to the view that he still wants to legislate.  What is also interesting was that he told us he had not received legal advice that he could not do so.  I had to put it to him, as opposed to the Minister acknowledging, that there is a considerable body of European convention and European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence which would very much defend freedom of expression, in particular, peaceful freedom of expression.  I also drew his attention to the fact that the precedent of the case of Open Door Counselling and Dublin Well Woman, in 1993, may well incidentally protect women where they might feel conflicted, pressurised, harassed or rushed to approach an abortion, and that they would have a right to receive information that might be peacefully and respectfully on offer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am sorry to say that while the Minister proposes to talk to garda&iacute; and abortion providers, he refused, when I asked him to do so, to commit to talk to people who advocate best practice in terms of peaceful witnessing to positive alternatives to abortion.

She told how when she approached an abortion facility in Britain she only wanted somebody to tell her that she could cope.  She did meet such a person in the context of a peaceful witness to positive alternatives to abortion.</p></speech>

Instead, they seem to be in hock to the abortion industry and only interested in depicting opposition to abortion, publicly expressed, as something that is somehow hostile or denigratory when what is clear from the Garda Commissioner's letter is that it is very much the opposite.  It is peaceful and it is not a threat to public order.  I would be grateful if we could have a debate on the matter in order to flesh out the Garda Commissioner's advice and to discover why there is advice that seems to run so contrary to the stated intentions of Government at this time.</p></speech>

I know that matters are a bit different this morning but I ask Members to reflect.  First, I ask them to watch the contribution made by the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, MP, earlier.  I know I can be political but I reiterate that our language is important.  Increasingly, people are tuning in to watch Oireachtas television to hear what we say and how we say things.  I appeal to Members, as we start the new term, to be conscious of where we are, of who we represent and of the people watching.</p><p>Senator Horkan referred to the ESRI report.  This is a very important report.  I heard Dr. Kieran McQuinn speaking on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; earlier.  The uncertainty relating to Brexit is just that - uncertainty.  Every day we think that we have a roadmap to somewhere but a different blockage is then put in place.  The shenanigans and language used in the House of Commons and the level of change is unprecedented.  The Minister for Finance has stated that, thus far, he has no plans to have a supplementary budget.  As Senators will know, he has been planning for two versions of the budget and has come up with a no-deal budget that will be introduced in two weeks' time.  It is important to remember that we do not want another recession.  Members have come in here with shopping lists as long the county hall in Cork.  We must be conscious that we have &euro;700 million to spend and that there are vulnerable small and medium-sized businesses which rely on the UK and which we must protect and support.</p><p>The Senator made an interesting point about the rainy day fund and inquired as to what constitutes an extraordinary situation.  To be fair to him and the measured contribution he made, this is an important issue.  I would be happy to have a debate on the rainy day fund.  Next Tuesday, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be here to discuss a number of matters, including Brexit.  The debate will be an opportunity for Senators to discuss the fund.</p><p>I join with Senators Horkan, Devine, Noone and Bacik in welcoming the decision by the Attorney General to initiate a new inquiry into the Stardust tragedy.  All of us of a certain age remember that Saturday morning in 1981 when we work up to the tragedy of 48 young people having died the night before.  The Attorney General has made it clear that there are new circumstances in terms of justice and obtaining answers as to why he had granted a new inquiry.  I commend him on his decision.  All along, the families of the Stardust victims have had one constant message and one request.  None of us in this Chamber can even attempt to understand the anguish and pain that they continue to suffer and that is why it is important that we have an inquiry.  I commend the families on their perseverance.  As Senator Devine stated, this is about standing in solidarity with the people today.</p><p>Senator Boyhan referred to the importance of diversification in agriculture, particularly the area of horticulture.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will be here next Thursday but we will endeavour to have him come here for a further debate in due course.</p><p>I commend Senator Boyhan on his contribution in respect of the men affected by what happened in Tuam.  There is an obligation to ensure that the support of the State is embraced and wrapped around those people.  I would be happy to have the relevant Minister come to the House.  The Senator should table a Commencement matter on the subject.  I would be happy to talk to him about the issue further in due course.</p><p>  Senator Devine raised the issue of children with autism and their access to education.  The Minister for Education and Skills, in light of the use of reduced timetables in schools, issued a statement that schools be required to work with and notify Tusla, the educational welfare service, whereby there is a reduced timetable being put in place.  Also, schools will be required to set out the rationale for the use of a reduced timetable and have a plan for the child's full reintegration into full-time day school.  The key phrase is &quot;full reintegration into full-time day school&quot;.  The basic tenet of what we are trying to achieve is as follows.  All pupils who enrol in a school should remain there for the whole day.  I have been involved with special needs education and I was a schoolteacher.  I am of the view that school is the place for children irrespective of their abilities.  They should be in an educational setting for the whole day unless they are exempt for particular and specific reasons.  I am happy to arrange for the Minister to come to the House.  I have a very simple viewpoint, namely, a reduced timetable should not be used by a school as a behavioural management technique or as a <i>de facto</i>tool of suspension or expulsion in the case of children with special needs.  I say that as somebody who has been involved with special education through my family.  I have been in schools where I got a clout from a young man or young girl because he or she lashed out due to a behavioural issue.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the teachers and those who work in special needs schools for their commitment and dedication every day.  That is why it is important to ensure that there are more places and more special needs assistants.  I accept that more work needs to be done and I would be happy to arrange for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter.</p><p>Senators Ruane mentioned Greta Thunberg, as did Senator Craughwell and others.  I must inform Senator Ruane that I honestly did not take the same inference from Senator Craughwell's contribution.  I thought, as the Cathaoirleach stated, that he spoke from the point of view of care and concern but I might have taken him up wrong.  I might have to defend him but I did not think that is from where he was coming.</p><p>Senator Bacik raised the issue of domestic abuse and I know she made a fine contribution at an event this morning.  As she stated, we have done a job of legislative work.  We have allowed for the reporting of old cases, we have become more aware as a society and the Garda has brought forward different elements of support.  We have a way to go regarding the recommendations and the level of ongoing need.  I would be happy to have a debate on the matter.  The Senator is right that there is a fundamental need to have joined-up thinking in respect of the criminal and family courts.  I fully concur with her on that.</p><p>Senators Bacik and Warfield mentioned the issue of hate crime.  Incidents like the one that occurred last Saturday night in Dublin when a young man was attacked have no place in our society.  We have moved a long way forward as a society.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has work on hate crime and I would be happy to have the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House.  There was a review on hate crime legislation but I am not sure whether it is finished.  I am happy to invite the Minister to come here to discuss the matter as well.</p><p>Senator Dolan raised the issue of the abolition of the training allowance.  My information is that the payment does not affect existing persons who are attending and that it is for a four-year period.</p></speech>

In saying that, I have received correspondence on the matter.  I met the parents of those who have been affected or who feel they have been affected and I met the individuals involved themselves.  It is important to ensure that whatever is the intended consequence, it is not an "misconsequence".  Despite what the Senator said, it is important to allow for day-care places to be extended and to work in tandem with the Department.  I am happy to talk to the Senator about the matter and to have the Minister come to the House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a matter that has an implication, and the import cannot be a negative one.

We need to have a real conversation about this from a national perspective, a local government perspective and from the citizens' point of view, in how we see our streets and streetscapes.  There is now a proliferation of street furniture, bikes, prams and buggies competing for space on pathways and pavements.  Some years ago in Cork a very good exercise was done where able-bodied people were put into wheelchairs or blindfolds and had to try to walk through the streets.  It was an interesting exercise.  I would be happy to pursue the matter with the Senator Dolan.</p> <p>I again pass on our sympathies to Senator Dolan on the sad passing of his brother Jim.</p> <p>Senator Colm Burke's contribution was important.  He spoke of the need for protecting democratic systems.  We can never allow populism to rise or for easy rhetoric to become part of our discourse.  I commend the Senator on that.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell referred to the farmers and set-aside farmland.  Negotiations are under way with the Minister, Deputy Madigan, and with the farmers.  I would be slow to bring the Minister to the House while those negotiations are under way and ongoing.  I have confidence in the Minister, Deputy Madigan.</p> <p>Senator Hopkins raised the issue of agriculture.  The Senator has been a very fine exponent and advocate for the farming community.</p> <p>Senators Gavan and Noone raised the issue of the childcare briefing this morning, the survey and the importance of childcare workers.  The attrition rate has been evident for a long time.  We have seen changes made by this Government and through the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and the previous Government.  Despite what Senator Gavan might say, there has been a very positive change in childcare provision.  I would be happy to have that debate as part of the pre-budget discussions.  I hope too that Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, will be in the House on budget night.  I will endeavour also to have Minister Devine here.  I apologise, the Senator may be a Minister Devine soon, with the support of the House.</p></speech>

This is an important point.  Obviously we are from competing counties, with regard to Cork and Shannon, but Senator O'Donnell made the point that aviation policy should be made irrespective of where one is from.  Dublin has now become the overriding part of aviation policy, which is not good for our country.  Any of us who travel and use airports recognise that it has become almost unpleasant to travel through Dublin Airport.  This is not because of the staff.  It is due to the volume of people going through the airport.  It is my view that we cannot have an overdependence on Dublin Airport.  I would happily have the Minister come to the House to discuss aviation policy.  As Senator O'Donnell has rightly said, aviation policy has an impact on balanced regional development and on tourism.  I would be happy to have that debate.  I note that the managing director of Cork Airport, Mr. Niall MacCarthy, appeared yesterday at the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  Mr. MacCarthy spoke about Brexit readiness and about having no need to panic.  It is critical that we understand the importance of Cork and Shannon airports and that they are the key economic drivers of regions.  I would be happy to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, come to the House to discuss that.</p> <p>I have responded to Senator Warfield and Senator Noone.  Senator Ruane also referred to Greta Thunberg.</p> <p>Senator Mulherin raised the issue of the regulator and the statement today.  I believe the Senator has made a good point in that the regulator should make that decision if we want to see investment in renewable energy.  Obviously, it is beyond my remit or that of the House, but if we want investment in renewable energy and if we want to retain and achieve our targets, then it is important that decisions are made.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile referred to immigration checks at the Border.  I am not familiar with that issue, but it is disconcerting if there is a pointed and concerted attempt at investigation and checking of people, which I hope is not happening to the extent the Senator has said.  I am not saying that it is not happening but it is important there is commonality of approach.  Again, I would have the Minister come to the House to discuss that.</p> <p>Senator Lombard spoke of the new Garda policing model being unfurled today and announced by the Garda Commissioner.  The Senator referred to the amalgamation of the west and north Cork Garda divisions, which does not make any sense to me.  Cork city was a pilot in the new community policing model, which is part of what is being announced today.  Senator Lombard and I are from the largest county in Ireland and we know full well the scale of the job, given the geographical distances.  Having a division based out of Macroom serving north Cork and west Cork makes no sense.  It is important that the resources we have are brought into policing on the ground.</p> <p>Senator Mullen raised the issue of the meeting to create safe zones.  I am aware that the master of the National Maternity Hospital wrote to the staff about a particular protest that is being held.  Whether one calls it a 40-day prayer vigil or a protest, that is a matter for people themselves.  I put it to Senator Mullen that I do not believe that it is appropriate for anybody - whatever their view - to protest outside a maternity hospital or anywhere close to it.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to outline the progress that has been made and some future areas of priority action.  As I always say, the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness includes a ring-fenced budget commitment of nearly &euro;6 billion for housing projects.  There is a list of actions across the various delivery methods.  However, we are always open to new ideas and suggestions if we think they can work.  These debates are useful, both to update the House on progress and to get some feedback. </p> <p>Addressing homelessness continues to be a key priority for this Government and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in particular.  We are working very closely with local authorities and our non-governmental organisation, NGO, service delivery partners to deliver solutions for those individuals and families experiencing homelessness.  Senators can be assured that real progress is being made.  The number of people exiting homelessness into a home is increasing significantly.  In the first half of the year, 2,825 adults and their associated dependants exited homelessness into tenancies.  This is an increase of 21% on the comparable period in 2018.  However, we are the first to recognise that this is not enough when so many people are still in need of a permanent or rented home.  Our work will not stop until we can address that because we know from the figures that are released monthly that more than 1,700 families are in need of a house.  We are trying to find homes for these families.  Even though things are improving as we find homes for people in emergency accommodation more quickly, it is still not enough.  We have to intervene in many different ways, which we are trying to do. </p> <p>I will outline some of the critically important ongoing activities.  We are delivering long-term solutions for homeless households by sustaining the progress made by Rebuilding Ireland in delivering more new social homes.  More than 27,000 households had their housing needs met under Rebuilding Ireland in 2018.  The supply of local authority and approved housing body homes available for social housing increased by more than 8,000.  That figure of 8,000 comprises the long-term permanent solutions, namely, new housing stock combining direct build, Part V acquisitions, leasing and so on, while the other 21,000 are accounted for by short-term measures, mainly the housing assistance payment, HAP, as well as other schemes.  We are also helping the taxpayers.  As Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas know, that is the intervention we are trying to carry out.</p> <p>Naturally, we want more permanent housing solutions.  For this reason, this year's aim is for permanent social housing delivery to reach a figure of 10,000 houses.  Last year, it was a little over 8,000 and this year it will be 10,000 and probably more.  We are committed to delivering 11,000 social housing units next year and 12,000 subsequently under the auspices of Rebuilding Ireland.  Under Project Ireland 2040, we have set aside a budget to deliver 12,000 social houses every year for the ten years up to 2028.  As I have said before, I hope and expect all future Governments, regardless of their make-up, to show the same commitment to social housing.  If we had that for the ten years before we came into government, we would not be in the position of being short of social housing.  We do not have enough social housing for a country of our size.  That is because of insufficient delivery in good years.  However, we are finally catching up and I ask that people commit for the future.  I analyse the commitments of every party and every spokesperson, and no one has committed to delivering 12,000 social housing units every year in the future.  We are committed to that and we are making that happen.  I hope others will do the same because it is important that we do that.</p> <p>While we increase the supply of social housing, the housing assistance payment and the homeless HAP place finder service are playing a very important role in accelerating exits from homelessness and finding houses for those who need them.  I have heard all the arguments that HAP relies on the private sector and it does.  It is not the perfect arrangement but more than 40,000 households are in a home because of it.  It is a successful scheme.  There will always be some difficulties and cases where it is not successful, as with any rental situation.  We will deal with those when we can.  In the majority of cases, however, HAP is working.  We would rather not spend this money on subsidising private rental accommodation, as I am sure everybody would agree.  We would prefer to use all that money to build permanent social housing, but the new houses cannot be built quickly enough.  As such, we have to rely on the private sector in the short term and work with it to provide people with a home today.  There is no point in telling a family that there is no scheme to help them rent a house in the short term while a house is being built for them.  We must have both.  The level of objection I sense towards HAP is wrong.  People are misinterpreting the benefits of the scheme, which is a shame. </p> <p>In early 2018, the Government made homeless HAP services available through all local authorities and introduced supports for local authorities to recruit dedicated place finder staff to work with homeless households to identify and secure tenancies in the private rental sector.  As of the end of the second quarter of 2019, more than 8,000 households had been supported by the homeless HAP scheme nationally.  The majority of people who use the HAP scheme find their own home.  They engage with our services, we put them through the system and their rent is subsidised under the scheme.  It works quite well.  However, there are many other categories.  Certainly the more vulnerable categories find it hard to find a house or cannot locate one.  That is where the place finder services come in.  They are working well with local authorities.  Their job is to bring people who are having difficulty finding a house closer to one.</p> <p>Where families require emergency accommodation, we are working to minimise the use of hotels.  I have been delivering family hubs as a more suitable form of accommodation.  Not only are the facilities more suited to maintaining a normal family dynamic, but it has been demonstrated that the families staying in hubs exit to a permanent tenancy much sooner than would be the case with other forms of emergency accommodation.  I have visited many of the family hubs.  They are not the perfect solution or the end solution.  They are a temporary solution while we find the household a family home, be it a rented house through a scheme or more permanent social housing.  However, they are much better than a commercial hotel setting.  They are not in any way permanent.  While we are increasing the social housing stock and finding more permanent homes for the families concerned, our job is to make that time in emergency accommodation as easy as possible.  It is not ideal, but we try to provide the services people need and ease the journey through emergency accommodation.  The family hubs enable that and are a much better place.  No one is saying they are the perfect solution in any shape or form.  They are just temporary.  </p> <p>There are now 28 hubs operating nationwide, offering almost 650 units of family accommodation in key urban housing authorities.  We recognise that supporting an exit from homelessness sometimes requires more than a house.  Sometimes it requires a broader suite of social and welfare supports.  We analyse the trends of the prevalent needs and what causes people to be homeless in the first place.  It roughly breaks down into two halves.  About 50% of cases have economic causes, such as a difficulty with a bank or a landlord, rents being too high or the loss of a job.  There is a financial reason in about half of the cases.  The other half of the cases do not have financial causes.  We try to intervene in those cases and help as well as we can, but some families need extra supports, not just the building or the home but extra help in availing of the house and staying in it.</p> <p>We have developed a high level interagency group to ensure a more cohesive Government response to homelessness.  The group includes representatives from key Government Departments, local authorities, Tusla and the HSE.  The whole idea of the action plan for housing was to bring all the relevant players together to work on solutions rather than having different Departments working in silos.  This approach has worked well in the Action Plan for Jobs and the climate action plan, and it is working with the housing action plan.  It is delivering solutions and we need to do more of that.  We need to develop working relationships between the Departments of Health, Housing, Planning and Local Government, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs.  All of these bodies are coming together to work on solutions to provide the best outcomes for people who are in a very difficult situation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A street outreach service is assertively engaging with people who are sleeping rough across the Dublin region to support them initially into temporary accommodation and then on to long-term housing options.  At least 200 new permanent emergency beds have been introduced in the Dublin region every year under Rebuilding Ireland.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive will deliver a further 200 additional permanent beds this coming winter. </p><p>I said previously in the D&aacute;il and I repeat that there is no reason for anyone to be living or spending the night on the streets.  There is not a family living on the streets, nor should there be because supports are available to them.  Every six months, an official count is done of the number of people living on the streets.  The most recent one indicated that approximately 160 or 170 people were recorded as living on the streets.  They do not have to do that.  We would rather they were not living on the streets.  We try to encourage them to come in and avail of our services.  I am not saying we have a house for everybody but we have an emergency response.  There are temporary emergency beds, and the services to wrap around those also.</p><p>We have put additional outreach people on the streets - I believe Fr. McVerry won that contract - who engage with people who are rough sleeping and try to encourage them to come in and use our services.  Some people are dealing with various issues, one of which may be a bad experience on a previous occasion.  There are many issues to be teased through but I would encourage anyone who knows or engages with someone rough sleeping to ask them to engage with our services.</p><p>We know that in extreme weather events people who would not normally come in off the streets will come in and engage with our services.  In one very bad weather event about a year ago - I forget which one it was - approximately 60 people who were rough sleeping came in off the streets.  A high number of those remained in our services after the event and have now gone through the system to try to find a permanent housing solution.  That is a good result, and we want to do more of that.  That is the reason we have an increased focus and more staff involved in the street outreach service trying to engage with people to bring them in.</p><p>It is important that we make sure there are a sufficient number of emergency beds to deal with people who come in from the streets.  Every year, following the official counts in October and November and we have the feedback from the NGOs and everybody else, and our own staff on the streets, we make sure we have a sufficient number of emergency beds to cater for that.  That is the reason generally every autumn there is an increase in the number of emergency permanent beds.  It is important that we would stay ahead of that.  </p><p>All of those emergency beds are supported, temporary accommodation where single individuals and couples receive the accommodation and health supports they need.  We have tried to move that further along.  Today, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is in Usher's Quay announcing the new &euro;30 million project for the Dublin Simon Community, which will provide more than 100 beds and will deal with medical as well as housing needs.  That is a fabulous project that has been going on for many years.  I am glad it has finally moved on and that our Department was able to find the funding for it.</p><p>Since the publication of the national implementation plan last September, Housing First services have begun to be rolled out nationwide. This service has been active in the Dublin region since 2014.  Services have recently become operational in Cork, Galway and Limerick.  All regions nationally are now either operational or are at an advanced stage of the tendering process.  My county, County Meath, has gone through that tendering process also.  A total of 386 tenancies have been created to date.</p><p>The Housing First model is one that worked very well in Canada, Finland and other countries.  It engages with a person who is rough sleeping for whatever reason.  In the past, time would have been spent providing services for that person but not providing him or her with a home delivered through the different services.  That model has changed in that we try to provide the persons with a home first, wrap all the services around them and help them to move on to a tenancy and manage all their household affairs.  Of the 386 tenancies created, approximately 80% of them have been successful and the people are still in their homes.  That is a positive intervention and one we want to continue to make.  I know the House will support that intervention, which has worked very well, and we will make sure that every county provides the same model.</p><p>Both the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I have been clear that we need to home in on the question of affordability of housing.  It is not just about social housing delivery.  We want to help address issues of housing affordability and recognise the significant pressure on lower to middle-income households.  This pressure is heightened further in Dublin and other urban centres.  While we will remain unrelenting in our commitment to meet and exceed our social housing targets under Rebuilding Ireland, this Government is equally committed to delivering genuinely affordable housing to families that do not qualify for social housing supports.</p><p>Informed by area economic assessments to ensure fairness and consistency, we intend to target interventions on making housing more affordable in areas where they are most required.</p><p>My Department hosted events on affordable housing for all local authorities in November 2018 and in April 2019.  As part of this process, each local authority was asked to submit economic assessments to the Department.  These assessments focused on both requirements for, and viability of, delivering affordable homes from their own sites.</p><p>Since then, the Government has committed &euro;310 million up to 2021 under the serviced sites fund.  This fund is for key facilitating infrastructure, on public lands, to support the provision of more affordable homes to buy or to rent.  That funding has been used to open up the lands so those local authorities have bought back into their own sites.  Currently, it is specifically for publicly-owned lands.</p><p>A maximum amount of funding of &euro;50,000 will be made available per affordable home.  On this basis, at least 6,200 affordable homes can be facilitated by this measure alone based on the budget allocated to it.  We hope to allocate more money to that in the future to bring that figure of 6,200 to well over 10,000 and beyond and to continue with delivery of affordable housing alongside our delivery in social housing and the improvements in the private sector.</p><p>Affordable housing, delivered on local authority sites, may be housing for purchase at discounted rates or cost rental, which is being advanced on a number of pilot sites before being rolled out more generally.  Homes for purchase will be made available under the recently commenced provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The maximum discount will be 40% of the market value of the home and the local authority will take a charge, equivalent to the discount, against the property.</p><p>This legislation was enacted in June 2018 and regulations in respect of the making of a scheme of priority were signed by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on 12 March 2019.  In its scheme of priority, each local authority sets out the criteria that will be applied to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households in instances where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  Further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding purchaser eligibility and other matters.</p><p>Under the cost rental model, rents cover the cost of delivering, managing and maintaining the homes only, less both the profit margin seen in the private rental sector and any financial supports provided by the State or local authorities.  With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, this would mean that many households on moderate incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case.  The rents will obviously depend upon the overall cost of each development and will vary according to the site and design specifics.  However, my Department has identified several factors that can put downward pressure on costs and make cost rental more affordable for tenants.  These include: low to zero land costs; a design approach with value engineering and long-term maintenance in mind; and capital subvention to individual developments through the serviced site fund.</p><p>More competitive rental levels under the model can also be supported by accessing low-cost, stable finance that is paid back over an extended period of time.  This long-term financing has, for example, been accessed via the European Investment Bank, EIB.  A pilot cost rental project is currently on site in Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, County Dublin.  It involves a collaboration involving the Department, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Housing Agency, approved housing bodies, Respond and Tuath, and the Housing Finance Agency.  Launched by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, earlier this month, it comprises 155 homes, a community facility, along with green spaces and car parking, some of which is underground.  The 155 homes will include 50 cost rental units, all of which will be two-bedroom apartments.  It is anticipated that at &euro;1,200, rents for these units will be significantly below the market rates for the area.  We want to get that price even lower but compared with the current asking price for rents, it is approximately &euro;600 or &euro;700 less.  Under cost rental and as we roll this model out, we should be able to achieve greater results when it comes to the costs.</p><p>While the cost rental element of this project is relatively small in scale, at approximately 50 units, it will act as the first example of how this model can work in an Irish context.  We know it has worked very well in other countries and we want it to work well here also.  It will provide us with invaluable lessons when designing a larger-scale system.  It will help to shape the contractual model and specifications for future larger-scale projects we hope to roll out across the country in years to come.</p><p>The second cost rental pilot project will be delivered on a Dublin City Council-owned site at St. Michael's Estate, Emmet Road, Inchicore.  It is estimated that this site can accommodate more than 470 homes in a high-quality mixed tenure development.  The current tenure mix as agreed with the Department will be 70% cost rental and 30% social.</p><p>In addition to these pilot programmes, the Land Development Agency is examining the potential to deliver cost rental homes at scale from its land portfolio and the broader State land bank at sites such as the former Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, and Shanganagh, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p><p>To this end, a working group has been established within my Department, in conjunction with the Land Development Agency, the Housing Agency and other expert bodies.  This group is developing a policy framework for the broader cost rental model to be used on those sites and other sites also.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is determining how a sustainable financial structure can be established to commence the delivery of units at the scale required to get this new category of housing off the ground.  The work of this group has been assisted by a consultancy and research project undertaken by the European Investment Bank on our behalf.  Everyone is very committed to making this model work and ensuring that it will be adapted to the Irish situation.</p><p>The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, is designed specifically to address housing supply which is a crucial factor in moderating house prices.  In addition to supporting the provision of private housing at market prices, LIHAF will support more than 2,300 affordable homes on mainly publicly owned lands, while 5,600 affordable homes will benefit from the LIHAF related cost reduction.  Some of these homes have already come on stream.  This is where there is private land beside public land and the infrastructure naturally accesses both.  The new Home Building Finance Ireland initiative provides finance at commercially competitive rates to developers with sites ready to go but which are experiencing difficulty in obtaining funding.  This will also contribute to the increased supply of new homes, including homes at more affordable price levels to buy and to rent.  In the first seven months of operation, &euro;41 million in funding has been approved under the initiative which will deliver 228 homes across seven sites. </p></speech>

I apologise for that.  We can get copies and if there is a specific problem, I can go back over the relevant issue.</p> <p>Under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, low to moderate income families drew down over 1,000 fixed interest loans through local authorities by the end of June 2019.  There are a number of applications in the system and funding has been allocated to deal with any application that is approved in the months ahead.  In addition, the help-to-buy scheme, which is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and assists first-time buyers to secure the deposit necessary to purchase a new-build home, has seen some 14,000 applications approved to date.  That is a very successful scheme.  I have heard criticism and misinterpretation of it.  At the start of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan, and in the year after that, many first-time buyers could not put a deposit together to help them draw down a mortgage so the market was not providing first-time buyer homes or building them at scale because there were not enough people in a position to buy them.  The help-to-buy scheme was designed to enable people to have tax paid over the years refunded to help them put together a deposit to get a mortgage.  That has worked out well.  The market has responded by building many more first-time homes and over 14,000 people have successfully availed of the scheme.</p> <p>The strategic management of key potential regeneration sites, many of which are owned by public bodies, is a key way Government will drive the implementation of Project Ireland 2040.  The Land Development Agency, LDA, was established on an interim basis under secondary legislation, but primary legislation to underpin the basis of the agency is being drafted with pre-legislative scrutiny scheduled for the coming weeks.  That legislation will work its way through both Houses of the Oireachtas too and we can discuss it further then.  The agency is a commercial State body and national centre of expertise which works with and supports local authorities, public bodies and other interests to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.  It will provide a new implementation mechanism for Project Ireland 2040 and the transformation of our cities and towns.  It will also strategically manage public lands and achieve public policy objectives, including the delivery of more housing in the locations that need it most and focusing on affordability.</p> <p>The LDA has an immediate focus on managing the State's lands to develop new homes and regenerate underutilised sites and has access to an initial tranche of eight sites across the country that have near-term delivery potential for 3,000 new homes.  Of these, at least 40% are intended for delivery as additional social and affordable homes and the balance as additional new supply to meet the high levels of demand in the wider housing sector.  That is on large sites.  The Government does not believe it is right to put only social housing on large sites and possibly have 3,000 houses of one type of tenure.  We believe in the mixed tenure approach, with social, affordable and private housing, and we believe that works quite well.  I am very conscious that others have a different view but we hold a strong view on that and any developments we do now will have that blend or mix of housing.  That is a better approach than that taken in the past when all the social housing was in one area and private housing in another part of town.  That is not acceptable and it is not the right way to develop good communities.  Significant preparatory work is under way for these sites and it is envisaged that construction activity will commence on the first homes in mid-2020 for delivery by the end of that year, pending grant of planning permissions.</p> <p>The LDA is also developing a strong pipeline of additional publicly-owned sites.  Departments were requested, in respect of lands they own directly and owned by agencies under their aegis, to identify additional lands over and above the initial eight sites.  The development of LDA managed lands will make a substantial contribution to the achievement of wider Government targets for housing delivery in general and social housing specifically.  We are aware of sites owned by other Departments such as the Departments of Health and Education and Skills.  It is right to facilitate their moving that land to the LDA to be developed in a proper way in line with our plans.   </p> <p>To enable more delivery of social and affordable homes on public lands, the Government, in parallel with the establishment of the LDA, approved a new public land affordability requirement.  Under this requirement, a minimum of 30% of any housing developed must be reserved for affordable purpose in addition to the 10% statutory social housing requirement under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, whether such development is being progressed by the LDA or any other market operator.  Furthermore, public bodies, such as local authorities and the Housing Agency, engaging with the LDA in respect of their lands will also be in a position to condition the release of lands for development reflecting their own policy requirements.  Therefore, complying with the Government's new public lands affordability requirement, the LDA will be capable of progressing a significant level of both affordable purchase scheme-based projects and cost rental-based projects on lands forming part of its portfolio of sites.  They will make a rather large contribution in the years to come.  It is a pity a land development agency was not set up many years ago to work in conjunction with local authorities to develop publicly owned lands. </p> <p>The topics I have spoken about reflect some of the innovative, proactive and intensive work that has been advancing under Rebuilding Ireland.  The Government is keenly aware that much progress remains to be made on all fronts to restore stability and sustainability in the housing sector.  Securing homes for all persons experiencing homeless and ensuring that any stay in emergency accommodation is as brief as possible and delivered in a setting that is appropriate to the needs of the householder or individual remain urgent priorities.  In parallel, we will continue to advance on social housing deliver, affordability, cost rental and to harness the expertise and capacity of the LDA and the local authorities to maximise positive outcomes for State inputs in terms of finance and land.  The State was not sufficiently involved in managing land and housing supply in the past.  That is why we did not have a sustainable housing construction sector.  I will not go into all the problems that has caused but I believe we are coming out the other side.  We have to ensure that cannot happen again.  If we manage and develop our land properly and if we plan using the planning framework and other plans that will supersede it and stick to those plans to deliver approximately 30,000 or 35,000 houses every year for the next 20 or 25 years, that will be one way to future-proof the country from the points of view of housing and land use needs and to ensure we are in a position to deal with the 1 million increase in our population over the next 20 years, and no doubt more thereafter.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak on housing today.  While I welcome the news that finally, after I have been fighting for it from the start, Carlow has been designated a rent pressure zone.  However, it is not good news that rents in Carlow have reached such dizzy heights that it qualifies to be placed on the rent pressure zone list.  While it is widely known that the Government has more leaks than a colander, the market sensitive information about these new classifications was leaked before the official announcement.</p> <p>It is not good news that there are now 42 rent pressure zones in Ireland.  This is not working and this Government is not being radical enough to ensure rent affordability.  We need more radical thinking and that is something quite a few people agree with me on.  Every three months, a report is issued on the areas that qualify to be added to the list of rent pressure zones.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A few months ago, Graiguecullen qualified as a rent pressure zone but Carlow did not.  Now Carlow has qualified, along with Graiguecullen, but Bagenalstown and Tullow do not qualify.  It cannot work because neighbouring towns do not meet the criteria.  The Minister of State needs to address this.  If Carlow qualifies then neighbouring towns such as Tullow and Bagenalstown should also meet the criteria.</p><p>I have repeatedly raised the issue that the threshold to qualify for social housing is far too low.  In Carlow, the threshold to qualify for the housing list is &euro;27,500.  A review was to be done eight years ago.  The Department has gone to and fro to tell me it is working on it.  After eight years, when will the review take place to change the threshold for the local authority?  Of the 31 local authorities, Carlow has one of the lowest thresholds.  The threshold in the neighbouring county of Kilkenny is more than &euro;30,000 as is the case in Kildare and Wicklow.  People are failing to qualify for the housing list and they are struggling.</p><p>I want to raise the very controversial issue of property tax.  In recent weeks, local authorities throughout Ireland have been voting on property tax.  Rural counties left behind on capital funding have had to raise the tax while places such as Dublin have been able to reduce the tax.  This all comes down to the funding allocated to local authorities, which is grossly unfair to rural Ireland.  I have said before, and I will say it again, that we cannot all live and work in Dublin.  We cannot all reach into the pockets of the hard pressed homeowners in rural Ireland for more money because they are unfairly marginalised due to the funding.  These people are the reason we have an economic recovery because they are working and already paying taxes.  They do not feel they get value for money from the State and this is a problem.  Will the Minister of State answer this?  The Minister, Deputy Murphy, is going to Carlow tomorrow.  I have asked to meet him because Carlow's capital funding is so low it is unreal.  It is unfair.  The Minister of State gave a very good brief on Rebuilding Ireland but 80% of it was about Dublin.  This is unacceptable.</p><p>It is no secret that we are in the worst of times.  We have chaos and uncertainty looming next month with Brexit.  Our young people are on the streets.  At this stage, everyone is taking to the streets.  Fine Gael has overseen a fall in home ownership to the lowest level in half a century.  With rents at eye-watering levels a whole generation cannot save to own their home.  New rent pressure zones will not stop this, especially in the way they are being announced.  We now have more vulnerable households at risk of homelessness than ever and there are those in hidden homelessness, living in overcrowded situations and sharing bedrooms.  So many people are still trying to avoid not being on the streets.  I cannot see a massive change.</p><p>This morning, we had a meeting about the future of affordable housing bodies.  Fine Gael scrapped affordable units and shared ownership in 2012 and only reintroduced them in the budget for 2019 after we put pressure.  We are now in a situation when there may very well come a day when we run out of money to build social and affordable housing.  Everyone is flagging this.  This morning, we spoke about approved housing bodies, local authority housing and building housing.  There is an issue when it comes to funding and the Minister is aware of this.</p><p>The followers of the woman who runs the Instagram page cheapIrishhouses have quadrupled in a short space of time because everyone is looking for a home they can afford.  Many of the houses are in less populated counties.  Some need refurbishment and others more serious renovation.  There is an appetite in Ireland for people to own their own homes but people cannot afford to do so because they cannot get the credit or money is not available.  I have long been a champion of allowing credit unions to facilitate small mortgages, which the banks do not seem to be in the business of giving.  We need to actively support home ownership by emphasising affordable homes, enabling the purchase of homes and, while we do so, ensuring that we enable local authorities and approved housing bodies to build social housing.  We might look at these cheap Irish houses and derelict houses not appearing on the vacant property database and, perhaps, ways to incentivise buying second-hand homes.  Judging by this woman's page, there are a whole lot of them out there.  It is unreal.  The Minister of State should have a look at it.</p><p>The State should play a greater role in supporting home ownership through affordable homes, help with deposits, shared ownership schemes and a reformed mortgage market.  We need solutions to the problems of the decline in home ownership.  Fianna F&aacute;il has shown its commitment to finding meaningful solutions through our role in the confidence and supply agreement and not shirking from leading criticism of the Government where it is at fault.  We are certainly kept out of the loop when it comes to leaks.  Even the Department is kept out of the loop.  Home ownership is slipping away from an entire generation as house prices have increased by 84% while wages have only increased by 10% since 2012.  Our 68% home ownership rate is the lowest since 1971 and is now behind the EU average.  People are using social media to find ways to own a home.  People are crossing the street to rent in a rent pressure zone, putting more pressure on the supply.  Thousands are on housing lists throughout the country.  We need to reshape all the announcements into positive action.</p><p>As I have told the Minister of State on several occasions, I firmly believe that local authorities building houses on their own land is crucial.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position on mortgages?  He said there is money for local authority mortgages.  I have received various answers on what the Minister of State has said today.  I represent a lot of people-----</p></speech>

If people go on holidays nobody replaces them.  If somebody is out sick they are not replaced.  The staff are worn out.  Unless we go back to staffing local authorities such as Carlow County Council we will not do the public or anyone any favour.  We need more staff.  We have great staff but they are not able to cope.  It is unfair that people who are out sick or on holidays are not replaced.  It is a huge issue.  It is probably the case in all local authorities but Carlow County Council is put to the pin of its collar and the Minister of State needs to look at it.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State and I ask him to come back to me with the answers to my questions.  I do not receive the same answers consistently when I deal on a daily basis with people coming to me with local authority issues, such as housing, mortgages, windows, doors and grants.  There is a hold-up on money and the Minister of State needs to clarify it.  He can announce it and tell me it is there but when I go to the local authority I could be told it is coming but that I will not get it for three or six months.  Sometimes it does not work.  We have a long way to go.</p></speech>

Let us talk about housing and the gross inequality that exists in this country.  A couple of weeks ago, we saw an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>about a house in Foxrock bought for &euro;2.4 million where the purchasers have sought permission to demolish it and rebuild a five-bedroomed house on the site.  This is what is going on among the wealthy in this country.  They can afford to lash out &euro;2.4 million for a house.  I know the house well because it was my brother's, who is sadly deceased.  I know the house and I know the love and care that went into developing and building it.  To think it will be razed to the ground to build another house just to get one extra bedroom is beyond me.</p><p>Let us look at the situation with young couples.  I know a young couple who have spent &euro;97,000 over seven years on rent.  Where are they to find a deposit?  Where are they to manage to put aside a few bob to build or purchase a house?  My colleague spoke about the policy being Dublin-centric.  The truth of the matter is that a massive number of young people in this town are working and living in the most appalling conditions because they simply cannot afford the rent and will never be able to buy a house.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I went through the income and wider finances of the young couple I speak of, and they could well afford a two-bedroom or even three-bedroom apartment in some parts of Dublin at a smaller cost than their current rent.  There is something terribly wrong when we are enhancing private ownership at the cost of ordinary working people.  We must find a way, even if it means the State should come up with an idea like providing a deposit so a young couple could repay that deposit to the State and their mortgage at the same time.  It would at least get them out of a rented apartment and make that property available.</p><p>I raised with the Minister of State with responsibility for Defence the number of married quarters in the likes of Cathal Brugha Barracks and the Curragh that could be brought back into use.  I advised at the time that Cluid would be willing to refurbish the properties and put families into them, thereby releasing properties in places like Dublin, Cork and the Curragh.  I am not sure about Limerick, Kilkenny or Donegal.  There are properties that could be refurbished and brought back into service.  It has not happened because there is a cross-departmental problem.  The Minister of State cannot do anything about the Department of Defence, and that Department has a policy position that it will not have married quarters.  A housing agency is willing to take these off the State's hands - it could sell them to the agency for &euro;1 - and it could refurbish the properties.  That agency could return the houses to soldiers.</p><p>I refer to teachers, nurses and garda&iacute;.  I was a soldier and my wife was a nurse when we got married, and we had not tuppence to rub together.  We were able to buy a house by means of a mortgage nonetheless.  It is just not possible for young professional people to do it now.  The Minister of State has referred to the mix of social, affordable and private dwellings.  I grew up in Galway city and there we had Shantalla, Bohermore and Mervue as local authority areas.  The finest of people grew up in those places and they qualified as the likes of craftsmen, fitters, mechanics, teachers or doctors.  They have fought hard to buy those properties and remain in the communities in which they grew up.  There is absolutely no sense in what goes on in parts of Dublin, where one house was sold for &euro;500,000 to accommodate one family in order to ensure a mix of social and affordable housing in what was a private estate.  That is beyond belief.</p><p>I do not get involved with local politics so I only know what people tell me.  I do not hold clinics or anything like that.  A neighbour told me she is renting a house in Sandyford that is subsidised by the local authority but the cost is &euro;1,700.  It was a local authority house and was sold for &euro;72,000 or &euro;73,000 to the original renters and subsequently sold for more than &euro;300,000 before being bought for close to &euro;600,000.  How have we allowed this to happen?  I am not saying it is this Government's fault as it inherited much of this problem.  Do not think for one minute I am blaming Fine Gael, the Labour Party or anybody else.  I am talking about a system that has been allowed to develop.  We must go back to the drawing board and somebody must take control of the people who make these provisions or advise Ministers on policy changes.  There is no reason we cannot have local authority areas, provided we are willing to put in the required services.</p><p>I remember my father, God be good to him, telling me about when they built the Shantalla estate.  If a piece of timber arrived on the site with a knot in it, the clerk of works sent it back.  They were the finest-built houses in Galway at the time and the same was true of Mervue.  I have first-hand knowledge of people in Moyross and Southill in Limerick, which are great communities that have been destroyed by a few thugs.  That was a policing rather than a housing issue.  The issues that have led to this desire for a mix of social and affordable housing mean it is not necessarily being driven for the benefit of families.  Social housing systems broke down because we did not police them properly.  Moyross is a classic case in point and I know the Minister of State has been there.  There was no shop within walking distance of Moyross when it was built.  It was a massive site but there were no supports.  From that perspective, it was a disgrace.</p><p>I visited Dresden recently with the German chamber of commerce.  I was absolutely amazed by the housing co-operative system they have in place.  When East Germany joined West Germany, there was a horrendous housing crisis in Dresden and they started the co-operative.  I invite the Minister of State to look at it.  It is now a housing and farming co-operative and it builds roads; it is an amazing system.  A member of the co-operative pays the monthly rent but ultimately, he or she can pass on the property.  It gives the best of both worlds.  The people with me in Dresden were bankers and the first thing they said at the briefing was that the model would work in Ireland.  If I had a site in the morning, I have an architect but I would need a builder.  I would not want to make money from it but-----</p></speech>

The bottom line is there are things at which we should be looking but we are not.  I have tried to support the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, all along.  I have said that we cannot start a giant stalled ship in five minutes and it takes time to do it.  I am nonetheless getting very tired of promises.  I get distressed looking at people who can afford to pay a mortgage but who cannot get one.</p> <p>I have a family member who will lose her house to a bank because the equity in the house was taken by a partner who disappeared with the money in his pocket.  The banks go after the asset rather than the money.  Do not talk to me about bankers as I could speak from now until Christmas about them.</p> <p>I draw the Minister of State's attention to the red tape matter raised at Dublin City Council recently.  Under the current process, local authorities seeking to build social housing worth more than &euro;2 million must go through a four-stage process with the Department known as the cost-effectiveness analysis.  This includes the approval for the design expenditure, approval to proceed with planning, approval to proceed to tender and approval of the tender window.  The target time for the completion of the process is 59 weeks and according to the Department, its approach process accounted for 15 of the 59 weeks for getting social housing construction under way.  It was reported that Dublin City Council hired a panel of suitable consultants to assist staff in compiling these reports.  Fianna F&aacute;il, for its part, stated it wants the threshold raised from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million, and according to the Minister, it would save six to eight weeks in the process.  We would still be talking about a year to get houses through the system.</p> <p>I could go on but I know the Minister of State has more access to these issues than I do.  How long is the site in Shanganagh there now?  Is it 15 years?  How long is the site in Cherrywood there?  For God's sake, people can put systems in place that can build houses rapidly.  Rapid-build houses are taking a year to construct.  I brought the Minister of State to see a system that can build a house in a couple of months so can we please change our thinking?  I know the Minister of State is trying to do some good work.</p></speech>
