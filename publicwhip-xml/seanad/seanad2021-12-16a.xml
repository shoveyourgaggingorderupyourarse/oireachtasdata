He is aware of its importance.  I welcome my fellow county man, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Feighan, to the House to reply on this matter.  I know he has a good interest in it.</p> <p>We have to consider the importance of this issue throughout the health sector.  University Hospital Galway, UHG, is the western regional centre for neurology.  However, it is short of neurology nurse specialists.  Patients are waiting longer for diagnosis and treatment.  National and international guidelines recommend that, on the basis of catchment area, there should be 13 neurology nurse specialists in this region but there are only four of them.  Investing in more neurology nurses is a cost-efficient way of improving the efficiency of outpatient clinics, reducing waiting times and ensuring patients have access to the specialist support they need to manage their conditions.  Patients who have access to neurology nurses have reported an improved sense of involvement in their care and being more prepared for tests and investigations.  The provision of more neurology nurses will ensure that patients get quicker access to outpatient therapy, reducing waiting lists and ensuring any deterioration in the health status of patients can be mitigated.  This will also ensure that additional hospital resources can be focused on those who need them.  </p> <p>I fully support the campaign of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland for 100 extra neurology nurse specialists, of whom nine will be for Galway.  We should take note of all the areas of health that are related to neurology, such as epilepsy, head trauma, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, headaches related to migraine, muscular dystrophy and other disorders, particularly those relating to the spine.  There are 700,000 people in Ireland affected by neurological issues.  The Minister of State may have some good news for me.  I am very interested in appointments to UHG.  I will speak about Cork University Hospital, CUH, in a moment.  I particularly want to know about the clinical nurse neurology paediatric position, the paediatric neurodevelopmental position and the clinical nurse specialist dealing with neurology and headaches.  The Minister of State may not have that specific information for me today.  If he does not, I hope he will be able to provide it to me in the near future.  </p> <p>I refer to the west and north-west regions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a population of almost 600,000 people and University Hospital Galway is the centre of neurology to deal with that whole area.  Some of the people campaigning for this have made the point to me that an additional nurse, who could talk to patients on the phone, can often talk a patient who is suffering from neurological issues through his or her circumstances and he or she may not need a hospital visit.</p><p>It is crucial we address this issue and that we seek better neurological services throughout the country for the many people who need them.  I thank the Minister of State for attending.  I hope he will have some good news for me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#B00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue and giving me the opportunity to update the House on the matter.  Neurology nurse specialists play an important role in triaging, assessing and providing ongoing support to neurological patients, as the Senator outlined, which in turn builds capacity within neurological services and allows for more timely access to efficient, equitable and high-quality care for patients.</p> <p>The national clinical programme for neurology, in conjunction with the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, completed an all-Ireland survey of neurological services in 2020.  The survey highlighted that, although all neurological centres have access to a designated clinical nurse specialist or an advanced nurse practitioner, the total number of neurology nurses specialists is significantly below what is recommended in international guidelines.  The national programme recognises the need to address this deficit to ensure the provision of efficient and timely care.  An additional 16 clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners have been sought for 2022 for different specialities in hospital groups.  While a decision on funding is awaiting finalisation in respect of the HSE service plan, the additional posts sanctioned will initially address the areas of greatest geographical inequity and the sub-specialties most in need.  Plans to increase incrementally the overall number of neurology nurse specialists will then be developed to address the remaining needs.</p> <p>The national clinical programme for neurology recognises the value skilled and highly trained nursing staff add to the neurological services and has endeavoured to endorse this by focusing its current work streams and initiatives on nurse-led clinics, nurse liaison services and outreach programmes.  Examples of this include the headache programme and the epilepsy outreach programme, both of which are funded under the Sl&aacute;intecare innovation fund.  These programmes involve the reconfiguration of the management of these conditions, enabling clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners to lead and co-ordinate the care of these conditions in the community.  This reduces the reliance on consultant neurologists and tertiary services, in turn reducing waiting lists, allowing more timely access to service and improving the overall quality of care, as the Senator outlined.</p> <p>In regard to the catchment area of University Hospital Galway, Saolta University Health Care Group has advised that the current cohort of permanent neurology nurses in the hospital, which includes two advanced nurse practitioners, will be augmented by a further three appointments in 2022.  The Senator asked about a few other appointments, and if he wishes, I will follow up with the Minister for Health or the Department.</p></speech>

That is good news about University Hospital Galway.  While it will not go the whole way, it will certainly make improvements, with three new appointments in 2022, I hope those appointments will happen in early 2022.  I understand that, in the context of some of these matters, filling the position the nurse is leaving will be the issue.  He or she may be ready to come into the neurological service but filling the position is an issue.  Obviously, a person cannot be taken out of where they are working if there is not someone else to fill it.</p> <p>I asked the Minister of State about a few specifics, which I probably should not have done because I did not give him advance notice.  I appreciate his commitment to reverting to me on those matters.</p> <p>Excellent work is done in Dublin and Cork in neurological services.  Nevertheless, Cork University Hospital, for example, deals with a population of 1.5 million.  The recommended outpatient waiting time should be six weeks but I am told the actual time is 18 months to two years.  The recommended number of neurology nurse specialists in that area is 20.  Overall, we need more neurology nurses.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State and appreciate him taking the matter.</p></speech>

The 2020 survey of neurological services highlighted that the total number of neurology nurse specialists needs to be increased to reach the levels recommended in international guidelines.  It is planned additional posts will come on stream incrementally and the areas of the greatest need will be addressed first.  The commitment of the national clinical programme for neurology to meeting the needs of patients is illustrated by proposed appointments such as those planned for University Hospital Galway, which the Senator welcomed.</p> <p>The commitment of the Government to the provision of quality health services in University Hospital Galway is further underlined by the development projects under way there, including a new radiation oncology unit costing &euro;56 million and the development of a temporary but substantial emergency department, ED, building in advance of the provision of a new emergency department and a women's and children's block.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#B00600"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  He may very well know that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 ensures animals are given pain relief before procedures are carried out that could cause them pain and distress.  There are two issues to note about that.  The first is it is a matter of legislation, not of being left to medical experts, and the second is that yesterday, during the debate on the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) (Foetal Pain Relief) Bill 2021, which was brought before the Oireachtas, the Government tabled an amendment to delay or prevent its progression.  The line coming from the Government is that it is a matter that should be left to clinical guidelines.</p><p>I think that is horrendous, particularly when one considers that all the <i>dramatis personae</i>of recent years who pushed for change to our abortion laws, such as Dr. Peter Boylan, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and all those organisations, have been completely silent on the question of precautionary pain relief.  There can be only one explanation for that, namely, for those who see abortion as something desirable in the law, anything that suggests the humanity of the unborn child is to be avoided, even if that involves cruelty.  That is a desperate situation and it cries out for legal remedy.</p><p>That is why it is vital that, in the context of the three-year review to take place of the abortion legislation, there be a strictly independent chairperson, not somebody, in the words of the Department of Health official, Ms Geraldine Luddy, appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health last week, with and a sexual-and-reproductive-rights approach.  That is code for buy-in to abortion.  We are talking about a three-year review of abortion legislation, legislation which many people in this country oppose.  Indeed, even some people who voted for repeal of the eighth amendment would think it goes too far in certain key respects.  There has to be strict independence here; there cannot be thought control about this issue.  That is why last week I recommended it be a judge or a retired judge.  None of us is neutral on the subject of abortion - it is a life-and-death issue - but somebody such as a judge, who has had to make a career out of striving for neutrality and impartiality, might be best placed to chair this review.  That is vital.</p><p>I have heard the Minister for Health make the point the policy has been decided and the legislation will not change but rather that this review is about examining the workings of the legislation.  A closed-minded approach such as that, however, is never taken when there is a three-year review.  The reason for a three-year review is to see whether anything in the legislation is counter-productive or is not working.  What is working from some people's point of view will mean it does not sufficiently facilitate abortion, but for other people, what is not working is that, for example, it has led to a dramatic increase in the number of abortions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We know that to be the case, with 13,000 over the last two years.  That is way in excess of the annual rates before it was legalised.  This is something we did not know before, although many of us warned about that point in advance of the advent of legislation, and it must be relevant to a review.  </p><p>Pre-eminently, though, I refer to something like pain relief and the case for precautionary pain relief in light of what the science now appears to be telling us about the capacity of the unborn child to feel pain in the context of later-term abortions.  This aspect must be among the subjects to be reviewed.  In circumstances where the Minister has not so far engaged with anybody who would regard themselves as a defender of the welfare of the unborn in this situation - and the Minister gave me a private verbal commitment that he would engage but we will have to see what that means - what is more important is that there be an independent chair of this review committee who will, as a matter of professionalism and determination, engage with all sides and not just with those who are happy with the abortion law and those who want more facility for abortion in this country, but also with those who wish to protect the unborn.</p><p>Therefore, this is not just an issue of life and death.  It is a matter of fundamental human decency.  In the reply from the Minister of State, I hope the Government will give a commitment that the chair of this review will be strictly independent and that means independent on the subject of abortion, as far as that is possible.</p></speech>

A review clause was included in the Act to facilitate monitoring of the impact, operation and effectiveness of the legislation in practice, as well as of the delivery of services in this area.  The Minister for Health commenced the review of the Act on 8 December 2021.  Phase 1 of the review will capture information on the operation of the Act from the perspective of women who access the service, health professionals who deliver the service and the public.  Later, it may also include service users and service providers.  Phase 2 of the review will be led by an independent chair.  Senator Mullen pointed out that the Minister had given him a private verbal commitment that will be an independent chair.</p></speech>

The chair of the review will also draw on the findings of other relevant peer-reviewed research and consult further with stakeholders, as necessary, before providing conclusions and any recommendations to the Minister in 2022.</p> <p>For the review to be effective, it must find out whether the legislation provided access to termination of pregnancy services in practice to those who wish to avail of them.  In this regard, independent research exploring women&rsquo;s experiences of termination of pregnancy services and gathering their views on how the system has operated since 1 January 2019 will be essential.  </p> <p>Information from service providers will supply the second key strand for the review.  Here, we will need to gather the views of those involved in providing termination of pregnancy services in community and acute settings in Ireland.  A tender for this research was issued on the eTenders website last week.  </p> <p>It will also be important to include, as the third strand of the review, an opportunity for members of the public, special interest groups or any other interested parties to submit their views for consideration in the review process.  This will be achieved through a public consultation process, and that was launched on the Department of Health&rsquo;s website on 8 December.  That aspect will run until April 2022.</p> <p>I am pleased that a review of the Act has commenced, and I assure the Senator that the Minister is aware of the need to appoint a chair who will conduct this work thoroughly and efficiently in a fair and transparent manner.</p></speech>

In everything said by the Minister of State, there was not a single concession to the idea I referred to.  It was all about consulting first with service providers and those who avail of the service.  No mention was made of medical people who have a conscientious objection or of scientific and other experts who have concerns about the impact of this legislation in respect of rising numbers of abortions, issues around pain relief and questions concerning promoting positive alternatives to abortion.  There was nothing of that nature.</p> <p>All that is being hived off to just some general consultation with the public heading.  That really shows the contempt that the Government has for the unborn child and for those who would defend his or her welfare, even within the context of an abortion regime.  That is truly tragic.  There was not a word there that acknowledged that there is any expert concern about the impact of the abortion law on unborn children.  That is an utterly tragic situation.  A review should not just be about looking at whether the objectives of the Act have been met.  It should, and always is in these cases, also be concerned with looking at whether any aspect of the Act is counterproductive.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State, personally, and others listening to make their views known to the Government, because clearly it is not interested in authentic independence on this issue.</p></speech>

He has commenced a review of the Act in line with the statutory and Government commitments.  The review of the operation and effectiveness of the Act gives us an opportunity to hear the views of all those involved and, most particularly, those of service users and service providers.  I am confident that the information which will be gathered during the review on the operation of the 2018 Act will provide us with evidence of how to proceed in future to continue to ensure that the service mandated by the people in May 2018 is operating effectively.</p> <p>I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s concerns to the Minister regarding the appointment of an independent chair to lead the review who has the necessary expertise and ability to carry out the work in an objective manner.  I assure the Senator that implementing the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 and ensuring access to services under the Act remains a priority for the Department of Health.</p></speech>

Dental services in Ireland are exempt from VAT in accordance with EU legislation.  This is vitally important, because dental treatment should be cost-effective and it should be provided at a cost that does not prohibit public or private patients from availing of it.  A new interpretation by the Revenue Commissioners, however, concerning fees paid by associate dentists to principal dentists, threatens to undermine Ireland&rsquo;s dental scheme entirely and to cause many problems for dental practices and the patients who use those practices regularly.</p> <p>Many fear that the increased costs which will be incurred by dentists from having to apply an additional charge in respect of VAT at 23% will result in people putting off visits to their dentist or simply not going at all because they cannot afford to do so.  A VAT increase of 23% will mean higher costs for dentists and patients.  Dental practices across Ireland will be impacted, but particularly those in the Border region where I come from.  They already face stiff competition from dentists in Northern Ireland, because a 23% VAT rate is not charged there.  </p> <p>Approximately 300 dentists practising across the Border region are directly threatened by the imposition of this VAT rate.  All of them will be subject to increased costs and some consideration must be given to the impact this development will have on ordinary people and the increased costs they will end up paying for their dental care.  This situation also has serious implications for the future of many dental practices.  An added VAT liability of 23% would have enormous economic implications and consequences for the viability of dental practices in the Border region that compete, as I said earlier, with dentists in Northern Ireland.  This is an issue that would affect dentists across the entire Republic of Ireland, where access to dental care is already at crisis level.</p> <p>Representatives of the Irish dental sector maintain that it is already in a state of crisis.  At present, the medical card system in this regard, the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, operated by dentists for the HSE, is losing participating dentists daily at a significant rate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The latest figures suggest there are fewer than 700 dentists operating a scheme that caters for 1.5 million medical cardholders.  This equates to more than 2,000 patients per dentist.  If a VAT liability is applied to dentists there would be widespread closures of dental practices and a further decline in the service to the public.  I am disappointed to see that the HSE and the Department have failed to engage on the DTSS, which is a separate issue but it is connected to what I am talking about here this morning.</p><p>A recent survey carried out across 19 EU countries showed that none of them were charging VAT at 23% for dental services.  This also applies in the UK.  This issue needs to be looked at with a degree of urgency.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Chamber this morning to take this issue on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  I plead with the Minister of State that a meeting could be organised between the Irish Dental Association and the Minister to try to work out some solution to this problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#D00200"><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a VAT exemption applies to dental services provided to a patient by clinic, a principal dentist or an associate dentist, and this has not changed.  The supply of facilities to a dentist to enable him or her to carry out a dental practice, is subject to VAT, and this has always been the case.  Some dental practitioners operate a fee-sharing arrangement where a principal dentist provides a premises and other facilities to other dentists in exchange for a fee, and provision of such premises and other facilities constitute a service, which has always been subject to VAT.</p> <p>In summary, the exemption from VAT in respect of dental services relates only to a dental service provided to a patient.  The supply of premises and other facilities to a dentist in exchange for a consideration is not, and never has been, covered by the VAT exemption.  This approach is fully in line with the VAT directive, with which Irish law must comply.  Exemption from VAT for certain activities in the public interest are set out in Chapter 2 of Title IX of the directive, and these provisions are transposed into Irish legislation in Part 1, Schedule 1 to the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010, where paragraph 2 (5) of Schedule 1 provides for an exemption in respect of supply of professional dental services.  The legislation that transposes Article 132 of the directive, and Revenue's interpretation of the legislation, ensures that exemption from VAT to the supply of dental services is applied consistently in a manner that is not dependent on the legal form of the person supplying the service.  In accordance with the directive and the current jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, the VAT exemption applies to dental services provided by a clinic, a principal dentist, or by an associate dentist whose services are provided to a patient.</p> <p>I am aware that dental practitioners are seeking that the VAT exemption on dental services for patients would also apply to the supply of premises and facilities provided by one dentist to another.  Aside from the central legislative position that I have already outlined, there is also an issue of fairness in why such an approach would be inappropriate.  It is quite possible for a person other than a dental practitioner to provide some or all of these services to another dentist, and in such a case the supply of the services would be chargeable to VAT in the normal way.  Therefore, it would distort competition if the service were to be exempt solely on the basis that it was provided by a dental practitioner.  The EU principle of fiscal neutrality ensures that where economic operators are carrying on the same or closely related activities, then those operators should not be treated differently in relation to VAT.  I understand that Revenue has been clear at all times regarding the VAT treatment of dental fee-sharing arrangements, and has outlined its position in correspondence and meetings with the Irish Dental Association.</p> <p>With regard to the VAT applicable to the supply of dental services in Northern Ireland from 1 January 2021, Northern Ireland is no longer part of the EU in respect of the supply of services and is therefore no longer under the remit of the VAT directive in relation to those services.  The Senator has outlined an issue that is of concern with regard to the UK leaving the EU, which has created that anomaly as the Senator has rightly outlined.  I also represent a Border constituency.  The Senator has sought a meeting with the Minister and I will bring his concerns and those of the Irish Dental Association, back to the Minister.  It is an issue that has emerged over the past year and I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, this could have serious implications for dental practices along the Border areas in particular and for all of the citizens who live in those areas.  From my information, the European Court of Justice has made deliberations on this particular subject.  As I said in my earlier contribution, a recent survey showed that 19 EU countries do not charge VAT for dental practices, and the UK also does not charge VAT.  It puts Ireland in an awkward position and many dental practices in a very bad position.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could use his good offices to arrange a meeting with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Irish Dental Association to tease through the issues.  The Irish Dental Association has serious concerns and would like the Minister for Finance to listen to those concerns.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, could facilitate a meeting on their behalf.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners are also satisfied that the correct interpretation of the legislation has been communicated to the Irish Dental Association consistently since they first raised this issue in 2018.  When a person or group is not satisfied with the response from the Revenue Commissioners they can raise the matter with the Tax Appeals Commission, whose role it is to adjudicate, hear and determine appeals against the decisions or determinations of the Revenue Commissioners concerning taxes and duties.</p> <p>With regard to the situation in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, unfortunately a different tax or VAT regime applies, and the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that there is no scope in the VAT directive to exempt the fees in question from VAT.  The Senator, however, has raised an issue that is unique in the Border area that has been accelerated over the past months.  Perhaps the Senator will write to me looking for a meeting with the Minister and I will seek to have that meeting.</p></speech>

Senator Lombard and I put down this matter for the Commencement to outline Fine Gael's view on the agriculture industry, the agrifood sector and, in particular, young farmers.  It has been Fine Gael's policy as long as it has been in government, for as long as I can remember anyway, that we have been very supportive of the farming sector and young farmers especially.  I remember the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations in 2011 and 2012 when decisions were made to positively discriminate in favour of young farmers.  We recognise, as a party, the contribution that the agrifood sector makes to rural areas and towns in areas like mine in Tipperary.</p> <p>Very distressing comments were made by a Green Party MEP a week ago that have caused real fear within the agricultural community where I am from in Tipperary.  The comments were ill-informed and inappropriate and they have not been clarified by the leader of the Green Party either.  Will the Minister of State get the leader of the Green Party, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to clarify that the comments made by Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe are not Green Party policy, as if they are we will have bigger problems?  Will the Minister of State reassure farmers in my county in Tipperary that as long as Fine Gael is in government, we will support the agricultural sector, young farmers and the farming network?  We as a party recognise the contribution farming makes to communities like mine in Tipperary and the knock-on positive effect it has for rural towns.  Businesses are created on the back of a good agricultural industry and Fine Gael will support that for as long as we are in government.</p></speech>

The agricultural industry has never been under so much pressure.  There is a Climate Action Plan, a nitrates action programme, CAP reform and inputs of products have gone through the roof.  The farming community have never felt so berated.</p> <p>We are trying to generate a cohort of young people to get involved in farming but a Green Party MEP has lambasted them when speaking about investment.  It is a major issue for the industry and this Government.  If this MEP had such views on investment, why did he not say people in urban areas should not get motor loans?  Instead, he attacked the rural agricultural community, and it makes no sense.</p> <p>We must ensure our young farmers get involved in agriculture and that they will drive forward our economy and feed the world.  We produce enough food in this country for 50 million people.  A statement like this from an MEP was totally disrespectful and ill-informed.  We must have a statement from the Government this morning indicating it will support young farmers and their views because we have the best young farmers in the world and they are the best-trained young farmers in the world.  They do not go to agricultural college any more, they go to university.  We have farmers out there with PhDs because that is the standard of our farming community.  We need the Government to stand up and back these young trained farmers.  We need to dispel the fear that comes from a misinformed MEP who is just trying to play politics with this matter and damage rural Ireland in the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#E00400"><p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and I are ardent supporters of generational renewal and the need to support and encourage young farmers as a way of ensuring we have the best and brightest in the sector.  As outlined by the T&aacute;naiste in the D&aacute;il last week, people are entitled to their opinions and to write whatever letters they see fit but I and the Minister want to assure all farmers that Government policy is to support them in investing in their businesses to make them more economically and environmentally sustainable.  The Minister was once a young farmer and he knows how important access to credit is and farming is an exciting career option for so many.  We want to do all we can to encourage people into the sector.  In Boyle I have been a businessman and understood how important the farming sector was to my business and town as well.</p> <p>The challenge of generational renewal is widely recognised both at national and EU level, with the new CAP citing it as one of its nine key objectives.  Our own Food Vision 2030 also highlights the challenge and proposes a number of actions, including maintaining the strong level of current support, the promotion of land mobility and succession planning, and increased education.  This reflects the need to ensure a vibrant agriculture sector equipped with skilled and innovative young farmers to respond to societal demands for quality food and environmental public goods.</p> <p>There is a range of measures both in the existing CAP and at national level that support younger farmers.  There is the young farmers scheme, with payments of &euro;110 million benefitting over 8,000 farmers each year, and the national reserve, with &euro;35 million allocated since 2015, providing financial support to young farmers during the crucial early years of setting up a farm enterprise.  Additionally, under the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, Il young farmer capital investment scheme, young farmers can avail of a 60% grant rate and over &euro;133 million has been paid to over 5,000 farmers to date.  Support to young farmers is also provided under the collaborative farming grant scheme.  These partnership structures are further supported through the availability of a tax credit at national level to assist with the transfer of farms within succession farm partnerships, promoting and supporting the earlier transfer of family farms.</p> <p>In addition, strong taxation measures assist land mobility and facilitate succession and are worth approximately &euro;200 million to the sector per annum.  Long-term leasing income tax relief has been an important driver of land mobility by providing access to land and security of tenure for younger farmers and a route to retirement for older farmers.</p> <p>In terms of the new CAP strategic plan, CSP, the Minister has been actively engaging with stakeholders throughout the process of developing the new plan.  Under the current CSP proposals, Ireland will continue to implement the young farmers scheme with an increased allocation of approximately &euro;35 million per year to help young farmers establish their farming business.  Qualifying young farmers will be paid on a per hectare basis, which will be more advantageous to young farmers than the current system, which was linked to payment entitlements.  In tandem with this, we will also implement the national reserve in each year of the new CAP, along with maintaining a higher grant rate for qualified young farmers.  The CSP will also continue to provide support for collaborative farming and will propose innovative ways to advise older farmers on succession and retirement options, which will increase the availability of land for younger farmers.</p> <p>Access to finance is a crucial business need and as well as liaising with the main banks on issues relating to the agrifood sector, we work closely across government to provide important supports for businesses, including farmers.  Most recently this has been to ensure that they have access to finance during the pandemic and also to help deal with the challenges brought about by Brexit.  These supports have been delivered with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The future growth loan scheme was developed with assisting young farmers among its primary objectives and has been in great demand, with 1,296 loans to the value of &euro;156 million sanctioned to farmers.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that people are allowed to have individual opinions, and I have no problem with that, but they should not relay individual "facts" that are not true.  Is there any other sector that would see a high-profile politician write to a bank to say it should not give those people loans?  Could we imagine if somebody wrote to banks asking them not to give plumbers loans because it is not right?  It is just not acceptable and as far as I am concerned, it is an attack on rural Ireland and where I am from.  It is an attack on businesses and really good and progressive business people in the farming sector who want to support their local community.  They spend locally and everything goes back to the community.  It benefits Tipperary and all the towns around it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a disgrace that comments like that have not yet been clarified by his leader.</p></speech>

The farming community is facing a financial crisis.  Fertiliser prices have gone up by 300% in the past three months.  We are going to have a major issue from now until spring.  Farmers have been told to pay up front for fertiliser.  A senior politician stepped out and said that no money should be given to farmers.  We need the Government to stand up and say enough is enough.  We need to support the farming community.  It is under enough pressure as it is.  The media is fundamentally against the farming community on the majority of issues.  After a gap of eight months, RT&Eacute; has still not appointed a correspondent for agriculture.  We need to have a strong statement from the Government supporting young farmers and what they do for our society.</p></speech>

It is important not to understate the deep hurt and upset caused in what is a cornerstone of rural communities by the letter written by Mr. Cuffe.  It left farmers feeling unfairly targeted.  I acknowledge that Mr. Cuffe has since stated that he should not have singled out young farmers, which is welcome.  What we are asking farmers to do to achieve our climate targets in agriculture is not to carry out drastic or radical actions like herd cuts but to make gradual management changes on their farms that reduce emissions and increase carbon sinks while maintaining food production.  In some cases, this will require that they invest in their businesses.  Technologies such as low-emission slurry spreading, LESS, have significant benefits from a grass-growth perspective.  Given fertiliser prices ahead of spring, making the best use of organic manure will be more important than ever.  As the Senators know, the technologies involve a cost which is higher than that relating to less environmentally friendly options.  Farmers have shown an appetite to adopt the newer technologies.  In a few short years, we have gone from low levels to having more than one third of all slurry spread through LESS technology.  This is a testament to farmers' willingness to act.  It is up to the Government to support them in that.</p> <p>We have already outlined the various schemes and enhanced grant rates.  We are committed to ensuring that young farmers have a fair crack of the whip.  We have work to do.  Mr. Cuffe has since stated that he should not have singled out young farmers, which is welcome.  I thank the Senators for raising this vexed and important issue.</p></speech>

I have just received my booster vaccine and I feel relieved and privileged to have it.  I wish to put on the record my appreciation of the Minister of State, Deputy English, taking on board the very valid views of all the Members of this House yesterday and withdrawing the countermotion and supporting the motion Senator Alice-Mary Higgins tabled.</p> <p>I wish everybody a very happy Christmas on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group in the Seanad.  We wish all Members health, in particular, over the Christmas period.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and his office, the Leader and the Leader's office and, of course, Martin Groves and his office, the ushers, the terrific catering and cleaning staff and all of the backroom people who make sure that we can do our business as best we can.  I wish everybody health and a very good new year.</p> <p>I wish to raise a few items.  I have just come from a Joint Committee on Disability Matters meeting with Peter Tyndall.  I think it is one of his last appointments as Ombudsman.  He spoke about his report entitled Grounded - Unequal access for people with disabilities to personal transport schemes.  It was disturbing to hear about the report and its findings, in particular in regard to the motorised transport grant and the mobility allowance which the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government did away with in 2013, promising that something would be put in place.  It is almost nine years later but nothing has been put in place.  There seems to be a paralysis in terms of doing something.  People are being denied access to work and to education, the ability to shop for themselves and a social and a sporting life, because sport matters to people with disabilities as much as it does to all of us.  It is incumbent on all of us to ensure all Departments to prioritise this for 2022.</p> <p>I refer also to the Women of Honour group which has spoken recently about the Government's draft terms of reference for an independent review into allegations.  They are not happy with them and have sought a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who has said he will meet them.  It is important the victims' voices are to the fore in this process.  The review has to be transparent and thorough, and it must have the full confidence of those impacted.</p> <p>The last thing I will mention is the need for blood.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is under huge pressure because of people's illnesses and because of the storm.  It needs to stockpile 12,000 pints of blood before Christmas.  It is wrong that gay men in Ireland are essentially barred from giving blood.  A big shout out to everybody who can give blood to do so.</p></speech>

I wish everyone a healthy and happy Christmas.  We look forward to a more positive 2022 after what has been a difficult year.  We must remember those who passed away over the past 12 months.  A number of my colleagues have had bereavements over that period, as I had myself last year.  I extend our sympathies to them at Christmas, which can be a difficult time.</p> <p>In regard to the booster jab, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, announced an accelerated plan this morning.  I look forward to receiving my booster jab.  That is something I would recommend that everybody do.  It is important that message comes from these Houses and that we ask people to make sure they get the booster jab to help our healthcare staff in the work they have been doing.  I take this opportunity to thank our healthcare staff in all our hospitals, vaccination clinics and testing centres for the long hours and the hard work they have done over the past 12 months.</p> <p>I am looking forward to the setting up of a joint Oireachtas committee on autism.  I think it is on the agenda of the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight later today.  This is something I have been working on for probably 15 months, since I came into the House.  I am delighted to see that is going to happen.  More than 6,200 assessments of needs have been completed in 2021 as part of the progressing disability services, PDS, programme which has been rolled out by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  It is vital that we have a clear pathway for services for all children and that resources are used for the greatest benefit.  Assessment of need is a central part of this.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is an excellent Minister of State in that position.  From numerous discussions I have had with her, I can see many positive changes over the next 12 months.</p> <p>As we come into the Christmas period, or the last ten days of it, I urge people to shop local.  Shop in the local town and the local county.  The hospitality and entertainment sectors, in particular, have been most affected by the reintroduction of restrictions.  Buy a voucher for a show that might be on later in the year, or for a weekend or dinner out.  It is important we support those industries at this difficult time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that we support that industry at this difficult time.</p></speech>

I wish to express my gratitude for the politeness, courtesy and solid support those offices have given the Members of this House.  I speak on my own behalf and that of my colleagues in the Independent Group.</p><p>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business, which is to take the motion in my name and my colleagues' names, No. 91, motion 2, on the Order Paper immediately after No.1 without debate.  The motion states, &quot;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes the publication of the judgement of the Uyghur Tribunal on 9th December, 2021 and accepts its findings.&rdquo;  I have taken the unusual step - I do not do this normally - of circulating the report of the Uighur tribunal, which was established in London and sat for a considerable length of time assessing what has been done to the Uighur people and set out in detail the colossal litany of cultural and physical genocide, enslavement, sterilisation, transportation and dehumanisation that is taking place in Xinjiang province as a result of the activities of the Chinese Communist Party.  I wish to draw the House's attention to the report because its findings are shocking.  It concludes with a quote from a woman who was in the camp, which reads:</p> <blockquote> 	&ldquo;In the &lsquo;transformation-through-education&rsquo; camps, life and death do not mean the same thing as they do elsewhere.  A hundred times over I thought, when the footfalls of guards woke us in the night, that our time had come to be executed.  When a hand viciously pushed clippers across my skull, and other hands snatched away the tufts of hair that fell on my shoulders, I shut my eyes, blurred with tears, thinking my end was near, that I was being readied for the scaffold, the electric chair, drowning.  Death lurked in every corner.  When the nurses grabbed my arm to &lsquo;vaccinate&rsquo; me, I thought they were poisoning me.  In reality, they were sterilising us.  That was when I understood the method of the camps, the strategy being implemented: not to kill us in cold blood, but to make us slowly disappear.  So slowly that no one would notice.&rdquo; </blockquote> <p>That is what is going on right now in China, and it is about time that the Members of this House and the members of democratic assemblies right across the world stood up and told the Chinese communist Government that we abhor what it is doing, we stand by its victims and we will not tolerate it.</p></speech>

I hope they have a good one.</p> <p>Last week, I had the opportunity to visit my home county of Mayo thanks to an old national school friend from Ballindine, Sabina Trench, who is now the CEO of South West Mayo Development Company.  We have known each other since we were four years of age.  It was a surreal experience for us to meet through our work years later having taken such different paths since school.  It goes to show how life can twist and turn and yet there are these wonderful points at which paths crossed and are aligned, which makes what we do so worthwhile.  In Balla, I had the opportunity to hear about the supports for local food producers such as Velvet Cloud, Achill Island Sea Salt, and Mescan Brewery.  This is something about which I am passionate, and I echo the call to support people by shopping local this Christmas.  It was lovely to see the community kitchen for new food business start-ups where I was able to sample some delicious Nollaig nog, the Irish version of eggnog, which is produced locally and is, apparently, available in some retailers across the country, so look out for that.</p> <p>I also visited the Mayfield Lake greenway in Claremorris, a LEADER funded project and a collaboration between Mayo County Council, the Forest Service, Inland Fisheries Ireland, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Claremorris Chamber of Commerce and Claremorris wildlife club.  It is a collaborative initiative that has brought the community together for this wonderful purpose.  The 3 km walkway is around Mayfield Lake and serves as a sister to the 5 km walkway around Clare Lake, literally, across the road.</p> <p>The highlight of my visit to Mayo was to Oliver and Anna Dixon's organic farm near Claremorris.  This farm is extra special because it takes part in social farming, an initiative that offers people who are socially, physically, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged the opportunity to spend time on a family farm in a healthy, supportive and inclusive environment.  There I met Eric Kilcourse from Ballyhaunis and Padraig Prendergast from Kilkelly who, through a Western Care Mayo initiative, have been coming to this farm in recent years.  It was heart-warming to see the relationship between Eric and Padraig and the farm owners Oliver and Anna.  While I was there, I helped fork in the silage to the cattle, and they showed me the two Christmas wreaths they made earlier that day with Anna, an accomplished artist.</p> <p>A variety of farm types can and do engage in social farming.  It provides these people with the opportunity to do ordinary things in ordinary places.  My Department provides significant supports to these worthwhile initiatives.  In September, we announced funding of &euro;377,000 to support social farming models, an area for which I would like to see further supports.  Social farming is an outcome focused support placement and to date has supported nearly 6,500 placement days for about 800 participants on nearly 80 social farms across the country, including two in my constituency of Laois-Offaly which I hope to visit in the new year.  I encourage my senatorial colleagues to do likewise.  They should find a farm near to them and arrange a visit.  They will not be disappointed.  If my visit was anything to go by, they will leave feeling inspired and, frankly, in awe of the wonder that is there in our rural communities.</p></speech>

I hope she does not feel the effects of it too much.  My brother texted me the other day when he got his booster to say that he was feeling a bit ropy afterwards, but he was glad to get it.  I wish the Senator well.  I have seen quite a few photographs online of a walk-in clinic at the community centre in my parish in the Short Strand.  There was a queue along the street with people going in to get their booster.  I wished I was home when I saw that so I could get it, but I look forward to getting my booster next week.  Like others have done, I thank and commend those in the healthcare sector, in the community and voluntary sectors, in the GAA, in the churches, in many sectors of Irish life and, indeed, in the Defence Forces and elsewhere, who are assisting the roll-out of the booster vaccine and have assisted in the vaccine programme throughout the pandemic.</p> <p>I note last night's debate and thank and commend Senator Higgins on her motion on the TRIPS waiver and by ensuring it was passed.  It was the right thing for the Government to do and I acknowledge and thank those Government Senators who stood strong last night and did the right thing.  As I said during yesterday's debate, none of us is truly vaccinated until everyone is vaccinated, and that was the core sentiment and intend behind the motion, which I was happy and honoured to co-sign.  I hope the Government listens and, more important, I hope it acts.</p> <p>I join with colleagues agus gu&iacute;m Nollaig mh&oacute;r mhaith ar achan duine san Oireachtas, ar an gCathaoirleach agus ar a oifig, ar Martin Groves, Bridget Doody agus achan duine in Oifig an tSeanaid, Oifig an Cheannaire, achan duine a oibr&iacute;onn go d&iacute;on agus go crua gach aon bhliain ach go h&aacute;irithe le linn na paind&eacute;ime agus an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; orainn go l&eacute;ir d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis i mbliana agus anuraidh.   I join in the sentiment of Christmas greetings to colleagues across the Chamber and these Houses and all staff of the Oireachtas who always work diligently and very hard, as the Cathaoirleach knows, but this has been a trying year for us all.  I hope they get a good rest and enjoy it &ndash; I am not looking at Martin Groves in particular.  I hope we all do.  I wish everyone a happy Christmas and Nollaig shona and all the best.  Hopefully 2022 will be a much better year for us all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1663" speakername="Annie Hoey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#J00100"><p>I have my full Christmas regalia on today.  I want to reflect on the news that Cappagh Kids is not going to receive additional funding for orthopaedic paediatric care in 2022.  I think we can all agree this is devastating news for patients, parents and staff who are trying hard to care for children with scoliosis.  It is hard for me and for the children and carers affected to understand why cost effective, sustainable healthcare is not being considered.  Children are waiting for too long in severe pain for surgery.  Letting care go for too long compromises the best outcomes for patients.  These patients are children and care for children cannot wait.</p> <p>I want to quote the original Wonder Woman, Lynda Carter.  She tweeted recently that "You don't have to be trans to understand the importance of respecting trans people and affirming their identities."  A study of over 9,000 young trans people, one of the biggest studies that has ever been done of young trans people, shows that access to affirming medical care reduces the rate of suicide and depression by 40%.  Trans people being able to access the care they need when they need it literally saves their lives.  We are so far from this being a reality in Ireland.  Despite the fact that we arguably have progressive laws in this area, we have very poor access to the care, including medical care, that trans people need.  I hope that for 2022, we can move to a place where care, compassion and accessible healthcare for our trans family is a reality and that some of the hateful rhetoric that has been flying around over the past couple of years is left in the bin.</p> <p>One of my favourite topics as a spokesperson on student matters is the Cassells report.  We are now aeons away from funding or getting a decision on how we are going to fund further and higher education.  I am sure it is trite to say that all I want for Christmas is a publicly funded further and higher education system but we have to get ourselves together in 2022.  Our further and higher education sector is creaking at the seams with precarious work practices and people not being able to access or afford it.  For years we have been promised there is going to be a solution.  I hope that in 2022 we can see a solution.  I hope it will be publicly funded.  For my last contribution this year, I want to emphasise that we must really stick a pin in the funding of further and higher education and find a solution for it in 2022.</p> <p>I thank all the staff in Leinster House, the office of the Cathaoirleach, the canteen staff, cleaning staff, and the Debates Office staff who deal with my truly chaotic inability to stick to a script.  I thank all the staff in Leinster House for all they do in keeping this place running and open and all of us safe.  I wish them all a very happy Christmas and new year.</p></speech>

A lot of heads popped up from the phones and looked over with surprise.  She is well known for forking out the silage on her own farm in Offaly.  She is no stranger to it.</p> <p>Like other Senators I wish to express my good wishes to all the staff of this House who are excellent people.  I thank the ushers, cleaners and everybody associated, those in the Library and Research Service, the Cathaoirleach and his staff, particularly Grace Coyle who happens to be a neighbour of mine.  We wish to express our thanks to everyone, as Senator O'Loughlin has done earlier.</p> <p>It has been a really trying year for everybody.  We should reflect today on giving a little bit of acknowledgement to the GPs, HSE staff, nurses and anybody who has been involved with the vaccination campaign and now the booster campaign.  We should also reserve a place for the people of Ireland who, over very trying times in the past two years, have acted with respect and dignity.  It has been hard.  Some have seen their business hit.  Some are not sure about vaccinations.  In general people have stuck with the Government and with the medical advice.  I am not going to deny that it has been really tough at times to accept it.  We have to accept it because we are fighting a pandemic and we can see it is rising again.  It is really important to remember the people of Ireland and always to acknowledge and listen to what they are saying.  Without them, we could not have got as far as we have.  In general, while we have our difficulties, we are not in a bad space.</p> <p>I wish my colleagues a happy Christmas.  It is really a pleasure to be dealing with them.  Let us all have a happy and peaceful Christmas.</p></speech>

I thank the Clerk and his team for the great work they do, and all the great people in Leinster House who do so much for us.  I also thank all our colleagues across the House.  Since we resumed meeting in person we have got to know each other a lot better.  The work we do here is absolutely fantastic.</p> <p>It is going to be a difficult Christmas because Covid-19 is still with us.  We all have to be cognisant of the fact that we are still living in a pandemic.  The booster programme is going very well but I am quite concerned about those who got the Janssen vaccine.  It was a single-dose vaccine.  A lot of people who got it are in direct provision, are members of the Travelling community or are homeless.  They are the most vulnerable in our society.  An extra effort needs to be made to ensure that those people get their booster without any delay.  The third shot is seen as giving us extra immunity but if someone only got the Janssen vaccine they only got one injection.  We need to make a really special effort to ensure that the people who received the Janssen vaccine get their booster as quickly as possible.  I do not know how that can happen but I have no doubt that the HSE has the mechanisms to make it happen.  I call on the HSE to ensure that all those who received a Janssen jab get their booster vaccine this side of Christmas.  It will provide the reassurance, confidence and protection that is needed.  </p> <p>I wish everybody a happy and a very safe Christmas.  We will all be back here in the new year and hopefully 2022 will be a better and a healthier year and we will begin to see the back of this pandemic.</p></speech>

We have to represent everyone.  That is why we cannot just have one voice or the voice of one cohort in our Chamber.  It cannot be the case that only the opinions of the liberal elite are heard, or the progressives, or any other political label that can be used.  We must have a full and honest debate and that is why no perspective should be dismissed out of hand.  When legitimate topics of debate are brought to this House they should be seriously considered on their merits and not shrugged off on account of not fitting in to one specific world view.</p> <p>This has been a very difficult year for many of us in the Chamber.  Many of us will have an empty chair this year where our loved ones will not be.  That will apply to many families throughout the country.  I thank all the people who have supported me in my role, the ushers and porters, the service and catering staff, Martin Groves and his team in the Seanad Office, the Bills Office, the Debates Office and the Library and Research Service.  Without them, none of us would be able to do the work that we do.  I wish each and every one of them a happy Christmas and a peaceful new year.</p> <p>I second Minister McDowell's motion this morning.  Sorry, I mean Senator McDowell.</p></speech>

In particular, I wish a happy Christmas to all of the Members.  This time last year, I was not a Member and it was courtesy of the people in this Chamber and the Lower House that I am back.  I thank them all.  It was 16 December 2020 that I was last in the city centre before the day of the count on 21 April.  People forget just how far we have come even though we are still not where we would like to be.  We had a lockdown in early January, we had 2 km and 5 km limits and most people could not visit their grandchildren or grandparents.  We are in a different place now and the vaccines have made a considerable difference.  Last night, the House did itself some credit in dealing with the TRIPS waiver issue the way it did.  I hope that people who have been willing to get vaccinated will get their boosters.  I have been looking online constantly since becoming entitled to get one last week.  There are long queues but I hope to get mine in the next day or two.</p> <p>No one has mentioned my next issue on the Order of Business in recent days.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, launched its ten-year strategy on Tuesday.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and the RSA's chairperson, Ms Liz O'Donnell, and the chief executive, Mr. Sam Waide, for what they are trying to do.  In 1998, we had more than 400 road deaths.  We have 1 million more cars on the road now than we had then and, while any death is one too many, the number of road deaths last year was 146.  The RSA is trying to cut that figure by half by 2030 and what is termed "Vision Zero" by 2050.  There may be less travelling this Christmas than there would otherwise be but I ask people to watch their speed, not to take narcotics or alcohol when driving, to be careful and to mind one another.  I hope everyone in the Chamber stays safe and I wish everyone a happy new year.</p></speech>

Among those who passed away was the Senator's dear mum, who was a highly respected member of our community in Cavan.</p> <p>I join in wishing a happy Christmas to the Cathaoirleach, his staff, Mr. Groves, Ms Doody, the excellent staff of the Seanad Office, who could not be more helpful or co-operative, all of my colleagues in the Seanad, who have been co-operative with me in my role as Leas-Chathaoirleach, the ushers and every member of the Leinster House staff.  We have an excellent community with great camaraderie.  Please God, everyone will come back well and refreshed after the holidays.</p> <p>I had a harrowing experience yesterday.  At the request of Libereco, a support organisation for Belarus in this country led by a wonderful man, Mr. Turlough Deenihan, I was on a call to the Samusenka family.  Two members of the family, Aliaksei and Kim, are in jail.  I have sponsored one and Senator Seery Kearney has sponsored the other.  They are in jail in Belarus on trumped up charges without due process or anything having happened since last November.  They are now undergoing something of a show trial.  I asked about their legal representation - even their lawyers are being threatened.  The entire trial process is shocking.  They often cannot see relatives.  The only time their relatives can glance at them is for a couple of seconds as they pass into the trial area.  They are handcuffed at all times.  Political prisoners are treated much worse than even well-known criminals.  It is an horrendous state of affairs.  Some 4,000 people have been jailed in this fashion.  Some 4,000 people per year get arrested.  There are constant arrests.  Belarus has added a new criminal offence of supporting sanctions.  If someone publicly supports sanctions, it is now a crime.</p> <p>The mother of the two men and one of their wives was on the call.  The family has been split up.  The trauma is shocking.  Some of them have to leave the country for Ukraine.  I want the Acting Leader, Senator Kyne, to bring this matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the Cabinet's attention.  The situation in Belarus is serious, horrendous and savage.  I was not the better of being on the call for an hour afterwards.  No one would have been.  It was shocking.  They were emotional and the mother broke down.  The situation is horrendous and we have to do something about it.</p></speech>

Their patience and generosity is appreciated.</p> <p>It is good that we finished on a good point yesterday with the debate on Senator Higgins's TRIPS waiver motion.  Credit is deserved across the Chamber for all of the contributions that were made.  I hope the Government acts on the motion.  Seeing action and a change in direction is the most important element.  I hope that the Government will listen to the House's call.</p> <p>I was not going to say much more until I got a call this morning from my colleague, Councillor Denis Hynes, in Kilkenny.  He told me a harrowing story.  There is a Pakistani national - I will not name him - who is homeless on the streets of Kilkenny this evening.  He was trafficked into the country to work for a prominent horse industry - I will not name it - where he worked seven days per week for &euro;300.  After 15 days of work, he would get one day off.  When he broke his ribs in the course of his work, he was treated by a vet.  He has put in his papers over being human trafficked.  He was afraid to do so for many weeks because his family in Pakistan were being threatened by the traffickers.  Of the &euro;300 per week, he was paying half of it back to the traffickers every month for the promise of a visa.  He has been through hell.  The worst part of it as we approach Christmas is that Kilkenny County Council has refused to do anything for him.  The homeless emergency services are saying that, because he does not have a PPS number, they will not help him.  He is facing Christmas on the streets of Kilkenny.  The lack of humanity is horrendous and shocking.</p> <p>Will the Acting Leader be kind enough to write a letter to Kilkenny County Council - I will supply him with the details afterwards - and make not a political request, but a humanitarian one to look after this man as we approach Christmas and ensure that he is not left out on the streets after the living hell he has been put through for the past two years?  I will be writing to the council as well.  This case gives just a small insight into the horrors of human trafficking that have been swept under the carpet in this State for too long.  When this story comes to the public's attention, the details will be shocking and have particular reverberations for the horse industry.</p></speech>

Ireland has taken a strong position, which I urge be continued.  This situation shows that we need to appreciate how fortunate we are to live in a free and democratic country such as ours.</p> <p>I am always struck by the Christmas story, which is a story of refugees seeking freedom from oppression.  Consider what we have achieved this year.  The Afghan admission programme has just opened, a regularisation scheme for long-term undocumented migrants has been introduced and we are moving towards abolishing direct provision.  The values of which we speak, which can be determined as Christian or liberal values of tolerance and inclusion, are important to those of us in the House.  I felt that was part of the debate on the TRIPS waiver motion.  We have moved quite a degree in terms of the Christmas message and what we have been delivering but we need to do more.</p> <p>I echo the sincere thanks to all of my colleagues for their co-operation and work during the year, to the Cathaoirleach, to Mr. Groves, and to the staff and everyone else who works in Leinster House.  We need to keep in mind those who will be working over the Christmas period, including healthcare workers and those in local authorities and emergency services.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I think also of the RNLI.  For those of us who will be out on Christmas Day swims and so on, its members will still be going out.  Finally, I want to say a word for the workers in An Post.  They have been tremendous during the entire course of the pandemic but during the Christmas period they are particularly busy.  I thank all of the postal workers for their work and I wish everybody a very happy Christmas.</p></speech>

We are now about 20 months into this pandemic and the National Transport Authority, NTA, has still not produced a three-day tax saver or flexible ticket.  I have been engaging with it every month.  My friend, Senator Buttimer, accuses me of being dramatic on certain occasions but I would literally get more information out of North Korea than I would out of the NTA.  I get one-sentence responses back to say it is trying to introduce this and then to say it has not decided if it needs legislative change or not.  I have gone to the Minister for Finance and have got it in writing to say that the NTA does not need legislative change.  I have presented this response that would enable the authority to introduce the flexible ticket and that it does not require a change to tax legislation.  I then received a one-sentence response back to say it was still looking at it.  Getting one and two-line responses is just not good enough in this day and age and it is literally like having to drag the information out of a body.</p> <p>The other issue we have is that I cannot seek a Commencement debate about this issue because the NTA is not responsible to this House and it is difficult to get those types of responses back from it.  The NTA has told me that it is about to be introduced in the first quarter of next year.  That will be pretty much two years since this pandemic started and it is simply unacceptable that although we have been back working in the office properly from last September, seven to eight months in we still have people paying for full monthly or annual tickets when they are only commuting to an office setting for two or three days a week.  I would greatly appreciate if the Acting Leader and his office could write to the NTA,  Hopefully he will be more successful than I have been in trying to get some sort of information from the NTA as to when this will be introduced.</p></speech>

Like Senator Hoey, I like seeing the sparkles and everything.  I joined in with the earrings and I know that many of the guys here are wearing their festive ties.  It is a privilege and an honour to be here and to speak with a strong voice on so many topics but particularly on things that are relevant to where I come from, in Ballinasloe, east Galway and Roscommon.  Also I thank Ms Deirdre Chambers who works in our Whip&rsquo;s office here, who our Acting Leader would know very well and Caroline Lynch in my own team, who are absolute treasures.  I look forward to 2022 being a better year.  I thank everyone in our towns and villages and each person in every type of job who have done so much to help the country through this crisis.  I am thinking of people filling shelves, truck drivers bringing supplies, people doing overtime in so many companies, particularly in the area of medical technology.</p> <p>I wish to mention how Medtronic ramped up ventilator production in Galway and took on hundreds of people and completed incredible feats.  They did 24-7 shifts and increased their production levels five times over.  That was to save lives across the world and provide ventilators.  Its CEO, Geoff Martha, recently received the Ireland-US Council's global achievement award for 2021 and he said that medical technology and healthcare services, together with third level colleges and local groups in Galway joined forces in an unprecedented way at the height of the pandemic.  I want to acknowledge that, which is completely incredible.</p> <p>I also want to acknowledge our children wearing masks in schools and leading the way in keeping our families safe, and our students and young people whose lives have changed so much.  There has been an incredible change in connection, isolation and loneliness for so many.</p> <p>Finally, I want to ask people, where I have no shopping done and I do not know about anybody else here, but when people are going out shopping I ask them to think about their local shops.  They should shop local and look for local.  They have spent so much in getting supplies in for Christmas and have done so much over the past year to stay open.  There are books, jewellery, toys, house furnishings and even, as the Minister of State, Senator Hackett has said there, the organic farm shops, and so on.  We should think about how we can support the people in one&rsquo;s own community.  It means so much coming up to Christmas.  Nollaig Shona Daoibh go l&eacute;ir.</p></speech>

Can the Acting Leader arrange that we have a debate in the new year at some point with the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, on cybercrime and cyberbullying?  As the House will be aware, the Minister herself made huge strides earlier in the year on Coco's Law and making it illegal to distribute intimate images of people on social media and online, which has been very beneficial.  The Acting Leader is aware that parents of children have great concerns, especially children of a vulnerable age, when they are on social media and online in respect of cyberbullying.  Commitments have been given in respect of a commissioner to deal with this issue.  Many people have been in touch with me in Tipperary looking for updates as to when that will happen in respect of the Government&rsquo;s commitment during its term of office to tackle cyberbullying.  A debate in this Chamber with the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, in the new year would be very helpful if that was possible.</p></speech>

We remember trainee Garda Gary Sheehan and Private Patrick Kelly and we thank them and their families for their service.  It behoves all of us who aspire to and want to have a united Ireland that we stand up and represent all of our people.  On this most sacred day for those families, it is incumbent on members of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party here today to condemn the video that Gerry Adams performed on in the past number of days.  It does nothing to achieve the goal of all of us who want to have a united Ireland.</p> <p>We remember also a man who died on this day in 1971, the late General Richard Mulcahy, Chief of Staff of the Volunteers in the 1916 Rising.  Look at the legacy that he left.  We remember him and thank him today for his service.  </p> <p>Our Covid-19 vaccine programme is now ranked eighth in the world.  We thank the men and women of our health service, together with the workers in the vaccination centres, our pharmacists and doctors.  </p> <p>I ask the Acting Leader to arrange a debate in the new year again on cybersecurity.  There has been an attack today on the Coombe hospital.  This is a worrying development again so soon after the attack that brought the whole HSE to a halt.  It is incumbent upon us to have that debate.</p> <p>On a more positive note, I wish the Cathaoirleach, all the Members of the House and the staff of Leinster House a very happy Christmas and, as Senator Conway has said, a safe one.</p></speech>

Many people made their appointments in the pharmacies.  Now it has been said that that was a mistake and that they cannot do this.  We are trying to get the boosters into people as quickly as possible.  I know that only 400 pharmacies were doing it initially and there are now over 700.  This is a way of getting boosters into people as quickly as possible.  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, is meeting today and there are concerns about the Omicron variant.  We should allow the pharmacies to give these vaccines to people because I got my booster vaccine in a walk-in pharmacy last week and it was run very efficiently.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People moved through it very quickly.  I compliment all the staff involved in giving out vaccines.  </p><p>Last but not least, Christmas is coming.

Obviously, it is a happy time of year for many but, unfortunately, a sad time for others.  It is appropriate to mark the death last Sunday morning of Frank Callanan SC, who was a former colleague and friend of mine.  We often like to say in Ireland that somebody is a gentleman and a scholar and that statement could not be truer of Frank Callanan.  He was tremendously generous with his expertise, experience and time.  When I worked in the office of Enda Kenny as legal adviser, Frank was an unending source of information, support and encouragement.  He was also a scholar who wrote extensively.  He edited a sesquicentennial history of the Literary and Historical Society in UCD, wrote about Charles Stewart Parnell and was a Joycean expert.  He was somebody who contributed at all levels.  His death tragically followed that of his father on Friday.  He was preparing for his father's funeral when he died.  It is appropriate to acknowledge and remember somebody who contributed so much and was such a lovely, gentle and considered person, as his funeral takes place tomorrow.</p></speech>

I am particularly mindful of those who will be on duty over Christmas, such as members of the Defence Forces, the fire service and the ambulance service and hospital staff.  I know that friends working in hospitals are really jaded and are suffering severe exhaustion after two years of constant working with PPE and Covid and in some cases, dealing with very difficult patients because they are being moved back in queues because hospitals must deal with the current crisis.  I am mindful of them today and I think we should send our good wishes to them.</p> <p>Where vaccine and boosters are concerned, I appeal those who email me on a regular basis telling me all the bad things about vaccines to give it up for God's sake.  If they do not want the vaccine, that is fine but do not try to turn me and other people.  Let me have my vaccine.  I am delighted I got the booster.  I queued up for three and a half hours and would queue for 13 hours if I had to.  I want to be protected and I want my family to be protected.  Four members on one side of my family currently have Covid - a four-year-old, a six-year-old and their parents.  It is not a nice experience but thankfully they had the vaccine and it is not as severe as it might have been.  If you do not want the vaccine, that is fine.  Do me two favours.  One, do not contact me to tell me I should not have it and two, do not occupy a hospital bed I may need at some stage in the future because you decided not to have the vaccine.  I thank Cathaoirleach for being kind enough to give us speaking time every now and then.  </p></speech>

I thank all the staff in Leinster House, including the ushers, catering staff and in particular the cleaners, who keep us safe in this challenging time.  I thank the Seanad staff, namely, Martin Groves, Bridget Doody, Carol Judge, Carmel Considine, Ilinca Popa, Eden McLaughlin, Aisling Hart and Amanda Carney in my office, who do so much great work behind the scenes on our behalf.  I also thank Eleanor Lanigan and Grace Coyle in my office for all their hard work.

On behalf of the Leader and Deputy Leader, I concur with all the sentiments expressed.  I thank the Cathaoirleach, the Cathaoirleach's office, Martin Groves and the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas such as the ushers, catering staff and cleaners.  I also thank staff from all the political parties and groupings such as support staff, secretarial assistants and parliamentary assistants, Deirdre Chambers in the Whip's office and all the teams in policy offices within the political parties.</p> <p>Senators O'Loughlin, &Oacute; Donnghaile and Gavan spoke about the TRIPS waiver.  I welcome the decision by the Minister of State, Deputy English, to support the motion on it yesterday.  There was no intent to divide the House.  He put Government issues and policy on that on the record.  It is important that the House was not divided.  </p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin spoke about working as part of the Oireachtas Committee on Disability Matters regarding personal transport schemes and the mobility allowance.  These are very important schemes that were cancelled a number of years ago.  The fact that they have not been brought back shows that it is not an easy problem to solve.  I know the Ombudsman has advised that both schemes need to be revised to make them compliant under the Equal Status Acts as they were regarded as being discriminatory at the time, which is why they were halted.  I hope we can get that sorted.  </p> <p>The Senator also mentioned the Women of Honour group.  The Minister for Defence has agreed to a meeting and I hope that takes place soon.  The Senator also mentioned the very important work of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  She pointed out some individuals who are not allowed to donate blood but those who can donate should do so.  </p> <p>Senator Carrigy spoke about the establishment of the Oireachtas committee on autism, which will come before the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight today.  There will be motion in the House afterwards.  I compliment the Senator on his advocacy in getting that committee established.  I am sure it will do very important work, once established.  Senator Carrigy along with Senators Dolan and Maria Byrne spoke about the hospitality and entertainment industry and the advice to shop local and so say all of us in this very important period for the economy and businesses up and down the country.  </p> <p>Senator McDowell made a passionate contribution about the motion on the Uighur people.  The motion states that Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes the publication of the judgment of the Uyghur Tribunal on 9 December 2021 and accepts its findings.  We should have a debate on that early in the new year.  I have not seen the report.  Perhaps it would be more advisable to have a full debate on it and accept it after that.  I have not seen the tribunal's findings, which I am sure are fine, and am not sure if other Members have seen or noted them.  Perhaps we could put that on the schedule for debate early in the new year so we can have a fuller thrashing out of that and arrive at a common position.  </p> <p>Senators Joe O'Reilly and Malcolm Byrne spoke about the situation in Belarus.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach was particularly moved by the call he had.  I am obviously not aware of the full details but I certainly concur with Senator Byrne.  It makes us prouder to live in this country but with that comes the responsibility to assist those who are not as fortunate.  </p> <p>The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, spoke about her trip to Mayo, all the good work taking place there and across all of rural Ireland and the work of Sabina Trench, who I met at the opening of the Kilmainham playground and is CEO of South West Mayo Development Company.  Senator Hackett spoke about the social farming model, which is hugely important for many.  </p> <p>Senators &Oacute; Donnghaile, Conway, Buttimer, Maria Byrne and Craughwell spoke about the booster vaccine roll-out.  The Minister for Health has announced some changes there, including the extension of the opening hours of vaccination centres from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week operating both walk-in and appointment-based clinics.  We have been increasing capacity in vaccination centres and opening new ones, including Richmond Barracks and the RDS in Dublin and a further centre opening in Cork city in early January.  We will be expanding GP practice participation from 75% to full participation nationwide and increasing the number of pharmacies participating in the programme to 700 from this week.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Byrne talked about the mixed messages on pharmacies.  Hopefully, that advice will be followed from this week.  I refer to the widening of the programme to those age 40 and over from the week commencing 27 December.  There have been changes on the 15-minute wait period and other changes are being looked at as well.</p><p>Senator Hoey talked about the ongoing issues with children awaiting scoliosis treatment.  As members of the health committee, both of us met with professionals working in that sector a number of weeks ago.  They gave solutions, or certainly advice, as to how things can be improved.  It is incumbent on Government to take those issues up and we need to keep the pressure on.  She also talked about respect for transgender individuals.  Much important legislative work has done, led by her party and by the former Minister of State, Kevin Humphreys, and supported by Fine Gael in the 2011-2016 Government.</p><p>Senator Hoey talked about the Cassells report.  It has been a long time around the Houses and it is one of those issues that Governments have not been able to grasp, that is, proper and sustainable funding of the third level sector.  Perhaps we will arrange a debate in the new year on that.</p><p>Senator Keogan talked about the empty chairs at tables at Christmas.  It is a difficult time for anybody to lose family.  That is why we continue to advocate the health requirements we have advocated, in particular in this pandemic, including getting the vaccine, having vaccine certificates, the use of face masks and social distancing.</p><p>Senator Horkan called for a debate on the road safety strategy, which Senator Buttimer raised that during the week.  I am sure the legislation will be going through pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, if it has not already done so, in the transport committee.  It is important to recognise the positive initiatives that have taken place to reduce the number of road deaths over the years.  As I said last week, road projects and the realignment of roads have the most important benefit of saving lives because they are works done to make roads safer.  New roads or road realignments are about savings lives and preventing and reducing traffic accidents and making junctions safer and so on.</p><p>Senator Gavan raised the case of an individual trafficked in Pakistan.  If he provides details, I will ask the office to write to Kilkenny County Council.  There may be more media scrutiny of that particular case over the coming days or weeks.</p><p>On Senator McGahon's contribution, I will write to the National Transport Authority, NTA.  I am not sure if the NTA has come into the transport committee to discuss matters like these.  If it was to be invited in, I am sure the Chair of that committee would allow him to ask the questions he wishes to ask.</p><p>Senator Dolan talked about the work of Medtronic in Galway and the ramping up of ventilator production and the award to be given to CEO, Geoff Martha.  It was great to see him receive the award from the Taoiseach recently.</p><p>Senators Ahearn and Buttimer talked about the issue of cybercrime, cyberbullying and cybersecurity.  I understand that the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the online safety and media regulation Bill was submitted in early November and that a Bill on those matters is expected in 2022.</p><p>Senator Ward made a lovely tribute to Mr. Frank Callanan.  I did not know him personally, but I have heard of him by reputation as a brilliant legal mind and someone who impacted so much on people's lives.  I am sure he would have had a bright future ahead of him in terms of his career.  It is a tragedy, and so close to the death of his father.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p><p>Senator Craughwell talked about the healthcare staff.  Many front-line workers have been under huge pressure over the last number of years and they are all sick and tired of it.  We hope this will be the last winter we will so worried about Covid and Covid viruses, but we just do not know.  We certainly hope it is.  I hope 2022 allows us to get back to the things we used to talk about and the things that we used to do and to some more normality in our lives.</p></speech>

I do not want, in any sense, to diminish the capacity of people to contribute on the Uighur subject.  If the acting Leader is signalling that time will be made available in Government time to consider this report in the new year, I would be prepared not to put it to a vote today and divide the House.</p> <p>I was just looking at the particular paragraph of No. 91, motion 2, and at the other motion on Mr. Richard O'Halloran.  It is nine months since I stood up in this House and asked on behalf of the movers of that motion for the Government to do something for this man.  He is three years away from his wife and children.  He is being imprisoned by a vicious regime in China in respect of a transaction that took place before he even joined the company, which it is complaining about.  Nothing has been done to get him back but it is about time it was.  I am sorry; I said nothing has been done but I know the Department of Foreign Affairs has been moving behind the scenes.</p> <p>We have to stand up to this wolf diplomacy.  We have to say to the Chinese, "Enough."  An Irish person cannot be interned in Beijing for three years because China has some dispute with his employer.  It is enough.  We have taken too much.  I will withdraw the amendment on the understanding that the acting Leader will provide time to read this report.  As I said, I gave it to every Member of the House today, and it is a shocking, disgusting read.  I do not expect anyone to read it before Christmas, but please read it in the days after Christmas and come back to this House and give Beijing the torpedo it deserves from an Irish democratic assembly.</p> <p>I withdraw the amendment on that basis.</p></speech>

This is the largest set of social welfare measures announced in 14 years and amounts to some &euro;558 million in additional spending in 2022.  Most of the additional expenditure, over two thirds of the total, will go towards protecting core rates of payment for social welfare recipients as committed to in the programme for Government.  As such, the provisions of the Bill give effect to across-the-board increases in weekly payments for pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents and jobseekers.  I consider it appropriate that we take this action now to address the additional financial pressure on social welfare recipients.  It is important also that we continue to take targeted actions to provide supports for those who are most in need.  That is why the Bill also provides for a series of measures that has a focus on carers, lone parents, low-income families and people with disabilities.</p> <p>As I have stated previously, a priority for me, since I became Minister for Social Protection, has been supporting our carers.  Family Carers Ireland estimate that 45,000 existing carers currently on reduced payment rates will benefit from the changes that we are making to the means test.  In addition, thousands more who up to now have not qualified for the carer's allowance payment will now be brought into the scheme.  The pandemic has been particularly difficult for carers and I am pleased to be the first Minister for Social Protection since the mid-2000s to make changes to the means test.</p> <p>Last year I increased the carer's support grant to its highest ever level.  This year I have reformed the means test and increased the weekly carer's payment.  Next year my priority will be to ensure that carers are provided with a pension.  I am very appreciative of the positive reaction from colleagues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to the measures announced for carers in the budget and look forward to hearing the views of Senators.</p> <p>As with previous budget day announcements, not all of the measures are included in the Bill.  That is because they do not require amendments to primary legislation.  One of these measures is the </p> <p>As a former Minister with responsibility for business, I know that the retail community is still feeling the impact of Covid-19.  The past two years have been so difficult for our small and medium-sized  businesses.  Therefore, I urge everyone to consider spending the Christmas bonus locally this year.  I firmly believe that if we make efforts to keep business in towns then we will keep towns in business.</p> <p>Other measures that do not require an amendment to primary legislation are to be introduced by regulation or on an administrative basis.  These include: a provision to reduce the minimum number of contributions required for people aged between 25 and 28 to access the treatment benefit scheme; an increase of &euro;5 per week as well as the uplift in the income threshold for qualification, in the fuel allowance payment, both of which I ensured took effect from budget week; the extension of the hot school meals programme; the equalisation of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance thresholds for one and two-parent households; the extension of access to support grants for jobseekers with disabilities, for example, towards a sign language interpreter, personal reader or workplace adaptation grant; and increasing the rate of the wage subsidy scheme for employers of people with disabilities by &euro;1 per hour, which is the equivalent to 60% of the national minimum wage.</p> <p>I shall now discuss the sections of the Bill.  Section 1 is the commencement provision.  Section 2 provides for definitions in the Act.  Section 3 takes account of the increase in the minimum wage from &euro;10.20 to &euro;10.50 per hour.  It provides for an increase in the reckonable earnings threshold for employees from &euro;398 to &euro;410 whereby employer PRSI contributions are paid at the lower rate of 8.8%.  Employers with employees benefitting from the increase in the national minimum wage will continue to attract the lower rate of employer PRSI.  It is intended that this section will come into operation on the same day as the national minimum wage increase on 1 January 2022.</p> <p>Section 4 provides that for the purposes of the Covid-19 employment wage support scheme, the employer PRSI contribution rate of 0.5% will cease on 28 February 2022.  The effect will be a reversion to the standard employer social insurance contribution rates of either 8.8% or 11.05%, depending on the income of the employee.  Section 5 provides for a &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate of maternity benefit from &euro;245 to &euro;250 from 3 January 2022.  Sections 6 and 7 provide for the equivalent increases for adoptive and paternity benefits, respectively.</p> <p>Section 8 extends the duration for which parent's benefit is payable from five weeks to seven weeks.  That is in line with Ireland's commitments under the EU work-life balance directive.  This scheme has proved to be very popular, which is reflected in a significant increase in claims this year.  I am pleased to be able to extend it by a further two weeks next year to support families with young children.</p> <p>My colleague, Deputy O'Gorman, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, will make a corresponding amendment to the associated parent's leave provisions.  I understand that this is likely to be done by way of regulation.</p> <p>Section 9 provides for the rate increase for parent's benefit.  Section 10 is to give effect to the increases in the graduated rates of jobseeker's benefit.  Jobseeker's benefit rates are graduated according to earnings in the relevant tax year.  Section 11 provides that the amount payable for a qualified adult on a graduated jobseeker's benefit claim will increase from &euro;87.20 to &euro;89.30 per week.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Heather Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Section 12 provides for a grant of up to &euro;500 towards the cost of a wig or hairpiece for people suffering from hair loss as a direct result of an illness or treatment for an illness.  This is a new measure I am introducing under the treatment benefit scheme and it will be of particular benefit to persons who suffer hair loss as a result of conditions such as alopecia or who are undergoing chemotherapy.</p><p>Section 13 will see about 18,000 disability allowance recipients gain up to &euro;5 per week on top of the general increase.  That is because this section will provide for an increase in the general weekly means disregard for disability allowance.</p><p>Section 14 provides for a &euro;10 increase in the weekly income thresholds of the working family payment for all family sizes.  Working families on the scheme will benefit by up to &euro;6 per week.  This payment, formerly known as the family income supplement, is a weekly tax-free supplement available to employees with children.  It gives additional financial support to people in employment and on low pay.</p><p>Section 15 is the first of two provisions that were not announced on budget day.  It will provide for periods spent in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, to be counted towards the number of days of continuous unemployment required on a relevant payment to qualify for the back-to-work family dividend.  This is a weekly payment to help people with children to move from social welfare into work.</p><p>Section 16 is a technical amendment to remove an out-of-date reference to section 238F.</p><p>Section 17 contains the other provision that was not announced on budget day.  The aim of this section is to provide that the Minister may designate one or more officials to act as a deputy chief appeals officer.  That person will be designated to deputise for the chief appeals officer if the latter is not available to perform his or her duties.  This should ease the administrative burden on the chief appeals officer and will, I hope, help speed up the social welfare appeals process and improve turnaround times, something I know Senators will welcome.</p><p>Section 18 gives effect to increases in the qualified child payment and the living alone allowance for claimants in receipt of social insurance benefits.  For most social insurance and assistance payments, an increase is paid for dependent children.  The &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over from &euro;45 to &euro;48 per week recognises the additional expenditure required during the teenage years.  The payment in respect of qualified children under 12 will increase by &euro;2, from &euro;38 to &euro;40 per week, continuing the policy of recent years that has been informed by research on the minimum essential standard of living conducted by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.</p><p>The living alone increase is an extra payment for people on certain social welfare payments who live alone.  The Bill will provide for an increase of &euro;3 per week, from &euro;19 to &euro;22.  Taken together with the &euro;5 per week increase in last year's budget, this represents a substantial increase of 57% in the living alone allowance since the Government came into office.</p><p>Section 19 will provide for increases in the weekly rates of social insurance payments. Section 20 allows for a significant expansion in the list of agri-environmental schemes attracting the specific means disregard applicable to farm assist, jobseeker's allowance and the non-contributory State pension.  These schemes attract a disregard of &euro;2,540, with the remaining balance over that amount assessed at 50%.  This provision will support Ireland's climate action agenda by removing a potential barrier for low-income farmers to participating in agri-environmental schemes.</p><p>Section 21 will provide for an increase of &euro;30,000 in the exempted capital value when calculating means for the carer's allowance.  Assessment of capital is part of the means test along with an assessment of income.  Capital includes savings, investments and property, other than the family home or principal private residence.  This section will provide for an increase from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 in the exempted capital value when calculating means for the carer's allowance.  This increase will allow carers who have accumulated savings to retain their investment without it impacting on their carer's payment.  Together with the increase in the weekly earnings disregard, thousands of carers will gain from these significant improvements.  These increases will benefit recipients who are currently on reduced payments and will broaden the net and bring in new applicants to the scheme.</p><p>Section 22 will provide for increases for qualified children and the living alone allowance for recipients on means-tested payments.  This is a mirror of the provisions set out in section 18 in respect of payments based on social insurance contributions.  The increase in the living alone allowance by &euro;3 to &euro;22 will benefit 230,000 pensioners and people with disabilities, while the uplift in increases for qualified children will be received by 372,000 beneficiaries.</p><p>Section 23 will provide for increases in the rates of social assistance payments, including a &euro;5 per week increase in the maximum personal rate.  This is equivalent to provisions set out in section 19 in respect of payments based on social insurance contributions and is intended to address commitments in the programme for Government to protecting core social welfare rates of payment.</p><p>Section 24 will provide for an amendment to the end date of the Covid credit guarantee scheme.  I agreed with the T&aacute;naiste to carry this provision in this Bill.  The Government approved the &euro;2 billion Covid credit guarantee scheme in 2020 as one of the main supports for Covid-impacted businesses.  The scheme was due to end on 31 December 2021.  It is now intended this scheme will be extended until the end of June 2022.  However, this legislation allows it to be extended to 31 December 2022, in case the more relaxed state aid rules are extended beyond the end of June.</p></speech>

This is the largest budget that has been delivered by the Department for years.  I think it amounts to &euro;23.5 billion in total, a phenomenal achievement.  I acknowledge the Minister, her Department and the officials in the Department.  I know she is very proud of the work they have done, especially over the past 18 months.  Along with the Department of Health, no other Department has been under as much pressure to get support immediately to people who have needed it.  I put on record our appreciation, as Fine Gael Senators, for the work the officials have done.  We have only to look back to two weeks ago, when the Minister and her Department acted quickly to reinstate PUP payments for people who had been adversely affected by the decisions made by the Government.  People appreciate that and acknowledge the Government has acted in the best interests of citizens throughout this pandemic.  The Minister's Department, in particular, has played a significant role in that.</p> <p>There is so much contained in the Bill that I cannot cover it in my allocated time, so I will point out and acknowledge just a couple of aspects.  The first relates to the Christmas bonus.  It is welcome that will be delivered to pensioners, carers, lone parents and people with disabilities.  The small but important changes the Minister has made in that regard, reducing it from 15 to 12 months, will make a huge difference.  That people who might have been receiving PUP and then moved to jobseeker's will be taken into account will have a significant impact on people and will allow people to qualify who might not have done previously.</p> <p>One aspect that is personal to me relates to the changes the Minister has made, not just this year but in successive years, to the parent's benefit.  She mentioned how the provision has increased from five weeks to seven weeks, which is very welcome, but in her time as Minister it has increased from two weeks to seven weeks.  There has been an increase of five weeks, therefore, since she has been Minister.  In my case, my wife was racing to get the final three weeks she could get when the announcement of the increase to five weeks was made last year.  It is worth noting how many men take that time off.  They see the benefit in the early stages of a child's life of being at home as a couple and a family.  The more of these supports we offer, through the Minister in particular, the more it will benefit that family structure.  As a Government, supporting that family network, especially at that time of life, is important.</p> <p>The Minister spoke about her commitment to the carer's allowance.  She will be aware that Senators held a meeting with family carer representatives before the budget and they made an awful lot of requests, one of which related to the income disregard for the carer's allowance.  They had asked year after year for it to be increased in order that more people could be included and could come into the threshold.  Deputy Humphreys is the first Minister to take such a step for more than ten years, for which they are really grateful.  That people who are single and had earned &euro;332 will see their payment increased to &euro;350, while couples who had earned &euro;665 will earn &euro;750, will make a considerable difference to people.  Similarly, the increase in the capital savings disregard from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 will have a big impact.</p> <p>Finally, there is a &euro;3 million budget for hot school meals, a programme that is to come on stream next month.  That is very welcome and it will make a big difference to schools in my community in County Tipperary.  I am thinking of schools in Tipperary town in particular that have applied for the scheme, and more schools will come on board.  Does the Minister foresee an opportunity to expand that even further over the coming years?  It is very important for the kids in those areas and I can see the benefits already in Tipperary town and other schools throughout the county.</p></speech>

As I said on numerous occasions, social protection and social welfare are a safety net for people in the State when they need support.  If Covid has taught people anything it is that those who thought they would never be reliant on core social welfare payments found themselves requiring support for themselves, their families or their businesses.  This has to be recognised.  It may put a different perspective in some people's minds on the importance of the social welfare budget.  It affects every aspect of life.  It is not just child benefit or pensions, which are universal payments, but all of the other payments that impact people across the spectrum.  Covid has changed people's perspective on this.  It is important the core payments are protected.  The majority of additional spending the Minister announced in the budget does this.  It is very welcome and I concur with others on the importance of the Christmas bonus and that it is back at 100%.  People have received it.</p> <p>The Minister mentioned carers.  I am chair of the Fine Gael Party group on health and disability.  We have had a series of meetings with carers.  We recognise the importance of carers in every household impacted.  We never know when we might need a family carer or when something very sudden might happen, such as a stroke or a fall, and a loved one needs support.  It is important the State is there to provide assistance to family members to care for loved ones.  The change the Minister has made will make it easier to qualify.  As people get older it is something that will become more prominent.  Nursing homes have done a tremendous job but caring for people at home must be the first port of call where it is possible.  I appreciate that it is not always possible.  It is easier for larger families.  It is easier where there is a primary carer, such a husband or wife who is fit and healthy and able to assist or a sibling.  It has an impact on the lives of family members and siblings who in many cases put their lives on hold to care for family members.  Every support the Minister has provided and can provide in future should be done.</p> <p>I welcome the changes and recognition that we have to keep pace with changes in the agricultural sector with regard to income disregard for environmental schemes.  These schemes generally require an amount of investment.  Whatever income is received should be disregarded and the Minister has looked at this.</p> <p>It is important that we continue to keep schemes under review.  When we increase the minimum wage or other supports people should not suddenly lose an additional support they badly need.  It is important that all of these things are kept under review and there is an assessment based on inflationary pressures.  Increases in one scheme should not result in people losing out under another scheme.  It is a comprehensive budget and a comprehensive package.  It is clear from the Minister's work on the budget and social protection that she understands the minutiae and workings of each of the schemes.  She has practical experience in how they operate and she has tried to make them fairer and more accessible for people who need those supports.</p></speech>

I pay compliment to her and the Department on how quickly they reacted over recent years with the Covid-19 crisis.  It cannot have been easy but by God they turned it around very quickly when they were asked to do so.  On a personal note, when a member of the Cabinet needed maternity leave the Minister stepped up to the plate and took on two very difficult Departments.  She is to be congratulated on this and I hope that in the near future proper legislation will be in place to facilitate maternity leave for members of the Cabinet, Members of both Houses and local authorities.</p> <p>I could not let the day go without having something to moan about.  It is the nature of the beast.  I take this opportunity every year to speak about class K PRSI.  Class K PRSI for officeholders was introduced in 2011 under the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010.  For the first time, all officeholders, including Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, judges, the Attorney General, the President and those in receipt of non-earned income, were subjected to pay class K PRSI.  It is deducted at a rate of 4% from salary but there are no entitlement to social protection benefits.  As soon as I was elected to the Seanad in 2014, I raised this issue on a regular basis and began work on a rapporteur's report with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection at the time.  The report was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I understand a second rapporteur's report has since been delivered on class K.  To date there has been no progress on the matter despite numerous debates and reports.</p> <p>When a number of local authority members and I challenged this in the courts the then Minister with responsibility for social protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, anticipated the outcome of the legal challenge and introduced an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill 2016 on Committee Stage to remove city and county councillors from the officeholder category.  Their PRSI contributions were changed to class S.  It is my contention the continued imposition of class K PRSI on all officeholders, including Members of the Oireachtas, is unconstitutional as officeholders are paying for a social welfare fund without a right to benefits from it.  Would any of us take out an insurance policy on our home or health if we could not draw down in it?</p> <p>There is a misconception that Members of the Oireachtas leave here with cushy pensions and that we are well looked after.  All of us in the House know how precarious the profession of politics has become.  At the last election, a number of one-time Deputies and Senators lost their seats.  In doing so at a time of a national pandemic they found they could not get employment.  When they were unable to get employment, they were unable to draw on social welfare contributions.  They found themselves in dire straits.  This is not the comfortable golden handshake job people think it is.  Many of our former colleague suffered badly when they left the House after the last election.</p> <p>There are several problems with class K PRSI of which I am sure the Minister is aware.  The insurance benefit that accrues to a person paying class K PRSI are nil.  The terms and conditions of employment of elected Senators and Deputies carry no entitlements to illness benefits if a person falls ill after the end of the D&aacute;il period and an election is called.  They have nothing to draw down on.  They are not entitled to any benefit with respect to unemployment.  More important, their social welfare record is broken.  This will impact people in years to come.  It may not be today or tomorrow but it will impact them in years to come.</p> <p>The argument has been made that we can make voluntary contributions and that we should do so as Members of the Oireachtas.  The voluntary contribution is not as simple as it sounds.  The cost of voluntary contributions is exorbitant.  For people on class S PRSI when they come in here a voluntary contribution is approximately &euro;500.  If people are on a class A when they come in here and wish to keep the class A up and running they pay &euro;5,000.  People would be a long time on social welfare before they saw that back.</p> <p>From the perspective of a Member of the House, the class K PRSI is a tax on public service.  This is the only way it can be interpreted.  The same applies to members of the Judiciary and the President.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One can argue that they are all well paid, but that is not the point.  Social protection insurance is not where that money should be deducted.  If the Government wants to take 4% off me because I am a well-paid Member of the Oireachtas, it can take that in tax.  It can put in a special tax rate for public servants and do it right but, for God's sake, it should take class K contributions out of the Social Welfare Bill.  They should not be there.</p><p>I have received countless letters and emails from people on the issue of unearned income.  I refer to a married couple.  One of them is paying class S contributions on rental income and the other is paying class K contributions on that income.  This is because of their different employment circumstances.  In one case, the rental income they have is unearned income, while, in the other, it is part of their income stream.  I agree that people who benefit from share purchases and the like should make a contribution to society, but doing it through the Social Welfare Bill is not the way to go.  I understand that it takes time to move these things along but we have been talking about this since 2014.</p><p>I am not going to submit amendments at this stage.  This is something that can be done by the Minister in collaboration with her staff.  She can find a way to rejig that section.  It is just wrong.  As I stated, I am in no way against someone paying 4% of their income as a result of holding a particular office, but it should be done through the tax system and leave us with our social protection in place.  Several former colleagues who left here in 2020 suffered badly as a result of the situation relating to class K contributions.  I will leave it at that.  I again ask the Minister to pass on to her staff our gratitude for the tremendous work they have done in the past two years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1630" speakername="Catherine Ardagh" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#T00200"><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  It is great to see her here.  I think she comes to the Seanad once a year and Senators usually have a list of asks for her.  My asks will come at the very end of my contribution.</p> <p>It is important to recognise why we have a Department of Social Protection.  I will rely on statistics compiled by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  There are 630,000 people who live below the poverty line.  I know it is the Minister's job and she is passionate about bringing those people above the poverty line.  Almost one in four children experiences enforced deprivation.  One in four primary school children did not have tools to access learning supports during Covid.  That is an issue about which I am particularly passionate.  I live and work in a very disadvantaged area in the constituency of Dublin South-Central.  When schools closed, many children there were not able to access resources.  They were not able to go online to continue their education.  That was very harmful to many children.  There is also the fact that lone parents are five times more likely to be working below the poverty line.  There are more than 240,000 people who are unable to keep their homes warm.  The Minister has already touched on that issue.  There are significant social justice issues and I know that the Minister is working hard to tackle them.  As Senators in partnership with her in government, I and my colleagues wish to support her in that regard.</p> <p>I hope to be joined by colleagues in commending the work her Department has done across the board.  As soon as Covid arrived, the Department hit the ground running and stepped up all its administration.  There were no delays.  Everyone who sought the PUP got it.  There was no waiting six months for payment; it was just done.  That has to be commended because it was a significant feat.  The Department really stepped up.</p> <p>In the context of the Bill before the House, as colleagues and the Minister have stated, this is the biggest budget package in the past 14 years.  It is a significant Bill containing more than &euro;600 million worth of measures.  There is the &euro;5 increase across all social welfare payments that was announced in the budget, as well as targeted measures for those living alone and the vulnerable and an increase in the fuel allowance.  Some &euro;23.3 billion will be spent on social welfare in 2022, including an &euro;870 million budget package.</p> <p>As the Minister stated, she spearheaded the change in means testing for the carer's allowance.  I know that I and all my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, such as Deputy Calleary and Senator Chambers, have worked with carers to try to promote and seek that amendment.  It is very welcome.  Many carers around the country will be included in the scheme, which is fantastic.  The Minister stated that she will introduce a pension for carers, which will be welcomed.  Will it be a stand-alone pension or will it be part of the whole review of the pension system?  In the previous Government, we had a significant amount of debate on the new pension scheme.  I ask the Minister to provide an update on that issue.</p> <p>There are a few local issues I wish to raise.  There are so many great things in this budget.  It is a significant package.  However, we only get to see the Minister once or twice a year and, as such, I have to bring up the issue of local employment services.  Obviously, she is well aware of the tendering crisis.  It has affected employment services for those with a disability, among others.  EmployAbility in Bluebell, for instance, will not be putting its services out to tender again.  This issue is affecting so many service users who have come to me.  They are really disappointed.  There are issues there.  I have raised the matter previously in the House.  I know there is a significant amount of engagement going on with service providers but, ultimately, it is the service users who are affected.  I hope the impasse can be overcome.  Obviously, there is the idea that the service should not be privatised.  It might be necessary to consider a hybrid model where the State steps in, especially in the context of vulnerable people who have disabilities.  Their access to employment should not be hampered in any way.</p> <p>Under section 4, the employers' contribution rate will be cut on 28 February, from 0.5% back to the previous rate.  Could that be reviewed in light of the fact that we are seeing more restrictions coming down the line and Covid has not left?  Another section provides for the credit guarantee scheme to be kept open until the end of June.  Perhaps the employers' contribution rate could be addressed in line with that provision.  There may be something else the Minister can do in the context of extending the 0.5% PRSI contribution rate for employers because they are still very badly hit by Covid, particularly with the new restrictions.  Many of those in the hospitality sector are very much still feeling the pinch.</p> <p>Every year, I ask for an increase in the threshold for fuel allowance because, as many Senators are aware, if one qualifies for fuel allowance, one also qualifies for ancillary benefits such as having one's home wrapped.  I know from many people to whom I have spoken that the grants available to retrofit one's house are just not there yet.  I know new schemes will be made available in the new year by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for  the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I recently spoke to a person with a small house who asked a plumber whether to get a heat pump or do something else.  The plumber advised that it would be far cheaper to get another gas or oil boiler.  People are not there yet in terms of retrofitting their homes because, even with all the grants, it is still really expensive to do.  I know there is a bigger picture of the just transition and we have to get a handle on that.  If people for the fuel allowance, they get access to ancillary State supports, such as those relating to house-wrapping insulation, through local health board.  In Dublin 12 in particular, a significant number of homes have been wrapped and many of the owners benefited from the supports provided.</p> <p>I again thank the Minister and her Department.  I admire all the work she does and the fact that she stepped in for the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.  She did a great job in that term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#T00300"><p>The Minister is very welcome.  The Bill is about putting into place what was already described in budget 2022.  There are a few important points to note.  The first is that the Bill has been deemed by independent analysis to be progressive.  Second, I and my Green Party colleagues very much want to ensure that the carbon tax is used in a way that will promote this progressive agenda and go towards helping those who are most at risk and in need.  That is exactly what the Bill does and what the budget did overall.  Third, our priority is to ensure children and families are top of the list when it comes to increases.  We recognise that children and young families have in many ways borne the brunt of the pandemic because Covid had a major disruptive effect on social lives, employment prospects in the short term and children's schooling.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Putting the next generation first will help to mitigate some of the worst aspects of Covid-19 and put children and young people in a better position to take advantage of a world we hope we will soon be entering.  We can see from all the increases outlined that the Minister has emphasised the needs of children and families in this Bill.  I believe the same can be seen across Departments.</p><p>Regarding this being a progressive budget, Dr. Barra Roantree of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, stated: "Budget 2022 announced some well-targeted reforms with clear policy objectives, such as the above-inflation increases in welfare supplements for those with dependants and those living alone, which will slightly reduce poverty."  That is what we can hope to do over the course of this Government's budgets.  This is the largest amount of money ever allocated to social welfare and it has happened under the watch of this Minister.  It has also happened, however, under the watch of three parties working together to ensure that we have a fair society.  That is what we have done.  We have stepped up to the plate to do that.  Of course, some people will ask why we did not get more money, but the money must come from somewhere.  That is the beginning and end of it.</p><p>Some of that money, albeit only a small amount, comes from carbon taxes.  We must ensure we incentivise people to do the right things and disincentivise doing the wrong things.  In the context of the Minister&rsquo;s Department, the carbon taxes have paid for an increase to the qualified child payment of &euro;2 per week for children aged under 12 and of &euro;3 per week for children aged over 12, an increase in the living alone allowance of &euro;3 per week, an increase to the fuel allowance of &euro;5 per week and an increase in the income threshold for the working family payment of &euro;10 per week.</p><p>Broadly, carbon taxes pay for three things.  We ensured when we negotiated the programme for Government, as three parties working together, that the revenue derived from carbon taxes would all be used for energy efficiency measures, assisting farmers to address climate change challenges, particularly small farmers and especially those across the west who face challenges, and tackling fuel poverty and ensuring a just transition, which is where the Department comes into play.  All those measures announced in this regard are being funded from moneys coming from carbon taxes.  </p><p>We can all shy away from the conversation around carbon tax, but it is important.  Tax is a nasty word, but in this instance the revenue generated is being ring-fenced for good and to help those people suffering the most in our society.  Overall, these proposals are positive and I thank the Minister for coming to the House to outline them.  I look forward to her closing statement and to hearing from my colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#U00200"><p>I thank the Minister for her statement.  I am disappointed with the way we are debating this legislation.  The deadline for tabling amendments to the Bill was 11 hours ahead of when the debate in the D&aacute;il concluded.  That is no way for the House to conduct its business.  That said, I welcome that the Minister took on board many of the concerns addressed in the amendments tabled by my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, in the D&aacute;il last night.  The Minister will notice that the same concerns are now being raised in the amendments we have tabled for tomorrow&rsquo;s debate.  This is because the deadline to submit amendments came before the Committee Stage debate had concluded in the D&aacute;il.  That is not the way to deal with legislation.  If we want people to put work into preparing amendments, we should at least afford them the respect of being able to do that when Committee Stage has finished in the D&aacute;il.  That would give us at least the illusion that the amendments might even be given consideration.</p><p>I will focus on carers in the budget.  I hope they will not have to wait another 14 years to see a change in the income disregard.  I acknowledge that change was a welcome move.  The State pension for family carers is most important.  I ask the Minister to engage with organisations such as Family Carers Ireland to ensure family carers get a full State pension when they reach pension age.  It is the very least family carers the length and breadth of this State deserve.  Many of them are providing 24-7 care in their homes for loved ones.  As the climate justice spokesperson for Sinn F&eacute;in, I add that caring is a low-carbon industry.  We have not respected that role.  We should support and extend the care economy as part of the just transition.</p><p>Nobody needs to be told that the costs of energy continue to rise.  The 71% increase in the cost of heating oil means families will more than likely spend between &euro;500 and &euro;600 more this winter.  Given that many low and middle income families have no access to the fuel allowance, we need something additional.  We welcome the scheme announced by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to pay &euro;100 to energy companies, but it will not go far enough.  It will certainly not be enough for many people, especially those who are outside the income threshold for the fuel allowance.  My colleague, Deputy Kerrane, spoke about the need for a discretionary fund to help working families with their bills.</p><p>We cannot just treat the symptoms of energy poverty.  We need a strategy to address the problem at source.  A third year has now passed where the Government has had no strategy for tackling energy poverty.  It lapsed in 2019, and there does not seem to be any urgency in addressing that deficiency.  Where is the new energy poverty strategy?  I encourage the Minister to raise this as a matter of urgency with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. </p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform released a report in 2020 which found there was no way of assessing whether our retrofitting programmes are reducing energy poverty.  If private homeowners can afford to retrofit, they can afford to pay their bills.  We need to not only address retrofitting from the perspective of reducing our emissions, but also to view retrofitting as a means of lifting people out of energy poverty.  I would like to hear when the Central Statistics Office will present the indicators we require to ensure these grants are targeted and will lift people out of energy poverty.</p><p>My other focus is on the Government's decision to continue to privatise local employment services, LES.  The amendment we tabled in the D&aacute;il was ruled out of order, so I will address some of the issues here.  It is outrageous that people are now losing their jobs.  I will read from correspondence a woman working in the Galway City Partnership sent to me and all the other Senators.  It goes to the heart of the problem.  She stated:</p> <blockquote> 	I do not want to be made redundant by the actions of ... the Department of Social Protection... .  I have been working with the Galway City Partnership for 7 years and I am really worried about being made redundant in 2022 by the same Department that I have effectively been working for all these years, as it seems that those at the top of the Department ... have now deemed that we in the ... Jobs Clubs are simply surplus to their requirements. </blockquote> <p>We tabled a motion in the D&aacute;il some weeks ago on protecting employment services from Government moves to shift to a for-profit model which threatens the existing not-for-profit and community-based employment services.  These existing services are person-focused, offer wrap-around and self-referral services and have successfully been in place for up to 25 years in some cases.  When I worked in Ballymun, I saw at first hand the impact these services were having on employment by working with people and getting them into jobs.  What is frustrating is that the Government supported that motion, despite stating that it intends to go ahead with the tender process.</p><p>The amendments tabled in respect of this Bill were drafted in conjunction with the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, which represents many of those working in local employment services.  We have also engaged extensively with those working in job clubs.  Members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party are speaking out of both sides of their mouths.  In the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and in their local areas, Fianna F&aacute;il representatives have been lamenting the dismantling of local employment services and job clubs.  They are all talk because they are not doing anything about it and the tender process is going ahead.</p><p>I hope the amendments will not be ruled in order and we can debate the issue more fully tomorrow.  We have tabled a range of amendments.  I will not labour the points made in them because the Minister gave commitments last night during Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, and I look forward to holding her to them.</p></speech>

As mentioned in the D&aacute;il, the Labour Party welcomes and will support the Social Welfare Bill 2021.  For many, social welfare benefits will be the only source of income.  This important legislation will result in an additional &euro;558 million in 2022, as the Minister mentioned.  This is very welcome for so many people.</p> <p>Like other speakers, I want to mention local employment and the contracts.  The Minister will be aware that I raised this issue with her and officials from the Department at meetings of the social protection committee.  Unfortunately, the Labour Party amendments that would have postponed the new tenders were not allowed in the Lower House yesterday.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the Department&rsquo;s position.  I am sure that she, like me, is aware of the decades of service that local employment agencies have given to their communities.  She is also aware of the strike action by SIPTU members in local employment services in Laois and Offaly.  Employees do not really know what their future holds.  Local employment services have been good to our communities.  We should continue to recognise their experience and support them by postponing any tender process and allowing them to continue doing the great job they do on behalf of us all.</p> <p>On 21 October this year, along with colleagues, I introduced the Social Welfare (Surviving Cohabitant&rsquo;s Pension) Bill 2021 in this House.  We are all very aware that the concept of family has changed and that it is time to bring this State into the 21st century.  Ireland needs to treat all its families, no matter what their make-up, fairly and in the same way.  The 2016 census showed that there are over 75,000 cohabiting couples in Ireland with child dependants, a figure that is likely to be even greater at the time of the next census.  If a couple is cohabiting, the Department of Social Protection assesses the means of both members when carrying out a means test for social assistance payments such as the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  It does not provide any guarantee regarding contributory social protection payments, such as the widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s pension that is payable when one member of the couple passes away.</p> <p>Our Bill sought to address this.  My party colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, moved an amendment last night in the D&aacute;il to address this also.  Cohabiting has far-reaching impacts on many payments and State supports, not just social welfare payments.  In this regard, consider the impact regarding medical cards and mature students going back to college.  There are many more examples.</p> <p>Members of a cohabiting couple cannot claim or transfer unused tax credits between themselves, and there can be an inheritance tax burden when a partner dies.  For the assessment of eligibility for social welfare payments, members of a cohabiting couple are treated together for income assessment, in the same way as a married couple is treated, but not if one of them passes away.  It is time that the law caught up with modern family life.  I acknowledge that the Minister committed to preparing a report on this important matter last night.  I believe the changes in our laws will have a positive impact on so many.  I and others in the Labour Party look forward to working with the Minister to make those changes and to making the State a place where all families are treated equally.</p> <p>Later tonight, we will have statements on the live music and entertainment industry.  The reintroduction of the PUP is very welcome.  In December 2020 the Minister increased the threshold for the self-employed, who can now earn up to &euro;960 over an eight-week period while retaining the full PUP entitlement.  This was an increase of &euro;480 over the previous amount.  This was widely welcomed by so many at the time.  The Department described this as a new measure that allows a self-employed person to take on intermittent jobs or one-off gigs without losing the entitlement to the PUP.  The problem for so many in the live music industry, particularly those who find themselves on the lower rates of the PUP, is that there are no one-off gigs or intermittent jobs.  They have no additional income and they and their families are suffering.  On behalf of so many, I ask the Minister to consider the rate of the PUP for all involved in this regard.  It would mean so much to so many, particularly at this important time.  Christmas will be hard on the entertainment industry this year.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  Colleagues will be calling for this later tonight, but seeing as we have the Minister in the House now, it is important to address the issue with her.</p> <p>I want to move on to the subject of carers.  The Minister will know that I have raised this with her on so many occasions.  I acknowledge the means-test increase introduced in the budget.  It is very important to so many people, as the Minister said.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment that she will consider providing carers with a pension.  That is an important statement by her and her Department.  I look forward to working with her on it.</p> <p>I acknowledge the fantastic work that carers do on a 24&ndash;7 basis.  Unfortunately, there are still many who do not meet the means-test criteria who are not getting a financial reward from the State.  They should.  We should be considering this.  We need to examine it again.  I look forward to working with the Minister on this to the benefit of all those carers who, unfortunately, are not getting the just reward that I and many others believe they should be getting.</p> <p>The Minister said the measure in section 17 was not announced on budget day.  It relates to the designation of a substitute to deputise for the chief appeals officer.  Through my office, I am hearing about delays that are affecting several appeals.  I welcome the proposal in the Bill.  How will it affect the day-to-day running of the social welfare appeals office?  What sorts of waiting time reductions will be experienced by those who are waiting on the results of appeals?  Like colleagues, I am aware of several appeals that have taken months or, unfortunately, a little longer.  I hope the new section 17 in the Bill, which I hope will be accepted, will reduce the waiting times.  For so many, the waiting period is too long.  I realise the Minister has acknowledged that in contributions and in discussions I have had with her, but she might tell us what she hopes the new section will mean for those waiting on appeals.</p> <p>I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s staff and all the staff in her Department.  Through my office, I am in daily contact with her staff, be they community welfare officers, local staff in the offices in Athy and Newbridge or those who help us with our queries over the Oireachtas lines.  At all times they have been very helpful and have quickly and efficiently dealt with my many queries, particularly in these very difficult times.  I thank the Minister.  If she could pass on my gratitude to her staff, it would be most welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1632" speakername="Frances Black" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#V00200"><p>The Minister is very welcome to the House.  I wish her and her family, including the new grandchild she had only this year, a really happy Christmas.  The first Christmas is always a very special one.</p> <p>I must highlight a few issues, however.  Now, more than ever, is the time to invest proactively and strategically in our public services.  While the nominal increase in welfare payments will no doubt be welcomed by recipients, we could see better value for money.  People living in Ireland would see a greater return on public money if we prioritised large-scale investment in public services and social expenditure.  The Covid-19 pandemic presents a unique opportunity in this regard considering the suspension of EU fiscal rules that have long acted as barriers to large-scale public investment and social expenditure.  Throughout the pandemic the need for high-quality public services has been demonstrated, but we will not see the improvements we require in our public services with short-term, budget-to-budget thinking and planning.  Therefore, I ask the Government to make a genuine investment in our public services in a strategic and ambitious way.</p> <p>With respect to the nominal increases in social welfare and protection payments provided for in this Bill, we need to acknowledge their true value.  A &euro;5 increase in a welfare payment is not really worth &euro;5 in the pocket of the person who receives it.  Arbitrary increases to welfare payments like this do not take full account of the impact of inflation, for example.  The Parliamentary Budget Office has reported that the increase of &euro;5 to the contributory State pension will represent a decrease of 0.5% in real terms from next year, based on an inflation forecast of 2.5%.</p> <p>We ought to link social welfare payment increases to inflation, as in many OECD countries, to ensure greater equality and parity in Irish life.  Additionally, while the increase in the minimum wage is to be welcomed, it is simply not enough if the living wage in Ireland is assessed as being &euro;12.90.  A living wage is a wage that makes a minimum acceptable standard of living possible.  We ought to reframe how we think about the minimum wage to take account of this reality.  We also need to take into account the reality that in the majority of cases, those in receipt of welfare payments and those on the minimum wage are more likely to live in rented accommodation, for example.  We are aware that renters spend a far greater proportion of their income on accommodation than owner occupiers.  Nominal increases to welfare and social protection payments fail to acknowledge this.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The cost of rent, as we all know, is extremely high at present, which inhibits renters' ability to save, to invest and to accumulate wealth.  Ultimately, all this ensures is that the disparity between the rate of return on capital and the rate of growth in the economy as a whole will continue to increase.  That will see inequality become more and more pronounced in Irish society, which is a huge worry.</p><p>I did not think I had so much time.  That is great, as I can talk about the PUP now.  I thank the Minister and her staff for the way they have handled this situation, particularly in respect of the music and entertainment industry.  I have been working very closely with the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, which is very grateful, as am I, for the respect and dignity the Minister has shown to those in the industry.  She has spoken to and met them and her staff have been really helpful too.  I acknowledge that.  It is genuinely very much appreciated.  However, I have to bring up the PUP and the anxiety that many musicians, entertainers and people working behind the scenes feel at present.  The PUP has been a true lifeline, as we all know, for those who have found themselves out of work due to Covid-19.  I advocated recently for the PUP to be reinstated in full for workers in the music and entertainment industry who are unable to work on account of the latest public health guidelines and guidance.  It is right that those restrictions are there but the reality is so depressing.  It is practically impossible for people employed in the music and entertainment industry to work in the context of the latest public health advice.  I cannot stress this enough.  They are not jobseekers.  They have jobs, they are highly qualified for those jobs, they love their jobs and they have spent years and years working at them, more so than any person going to college.  Some of these people are world-renowned, brilliant musicians.  They have the jobs but they are simply unable to do them due to public health restrictions and the public health messaging.</p><p>The PUP will therefore continue to be a lifeline for people employed in the music and entertainment industries for the foreseeable future.  I implore the Minister to restore the PUP to the full rate of &euro;350 for all the workers who find themselves out of work again, who are mostly musicians and entertainers.  There is the 50% capacity restriction. There are an awful lot of musicians, at a lower level, whose gigs have been cancelled and they just do not have work.  It is very hard to sit in front of musicians with tears in their eyes, not knowing where they will get the money for their children's Santy presents, their mortgage repayments or their heating bills this Christmas.  We should reinstate the &euro;350 rate for all workers.  It is a matter for urgency, especially as we approach Christmas.  I acknowledge the Minister is keenly aware of the impact this pandemic has had on the unemployed in these industries.  I ask for her continued commitment to the workers in this sector.  Again, I thank her for the respect and dignity she has shown them.  She has no idea what that means because they do not get the respect and dignity they deserve most of the time.  That is where I struggle.  They are not heard.  The Minister's is probably the only Department that has really listened to them, and I thank her again for that.  I wish her a very happy Christmas and thank all her staff.  They are doing a phenomenal job and they are on the ball.  Any time a phone call comes through, they are there and they always have the answers to the questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1642" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#W00200"><p>The Minister is welcome to the Chamber.  It is great to be able to stand in this House and welcome such a large social welfare package.  We can be very proud of our country and the levels of spending we see here across all areas of social protection.  That does not happen everywhere in the OECD and beyond.  We see a record budget for next year, 2022, involving an increase of &euro;558 million.  We see increases across all social protection payment recipients: pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents - everybody is getting an increase to reflect the increase in the cost of living.  The increase in the cost of living is a particular problem in Ireland and we are conscious that it is a particularly difficult time for many families heading into the Christmas period with the increases in the cost of fuel and in general across utilities.  To see a substantial and significant social welfare budget of this size, therefore, is something to be very proud of.</p> <p>Next year the overall social welfare spend will be &euro;23.3 billion, which is a colossal amount of money but money well spent.  Ours is a country that prides itself on having a minimum standard of living for all our citizens and a safety net through which no citizen should fall.  We protect and look after our most vulnerable.  We look after people and give them a crutch, protection and assistance at the most vulnerable times in their lives and when they need it.  In Ireland, 29.3% of overall government spending will be on social protection.  That is almost a third, something else to be really proud of as a country that ensures that all citizens are protected, that we provide a minimum standard of living and that, again, we look after our most vulnerable.  In addition, we spend 8.2% of our GDP on social protection, again a significant amount of money.  As I said earlier, we allocate almost 30% of government expenditure to social protection.  The OECD average is 20%, so we are way above the average in that regard, again something to be very proud of.  Some 633,000 families receive monthly child benefit payments.  I am proud that in our country that payment applies to every child and there is no assessment of income, again something to be proud of and something we have held on to.</p> <p>It has been a very difficult time for the Minister's Department and her officials.  There have been a lot of demands on the Department to cater for a variety of needs across the country and to deal with the pandemic and various sectors.  Senator Black mentioned the live entertainment sector, which she has spoken about many times in this Chamber.  Particular attention is to be paid to that sector in the weeks and months ahead.  We know that that sector and the tourism sector and jobs in those sectors are not looking as positively on 2022 as they might have even a month or two ago.  It is about being proactive and ensuring we target this huge amount of money going into social protection at the sectors that need it most, the citizens who need it most and those families and citizens who are most vulnerable to the coming year.  We are not out of the woods yet.  However, this Government has done an incredible job of maintaining social solidarity through the pandemic, in large part due to the Minister's Department and the work of her officials and herself in ensuring we have protected people's incomes, protected businesses and protected people from the worst elements of this pandemic.  Again, that has not happened everywhere across the world.  We have been able to maintain that social solidarity and to bring people with us not alone through our vaccine campaign and now our booster campaign but also by ensuring that we protected people's incomes and protected businesses and that we have, I think, left most people able to get back up on their feet again as we start to reopen society.  The Taoiseach made reference recently - I think it was last week on "The Tonight Show" - to the degree to which we have reopened and got the economy back up and running and many sectors back up on their feet.  Part of that is because of these significant payments we have made available through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the PUP and the social protection payments across all sectors.  That has allowed our country to survive the past year and a half and will allow us to survive the next year or two as we continue to make our way through this pandemic.  While it is a difficult time, I think the overall public perception or feedback we get as public representatives - certainly, the feedback I get - is that people feel the Government has done a good job in providing those protections, income supports and social welfare packages and payments.  People feel the State is doing its best by its citizens, and that is something to be very proud of.  We are coming through an unprecedented time.  You could be forgiven for feeling we have got used to living like this, but we are still living through exceptional and extraordinary times.  The budgets we have seen for next year are exceptional to meet the times we are living through.</p> <p>It is a pleasure to have an opportunity to be on the record as saying this is a significant amount of expenditure for next year.  I know it will be targeted to the most vulnerable citizens in our society.  I look forward to hearing the feedback from our citizens next year as we move through the year.</p></speech>

She is heading up a Department known as "Social Protection", with the idea being that we protect our people at a time in their lives when they need us.  Thousands of people never thought they would have to engage actively with the Department during their healthy working lives until 18 months ago when they were let go from work because of the pandemic.  They engaged with the Department and were supported.  That happened because we as a nation believe in looking after people when they need support.  That was never more evident when the pandemic hit and continues to be the case.</p> <p>Support would not have been possible if we did not have a healthy and vibrant economy with prudent management of the budget over many years.  In 2010 and 2011, our country was on its knees.  Had the Government not been prudent in its economic management or had it been reckless in how it handled revenues, we would not have been in a position to step in and support people at the beginning of the pandemic.  I spoke to someone who was in business on one of the Canary Islands but who got precious little support when the pandemic hit.  We need to reflect on what our values as a society are.  Those values are demonstrated through the Minister's Department.</p> <p>I remember having a number of discussions with the T&aacute;naiste, our party leader, when he was in the Department - those discussions have continued with the current Minister - about the welfare trap that people with disabilities fall into whereby if they are offered short-term contracts or part-time employment, they are reluctant to take it up because they would not only lose their social welfare payments, but also their ancillary benefits, for example, medical cards.  This issue has been addressed and we are in a better position now than we were five years ago.</p> <p>What I like about the Minister's management style in the Department is that it is a down to earth, commonsensical, practical approach.  It manifested itself in the case of a person with a disability on Achill Island who had an opportunity to do a PhD but who would lose benefits upon taking up the course.  The Minister took a practical approach to resolving the situation.  Thankfully, that person and many more like that person will have the opportunity to go on to third level, become qualified and eventually step away from the Department and contribute to it instead of benefiting from it.</p> <p>Regarding people with disabilities, the main challenge facing the country is the number of people who still rely on benefits from the Department.  Unfortunately, 83% of blind or visually impaired people are reliant on welfare.  This means that only 17% are gainfully employed and contributing to that support.  The National Council for the Blind of Ireland produced an interesting report on employment opportunities, and the lack thereof, for blind or visually impaired people.  The T&aacute;naiste launched that report approximately three weeks ago.  It makes some practical and commonsensical suggestions.  For example, an adaptation grant is available from the Department to assist people who wish to take up employment but need a screen reader or some other piece of technology.  Unfortunately, it is the employer that applies for the grant, so if the person decides to move on to another job, that piece of equipment does not follow him or her.  A simple change could be made whereby the person would apply for the grant and get the piece of equipment so that, if he or she moved from one company to another, the equipment would follow.  Many commonsensical decisions that would make a significant difference could be taken.  The report is worth reading.  Some of the Minister's officials have had sight of it and the T&aacute;naiste has read it in detail.  Perhaps a small working group involving the Departments of the Minister and the T&aacute;naiste could iron out some of the issues, make the situation simpler and more straightforward, and result in more people becoming contributors to the Department of Social Protection as opposed to beneficiaries of it.</p></speech>

This is important legislation, in that it gives effect to an expenditure increase of &euro;558 million, which is an extraordinary amount.  I thank the Minister's officials and her departmental staff for their courtesy to us.  Two thirds of the budget spend is on protecting core rates of social welfare.  In light of what we are trying to achieve as a society and a Government, social welfare is about social cohesion, solidarity and the redistribution of income.  If ever we had solidarity from a Government or a Department, it has been during Covid-19.  I commend the Minister on the many initiatives she has taken and the support she has given to many sectors of her Department.</p> <p>We have not done enough for a number of groups.  Senator Black has mentioned the live entertainment industry but I wish to refer to travel agents, who have been affected profoundly by the rule changes around Covid-19 and the curtailment of international travel.  I believe that, since the summer, passenger numbers on aeroplanes have decreased by 50% with 30% no-shows at airports.  This is a significant reduction, even accepting the pressures of Covid.  Our travel agents need support now more than ever.  They have become somewhat invisible in the latest Covid developments.</p> <p>I commend the Minister on her involvement with another group, namely, the hospitality sector.  My colleague, Senator Maria Byrne, and Senator Casey tabled a recommendation to the Finance Bill but it was not reached because of the time allotted.  It addressed an anomaly that could have a significant impact on hotels around the country whereby they might not be able to qualify for the EWSS despite seeing a 30% reduction in their monthly revenues during the period covered by the extended scheme from 1 January to 30 April of next year.  The hoteliers to whom I speak in my city and county of Cork tell me that this is a serious anomaly that could affect the livelihoods of thousands of people.</p></speech>

I hope that the Government will explore with the Irish Hotels Federation a way of looking after these businesses.  It is an important industry that provides thousands of jobs.</p> <p>I support the work being done by my colleague, Deputy Colm Burke, in the Lower House on the issue of carers, including home carers.  As the Minister knows, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, yesterday launched a review of how home care was commissioned and delivered.  I have given the report a cursory glance but have not read it all yet.  It calls for a root-and-branch review of home care and the introduction of regulation.  In a Covid world, it is time that we had a debate on the extraordinary challenges facing caring and what they mean for our society and economy.  We are living longer and our needs are becoming more complex but, thankfully, we are also staying at home for longer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In its report, HIQA speaks about the system being unsustainable and not meeting the needs of people.  In fairness, that is a very good place to start.  What do we want our carers to do and what do we want the person being cared for to receive?  I commend carers and thank the Government for the support given to carers.  It is nonetheless important as we come to the part where we are to have a statutory regulation, I think, by 2023 to have this debate.</p><p>I thank the Minister for her work and her office staff for their courtesy to us.  I hope we can support this Bill, which is worth &euro;558 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1695" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#Y00200"><p>I thank the Minister for bringing this very important Bill before us.  I commend her and the staff in her Department on the job they have done to date.  It has been a very difficult time because so many people have been in and out of employment and there have been many ups and downs for many people.  There have been many structural changes as well.  People may have had to apply for payments when they may not have been on payments before.  People may have been laid off temporarily or lost their jobs and many people have seen so many changes.  The Minister and her Department have stepped in and been able to facilitate and help those people along the way.</p> <p>I agree with the remarks of my colleague, Senator Buttimer, about the Irish Hotels Federation.  There are 11,000 people affected because they cannot benefit from the employment wage subsidy scheme or the Covid restrictions support scheme.  For various reasons, they may not have been working in 2019 or the hotels may not have been open.  Perhaps the Minister could relay this point to the Minister for Finance because we did not get to debate it properly in the House the other evening.  I would certainly like to put it on record that these people need our help.  I support the comments about travel agents, many of whom have been contacting me as well.</p> <p>Another sector I want to highlight is the bus and tour operators.  I have been speaking to a tour operator who runs a private business bringing tourists into the country.  They stay all over the country, using our hotels, and the bus operator takes people to different parts of the country.  For the month of March next year, the operator had 15 different group bookings but it now has none.  It is a similar picture for February.  Many other businesses have similar stories.  With the new variant, people are afraid to travel so these businesses are losing out.  They need the support of the Government because although they are doing their best to operate, unfortunately people are still cancelling their trips.</p> <p>I thank the Department and the Government for the support given to the hospitality industry and the entertainment sector.  While I understand many people are very frustrated by these changes, unfortunately, we must live safely.  Every day there are changes caused by the variant and we just do not know what we are facing.  It is good the Government is coming out with guidance and suggestions on how we should live safely.  It is important that the Government is there to give support because in some other countries businesses do not receive that support.</p> <p>I will highlight another matter.  Currently, many people with a disability may have had two or three weeks where they were not very well and able to work.  There may be other weeks where they are in good form.  If they are out of work, they get the equivalent of the jobseeker's allowance.  There was a scheme where they were allowed to work a certain number of hours but if they are now out of work long term and they need to go on the payment, there is an impact.  I ask that the Minister review this.  There are some people who may be able to work for a couple of weeks and then they might be very ill for a while because of a debilitating illness.  A family member may care for them and I know there is a means test involved.  I welcome that the threshold has increased.  These people feel if they could work for a certain number of hours when they are able to do so, they have much more to give.  That is instead of losing out on a payment.</p> <p>My description may be confusing the matter.  When the people in question feel good, they can work, but when they are ill, they are not able to work.  They end up going on the payment that is equivalent to the jobseeker's allowance.  Perhaps a balance could be struck where they would have an easy way of opting in and out of the payment on the weeks they could work.  Many employers are looking to employ people with a disability and willing to accept the fact there are weeks they may not be able to work.  It is something that will have to be looked at in any event.  I thank the Minister for her time.</p></speech>

I will follow up a couple of points from Senator Conway.  The concept of the social welfare system in any modern society is that it functions as a safety net.  It should be for people when they encounter some sort of major unexpected difficulty in life and they should be able to fall back on it.  It is a testament to the Irish State when we see how widespread and effective that safety net was for thousands of people throughout the country over the past 18 months.  It is another testament to the State to see how effective and reactive the system was in reintroducing supports as quickly as possible, withdrawing them as the country opened again, before reintroducing them as the position got more difficult.  That reactive quality is a telltale sign of how successful the Minister's stewardship of the Department has been and how successful the Government has been as well.</p> <p>We can compare this to other places in the European Union, including our nearest neighbours and other places on the Continent, and the reality is quite stark.  The concept of social welfare is to provide a safety net.  We were really able to offer a huge safety net to thousands of people who needed it at the very worst time during this pandemic.</p> <p>As we approach Christmas, I may not have another opportunity to say this but I commend the Minister on the brilliant work she has done in several Departments this year.  I compliment the work of her staff in the Department, who have been extremely helpful not just to me but to members of all political parties and none.  It is a testament to the Minister's work ethic that she instils the same ethic in her staff.  We should take this opportunity to say thanks for that.</p></speech>

As a former credit union manager, I know all too well the real-life examples of people who, when they fall on hard times, need the support of the Department of Social Protection.  Social protection is about helping people when they need it.  The decisions I have made as Minister and I will continue to make will be guided by how we can support those most in need of our help.</p> <p>I have secured the largest social welfare budget package in over 14 years and I have managed to do that in the context of already unprecedented spending to support people during the pandemic.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Heather Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, I cannot do everything in one budget.  No Minister could do that.  That is the reality of being in government.  The purpose of this Bill is to make real improvements within the resources we have available to make the social welfare system work better for people who are unemployed, for our pensioners, carers, people with disabilities, lone parents and those who live alone.</p><p>I will try to go through these points as quickly as I can.  I hope I have covered most of the issues that have been raised.  I thank Senator Ahearn for his kind comments about our staff.  I thank all Members who have complimented the staff in the Department of Social Protection.  I am very proud to be the Minister for Social Protection.  The staff have been absolutely outstanding.  The Senator mentioned parent's benefit.  I am delighted that we are able to extend it.  I worked with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, who has policy responsibility for that area.  It does make a difference.  We want to see more men taking up the offer of parent's leave.  It brings more equalisation into the workforce as well.  Everybody will be seen the same when they take maternity, paternity or parent's leave.  That was not always the case.  I remember taking maternity leave myself long years ago.  It was sometimes perceived as an impediment to one's career progression.  I am glad we are moving away from that.  The more we equalise the benefits we give to men and women in terms of childcare, the more equal our society will become.</p><p>The Senator mentioned hot school meals.  I was delighted we were able to extend that programme to almost 300 schools.  It is hard to beat a good hot dinner in the middle of the day for any child.  I was speaking to a few teachers who said the hot dinner does not get left in the bottom of the schoolbag to go blue with mould.  They eat it and they enjoy it, and a lot of them are going back for more.  They really do appreciate it in schools across the country.  It is something I am completely committed to.  It helps a child concentrate.  At least they get the one good hot meal.  That is so important for their education and development.  We are carrying out a review of that pilot scheme.  It is definitely something I want to continue to progress further.</p><p>Many Senators brought up the issue of carers.  I was delighted to make changes in this budget to the carer's means test and to a number of disregards.  I want to continue to work with the different organisations.  They have very much welcomed the changes I have made to the income disregard.  I really wanted to improve that.  I am aware of a lot of cases where a partner, usually a mother, might have to give up her job to care for a sick child but because the husband was working or because they had some savings, they did not qualify.  We have made those changes.  A couple can earn up to &euro;750 a week.  The first &euro;50,000 of someone's savings will not be taken into account as part of the means test.  We have increased the carer's support grant and the weekly payment.  We have reformed the means test.  My next priority is to make sure we can provide our carers with a pension.  That has been talked about.  It is part of the recommendations from the Commission on Pensions.  I want to start to progress that as soon as we can.</p><p>In response to Senator Craughwell, I have a note here and I am going to give him the update.  He tabled an amendment to remove the pensions whereby public officeholders pay a contribution of 4% of their remuneration, where it exceeds &euro;5,200 per annum, to the social fund.  As I mentioned last year in the Chamber, such a measure would definitely need cross-party support.  We have to get that before we can go any further.  It is something that should be discussed with the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Rural and Community Development.  Perhaps this House could write to the committee and ask it to take up this issue.  There is a former Member of this House who currently has no income.  The Class K contributions that were made do not cover them and they do not have a job.  I agree with the Senator that we need to look at it, but we need to do so on a cross-party basis.  I ask that the Senator ask the joint committee to look at the matter to see how we can bring it forward.</p><p>Senators Ardagh and Black raised a number of issues relating to PRSI.  We have targeted this budget at the most vulnerable.  The ESRI has said all of the four lowest income deciles will benefit from the tax and welfare measures announced in the budget, with the largest gains in the bottom two deciles.  The ESRI analysis shows that the increases for qualified children, living alone and fuel allowance will particularly benefit groups at higher risk of poverty.  We get the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, report from the Vincentians.  We take it into account.  It certainly determines what we put in our budget in terms of targeting measures.  We will continue to incrementally increase these supports.  As I said, we cannot do everything in the one year.  I particularly want to target those least well off in this budget.</p><p>On the PRSI rate relating to the EWSS, I am doing that.  The EWSS is actually the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  I am extending it in line with the changes he has made.  On the threshold for the fuel allowance, I increased the disregard for the fuel allowance up to &euro;120 per week.  We have been doing work there.  We used the MESL research to inform policy.  The higher rates of payment for children aged 12 and over were introduced as a direct result of this research.  We provide the funding to the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice to produce this report every year.  We do take it on board and take their views into account.</p><p>Senator Ardagh talked about local employment services, as did Senator Boyhan.  I absolutely recognise the good work that is being carried out by local employment services across the country.  They do great work in helping people with career guidance, CV and interview preparation and upskilling and training supports.  However, the clear advice from the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Attorney General and the Comptroller and Auditor General is that the Department of Social Protection is in breach of national and EU procurement rules and that there needs to be a competitive procurement for our employment service contracts.  We have no choice but to put this out for tender.  That is the position.  We have worked very closely with all of these providers.  My officials have had numerous meetings with them.  We have no choice but to put this out to tender.  What I can say is that there will be consideration given to the community links and social service they provide.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Heather Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not want to hear people saying this because it is not the truth.  We are absolutely not trying to privatise those services.  We have to put it out for tender and, as I said, we have been working very hard with providers.  I do not know of any reason they cannot win the tenders.  If they are providing a good service, they should have confidence in the work they are doing.  They will have to collaborate, there is no doubt about it, but when we all work together we get better results.  At the end of the day, the most important person in all of this is the end user.  I want to see people who need help, support and encouragement getting back into the workplace.  I want them to receive that support because they deserve it.  I just wanted to put that on the record of the House.</p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly spoke about the fuel allowance.  The allowance is currently paid to more than 365,000 households, which are at greatest risk of poverty, for 28 weeks.  As part of budget 2022, we increased that to &euro;33 per week.  There are, of course, other issues around energy costs and we have a number of other supports available, such as the different grants for house insulation.  The best way to tackle energy costs in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling house, which is what the retrofit grants are for.</p><p>Senator Ward referred to cohabiting couples.  I discussed that with his colleague last night.  I am committed to submitting a report to the committee that will be set up as a result of the recommendations made by the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, of which I understand Deputy Bacik will be chair.  My Department will produce a report which will feed into that.  The chief appeals officer was mentioned earlier.  Most delays in this regard are due to a lack of information being provided, much of which is medical information, and that slows down the process for people.  I will appoint two more appeals officers to assist with this work.  Under the legislation, for some reason there could only be one.  I will, therefore, change the legislation which should help improve the time issue.</p><p>Senator Black raised the situation of musicians.  I understand they have had a really difficult time.  They can receive the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, if they have lost their job and they can earn &euro;960 over an eight-week period and still receive the PUP.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, introduced a multimillion euro range of supports and has been engaging with them.  Last week, she announced a &euro;50 million sectoral support package.  We will continue to engage with musicians.</p><p>In response to Senator Conway, the Cost of Disability in Ireland - Research Report was published last week.  It has now gone to a strategy steering group that is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  Yesterday I addressed a meeting of the group that will look at that report.  The cost of disability is a whole-of-government issue.  It is not just the remit of one Department.  There is much information in the report and I know the group will go through that.  It is a good piece of work that we need to look at in order to consider how we can improve the situation for those with disabilities.  I was delighted to change the law, which Senator Conway mentioned, so that Catherine Gallagher could do a PhD without it impacting on her disability payment and, indeed, I named it "Catherine's law" after her.  I was glad to be able to make those changes.  The Senator also said that the adaptation grant follows the user.  This is an issue we should look at and I am happy to do so.</p><p>Senators Buttimer and Maria Byrne brought up the issue of travel agents, the hotel sector and bus operators, EWSS and CRSS.  That is a matter for my colleague, the Minister Deputy Donohoe.  I have raised these issues with him and I will certainly take them up on behalf of the Senators again.  Senator Maria Byrne also raised the issue of people who can only work part time due to an illness.  I increased the amount people on disability allowance can earn before it impacts on their payments.  I will look at that issue on behalf of Senator Byrne.</p><p>I thank the Acting Chairman for his kind comments.  I was delighted to have served as the Minister for Justice for six months.  It was a great experience which I enjoyed and I was glad to be able to fill in for my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, so that she could take maternity leave.  This is an issue that we in the Houses of the Oireachtas need to address and about which legislation will have to be passed.  This should be done as a matter of urgency.  I know the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste are committed to doing that.</p><p>Once again, I thank Senators.  This is my second social protection budget.  I have seen first-hand the extraordinary effort the staff of the Department made when they were faced with a crisis.  Their first thought is always of the person who needs our support and to provide a high-quality service to him or her.  What the staff did, and continue to do, was extraordinary.  I am thankful for the recognition they have received in this House.  For my part, as the Minister, I will continue to work with all Members of this House, the joint committee and the organisations representing our most vulnerable groups to continue to make improvements to the social welfare system, to alleviate poverty, to support people into sustainable employment and to provide a social safety net to people throughout the country and throughout their lives.  I look forward to progressing this Bill in the coming days with the support of both Houses so that people can feel the benefits.  I thank Senators for their contributions and I will certainly take them on board.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#FF00300"><p>As ever, it is an honour to be here.  The Appropriation Bill 2021 is an essential element of financial housekeeping that must be concluded by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of this year.  The Bill serves two primary purposes.  First, the Appropriation Bill is necessary to authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2021 on the basis of the Estimates that have been voted on by the D&aacute;il during the year.</p> <p>Section 1 and Schedule 1 set out the amounts to be appropriated for supply services.  These relate to the amounts included in the Revised Estimates for 2021 voted by the D&aacute;il earlier this year, further Revised Estimates and all Supplementary Estimates voted by the D&aacute;il this year.  In aggregate, these Estimates amount to nearly &euro;73.1 billion.  This represents a significant investment to support the delivery of essential public services and to provide for the necessary infrastructure to support economic, social, environmental and cultural development.</p> <p>These Estimates also reflect the continued significant expenditure on measures to respond to Covid-19, with almost &euro;13.5 billion in gross expenditure when including expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund and the national training fund, made available to Departments in 2021.  This figure has allowed Government to continue critically important expenditure measures introduced in 2020 that were required to support our economy, enterprises and households from the unprecedented shock of Covid-19 and to provide the necessary funding to our health service to respond to the pandemic.</p> <p>A further key purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to provide a legal basis for spending to continue into 2022.  The passage of the Appropriation Bill 2021 allows continued funding, in the period before the 2022 Estimates are approved, of social welfare payments from the social protection Vote, Exchequer pay and pensions and other voted expenditure.  If the Bill were not enacted before the end of December, there would be no authority to spend any voted moneys in 2022 from the start of January until approval of the 2022 Estimates, since this authority for 2022, as contained in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965, is based on the amounts provided for in the Appropriation Bill 2021.</p> <p>Under the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in budget 2004, Departments may carry over, from the current year to the following year, unspent capital up to a maximum of 10% of voted capital.  The multi-annual system is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management by Departments and agencies of capital programmes and projects.  It recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning and profiling of capital expenditure and acknowledges that capital projects may be subject to delays.  The carryover facility allows for a portion of unspent moneys, which would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned under the annual system of allocating capital, to be made available for spending on programme priorities in the subsequent year.</p> <p>The Appropriation Act determines, definitively, the capital amounts which may be carried over to the following year.  The aggregate amount of proposed capital carryover from 2021 into 2022 is &euro;820.1 million, which represents 7.8% of the total Exchequer capital programme of over &euro;10.5 billion for 2021.  This level of capital carryover, as with the carryover to 2021 from 2020, reflects the impact of the construction closures due to Covid-19 which affected the spending plans of Departments.</p> <p>The proposed amounts to be carried over by Vote are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  The 2022 Revised Estimates Volume sets out detailed financial and key performance indicators for Departments and offices.  In Part 2 of the Estimates, for each Vote availing of the capital carryover facility, a table is included listing the amounts to be deferred by subhead.  In line with last year, section 3 of the Appropriation Bill includes a specific provision to allow for an advance from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account, with this advance then being repaid to the Central Fund in January.  The amount included this year is up to &euro;292 million.  </p> <p>The need for this provision arises as certain Exchequer liabilities and social welfare payments are due for payment by electronic funds transfer on 1 and 4 January 2022.  With the banking system closed on 1 January, funding will need to be in place in departmental bank accounts before the end of this year to meet those liabilities on a timely basis.  In addition, An Post needs to be pre-funded before the end of the 2021 in order to physically transfer cash to its network of post offices throughout the country.  These Exchequer pay and pension and social welfare payments form part of the supply services for 2022 and these costs will come under moneys voted in 2022, in respect of which the usual processes and mechanisms for voted moneys will apply.</p> <p>The signed Act is required by the Comptroller and Auditor General for clearance of the end-year issues from the Exchequer.  Under Article 25.2.1&deg; of the Constitution, the President may not sign a Bill earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill is presented to him.  However, there is provision in Article 25.2.2&deg; whereby, at the request of the Government, with the prior concurrence of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the President may sign a Bill on an earlier date than the fifth day mentioned.  In view of the urgency of this Bill, the provision in Article 25.2.2&deg; is sought, and a motion to this effect is placed before the Seanad.  Such an earlier signature motion has also been sought for the Appropriation Bill in previous years.</p> <p>The Appropriation Bill is an essential element of housekeeping which those of us in both Houses of the Oireachtas are required to undertake. The passing of the Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2021 on the basis of the Estimates voted on by the D&aacute;il during the year.  Of fundamental importance to those that depend on our essential public services, the passage of the Bill will also ensure that payments funded from voted expenditure in 2021 can continue to be funded in 2022 in the period before the D&aacute;il approves the 2022 Estimates.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I am reading some biographies of 18th century English politicians and the whole idea of appropriation was considerably important as the only means their parliament had over their executive, in the form of the king and his ministers.  Controlling supply was the huge mechanism of control.  Of course, in a constitutional democracy, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann can vote no confidence in a Taoiseach and that is the end of that Administration and the Executive is held in account by that much more democratic means.</p> <p>I remember, as Minister for justice, that towards the end of any given year, there would be a bit of a rush to get rid of unpaid capital available to the Department on various items rather than hand it back to the Minister for Finance on the basis that the next time round, it would be said the Department had to hand back money last time and it would be asked why it needed so much this time.  I am aware of those kinds of conventions and realities.</p> <p>Holding the Executive to account in a Parliament is very important.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We do it through parliamentary questions, if one is a Deputy, and sometimes through Commencement debates in this House in some respects.  Fundamentally, however, there is a growing concern in society, which we would be very foolish to ignore, that the Executive is not adequately held to account by the Houses of the Oireachtas in the way that executives in other parliamentary democracies are.  In my view, this is no more clearly underlined than in the current Covid crisis.  We have the Health Acts and various other statutes that we passed on an emergency basis that give to the Government vast powers to close down sectors of the economy and make decisions of this and that kind about social, economic and ordinary behaviour.  No Government in this country has held such powers since that days of the Second World War.</p><p>There is an absolutely unanswerable case, and I have said this on a couple of occasions in the House recently, for the establishment of greater Oireachtas scrutiny of the Covid crisis.  We are giving huge powers to Ministers to make statutory instruments that are having radical effects on us.  Who knows what will happen when the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, next knocks heads with the Government and decides on what else it considers necessary?  There is no answer to the legitimate demand that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann should establish a joint committee, like that chaired by Deputy McNamara in the interregnum before the establishment of the coalition Government, to hold Ministers and senior civil servants and administrators in State agencies fully accountable on a weekly basis and have them explain precisely what is happening.  It is not sufficient that we in these Houses learn on television what an RT&Eacute; reporter put to a Minister at a press conference on Lower Baggot Street or what Dr. Tony Holohan or whomever else it may be said by way of response.  We cannot have Government by the media; we must have Government by accountability.  People who exercise these powers and take huge decisions concerning our collective futures should be accountable on a daily basis.  If this is an emergency - and NPHET says that there is an emergency - we, as an Oireachtas, should have emergency scrutiny of the Government and its actions.</p><p>It was stated previously that the ordinary sectoral committees would provide an adequate degree of scrutiny over the activities of the HSE, the Government and such.  That has proven not to be so.  The Joint Committee on Health does not actually hold the Government or the HSE to account.  The media do a better job than the sectoral committees.</p><p>I ask again - perhaps some time I will take the guerrilla action on this in terms of the business of these Houses - that the Government hears the demand that is being made of it to put together a proper accountability mechanism in Leinster House to supervise the powers it has arrogated to itself to deal with this emergency.</p></speech>

We were in the Lower House 12 months ago - the year has passed quickly - for the debate on the Appropriation Bill.  The Minister of State might recall that at the time there was a fulsome debate on the issue of councillors pay as part of the appropriations.  Thankfully, that issue has been rectified.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, for grappling with this and putting it to bed.  This important issue was left hanging for a considerable period.</p> <p>The Bill before us will allow for the continued spending of money during the next year.  If one goes through the different Votes, one can see the range of responsibilities the Government has to ensure that the country is run appropriately and the amount of spending that is required by the various Departments, including the newest, namely, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The sectoral committees consider a wide range of spending programmes each year.  The latter do not include all the different agencies that do work on our behalf as well.</p> <p>Senator McDowell raised interesting points regarding authority, spending and so forth.  As a member of the previous Government, it struck me that during the interregnum between the election and the formation of the current Government, the constitution of this House proved somewhat problematic because there was no Taoiseach elected and, therefore, the 11 Taoiseach's nominees to the Seanad could not be put forward.  Matters went to the wire in the context of the formation of a Government by the three parties involved.  AT the same time, the renewal of the Offences Against the State Act and the passage of various legislative measures required the approval of both Houses.  In order to avoid such issues arising again with regard to legislation that would give rise to the need for constitutional change and as part of a larger package of Seanad reforms, the outgoing Taoiseach's nominees should be allowed continue in position until such a time as a new Taoiseach is put in place.  This would mean that we would always have a fully constituted House of 60 Members.  Following an election, the new Taoiseach would then have the power to nominate his or her 11 nominees.  If the nominees of the previous Taoiseach had remained in place in 2020, we would have avoided the situation that arose.  We must recognise, however, that said situation happened and that could happen again in the future.</p> <p>As we have seen, the Parliament has become fragmented.  It is not as quick as it might have been back in the time of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats putting a Government together in a number of weeks.  Perhaps those days will return in the future with different parties involved.  Who knows?  There are many smaller groups and parties, however, and it is taking longer to put Governments together.  That was a stumbling block on the most recent occasion.  It might be something worth considering for a Government of the future.</p> <p>I will not delay this important work.  I commend the Bill the to House.</p></speech>

As we know, this is an essential piece of financial housekeeping legislation and, of course, we will be supporting it.</p> <p>I will make a couple of brief points if I may.  Neither of us is very comfortable whenever this happens, but I agree with Senator McDowell regarding the point he made on oversight.</p></speech>

We made it very clear that we support the public health measures.  There is a yawning gap in the context of oversight, however.  We are all held responsible when the relevant statutory instruments come into being, and yet we have no effective say in respect of them.  Senator McDowell's suggestion of re-establishing the relevant committee has real merit.  It would not be a threat to anyone and it would give these Houses a better opportunity to hold the Government to account.  Obviously, it would also give the Government a better chance to explain its position as well.  We should revisit this issue as a matter of urgency in the new year because, unfortunately, it looks as if we are going to potentially be in a further phase of Covid-19.  Who knows for how long that phase will last?  Hopefully it will not be too long, but the first few months of next year look like they will certainly be dominated by it.  In light of the latter, I support Senator McDowell's suggestion.</p> <p>The Bill gives me the opportunity to talk about financial accountability in the context of some specific concerns I have.  One such concern that springs to mind immediately is the money spent on the regeneration project in Limerick.  This was originally supposed to be a &euro;3 billion project but the funding for it was cut back to approximately &euro;360 million in 2008 after Fianna F&aacute;il drove the economy off a cliff.  Here is the thing.  I believe the actual spend is going to be in the region of &euro;400 million.  What happened in that interim?  Some 1,300 houses were demolished and 270 new houses were built.  In terms of the housing crisis in Limerick and the beleaguered communities of Moyross, St. Mary's Park, Ballinacurra and South Hill, what was promised at the time was not delivered.  In fairness, all political parties have now declared regeneration to be a failure.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a damning indictment of successive Governments.  It is a damning indictment of the pledges that were made at the time to finally address the horrific levels of inequality and deprivation that had just been forgotten about.  When one speaks to locals, they say they cannot see &euro;400 million in the area.  Politicians are genuinely scratching their heads and asking where the money has gone and how it has been spent.  There is a complete lack of accountability.  It leads to huge frustration locally.</p><p>Another local issue is University Hospital Limerick.  We all know about the increase in spending.  We also know that in Limerick we are seeing the situation getting worse, rather than better, each year.  It is getting significantly worse, unfortunately, in the areas of trolley counts and so on and so forth.  In the context of the financial spend, one has to wonder why we do not have an MRI scanner in our primary care centres.  These are new primary care centres that have no additional staff and no additional capital equipment.  As a simple example, if we had an MRI scanner in a primary care centre, we could divert significant numbers away from the accident and emergency department, which is consistently the worst and most overcrowded in the country.  Again, we need to revisit accountability and prioritising how money is spent.</p><p>The final example is one I have mentioned to the Minister of State before.  I have offered it to him as a quick win, particularly for the Green Party.  The existing railway line between Limerick and Ballybrophy has 8.5 miles of track to be completed in order that upgraded speeds can be facilitated and we can start to introduce additional services and make it a proper commuter line.  At the moment, there are only two services in one direction and three services in the other.  The speed is so slow that, frankly, most people just do not use it.  It is 30 miles per hour.  That is an easy win.  The difficulty is that at the minute the multi-annual planning suggests that it will take another four years or so to complete that track.  Why not roll up those finances and get it done next year?  The Government could shut it down for a few weeks, get it done, get it completed and give the people on my side of Limerick city, as well as those in County Tipperary, a real prospect of a decent, local heavy-rail commuter line that we could use.  I have suggested this to the Minister of State before.  I commend it to him again today and ask him to take it back to his Department.  I will leave it at that today.  Obviously we will support the Bill.</p></speech>

This is an important Bill.  I welcome this debate, as many Members of the House have done.  We should not have shoehorned it into the last day of term, although I know why it was done that way.</p> <p>I will raise three points, the first of which is a matter that Senator Kyne prompted me to raise.  The Minister of State has been a member of local authority, as many of us in the House, including the Acting Chairperson, Senator Horkan, have been.  I do not think Senators Gavan and McDowell have been.  An issue is being raised by the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and its executive committee around the issue of councillors' gratuity payments.  It seems that the arrangements have been altered without proper consultation or engagement with the AILG.  I hope that as part of our discussion today, the Minister of State will take this issue back to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and the Ministers, Deputies Darragh O'Brien, Donohoe and Michael McGrath.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will also address this issue.  The issue of the gratuity payment arises in the context of how we value and treat our local authority members.</p> <p>I welcome the allocation of funding in the Appropriation Bill.  Senator Horkan and I are members of the transport committee.  In that context, I welcome the earmarking by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, of more than &euro;90 million over the next two years to improve journey times on the Cork to Dublin railway line.  It is money well spent as part of the overall transport budget by the Minister and by the Government.  It will shorten the train journey from Cork to Dublin by eight to ten minutes.  Ultimately, this will allow trains to hit speeds of 200 km/h on the track.  That is important because if we are to move away from the car and dependency on the car, public transport is critical.  The frequency of the service from Cork to Dublin is one point and a second point is the improvement in the customer experience that will result from a reduction in the journey time.  I welcome the investment by the Government in the Cork to Dublin railway line.</p> <p>I did not hear all of Senator McDowell&rsquo;s contribution.  I do not want to strike a discordant note in the last day of term.</p></speech>

I ask Senator Gavan, wearing both his trade union hat and his public representative hat, to hold his former president, Gerry Adams, to account.  The Senator should ask Mr. Adams to apologise to the people he sullied with his video this week.  I say that as a republican and as somebody who wants to have united Ireland that is respectful of all traditions.  I ask Senator Gavan to do that.</p> <p>Senator McDowell's overarching point is one we need to focus on.  We all recall that last Christmas, An tUachtar&aacute;n sent a letter to the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach about the way successive governments have put Bills before him at the end of the year.  Similarly, it would be appropriate that we would do something similar with the Appropriation Bill.  We should not have Bills on the very last day and the very last journey.  The document containing the Revised Estimates for the public service for 2022 is a tome in itself.  I understand and appreciate that select committees deal with the allocation of finances and resources.  That is good, appropriate and proper.  However, our total gross expenditure is &euro;87,593 million.  All of that is our Government spending money on behalf of our citizens.  I believe a level of scrutiny is needed by us in this House on matters of financial interest.  I know we cannot put a block on a budget - we do not debate the budget - or put a block on a finance Bill, although we can make recommendations.  As part of the reform of the Seanad, we can look at that again.  I believe that by comparison to other parliaments, we have good scrutiny and accountability in the House.  However, we need to look at how we can do it better in a post-Covid way.  I share Senator McDowell&rsquo;s sentiment that we are elected and the Government is elected in Parliament.  I will finish on the point that we need to have scrutiny.  I know there is time for questions in the D&aacute;il, but we need to have scrutiny.  I agree with the fundamental point that Senator McDowell made about NPHET.  I think government by media is bad for our country.  NPHET and the national immunisation advisory committee are unelected.  Although they are experts, we should be included more to give parliamentary oversight, in my opinion.</p></speech>

During the interregnum, we had a vacuum of committees and oversight facilities.  Something <i>ad hoc </i>was constructed in a hurry.  It was much better than nothing.  It meant that there was a place.  A system was set up whereby Ministers could be questioned, although it was outside the normal procedures.  I think it worked.  Deputy McNamara was elected as Chairman of that Covid-19 committee.  I nominated him.  I felt that he was challenging.  He certainly acted as an independent Chair.  I praise him for the work that he did on that.  Senator McDowell threatened guerrilla action if he does not get some changes.  He is welcome-----</p></speech>

It is a constitutional imperative to pass the Appropriation Bill today.  We ran into a constitutional challenge and there was a sense of impending constitutional crisis.  Senator McDowell even went to the High Court to establish whether the Seanad was properly constituted and so on.  We had other problems.  For example, we in the D&aacute;il could not vote remotely and had to move to the convention centre, which hinged on constitutional challenges.  Deputy Carroll MacNeill has suggested a constitutional change to allow us to vote remotely.  I note that the European Parliament can vote remotely.  I believe I am going far off topic, though.</p><p>Senator Gavan spoke about regeneration in Limerick and how there had been large sums of money supplied but he could not see where it had been spent.  I invite him to submit questions asking for detailed breakdowns of where money has gone in the regeneration of Limerick.  We will then go through it.

It is one of the premier rail lines in the country and it is important that it receive investment.  It is something that will make people switch out of cars.</p><p>The Senator is right that a considerable amount of money is being spent.  While this debate is a formality in some ways, given that the Opposition will not be challenging the Bill, it has to be done.  It is a constitutional imperative.  Otherwise, we will not be able to spend money.  There are very large sums of public money being approved, so we must go through it.</p><p>The pandemic has continued to impact on public finances in 2021, with significant supports being put in place by the Government to respond to the impacts of Covid-19.  This year, an additional amount of almost &euro;13.5 billion was provided for measures to support the delivery of key public services and to provide supports for workers, businesses and communities impacted by the pandemic.  This additional funding has been allocated to a wide range of measures, primarily income and employment support schemes under the Department of Social Protection, additional funding for our health service, support for affected businesses and sectors through grants and the rates waiver, and supports for the education sector and the operation of public transport.</p><p>Turning to core expenditure, in addition to the exceptional supports provided to deal with Covid-19, the Government continues to invest in our core public services, with a significant proportion of gross voted current expenditure allocated to health, housing, social protection, education and justice.  All of these provide essential front-line public services.  This will continue in the coming years, with sustainable increases that are broadly in line with the trend growth rate of the economy planned in core expenditure over the period to 2025, which will see overall core spending grow from just over &euro;70 billion in 2020 to almost &euro;93 billion in 2025.</p><p>Our system of social welfare seeks to provide an effective social safety net for the more vulnerable members of society.  This support has been particularly important in 2021.  The Department of Social Protection has played an important role in supporting our people in these unprecedented times.  The 2021 gross voted expenditure allocation for social welfare is more than &euro;30.5 billion across the Department's Vote and the Social Insurance Fund.  Approximately &euro;8.8 billion of this funding is in respect of Covid-19 supports introduced to support employees and businesses.</p><p>The Department of Health plays a crucial role in our response to the pandemic.  At &euro;22.1 billion in 2021, health spending accounts for almost 25% of gross voted expenditure.  This support has facilitated the drawing down of funds to the HSE to support maximising capacity within our health system.  Providing quality healthcare is a key priority for the Government.  The past number of years have seen significant increases in resources for the day-to-day running of our health service.  This will remain a priority for the Government.  Given the scale of the overall allocation, effective management of health expenditure is crucial.</p><p>Including the allocation of &euro;500 million in commercial rates waivers for businesses due to the impact of Covid, the amount allocated to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage was &euro;5.4 billion in 2021.  This level of resourcing reflects our commitment to making housing a key priority of this Government.</p><p>Expenditure on education at almost &euro;11.5 billion in 2021 between the Departments of Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science<b></b>accounts for more than 14.5% of gross voted expenditure.  The scale and composition of education expenditure has changed over time in response to changing needs and demands, including demographics, special educational needs and skills development.</p><p>The pandemic's onset had significant knock-on impacts on infrastructure delivery in 2021 and, thus, on the level of capital expenditure.  As detailed by Departments during the end-of-year monitoring of capital expenditure, spending plans were impacted by project interruptions and some sectors have indicated that they will need to use the carry-over function into 2022 to make up for this.</p><p>Increased capital investment will be critical as we face new challenges in the years ahead.  The revised national development plan, NDP, was published on 4 October, incorporating an investment package of &euro;165 billion over the ten-year period from 2021 to 2030.  The revised NDP sets out the ten-year capital ceilings, which will support economic, social, environmental and cultural development across all parts of the country under Project Ireland 2040 in parallel with the national planning framework, which sets the overarching spatial strategy for the next 20 years.  Taking into account the total gross voted capital expenditure allocation for 2022 of &euro;11.7 billion as set out in the budget, the addition of capital carry-over of &euro;800 million brings the total available voted capital expenditure for next year to almost &euro;12.5 billion.  This increased investment will play an important role in delivering much-needed public infrastructure across Ireland, particularly in sectors such as social housing, higher education, primary healthcare, public transport, water infrastructure, and climate change adaptation and mitigation.</p><p>This essential technical legislation authorises in law all of the expenditure that was agreed by way of Estimates during this year.  The House will be aware that the passage of the Bill is required to ensure that it is possible to make payments in 2022 in respect of services that were funded from voted expenditure this year, including the jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance, non-contributory State pension, nurses' pay, Garda pay, teachers' pay, all other pay and pensions funded from voted money, and payments to suppliers of goods and services, including SMEs.  Of fundamental importance to those who depend on our essential public services, the passage of this Bill will allow the payments required to deliver those services to continue into 2022.</p></speech>

I raised this matter under the Social Welfare Bill and will do so under that Bill again tomorrow.  Given that the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, is in the Department of Finance, it is important in the appropriation of moneys that we consider the proposal from the Irish Hotels Federation regarding how the hospitality sector is not able to avail of the employment wage support scheme, EWSS, in order to safeguard jobs and protect the industry.  There is an issue with the way in which trading in 2021 is being used to channel payment, or not channel it, as it were.  I hope that the Minister of State will consider the proposal, which was meant to be addressed under the Finance Bill but we did not reach that recommendation because of time constraints.  It is a genuine proposal that has merit.  I appreciate that the Government has given considerable support to the hospitality sector but there are issues around staffing for the future, as we all know.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will not repeat the well-worn statements and positions on how the month of December allows the hospitality sector to trade in the quiet months.

This is covered by the expenditure in section 1.  I simply wanted to say that the social difficulties that existed in Limerick and its suburbs in particular were very apparent to the Government of 2002 to 2007.  I visited Limerick on a number of occasions as the Minister with responsibility for justice.  It became rapidly apparent to members of the Government at the time that it was not simply a matter of law and order.  There were deep-seated difficulties with the geography and social geography of Limerick that needed to be addressed.  Large sums of money needed to be invested by way of capital regeneration.  This included roadways through Moyross.  These things had to happen.  Even now they are just about to happen, which is a long wait.  It is a long time since I was the Minister with responsibility for justice.  We should be careful in future and learn the lessons of Limerick that if we build segregated housing in a manner that ignores the need for an integrated community fabric between all classes in any community, city or county, we build ourselves problems.  It was not the economic collapse that damaged Limerick regeneration.  The will of the Government at the time running up to the crisis of 2008, and certainly as far as 2007 when I was there, was to do something positive about Limerick and make sure what was happening there was remedied and that the mistakes that were made in Limerick would not be repeated elsewhere in the country.</p></speech>

I am at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, I am in the same corridor as the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and if Senator Buttimer sends me the specifics of proposals to support the hospitality sector, I would be very happy to give them to the Minister.</p> <p>Senator McDowell is absolutely right in his comments about Limerick.  Dividing societies is a bad idea.  It is a hazard of zoning.  It is important in planning that we do not create ghettos or isolate people.  I congratulate my colleague Councillor Sa&scaron;a Novak on the work she did in drawing attention to a very large wall beside Moyross that seemed to have been constructed to divide one community from another place.  This is not a reasonable thing to do in any society and was shocking to see.</p> <p>Recently, I was in Limerick to visit the Government procurement office there and to oversee the national broadband plan.  I was very impressed by how beautiful Limerick looks on a sunny day.  People were sitting out by the river.  It is a fine city altogether.  I have great hopes for its regeneration.</p></speech>

I know many Members have a keen interest in this area.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, to speak to us this evening.  When she took office, she did not expect to be hit with a tsunami of Covid.  I compliment her on all that has been done.  I must keep an independent hat on me.  I call on the Minister to speak for five minutes and then I will call on Senators to make their contributions.  I give the floor to the Minister.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Baill as an deis seo labhairt leo maidir leis na taca&iacute;ochta&iacute; at&aacute; curtha i bhfeidhm agam don earn&aacute;il f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach seo.</p> <p>I am fully aware of the severe difficulties being faced by live performers and all artists as a result of the pandemic and my Department and I have engaged extensively with stakeholders to understand these challenges and put in place supports for the sector.  From 7 December, new necessary measures to protect public health were introduced and included restrictions on capacities for live indoor performance.  In response to this, the Government agreed to a &euro;25 million increase in funding, bringing the provision for the live performance sector to &euro;50 million in 2022.  In addition, I have provided &euro;4 million for the night-time economy in 2022.</p> <p>Restrictions impact very particularly on the viability of live performances and therefore, the Government has increased and expanded horizontal supports from across the Departments including the employee wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and extended the local authority rates waiver to the end of March next year.  The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, has been amended and reopened to support people who lose their employment from 7 December as a result of the new restrictions.  These areas are the responsibility of the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe, Humphreys, Darragh O'Brien and the T&aacute;naiste, whom I have also engaged with extensively on behalf of the hard-hit sectors I represent.  This evening, I intend to give the House details of the supports provided by my Department.</p> <p>The epidemiological situation is such that we are not where we expected to be at this point.  We as a Government have had to take the very difficult decision to introduce restrictions by limiting capacity on the live performance sector to 50% of seated capacity, as well as the closure of nightclubs.  In 2020 and 2021, the live performance support scheme, LPSS, and the local live performance support scheme, LLPSS, operated by local authorities on behalf of the Department, were instrumental in making it possible for thousands of artists, crew and workers in the arts, culture, live music and entertainment sector to engage in thousands of days of paid work, when it would have not otherwise been economically viable.  This support has been far-reaching across the country and across the sector.  I will share some results with the House now.</p> <p>The pilot live performance support scheme in 2020 provided support to 59 separate promoters and producers, totalling more than &euro;5 million.  The live performance support scheme in 2021 supported 239 promoters, venues and producers in every corner of Ireland.  My officials are currently gathering information on activity generated to provide a final report.  However, based on information provided today, we can say that more than 32,000 people have been employed through this scheme, with more than 53,000 employment days created.  Under the local live performance support scheme, grants were awarded to all 31 local authorities.  Senators will probably be aware of this scheme but may not know that it is an initiative of my Department.  It has proved incredibly popular and my Department has received very positive feedback on phase 1 of the scheme and the launch of phase 2 was very much welcomed.  Its popularity stems in part from the fact that it reaches local musicians, artists and performers that may not have benefited from the LPSS itself.  Based on the feedback gathered so far, more than 4,000 people have been employed during phase 1, with more than 6,000 days of employment created.</p> <p>Under the commercial entertainment capital grant scheme, a total of 88 grants of up to &euro;25,000 each have been awarded to venues, performance facilities and private sector classes throughout the country for Covid adaptation improvements, including ventilation.  These grants have been paid out this week and will undoubtedly be welcomed by a sector which strives to make venues and performance spaces the safest possible for audiences.</p> <p>Under phases 1 and 2 of the event sector Covid support scheme, 480 grants of up to &euro;50,000 each were awarded in 2021.  This is targeted support for SMEs operating in the events sector, including event managers, service providers in lighting, sound, stage equipment, fencing equipment, security and catering.  Funding for this scheme amounts to &euro;11.5 million and was provided via transfer from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p> <p>Under the music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, which comprised of MEBAS I, MEBAS II and MEBAS phase 2, more than 1,000 grants were approved during 2021, with amounts ranging from &euro;1,500 to &euro;5,000.  This scheme supports sole traders, partnerships or incorporated businesses in the sector to include musicians, bands, DJs, sound, lighting, audio engineers, stage managers, and stage technicians.  The sum of &euro;1 million was allocated to the St. Patrick's Festival 2021 for arts programming, supporting more than 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff.</p> <p>My Department opened up stream D of the Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 in July 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is open to not-for-profit arts and culture organisations.  Stream D is specifically for any capital adaptations or equipment necessary to assist arts and culture organisations in reopening safely after Covid-19 and to help prevent its spread.  To date, &euro;977,000 has been allocated to 104 arts and culture organisations with &euro;818,000 of this paid to 100 organisations.</p> <p>The outdoor public space scheme was introduced to help local authorities open up and create public spaces and facilities dedicated to the arts, culture and festivals.  The scheme was developed in consultation with the County and City Management Association and with input from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Projects must demonstrate how they will support the night-time economy.  Each local authority can apply for up to &euro;250,000 under the scheme.  To date, 18 local authorities have been awarded funding of more than &euro;4.4 million under this scheme.</p> <p>I also provided a very important support for well-being in the sector.  There is no doubt but that the mental health of the nation is taking a battering under Covid-19.  If anything, this is much more acute for artists who have a compelling need to perform their art.  I provided &euro;230,000 to Minding Creative Minds, a free counselling service available to every individual in the creative sectors.</p> <p>The package of supports for &euro;50 million that I announced last week included a reactive support for events that were due to take place in December and January to minimise cancellations and to provide support where these are unavoidable.  The new supports for the sector include &euro;5 million for the seasonal musical theatre and pantomime scheme.  This fund will increase from &euro;2 million to &euro;5 million and the turnover requirement is being reduced to &euro;100,000 from &euro;300,000 with applications being accepted until the end of January 2022.  This scheme is now open for applications.  Funding has already begun to be paid out to the successful applicants this week.</p> <p>A total of &euro;20 million has been provided for another strand of the live performance support scheme, LPSS 3, specifically to support performances in December and January which may need to be cancelled, curtailed or rescheduled.  This non-competitive scheme will open for applications tomorrow, 17 December.  Venues, including nightclubs that stage live performances, producers and promoters can apply for up to 50% of their eligible costs.  A minimum of &euro;14 million is being provided for another strand of the live performance support scheme, LPSS 4, to support performances being staged from February 2022 to June 2022.  This scheme will open in January 2022, and gives venues and promoters some certainty that they can continue to run financially viable live performances with our support across the sector for the first half of the year.  With this money, they can continue to employ musicians and the people who help behind the scenes.  Further assessments will take place as we continue through to the new year.</p> <p>The sum of &euro;5 million is being provided for local authorities to support local artists and performances through the local live performance support scheme.  This will include funding for community and local pantomimes.  A total of &euro;5 million is being provided to continue the capital supports scheme, the commercial entertainment capital grant scheme, CECGS, to venues, including for ventilation upgrades and other Covid adaptations.  Stream D of the cultural capital scheme for not-for-profits will continue as long as the pandemic restrictions are extant.  The sum of &euro;1 million will again be provided to the Saint Patrick's Festival 2022 to employ artists and arts workers.  A further extension of MEBAS, which supports businesses in the music sector, will be announced in January.  The current phase 2 of this scheme has provided grant support to businesses to cover costs up to the end of December.  The Minding Creative Minds well-being initiative will continue to be funded.</p> <p>The rationale behind these schemes is to provide employment opportunities for artists, musicians and crew.  Thousands of days of employment were generated by the schemes over the summer and autumn when other activity was restricted due to public health measures.  I am confident that the new strands of the schemes will give much needed employment to musicians, artists and arts workers again, including in the nightclub sector.  I am committed to supporting the live performance and the nightclub sector as it journeys through this really difficult phase.  The schemes aim to be as flexible, responsive and timely as possible in that regard.</p> <p>In 2021, I allocated a record &euro;130 million to the Arts Council.  The council has been doing extraordinary work in getting this funding to artists and arts organisations across the State.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would take many hours to elaborate and itemise the interventions made by the Arts Council with this money but here is a flavour.  The council provided funding for 12 organisations that protected them from closure, with &euro;1.7 million from the emergency stability fund, with over &euro;8 million awarded through the agility award to over 1,800 individual artists, and with &euro;4.3 million in capacity building support scheme funding for 248 organisations.  It enabled artists to better reach the public with a series of digital skills webinars and a toolkit.  Maureen Gaffney chaired Surviving or Thriving well-being webinars, which was and is a particularly important intervention.  The Arts Council also oversaw a 239% increase in approved bursaries and an increase of 412% in the value of the bursaries in 2021.  Some 189 new schools joined the Creative Schools programme in 2021, alongside 164 schools which are continuing their second year of the programme.  Over 265 creative artists, practitioners and associates are engaged in the initiative.</p><p>As a former music teacher, a singer and as someone who has busked many a time in Dublin's Grafton Street, like so many musicians and music lovers in this House, I have been distraught at the damage done to our arts during the pandemic.  This is just a snapshot of the work my Department and the Arts Council have done to support the sector throughout this Covid-19 crisis.  I guarantee that it is support that will continue unabated so long as the sector needs it.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&iacute; chomh gn&oacute;thach.  N&iacute; fheicim &iacute; go minic.  I will take the opportunity to thank the Minister.  Coming from Clare, the home of music, I can talk about what I have seen first-hand in the sector in Clare.  The whole pandemic has, of course, been devastating for the sector.  Despite every Cabinet Minister fighting over money, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, has done well to get a very good deal and to get as much money as she could for the entertainment sector, as well as for sports and arts.  I personally have received so many emails and phone calls of thanks to be passed on to the Minister and I have not had the opportunity to do so.  These came from venues, hotels, musicians and performing artists.  We can always blame the Government but we did not create the Covid virus, although the Minister has been left to deal with the repercussions of it and people are starting to recognise that now.  It is terrible that things have to be shut down but health advice has to be taken.  The Minister has to follow it and she has to stipulate what needs to be done for the safety of all.</p> <p>I want to give the Minister a flavour of the situation.  This weekend, we have 48 gigs in Clare all funded through the Clare Arts Office, which got the funding from the Minister.  I could go on forever.  From Loop Head, over to Killaloe, up to Mountshannon and down to Ballyvaughan, there are things happening everywhere &ndash; indoors, outdoors and on the streets.  We have new outdoor venues that we have never seen before, and they got funding thanks to the Minister.</p> <p>She is the right woman for the job.  I do not know if anybody else could have got so much in such a short time, all things considered and given the challenges.  The Clare Arts Office and Clare Tourism actually struggled to spend and to deal with all the money.  They got so many supports that they were completely blown away.  They had not expected those sectors would receive so much.  I have friends who got grants who had never got grants before in their lives.  I have musician friends who got money to develop their trade and, for the first time, they had funding and they got paid to be at home, and to write, to create and to develop their craft.  For years, they have just been performing.  This funding the Minister has given has enabled them to nurture their own trade and to look at other skills, reach out and be more creative.</p> <p>The Minister has had a very hard time.  It is hard for everybody.  People are getting so sick of Covid now that it is all about blaming somebody or something.  I know several musicians, famous ones as well as very good traditional musicians who nobody knows about, but we have them all in Clare.  Not only do we have lots of good musicians who are from Clare, but we have lots of them living in Clare as well.  I have to say, with my hand on my heart, that they are deeply grateful for what the Minister has tried to do in a really challenging time.  As we have the Minister in the House, I want to take the opportunity chun bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il l&eacute;i agus t&aacute; a l&aacute;n daoine an-bhu&iacute;och di.  Bh&iacute; d&uacute;shl&aacute;in mh&oacute;ra roimpi.  Iarraim uirthi coinne&aacute;il leis.  The Minister is just getting started.  If we did not have a pandemic, God knows what would have happened.</p> <p>Nobody in the history of the State has ever introduced the basic income that the Minister has introduced and that she is working on.  She is going to be talking to over 200 groups of artists.  This is what I really like about the Minister.  She is listening and engaging with people and with groups.  That is how we progress as a Government and as politicians; it is when we listen to people.  The pilot scheme will open for applications early in the new year.  Almost 200 artists, art workers and representative bodies will be in attendance at the meetings with the Minister.  That is why she has been doing so well so far.  It is because she has been listening to people, artists and venues.  Right from the get-go, a year and a half ago, she was straight out to create spaces outdoors so people could at least have creativity in the outdoors.  I hope she gets a couple of days off over Christmas because I know she has not had a break in a year and a half, but everybody needs a break.  I hope she gets a small one and I hope her children get to see her.  I thank her from the bottom of my heart because those messages are straight from many musicians, performers and hotel owners, who have been ringing me and emailing me to please tell the Minister they are really grateful for what she has been trying to do for them.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1664" speakername="Sharon Keogan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#SS00400"><p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  I want to go through some points with her that the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland has asked me to raise with her today.  There is &euro;25 million for the live entertainment sector for 2022 in the budget and an additional &euro;25 million was secured on the announcement of the most recent restrictions, which effectively closed the sector, yet this &euro;25 million goes only to the ticketed sector.  The survey recently carried out by the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland has the following findings.  Just over 70% of the workers surveyed did not receive any work through the live performance support scheme, LPSS.  Over 50% did receive support through the music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS.  Almost 96% have not received funding through the Arts Council since March 2020.</p> <p>The Arts Council funded theatres, venues and organisations in 2020 and 2021 through the emergency stabilisation fund.  What was the reason for this funding?  If it was because venues were suffering loss of revenue due to being unable to stage performances, then box office takings were almost non-existent.  Was this not a compensation scheme and should this have been afforded to all businesses who suffered the same?</p> <p>As Minister with responsibility for the arts, Deputy Catherine Martin has stated she cannot advise the Arts Council on policy or give it any direction.  On 13 October 2021, in a press briefing on budget 2022, in response to a question about the difficulty in accessing arts funding and the difficulty in the application process, a reporter asked if the Minister would like to see that simplified.  The Minister replied by saying it was not for her to tell the council how to do its business, that it is separate to her and so, legally, she cannot instruct it on how to do that.  On 19 November 2020, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister responded to a question about instructing the Arts Council on policy, by saying: "While I have authority to give policy direction to the Arts Council, I am also bound to recognise the statutory independence of the Arts Council in its funding decisions".  The Arts Act 2003, Part 2, section 5(3), states: "The Minister may, in relation to the performance by the Council of its functions (other than under section 24), give a direction in writing to the Council requiring it to comply with such policies of the Minister or the Government as are specified in the direction".  Which is it?  The Minister can instruct it or she cannot.  Does she know?  Why has the Minister not exercised that ability?  The Arts Council received &euro;130 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  Does the Minister not think a publicly elected representative and a Minister of the Government should exercise her legal power over Arts Council policy, especially at a time when its funding was generously increased to &euro;130 million for two years in a row?</p> <p>With regard to the recent funding announcement of the &euro;25 million secured in budget 2022 and the additional &euro;25 million secured on foot of recent restrictions, when was the decision taken to allocate &euro;34 million to the LPSS 3 and 4 schemes?  On 29 November, at the live entertainment stakeholder forum, the question was directly put to the Minister&rsquo;s official on the &euro;25 million and whether the decision had been made that it would only be used for the LPSS.  The answer was an emphatic "No" and it was said that the decision had not been made already and it would not be just the LPSS.  However, on 24 November, at the Minister's appearance in front of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, she stated, in reference to the &euro;25 million fund, that there is the LPSS of &euro;25 million for 2022.  It sounds like the decision has been made yet a stakeholder forum was convened on 29 November.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Are these stakeholder funds only a box-ticking exercise?  Some &euro;44 million of this funding is being funnelled through competitive schemes, meaning that not everyone will benefit.  Imagine if pubs had been supported during the pandemic by a competitive scheme under which a particular pub would receive support but the one across the road would receive nothing.</p><p>The proposal for a scheme of Covid supports for arts and art workers proposed by the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, was emailed to the Minister's officials on 31 August 2021.  Not until 24 November, during her appearance at the Oireachtas joint committee, did MEAI discover the Minister considered the scheme not feasible.  She stated that officials examined it and believed it was not feasible.  On 2 November, the music and entertainment cross-party committee wrote to her to enquire in this regard.</p><p>The Minister can clearly see that these schemes are not working for the artists she is here purporting to represent.  I need her to do more.</p></speech>

It is sad and unfortunate these restrictions are necessary as a result of the health situation and where we find ourselves.  It was such a fantastic period when we had full auditoriums back again.  At the end of November and start of December, I was lucky enough to attend three live shows with full houses over three weekends, demonstrating my wide taste in various types of music, as Senator Malcolm Byrne will attest, from our own internationally acclaimed Brian Byrne from Navan who appeared along with a host of music stars at the Solstice Arts Centre in Navan, to Gary Barlow live in the 3Arena and the "Sunday Miscellany" live Christmas performance in the National Concert Hall.  The joy on people's faces at being at those live events was fantastic to see.</p> <p>What is notable - I do not have to say it to the Minister or anyone else here to discuss this issue - is the massive amount of employment that is generated behind the scenes of all these live events, particularly the big live shows.  Many people, not just the performers, are dependent on these events for their income.  The Minister alluded to that in her speech.  It is notable.  I know that, with her other hat on, she is taking account of the tourism that spins off from live events, especially the big live shows in the 3Arena, for the hotel and hospitality industry.  There is no doubt that, of all the Ministers, she has been faced with one of the most challenging scenarios arising from Covid and the impact on the people she represents.  She has tried valiantly, such as by ensuring performances could take place in safe outdoor spaces in summer.  I praise her for that and for trying to demonstrate ways the sector could still function.</p> <p>The funding of &euro;50 million announced last week is significant.  The Minister referred to the broad range of associated supports.  Of particular importance are the mental health supports for those impacted.  I praise her for doing that.</p> <p>The passion the Minister has for this was evident from her speech.  Her background is clearly a factor in that regard.  She mentioned that she busked on Grafton Street in years gone by.  The issue of musicians who do not qualify for the schemes that have been announced is problematic.  Such musicians may end up falling between two stools in this regard in that they do not perform at ticketed events but only play small gigs at clubs and so forth.  We need to ensure the funding will trickle down to those who are struggling and need it the most.  It is important these musicians who are passionate about their artistic performance are not squeezed as a result of not being able to qualify.  Those who were previously able to eke out a living have experienced massive losses in income in the past 22 months.  They are all self-employed people, and in the past 22 months there has only been a very small window when they could be operational.  The Minister mentioned supports such as the music and entertainment business assistance scheme and others that were provided and are very welcome.  It comes down to the qualification for those schemes and the demonstration of associated business costs.  Many of these people are small self-employed people and will struggle to get the various pieces of required documentation together.</p> <p>The amount of money is significant.  Will it be sufficient to provide for all those who wish to qualify?  The Minister has done exceptionally well to acquire that funding, but what would she like to see beyond it in terms of making sure the people she mentioned actually receive the support they require?  I am sure she is aware that a lot more funding is probably needed.  She mentioned in her speech and when she announced the funding last week that there are other ways in which this issue could be tackled and that she is examining how further supports can be provided to the broader events sector.  In what ways could that be done?  Is it a question of liaising with other Departments, such as the Department of Social Protection, to see what help they can provide?  That has to be examined.  I thank the Minister for being present.  We wish her well in the work she is doing.</p></speech>

I concur with the comments of Senator Cassells regarding the fact she has had one of the most challenging Departments in the past 18 months.  I thank her for the work she has done.  There are still issues outstanding but she has done a serious amount of work across a broad spectrum.</p> <p>It is important to recognise that the sector has been totally devastated by Covid-19, be it as a result of social distancing, travel restrictions, closures or the 50% capacity restriction.  The events sector accounts for 90% of the 5 million tickets sold in Ireland each year and contributes &euro;3.5 billion to the economy.  Every &euro;1 spent brings an additional &euro;6 spend in the tourism and hospitality sector.</p> <p>In summer, the Oireachtas joint committee, of which I am a member, produced a report and made several proposals.  It recommended that the Department engage with the stakeholders in respect of the roll-out of the MEBAS and expedite plans to develop new support schemes for artists, with meaningful engagement with representatives of the entertainment sector regarding plans to open.  It called for the full rate of PUP to be maintained for workers in the entertainment sector until the industry is fully open and for it to be ensured no workers in the sector are reduced to jobseeker status in the interim period.  Unfortunately, not all those proposals were taken on board.  At the most recent meeting of the committee, I asked the Minister for a full report on the proposals in hospitality and entertainment to be sent to the committee.</p> <p>As Senator Keogan stated, figures we got from the MEAI indicate that 70% of workers did not receive any work through the live performance support scheme, LPSS, and 50% only received support through MEBAS.  Funding for the Arts Council has been doubled  but a significant proportion of that funding went to theatres, venues and organisations.  I welcome the fact the funding is being maintained for 2022.  I have met several people in my home county who are in that sector.  They have been very positive about the supports that have been put in place.  Unfortunately, some people in the live entertainment sector have been left behind, as demonstrated by the figures to which I referred.  The MEAI proposed a scheme but it was not accepted by the Department.  To my understanding, however, the funding for the scheme was not exhausted because it was treated slightly differently.  What was the basis for the requirement in respect of business costs, which ruled out many people from being able to apply?  Other schemes designed to offer the same type of support did not have that requirement.  I sought an update from the Department in recent days but I have not received any figures on the various schemes.  I have spoken to several people in the industry, including a young lady who lost all her gigs and will travel to Dubai in the new year to make money to be able to support herself in college.</p> <p>In the context of the traditional panto, I welcome the reduction to &euro;100,000 but, unfortunately, it will not cover all the local pantos.</p></speech>

I welcome the work she has done and the fact she stated support will be there for the coming year.</p></speech>

It is nice to meet her here in the Seanad.  I thank her for the comprehensive update.  She has an incredibly challenging brief.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This period has been quite challenging for people who are creative and need to connect with people.  That is their passion and vocation in life.  As my colleague said, we have to make sure that people are not left behind.  If a basic income for artists and creative people is what comes out of this, that is a good thing because creativity is part of our DNA.</p><p>I have a slightly different question.  I have tried to be a voice for the wedding industry throughout the pandemic.  I will make a point I have made consistently.  I am not here to ask the Minister for supports for the wedding industry, but those working in it do not have a place to go to in government.  They do not know where to go.  I talked to members of the Wedding International Professionals Association and they do not feel they have a Ministry they can go to.  They gravitate towards the Minister's Department because it covers live entertainment, tourism and, in part, business.  They believe that the Minister's Department is probably the one to go to because it takes in events.  The wedding industry is worth &euro;3 billion.  Its members want best practice but they need to engage and are looking for partnership.  I ask the Minister to bring back to the Department that we need to be able to give them a Ministry they can come to about best practice.</p></speech>

The Minister is very welcome to the Chamber.  This is a critical debate.  As the Minister can imagine, I am very concerned about the music industry.  We need to act now to save the music and live entertainment industry in this country.  Some action has to be taken.</p> <p>The long and short of it is that music and live entertainment are an intrinsic part of what it means to be Irish.  They are so much part of who we are and we cannot imagine life without them; I certainly could not.  I do not think anybody in this Chamber could imagine life without the music industry, but we may have to if immediate action is not taken to save it and the people employed in it.  We might have to say goodbye to the music industry because of the way it is going at the moment.  The reality is that musicians I know are leaving the industry because they cannot survive on no money and they are not earning.  When I talk about music and live entertainment, I need to be clear that I am not talking about international touring acts playing in multi-thousand seat venues in Dublin, Cork or Galway.  I am talking about the music that is written, learned, performed and enjoyed on this island in pubs, bars, small theatres and venues.  It is the lifeblood of Irish music and without it we do not have a music and live entertainment industry.</p> <p>We need to remember that this industry is made up of people.  The music is written and played by people who have dedicated their entire lives to perfecting their craft, which makes an invaluable contribution to Irish life.  These are people whose livelihoods have been completely decimated over the past two years, who have families that they are struggling to provide for and who cannot afford their Santa Claus presents.  I am getting upset because I have to listen to what the reality is.  It is horrendous.  A man sat in front of me this week who was completely and utterly broken.  His gigs were all cancelled, he has no money and he cannot get the PUP.  Even if he did, some people only get &euro;200.  How can anyone survive on that?  </p> <p>All I am asking is that the Minister listens to those in the smaller sections of the music industry.  I am asking her to please listen to the musicians.  The cross-party Oireachtas committee has asked for a meeting with the Minister twice.  We got no response.  We just want a little respect.  That is all it is; respect and dignity.  I have been in the music industry for years.  I know what it is like to be disrespected.  I have gone through it and did my apprenticeship.  The Minister is a good woman and has a good heart.  She knows what it is like because she is a musician.  I am asking her to please listen to what musicians have to say.  I ask her to please just talk to them and listen to what they are saying.</p> <p>The stories people tell me speak to the reality of the experiences of those employed in the music and live entertainment industry.  The Minister has worked very hard on this, but I am concerned that the supports that have been committed by her Department are somewhat misplaced.  They are not getting to the heart of the problem and the suffering of people directly employed in the music and live entertainment industry.  The moneys committed to the industry as a whole are welcome but they are not reaching the people they need to reach.  I work with those people all the time.  The LPSS is a competitive scheme targeted at venues and promoters.  I am sure the funding awarded to venues and promoters under this scheme is very welcome.  However, for every venue and promoter that got the funding there are likely to be twice as many that did not.  Why are we relying on competitive schemes to support an industry as important to us as this?  It is the lifeblood of who we are in Ireland.  Imagine the uproar if, during the pandemic, support for other industries, such as hospitality, was provided through competitive schemes.  Why do we not treat the music and entertainment industry with the respect it deserves?</p> <p>I have so much to say but my time has run out.  I am sorry we did not have much longer for this discussion.  What will the Minister do for all the musicians who have no money today?  They are facing into Christmas, cannot get their Santa Claus presents and cannot pay their mortgages and heating bills.  What can the Minister do for them today?  I would love an answer to what the Minister will do for them today and for the next month.  That is all.  I know that the Minister has all these schemes, and that everything is together and it has been wonderful, but it is not enough.  I ask the Minister to please meet the musicians and talk to them.  They want to talk to her.  I understand she might be annoyed and frustrated but I am asking her to please talk to them.</p></speech>

We all understand where she is coming from.  I will move to Senator Wall.  I ask Senators to keep to four minutes, if they can.  I will get rid of my four minutes to give them the time, which is fair for me to do.</p></speech>

I also welcome the Minister to the House.  There can be no doubt that one of the industries hit hardest by the Covid pandemic is live music and entertainment.  Once again, it is this industry that is being told it must reduce the numbers attending its venues.  It is those working in this industry who are listening to the prospect of further restrictions in the venues where they perform.</p> <p>I recently raised the case of a late-night venue in my hometown of Athy, whose owners reached out because of falling numbers in that venue.  They were crying out for support and said that unless there was a reintroduction of previous assistance offered by the Government, they would simply have to close their doors with a loss of jobs.  My colleague, Councillor N&iacute;all McNelis, has informed me of the R&oacute;is&iacute;n Dubh venue in Galway.  I have spoken to its owner, Simon Heaslip, who described the current situation as brutal and simply mental torture.  All of his 17 sold-out performances have been cancelled, some of them for the third or fourth time.  Operators must ring those who have booked tickets each time, which is three times more work for staff.  As we all know, December is the most important month for all the operators of live music venues because January, February and March are traditionally the worst months of the year.  Yet, in the case of the R&oacute;is&iacute;n Dubh and many more venues, December is simply a write-off.  </p> <p>I acknowledge the package that was recently announced by the Government.  It will make some difference to those venues but, without the doors opening, their December take will be but a small fraction of what was taken in 2019.  The landlords of these venues must still be paid their rent and those operating the venues must still pay the mortgages on their homes.  Many people I have spoken to, such as Simon Heaslip, acknowledge the Minister's assistance with this brutal situation, as they describe it.  They thank her for it, but they want more and I am sure the Minister knows that they are still suffering.</p> <p>I will also mention the people Senator Black has so eloquently spoken about.  Today, I took the opportunity on Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill to raise the concerns of many performers with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  In acknowledging the reintroduction of the PUP, I asked the Minister to look again at the rates of this payment, especially for those in the live entertainment industry.  In December of last year, the Government, through the Department of Social Protection, increased the threshold for self-employed people who can now earn up to &euro;960 over an eight-week period while retaining their PUP entitlement, which was obviously an increase.  It was rightly welcomed by many at the time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Department of Social Protection described this as a new measure that would allow a self-employed person to take an intermittent job or a one-off gig without losing his or her entitlement.  The problem now, as we all know, for many in the live music industry, and in particular those who find themselves on the lower rate of the PUP, is that they have no more one-off gigs or intermittent jobs.  They have no additional income and they and their families are suffering terribly at this time.</p><p>Members have mentioned Mr. Jackie Conboy and the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland.  My colleague, Senator Sherlock, continues to raise the plight of those stuck on this payment and has highlighted the many issues I have previously spoken about.  I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Black, on her contribution here tonight, which has been very important.  As I am sure the Minister knows from meetings with representatives of the MEAI, many of its members are professional musicians or operate professional supports for the industry.  They also own houses and have families, mortgages and other loans.  They simply cannot repay them at this time because, as I said, there are no more one-off gigs or employment.  I ask the Minister to reach out to the MEAI in the coming days and listen to what it has to say on behalf of its members.  Please help these professionals who are calling out for so much help at this time in the run-up to Christmas.</p><p>There was also supposed to be a three-week review of the reopening after 22 October.  Will the Minister let us know in her reply if it ever took place and what were the findings?  I also ask about the protocol and regulations for community and social halls throughout the country.  It is clear from conversations with colleagues such as Councillor John Pratt in Waterford that online booking is simply not working for them and the halls are not operating.</p><p>I will finish by thanking the Minister once again.  I hope we can work towards a basic income for those in the industry so their talents, which we all enjoy and admire, can be feasible to live on.</p></speech>

I acknowledge her service to the industry and advocacy on its behalf in recent years.  I also echo the request for the Minister to meet the Oireachtas group, although I am not a member of it.  It has sought a meeting and Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and I have also requested a meeting.  We would appreciate that as well.</p> <p>We have warned since the start of the pandemic about the potential impact on musicians and those impacts have been laid out here this evening and are very clear.  People are struggling to pay bills and put food on the table.  Their mental health is hitting rock bottom and talented artists are leaving the sector in their droves.  Many cannot access the supports that are in place.  I can think of big groups like Lankum and The Gloaming, whose success comes from standing on the shoulders of all those who perform in our pubs around the country.  There was mention of MEBAS being introduced again in January and it seems to be the most successful scheme.  It appears that will be needed far sooner in order for people to get through Christmas.  People should not be in competitive or "dog eat dog" schemes, with scraps to be given by promoters, venues and producers.  Many of the people in question are sole traders who rely on pubs and non-ticketed gigs, as I do on the small number of occasions I perform at this point.</p> <p>I will give a minute to Senator Eugene Murphy if he wants.  In the time I have left I will mention the basic income scheme.  There are so many outstanding questions and I wonder what the purpose and design of the scheme will be.  There is to be &euro;25 million spent and the scheme is not means-tested and so on.  Is that the best way to spend this money?  I want to see some type of scheme that gives a weekly payment and we have called for a living wage pilot scheme in the past, although I am not sure about the planned scheme.  I am worried it will be rushed and I am not sure the scheme that is planned is what is required.  Is that the best way to spend &euro;25 million?  I am just not sure and I do not want to see a rushed scheme that ends up really dividing artists and the arts sector.</p></speech>

I certainly echo many of the comments of my colleagues and particularly those so eloquently expressed by Senator Black.  All of us in the Chamber look forward to a day when we can debate arts and culture policy without the impact of Covid-19.  The Minister and her Government have had achievements, including increasing Arts Council funding to &euro;130 million, additional supports for local authorities and the introduction of the basic income scheme.  These are all positive developments but, unfortunately, we are dealing with the challenges of the here and now.</p> <p>I will not go over some of the comments raised to date during this debate but I want to look beyond to some of the specific schemes and the scenario after 9 January.  We cannot continue the position of opening live theatre and events and then closing them again.  The supports are appreciated but it is almost like we allow them to open, we kneecap the sector and then we give people crutches.  If we allow them to open again, we kneecap them again and give them crutches.  That cannot continue and there must be an element of certainty.  Looking beyond 9 January, the problem for theatres and live venues is they are planning a spring schedule and making financial commitments but they do not know what will be the position after 9 January.  I appreciate we cannot predict the trajectory of the virus but it is important that we get decisions for all those venues before 9 January.  I ask the Minister to not make announcements on 8 January about the changes that will happen as that would not be acceptable.  It was tough enough to announce on a Friday specific changes that would happen on the following Tuesday.  I ask the Minister to make that announcement as soon as possible.</p> <p>Another point I make about January is that it might be very different.  By 9 January, if the booster campaign is rolled out as quickly as it seems it might, we should see everybody over 40 and those who are vulnerable triple-vaccinated or at least given that opportunity.  Theatres and live venues are safe and controlled environments.  In places I have gone, I have been asked for the Covid-19 pass and identification.  I have had my temperature checked going into several places.  It is important for the Minister to try, if she can today, to give us some certainty about what might happen from 9 January.  This is important not just for the professional sector but the amateur theatre sector.  We are about to move into the three-act drama festivals taking place right around the country.  Local musicals will be staged over the next number of months.  All of that planning is happening now and the lack of certainty and a clear roadmap is causing a problem.</p> <p>I welcome the supports.  Senator Cummins and I had a Commencement matter last week that the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, took on the Minister's behalf.  It concerned local pantomimes and theatres.  I very much welcome that &euro;5 million fund that will be administered through local authorities.  The difficulty is we do not have details of that scheme.  The problem for many pantomimes and local theatre Christmas productions, as the Minister appreciates, is they are on now or are being planned for January.  Those groups are already ringing the local authorities, who do not know what will happen.  It makes perfect sense to channel the money through the local authorities but we must ensure the money is there and it is a simple scheme that is easy to administer to get the money into the hands of those groups as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Other than that I echo the comments of Senator Black and everyone else.  In all the schemes, the most important point is getting the money into the hands of musicians and artists.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister and the Leader for facilitating statements this evening on a critical topic.</p> <p>The Minister is aware the live theatre, arts and events industry has had what can only be described as a torrid 20 months.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The impact of closures, curtailments, restricted audiences, social distancing and cancellations has been devastating for lives and livelihoods.  This industry adds so much to the rich cultural and social tapestry of our country but it is often misunderstood.  I have purposely used the word &quot;industry&quot; because there is a perception that those involved in theatre, the arts, dance and other disciplines and events do it as a hobby, but the reality is that this is a valuable sector which supports many thousands of workers who have, at times, felt undervalued during the pandemic.  As a result, there is a degree of scepticism out there which is hard to overcome.<br/><br/>Last week's swift announcement by the Minister of the &euro;50 million support package has allayed some of those fears and demonstrated that the Government is willing to step in to support producers, organisers, groups and performers who have been financially impacted by the capacity limits placed on venues.  While I do not understand the logic which says that public transport can operate at 100% while safe venues like theatres can only operate at 50%, I accept the decisions made by the Government on the basis of public health advice.  However, it is difficult for us as politicians to explain to the likes of a youngster who was due to go to a pantomime why he or she cannot do so, while Broadway and the West End operate at 100% capacity.  We are where we are, however.<br/><br/>I wrote to the Minister on this topic within a couple of hours of the announcement on 7 December and I thank her for taking on some of the suggestions I put in that letter regarding the turnover requirement in reducing the production cost.  It has brought so many more people into the net and is extremely welcome.  If moneys additional to the &euro;3 million are required under that scheme, I hope they are provided.<br/><br/>I also thank her for taking on board the suggestions put forward by Senator Malcolm Byrne and I last week, when the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, took a Commencement matter we tabled regarding having a funding mechanism through local authorities for community and not-for-profit organisations in the process of putting on productions or midstream in terms of productions.  I gave two examples of Waterford Panto Society and the producers of <i>A Christmas Carol </i>at Garter Lane, who made the brave decision to continue with their productions and had to face the logistical challenge of deciding what 50% would attend, and also face significant financial loss.  It is important that clarity is brought to the local element of the scheme.  It is right and proper that it be administered through the local authority sector because that sector knows and understands those groups best.  Urgency is required in respect of this matter.<br/><br/>I will conclude with a general point on the administration of schemes and the at times complex nature of the application process.  There is a perception that it is only certain organisations and people that get arts funding repeatedly.  Much of that is down to the complex nature at times of the application process.  A body of work needs to be done in the Department and the Arts Council to simplify that process and open up those funding streams so the money, as other Senators have said, gets to those who need it most.  I thank the Minister and wish her continued success in her role.</p></speech>

She did not expect to be hit by this tsunami.  When Covid first hit, we thought it would be over in a number of weeks.  We see where we are now.  I know the Minister understands that it has been a hard time for musicians.  She might take the following point on board.  When the stakeholders forum takes place, sometimes in that debate the smaller musicians and engineers are forgotten.  That is not intentional but they get lost in the big debate.  That is where we are coming from.  There is a cohort of workers there, though not a huge number, that are in a bit of bother and I know the Minister and her officials will address that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-12-16a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021121600002#WW00300"><p>I thank everyone for their contributions.  I understand and appreciate the passion with which each Senator spoke and acknowledge how difficult these restrictions have been and continue to be, how cruel they are and the havoc Covid-19 has wrought on the live performance sector.  I want to make it clear that I have nothing but respect for the musicians of this country.   I respect the passion each Senator has and their contributions, but I have nothing but passion and respect for musicians.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Ireland remains vulnerable to a further deterioration in the disease profile, depending on a number of factors, including the levels of social contact in the coming weeks and over the festive period.  That is why, unfortunately, we had to introduce these additional measures to protect public health.</p> <p>Many Senators raised issues relating to the PUP and they have also been raised by the stakeholders I have engaged with.  My Department officials have in turn flagged them with the Department of Social Protection.  In the D&aacute;il earlier, the T&aacute;naiste said he would engage directly with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, today, which I welcome, to see if there could be flexibility.  We do not want to see people facing this at Christmastime.  I welcome that recognition from the T&aacute;naiste and, if Senator Black was not already aware of it, I am sure she will too.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about planning for what will happen after 9 January.  That was on my mind when that restriction was put in place until 9 January and that is why I have said the money for the cancelling and curtailing of events goes through to the end of January.  I signal now that there will be a minimum of &euro;14 million so people can plan right through to June.  There is a Covid contingency fund which, with the help of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, I have tapped into to get this extra money.  I will not be found wanting and will look for more money if the industry needs it.  It is so the industry can plan, if there are restrictions.  Please God there will not be.  I keep hoping the industry will open, our theatres will be full and we will all enjoy music in every corner of Ireland.  However, if we cannot, I am saying they should plan because we will help them.  My Department will make it viable for them to plan until June so I urge them to plan and employ musicians.  We are stepping in.  That is critical to the next phase after 9 January.</p> <p>I and my Department will continue to engage meaningfully with stakeholders.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I met with the live performance stakeholders last week.  Senator Murphy referred to people being left behind but we are strict that every one gets the same time.  No one gets to speak for ten minutes while others speak for two.  It is timed so each is treated with equality.  We met them all and stakeholder engagement has been at the heart of everything I have done as a Minister.  As recently as Monday, my officials and advisers met with representatives of the music and live entertainment sector again.  Yesterday, we hosted a historic engagement with over 150 artists, arts workers and representative bodies because it is important that they shape the basic income for the arts pilot.</p> <p>Senator Warfield asked if are we doing the right thing here.  I am following what artists asked for.  This was the number one recommendation from them.  I thought it was important that they shape it.  Nothing is set in stone yet because I want the artists to shape this basic income.  This is their demand to me through the arts and culture recovery task force and I am responding because it is about time we started valuing the arts by giving them this basic income.</p> <p>Many speakers referenced the MEAI.  My Department has had consistent engagement with that group.  I have engaged with it on eight separate occasions since the pandemic began and there have been 21 departmental engagements on top of that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=16"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is not to mention the numerous phone calls and messages that take place out of hours and over the weekends.  To say that I am not listening or not engaging is simply incorrect.  I am fiercely supportive of musicians, local artists and arts workers.  Their sector is large and there are many representative groups with which I frequently engage to hear their feedback first hand.  That includes the MEAI, the Live Venue Collective, the Events Industry Alliance, the Large Venue Association, the National Campaign for the Arts, the Independent Producers Forum, EPIC, and the Wedding Bands Association which Senator Currie mentioned.  We have engaged with them and they received money from the live performance support scheme, LPSS.  They were quick to say thank you.  We have engaged with the Wedding Bands Association and continue to do so.  </p><p>The music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, was developed in close consultation with the MEAI because it said it needed it to reach its members.  It was launched in June 2021.  Initially &euro;14 million was reserved to deliver the scheme.  That was over-estimated by those involved.  I am grateful for the advocacy groups such as MEAI which endeavour to represent workers in its sector.  More than 1,000 recipients have received &euro;3 million in business supports through each of the three variations of the MEBAS initiative.  Since its launch 628 freelancers, sole traders, musicians, businesses, bands and crew were awarded the business expense support grants ranging from &euro;2,500 to &euro;5,000.  The scheme, in consultation after meeting with the MEAI, was adjusted again in August at its request to allow for businesses with a turnover of &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 to come within the threshold.  That allowed an additional 74 businesses and sole traders to meet the limits.  No demonstration of costs was required.  They just had to say that they had costs to get the MEBAS grant.  That was following consultation with the MEAI.</p><p>I recognise that even this lower level intervention is important for musicians survival to meet their business costs.  Some 386 grants have been awarded in the latest phase.  That covers business costs up to the end of December.  Payments are continuing.  I am delighted to confirm that another round will be delivered in January 2022.  </p><p>The LPSS announced last week is a non-competitive scheme.  The previous LPSS supported more than 50,000 musicians.  It is not the case that the supports I announced last week are all for ticketed events.  They cover non-ticketed events too.  We are clear that the Government introducing these restrictions in the run up to Christmas, the most economically important time of the year for live performance and pantomime, is disappointing.  It is beyond a bitter disappointment that we have arrived again at this point.  This industry has been asked countless times to shoulder the burden of protecting society and those around them to the detriment of their livelihoods and mental health.  At all times I am trying to support them in every possible way through engaging with them.  I am profoundly grateful to their sacrifice.  We are thankful for the joy that they bring to our lives and their incredible work.  I want them back singing again.  With every scheme we devise, we in the Department ask ourselves, "How can we help them and how can we help them get the money?"  I am constantly thinking about the musicians, their livelihoods and putting food on the table.  </p><p>We had hoped not to take the backwards step in the lengthy process of reopening all parts of society and the economy but the path of the pandemic has not proved to be predictably linear and that is why the &euro;50 million was announced last week.</p><p>As I said, a Covid contingency fund of &euro;4 billion is there.  That is where I got the extra &euro;25 million from last week.  If necessary, we will return to that fund if our musicians and artists need it.  The fund is to provide certainty and flexibility for the public finances should the situation around the virus deteriorate further.  If further funding is required, I will seek additional support from the fund and the sector can be certain that we will not be found wanting.</p><p>I hope I have reassured Senators of the vast depth of support, respect and commitment that I have for the arts, culture, music and entertainment sector.  That goes to the core of everything I do.</p></speech>
