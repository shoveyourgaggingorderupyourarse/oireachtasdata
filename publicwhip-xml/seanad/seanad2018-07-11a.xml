    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1416" speakername="Martin Conway" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#A00400"><p>I apologise for being slightly late.  I have come directly from a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality.   I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to the House.</p> <p>I raise this Commencement matter because there is an inequity in the system.  Pay restoration is a fundamental principle across society, whether in the private or public sector.  Many members of the public took a hit from 2008 or 2009 until 2014 or 2015 and their pay is now gradually being restored.  There have been numerous examples of pay restoration, in particular across the public sector.  It is likely that full pay restoration will be achieved in the next budget or the one thereafter.</p> <p>However, in budget 2012 the pension guidelines, entitlements, structures and so on  were changed for a group of pensioners who, prior to 2012, had a legitimate expectation to a specific level of pension entitlement when they retired.  Under the new guidelines, many of those born in 1948 lost benefits to which they would have been entitled had they been born a couple of years later.  A specific number of people have been affected by the changes.</p> <p>The entire cost of reverting to the pre-budget 2012 guidelines would be approximately &euro;270 million.  An inequity has been created by the changes.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, should consider reverting to the pre-budget 2012 guidelines.  Doing so would not open a floodgate but, rather, help a specific number of people at a cost of &euro;270 million.  I do not ask for the entitlements to be backdated but, rather, that the former level of benefit now be restored.  If that cannot be done immediately, I ask that a timeline for such be put in place.</p> <p>The Department is fully aware of the circumstances of the issue because a constituent of mine has gone to the trouble of researching the matter, putting the figures together and making a case to the Department.  Parliamentary questions on the matter have been tabled by Deputies.  The case put forward by my constituent is fair and well articulated.  This is a question of equity and fairness.  I sincerely hope the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, will right the wrong done to these people, who have paid their taxes, served their country well and done their duty, or at least give a timeframe for that to be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#A00500"><p>I thank Senator Conway for giving me the opportunity to address this issue on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty.  The current rate bands applying to the State pension were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000, and more accurately reflect the social insurance contribution history of a person.  A reversal of the rate bands for post-2012 pensioners to the 2000-2012 rate band percentages would carry an estimated cost of &euro;73 million in 2018, including inflows from other payments such as the non-contributory State pension and increases for qualified adults, and rise at a rate of &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million per annum.  That would mean an extra cost of approximately &euro;85 million in 2019 and &euro;97 million in 2020.</p> <p>Better-off pensioners who do not qualify for means-tested pension payments and did not make sufficient contributions to the Social Insurance Fund to qualify for a full-rate contributory pension would be the main beneficiaries of a reversal of the changes.  Prior to the introduction of the current rate bands, a person with an average of 20 pay-related social insurance, PRSI, contributions per year over his or her working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 to 52 contributions.</p> <p>The Government does not propose the reversal of the rate band changes.  Rather, it intends to introduce a total contributions approach to establish the level of entitlement for all new contributory State pension claims form 2020 onwards.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is currently the subject of a public consultation which stays open until 3 September and is available on the Department's website.  The total contribution approach, TCA, will ensure that the totality of a person's social insurance contributions, as opposed to the timing of them, will determine their final pension outcome.  In particular, it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace while raising families or in a full-time caring role.</p><p>The roadmap for pensions reform 2018-2023 sets out how it is intended to implement the TCA to calculating entitlement to the contributory State pension.  In the interim, on 23 January, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection announced the agreement of the Government to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated under a total contributions approach which will include up to 20 years of a new home caring credit.  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes, who are currently assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the contributory State pension.  A person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new home caring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where he or she satisfies the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to ten years of other credits, for example, awarded when on jobseeker's or illness benefit, may also be used, subject to the total credits not exceeding 20 years.  People whose entitlements were assessed after the September 2012 rate changes will have the option to be reassessed under a TCA option and be paid whichever is the more beneficial amount.</p><p>Work is under way to draft legislation to enable implementation of these arrangements.  In parallel with bringing in the legislative changes, information technology, IT, system solutions are being developed to implement the changes.  In the final quarter of this year, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will begin inviting relevant recipients of the contributory State pension to seek a review of their pension calculations with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019, backdated to 30 March 2018.  </p></speech>

I will advise my client to feed into the review.  It is an issue the House will address again in September because there is an inequity in this area.  Perhaps we will need to do more research to be able to articulate the inequity a little more.  I encourage everybody following proceedings who has an interest in this issue to feed into the review because it is important.  The more people participate in the review and engage with the process, the better and more reflective of society the outcomes will be.  I encourage people to participate.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to address this issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1396" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#B00400"><p>I welcome the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, to the House and thank him for taking time out of his busy schedule to be here.  It is much appreciated.</p> <p>I would like to discuss the North-South interconnector.  It goes without saying that An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision in 2016 regarding the North-South interconnector was met with a tsunami of disappointment, anger and frustration by the people affected.  If EirGrid thought that was the end of the matter and people would take this decision lying down, it was very much mistaken.  Two years on, the determination of the people affected is as strong as it has ever been.  I have attended a number of meetings throughout the Cavan-Monaghan area and have witnessed at first hand that resolve.</p> <p>Those affected received a shot in the arm by recent court decisions on both sides of the Border, one in Northern Ireland and a second in the Supreme Court.  The High Court in Northern Ireland ruled that planning permission granted for a &pound;240 million waste incinerator had been unlawfully authorised.  Planning permission for the facility had been approved by a civil servant in the Department for Infrastructure in 2017.  This landmark ruling would have a wide-ranging effect on the North-South Interconnector as it too was signed off on by a civil servant and not a Government Minister.  At this point, I am sure the Minister will agree that all of us would like to the institutions in Northern Ireland back up and running for the benefit of all.  I appeal to Sinn F&eacute;in and the Democratic Unionist Party to lead those who elected them to lead.  The other shot in the arm was the Supreme Court's decision in favour of a Meath lady by the name of Maura Sheehy, a landowner affected by the proposed line.  The court agreed to hear the case put forward by the North East Pylon Pressure Campaign.  I understand the case is due to be heard at the end of this month.  </p> <p>In 2017, the Minister signed off on a procurement process for the installation of 409 pylons both North and South of the Border.  At the time, we felt the Minister's decision was probably premature, to put it mildly, but I recall that he stated in his defence that it could be rescinded at any time.  Given the decision by the courts, the fact that planning permission no longer exists for the facility in Northern Ireland and the Supreme Court case on the proposal in the South, the time is now ripe for the Minister to rescind his decision and ask EirGrid to withdraw from the tender process for these pylons.  It would be a sensible thing to do and a good gesture on the Minister's part.  </p> <p>As the Minister is aware, the residents along the route, including in counties Monaghan and Cavan, remain resolutely opposed to the proposal.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas have passed motions which seem to have fallen on deaf ears.  Coupled with everything else that has happened over the years, this has only served to strengthen the will of the people that if this project is to go ahead, it must be undergrounded.  Here we are ten years down the road and much has happened and many changes have occurred in that period.  Technology moves on.  I recall that when this project was introduced, we were told it would be 30 times more expensive to underground than to overground it.  Most people on all sides now agree that undergrounding would not cost much more than overgrounding.  At the time, EirGrid told us that from an engineering perspective, it was not possible to underground the interconnector.  By its own admission, a few years on, the company now says it is possible to underground it.  We have seen examples of projects similar to this in Belgium and Germany that have been undergrounded.  </p> <p>It is ten years on and things have changed but the one thing that has not changed and is as strong today as at any time in the past is the will of the people to ensure this project does not go ahead.  From meetings I have attended and people I have spoken to, I assure the Minister that as far as the people and landowners along the route are concerned, not one single pylon will ever see the light of day.  That is the message I am getting loud and clear and it is the message I would like to give to the Minister.</p> <p>I congratulate the action groups in Monaghan, Meath and Cavan for their continued work.  I hail the resolve of the people who are as determined today as they have ever been.  I ask the Minister to instruct EirGrid to withdraw from the tender process to see where this is going because we are in a legal limbo at the moment and God knows how long it will be before we are out of it.  Question marks hang over the independent report that was promised.  We seek the report's publication.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#B00500"><p>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this issue.  The North-South interconnector is vital infrastructure in delivering the objectives of Ireland's energy policy, namely, ensuring competitiveness and security of supply.  It will also ensure a safe and sustainable source of energy for the jurisdictions of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The interconnector, as proposed as an overhead line, was granted planning permission in Ireland in December 2016.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Denis Naughten:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Following a planning process in Northern Ireland, the section of the project in that jurisdiction was also granted planning permission in January 2018.  The construction of the project and all related procurement activities are operational matters for EirGrid and ESB Networks in respect of which I have no function.  The 2012 Government policy statement on the strategic importance of transmission and other energy infrastructure states that "Government does not seek to direct EirGrid and ESB Networks or other energy infrastructure developers to particular sites or routes or technologies".  However, I respect fully that this project gives rise to concerns for a number of people, particularly those living in close proximity to the proposed project.  In fact, I was the first Minister in a decade to meet with the groups and listen directly to their concerns.</p><p>Following the planning decision in Ireland, two motions calling for an updated independent study into the North-South interconnector were passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and this House in early 2017.  I subsequently commissioned two studies designed to address the main points of the motions as well as key concerns expressed by those opposed to the development of an overhead line.  Some impacts such as environmental and health concerns will not be assessed since the statutory planning process is the appropriate method by which such impacts are assessed and evaluated.  The consultants undertaking the two studies have completed their respective reports and they were submitted to my Department earlier this year.  They have now been fully considered by my Department and submitted to me.  It is my intention that the reports will be brought to Government as soon as possible and made publicly available on my Department's website.</p><p>There are a number of ongoing legal issues in Northern Ireland which are ultimately matters for the authorities there.  The judgment of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland on 6 July relates to a different project, although it has been acknowledged that it could have wider implications for decision-making in Northern Ireland, not just in relation to infrastructure but to the operation of government and decision-making generally.  It is to be expected that the judgment will be studied over the coming weeks by authorities on both sides of the Border as to any implications for the North-South interconnector project.</p><p>To answer Senator Gallagher's question, I made it clear when I signed off on the procurement process that this could be paused or stopped at various stages in the process.  I gave that commitment to the D&aacute;il, definitely, and I may have given it here as well.  I stand over that.  It was the only basis on which I allowed the process to commence.  I am monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

There is a certain element of frustration in relation to the non-publication of the reports.  I wonder if the Minister has an actual date for publication or whether he can provide a timeframe within which we can expect publication to occur.  On the tendering process, the ordinary man or woman in the street will be of the view that if one is undertaking a major infrastructure project such as the one under discussion, one would not send out a tender document looking for people to price the construction of it until one was sure one had planning permission.  That is how one would approach a shopping centre project, for example.  This is because, with the passage of time, material prices may go up or down and one cannot be sure one is getting value for money.  With respect, the Minister is a sensible individual and the sensible thing to do here is withdraw the tender process until we see what the road ahead looks like.  At the moment, we cannot say how long that road will be or how long we will be in abeyance on both sides of the Border from a legal perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#C00300"><p>This tender process is not just for the construction or potential construction of the route.  As such, one cannot compare it to a shopping centre.  To go ahead with the development of a shopping centre, one needs to know where the doors of each unit and the exits will be and what the overall design is.  This process involves the design of transmission masts as well as the detailed design work.  This is in order to meet the set timelines.  As the Senator knows, there is a huge issue with electricity supply in Northern Ireland.  In fairness, it is on both sides of the Border.  All parties involved accept and acknowledge that there will be a severe shortage of electricity post the early 2020s in Northern Ireland which is an issue that must be addressed from an economic development point of view.  There are many other aspects to it.  The courts process in Ireland and Northern Ireland is not a matter in which I can get involved except to note that there are issues here and in the other jurisdiction which we are monitoring closely.  I am constantly engaged through my officials in relation to various aspects of this.</p></speech>

My D&aacute;il colleagues, Deputies Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh and Pat Buckley, raised the matter as a Topical Issue last night and I hope the Minister of State is not going to read out what was read out to them.  We need to move on and work to get this vital service restored for our young children and adolescents.  The Minister of State knows about Linn Dara.  Last year, half of the beds in the inpatient unit were closed down and on Friday that happened to the day programme servicing the inpatient unit and outpatients to keep people at home to be treated in the community as per A Vision for Change.  In 2006, it was announced that there would be 15 of these units opened across the country.  We had three and are now down to two.  We cannot stand over that.  We cannot stand over the chipping away, brick-by-brick, at child and adolescent mental health services.  The Minister of State has been frequently involved with the Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care and he knows about the absolute crisis in services for children.  Many services are not being provided.</p> <p>The Minister of State should not listen to the management of the HSE, he should listen to me and those people who are on the ground regarding their experience of how this service was shut down.  On 11 June, the consultant was told by the director of services of concerns regarding staffing in CAMHS at the Linn Dara day programme.  The possibility arose because the supporting CAMHS in Clondalkin was in dire straits.  The consultant was willing to support the services in Clondalkin and formulated a solution with staff to provide 50% of capacity to Clondalkin with 50% remaining in the afternoon.  It was half and half.  Staff would go to Clondalkin in the morning and return to Linn Dara to carry out the assessments, appointments and therapies in the diary to provide long-awaited services to adolescents and children.  As such, two members of staff went to Clondalkin and nothing else happened between 11 June and 27 June.  On 27 June, an email was circulated by senior management instructing and advising of the closure of the day hospital programme on 6 July, which was last Friday.  The senior manager went on to say the service should not inform any of the families directly about the closure and should continue to make appointments at 3.55 p.m. on Friday for children who have been on those waiting lists for a long time.  This order not to inform families was the entire concern of management.  They refused to communicate directly with the families or the staff.  They said they would not issue letters to cancel appointments because they did not want them to end up on the Joe Duffy show.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The closure was kept quiet.  Last Monday the team members were instructed to commence working in their new posts, but, again, they were not consulted.  The closure has caused massive distress and led to significant consequences for the adults involved and their families.  All of the adults were discharged prematurely from the day programme last Friday, 6 July.  In the space of just one week the families were informed of the closure and that their loved ones would be discharged from the programme.  The unit has ceased operations.  We have been told that it will be reopened in September or October, but that is absolute balderdash, as I know that staff have been told that the issue will be reviewed in November.  That does not mean, however, that the unit will be reopened.  Consultants have been offered the opportunity to return, but the same courtesy has not been shown to any of the team.</p><p>I urge the Minister of State to show leadership.  I want him to tell the HSE that enough is enough, that the people affected have had enough, that everything has changed and that it is the people of the nation and their children who are in dire straits.  I plead with him to show leadership and provide assistance for the people concerned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#D00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  It is the policy of the HSE, as reflected in its annual service plans, to provide an age appropriate mental health service for those under the age of 18 years.  I reiterate the Government's commitment, in view of the significant additional funding allocated in recent years for the development of all aspects of the mental health service, including services for young people.  I will continue to make the case for the allocation of further resources annually in line with evolving demands and in accordance with the commitments given in A Programme for a Partnership Government.</p> <p>The HSE service plan 2018 commits to further developing the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  This is against a background where the demand for access to CAMHS increased by 26% between 2012 and 2017 and where various youth mental health initiatives, other than the specialist CAMHS service, are also being progressed.</p> <p>We have 69 CAMHS teams and three paediatric liaison teams that are supported by around 75 CAMHS beds nationally.  Further beds are planned to come onstream as quickly as possible.  In addition, the Government has agreed to fund an extra 140 psychiatric nurse undergraduate places each year to help to improve the planning and delivery of services in the next few years.</p> <p>A key difficulty being addressed on a steady basis by the HSE is staff recruitment and retention, particularly in the sphere of CAMHS.  The recent appointment by the executive of 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists will help to develop counselling services in primary care.  It is anticipated that these posts will deal with the less complex child and adolescent cases and thereby reduce the demand on CAMHS.  In addition, I recently approved ten new posts of advanced nurse practitioners, ANPs, that will be specifically directed at the CAMHS service nationally.  The new ANPs will play a key role in delivering better service co-ordination where local service pressures are greatest.</p> <p>The HSE Linn Dara CAMHS service covers a region comprising County Kildare, west Wicklow and south west Dublin and reflects a total population of around 420,000.  There are seven multi-disciplinary community CAMHS teams for these areas.  The HSE has indicated that a decision was taken by the Linn Dara management team to temporarily suspend its day programme from Friday, 6 July.  This was to maintain essential community and inpatient services.  It is expected that the day programme will reopen in September or October.  The decision was taken owing to psychiatry and allied health professional temporary staffing shortages within the community sectors.  To maintain essential provision of services, psychiatry and multi-disciplinary staff have been reassigned from the adolescent day programme to maintain other key community-based Linn Dara services and manage their overall capacity at this time.  The small number of young people who were scheduled to attend the adolescent day programme will continue to attend their existing community CAMHS teams and receive appropriate individual and therapeutic programmes.</p> <p>The HSE has a statutory responsibility to ensure safe, adequate and sufficient service provision in all areas of the CAMHS service.  The Linn Dara inpatient unit will remain fully operational as normal, with 22 beds available, as well as functioning community teams.  The Senator may rest assured that I will keep this matter under close review and that all efforts will continue to be made by the HSE to address ongoing service difficulties at Linn Dara.</p></speech>

I implore the Minister of State to, please, change his script and find a way to resolve the matter.  He has mentioned that a "small number" of young people are involved.  The CAMHS service covers a region with a population of 420,000, yet only 45 young people are treated annually, while waiting times, as we know, are off the Richter scale.</p> <p>I welcome the recent announcement of ten new posts of advanced nurse practitioners.  I plead with the Minister of State to listen to me.  The unit's team provided a solution.  Superficially, it was accepted by the senior management team, but, sadly, a week later it reneged on the offer and the unit's team was told not to ask questions, to close the doors within a week and not tell the parents.  Management did not consult the staff.  We need to change that script in that regard.  A solution was provided this year, just as it was last year, but it was not taken on board.  As legislators, we cannot stand by as children's health is at risk.  Therefore, we need to show leadership by saying to the HSE senior management team that the closure will not happen and asking why it did not talk to us beforehand.</p> <p>The Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care will continue to pursue this matter.  The HSE turned down an invitation to appear before the committee today after initially accepting it to give its version of events which is the same as that of the Minister of State.  I urge him to find out more about the matter and not accept the HSE's bland excuses about staff shortages because they fly in the face of the evidence that I have in my possession.</p></speech>

There is an issue that affects staffing and it is cross-sectoral.  I am sure the Senator is well aware of the staffing issues, as she is very close to the staff.  Therefore, she understands the issues and the challenges.  However, I must view the issue at a policy level and identify the challenges at a national level.</p> <p>The day programme has been suspended temporarily for the summer months in order to accommodate and ensure continuity of inpatient and community services.  It is very important that best use be made of the available resources.  I support the HSE in its efforts to widen the scope of the service and ensure it will continue.  I understand the number of children impacted on by the change to the day programme is fewer than three.  When I say impacted on, I use the them carefully because the children concerned continue to avail of services in their communities.  The community CAMHS teams are delivering the services as opposed to the day programme run by Linn Dara.</p> <p>CAMHS has grown exponentially in the past few years.  The amount of money the State and the Government have put into developing it is astounding.  We have moved from a situation where 20,000 people were in institutional residential care during the 1960s to one where the number is just 1,000 people.  We have done so by building community teams and developing and growing CAMHS.  I, therefore, ask the Senator to withdraw her remark that attempts are being made to dismantle the service brick by brick because nothing could be further from the truth.</p></speech>

I recall that I made such a proposal about two years ago owing to increasing pressure on the State to provide long-term residential and respite care.  One of the proposals made called for the setting up of a biannual meeting of all of the key players.  They included the Department of Health, the HSE, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, the Irish Medical Organisation and Nursing Homes Ireland.  Such a meeting would allow them to meet and deal with challenges arising in the area.  Over 23,500 people live in private residential care settings under the fair deal scheme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have another 6,000 to 7,000 in community care services.  There is going to be a huge change in the demographics, with the number reaching 85 years of age increasing all of the time.  The number reaching 65 years of age is also increasing.  Therefore, there will be huge challenges.  Likewise, there will be huge challenges in hospitals because of the growth in population.  The figure used is that 51% of all hospital beds are occupied by people over 65 years of age.  If there is an increase in that demographic, there will be an increase in the demand for beds in hospitals.  Therefore, there will have to be a faster response from hospitals in trying to provide step-down care facilities.  It is in that context that I propose a forum be set up to deal with the issue of long-term care that would meet either once every three months or once every six months to tease out issues arising and that there be a fast response from both the HSE and the Department in order that they would act before issues arose that would have to be acted on urgently.  It is in that context that I raise the issue.</p></speech>

It is very real and there is no argument about it from my end, as the Senator is aware.  I support his endeavours to have it addressed in a broader context and have a facility for all stakeholders and all those with an interest in and a working knowledge of what is going on in the sector.  I have no difficulty in that regard.  As the Senator outlined, people are living longer than ever before and success in improving health outcomes and extending life expectancy has been achieved.  The projected numbers of older people are stark, to say the least.</p> <p>The report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, Sl&aacute;intecare, supports a significant shift in the model of care to one that is focused on prevention and early intervention and which will provide most care in the community.  It is crucial that the appropriate supports be in place to match each person&rsquo;s needs at whatever point he or she is at in the interaction with the healthcare system.  The Senator is a particular proponent of the policy of prevention, rather than cure, and that we work with people in the community to try to prevent difficulties, but we also know that it is a fact of life that a large population will invariably require long-term nursing care in a residential setting, no matter what efforts we make to avoid this.</p> <p>The Senator will be aware that the Department is developing a statutory home supports scheme.  An important step in the development of the new scheme was a consultation process which was carried out in 2017, the purpose of which was to allow everyone with views on this topic to have his or her say.  There was a very high response rate, with approximately 2,600 submissions received.  A report on the findings of the consultation process was published last month.</p> <p>Planning for future services will continue and it will be informed fully by the views and concerns of all stakeholders.  However, this is not an issue that can be readily progressed by the kind of forum proposed by the Senator.  The decisions that remain to be taken are less about what we need to do but about how to do it.  It relates in large part to resourcing and the balancing of priorities within the health sector and government overall.  I am pleased to inform the Senator that I will host a conference later this year on housing for older people which will bring together key stakeholders to share best practice and discuss how best to meet the needs of older people.</p> <p>As the Senator knows, I have a particular interest in addressing the long-term care needs of older people in communities and supported living environments.  Notwithstanding this, the Senator's point is valid.  I support the validity of his request, to have it considered furthe, that we have a specific forum, but what we do not want is a duplication of fora.  We want to ensure we build it in, but I do know from where the Senator is coming.  I have heard the case being made before and I am supportive and welcoming of it to ensure we can accommodate more voices at the table.  The Senator mentioned some of the stakeholders, including Nursing Homes Ireland and the IMO.  The conference we will organise in September, October or November will look at the long-term residential care needs of older people, not specifically in institutionalised settings but more in the community in supported housing.  All of the people whom the Senator mentioned will have a role to play and a contribution to make.  That will be part of the conversation.  As opposed to isolating it to residential care settings, we hope to broaden it out.</p></speech>

Likewise, when they go to the HSE, the response is that it must go and talk to the Department.  Their view is that even if such a forum was to meet only once every six months, all of the stakeholders would sit down to talk about the issues and how they could be addressed before they became a real problem.  It is in that context that they have raised the issue.  They are being told that one party has to consult the other.  As a result, they are finding that they have to go back and forth.  They state a meeting on a biannual basis would help in dealing with a lot of the issues that arise.</p></speech>

They are people who just want to be heard in a forum that is more complete in order that they are not potentially operating in a vacuum where one partner states it needs to discuss an issue with another.  I have discussed the matter with Nursing Home Ireland and understand from where it is coming.  Therefore, in the interests of completeness, I will certainly have the conversation on the Senator's behalf and progress the matter within the Department and the HSE to see if we can work out the detail of how it would work, be it a forum, a round table discussion or a biannual meeting.  We must ensure people's voices will be heard on a more regular basis in a more complete setting where every voice will be represented at the table at a given time in order that answers will be more readily available to them.</p></speech>

Youths have been arrested, shots fired at security forces and there has been a return to inter-communal strife between residents of the Bogside and Fountain areas of Derry.  Those issues must be addressed, although there will not be time to so do in this session.  The ongoing drift in Northern Ireland caused by the absence of a functioning Assembly in Stormont has led to a lack of decisions and inadequate progress in the peace process.  It is of concern to all Senators.  I ask the Leader to allocate time for us to comprehensively address that matter in the next session.</p> <p>All Senators are concerned by the health service.  The HSE has money lying idle for home helps but a staffing crisis is preventing it being used.  This issue does not affect only my county.  In Galway, Mayo and Roscommon there were 45,000 unused home care hours in the first three months of this year.  One in every four people in the country waiting for home help is in that area but no HSE staff are available to carry out the work.  There is a systems failure of monumental proportions not just in terms of the startling home help crisis but across the health service and that must be addressed.  A trolley crisis, equivalent to that in the annual January peak period, occurs daily.  That is another systems failure.  People arriving by ambulance at Cork University Hospital may wait for three hours before the ambulance can release them to the care of the accident and emergency department to receive treatment.  Step-down beds are available in hospitals such as those in Kenmare, Dingle and Tralee but there are insufficient staffing levels to be able to allow patients use them.  Meanwhile, the HSE is spending hundreds of millions of euro on agency staff.  All of those issues point to a systems failure in our health service.</p> <p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, is responsible for much legislation of huge importance which has come before the Seanad, whether from his Department or through the Department of Justice and Equality by proxy.  However, Ryanair has cancelled 30 flights and a proposed strike tomorrow will affect businesses and the economy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Despite this, while the Minister is willing to intervene in just about every other system and every other Department, he will not intervene in his own to ensure that flights continue between Ireland and the rest of the world.

The representatives outlined the stark reality of what work is like for their nurses.  I will read a short passage for the House:</p><blockquote>The reality of the ED Nurses daily/nightly experience is described as deep frustration and anger at the fact that they feel unable to care for their patient's fundamental needs in the way they would wish and are trained to do.  The physical environment where patients are crammed together within touching distance of each other, with little or no privacy, poor hygiene facilities are inadequate to maintain patient dignity or privacy.  This is a dehumanising and degrading experience for patients, their relatives and those that care for them is, and is now in its second decade.</blockquote> <p>That sums up what is happening in our hospital emergency departments and the conditions in which nurses have to work and in which patients are treated.</p><p>I refer to the previous speaker who talked about home help.  The fact is Fianna F&aacute;il went through this country and took hours from people who were vulnerable and elderly.  A 99 year old man in Westport was told that he could not even have two hours' home help a week under Fianna F&aacute;il.  That was the reality of it.  When it was supposed to stand up to the troika and protect our heath services, it offered them up as a sacrifice as it bankrupted the country.  I will not take lectures from Fianna F&aacute;il on what is happening within the home help service now.</p></speech>

There is now an opportunity for the HSE to get back into negotiations on the price, which it did not do in the first place, and to look at the conditions around the expert evidence available at the time.  I want the Minister for Health to outline the timeline and process involved in the approval of Translarna and to take responsibility for it.

This index is a measure of progress across all 17 sustainable development goals.  Countries like Sweden, Denmark and Finland are top of the ranking in terms of their progress towards achieving their goals by 2030.  It was no shock to see that, with regard to the sustainable development goals relating to the environment, Ireland is on the red list, which means we have a very poor status.  When it comes to the proportion of renewable energy in the total amount of electricity we consume, we have a red mark and a very poor rating.  When it comes to responsible consumption and production, again Ireland fares really badly.  On climate action and energy emissions, again we see a red dot and Ireland performing very poorly.  On sustainable development goal 14, life below water, Ireland receives a red dot in respect of ocean health.  Ireland again performs very badly.  We seem to be missing leadership when it comes to environment and water health.  In fact, with regard to life on land, Ireland is not performing and receives a red mark in respect of the annual change in forest area.  We are not, in any way, moving towards achieving the sustainable development goals we have signed up to by 2030.</p> <p>I want the Members of the House to be aware of this.  We have to work together and we have to try to meet our international obligations.

They show how dangerous it is to allow any opportunity for dissident republicans to take up this thing.  In fact, it shows how volatile the situation would be if there were any attempt to institute a Border again in this country.  With regard to setting a spark, incendiary activities and all the rest of it, these bonfires that the so-called Protestants set up are appalling.  I am glad that I am a member of the Church of Ireland, which is the reformed Catholic Church in this country and which is not associated with this shower up in the North of Ireland.  These monumental, enormous, vast skyscrapers are partly triumphalism and partly these people marking out their territory.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They seem to be very threatened, but I would say to them that the only way forward is by sharing.

I served with Bart on Cork County Council and his father, Mick Donegan, the girls' grandfather.  He was a great patriot and a great person and I worked very well with him over the years.  It is great to have them in the House.</p> <p>I raise the plight of the agricultural community that seems to have materialised following the drought, in particular in the past five to six weeks.  Four and a half months ago we had snow and now there has been no rain in my part of the country for the past five and a half to six weeks.  There is a knock-on effect on the water supply and grass growth has become a major issue.  Other crops are affected as well, in particular spring cereals.</p> <p>We must consider how we will manage the vast amount of stock in the future.  We have 365,000 extra cows in the country since 2013.  We must have a plan in place for when we have extreme weather events.  In the past five years, in both 2013 and 2018, we went to France to get fodder for the winter.  Given the scenario we are in at the moment we must come up with a long-term strategic plan so that we are not going to France when the situation develops into an emergency.  If we have to import fodder it should be done on a managed basis.  The situation is becoming dire in that most of the second cut of silage has been either grazed or cut and fed to cattle.  Fodder will be an incredibly important issue for the agricultural community for the coming winter.</p></speech>

Going forward, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine must be proactive in ensuring that winter fodder will be imported and be available.  We must put a strategic plan in place now to ensure fodder comes into this country not in March or April of next year but before the winter begins.</p></speech>

As Members know, the emergence of men's sheds is a fairly recent development and they are now located in many areas around the country.  I am familiar with the one in Monaghan town.  It has been a great development and offers great solace as well as outreach to men who for one reason or another feel isolated.  They could be retired or unemployed.  The groups are made up of tradespersons of all ilks.  It is a fantastic organisation that deserves great praise.  In light of all that, it is difficult to understand the decision by the HSE and the Government to cut funding to the Men's Sheds Association nationally by up to 7%.  We are talking about a cut of almost &euro;19,000.  That is most regrettable and will affect their ability to function as a national association.  It is difficult to understand the thinking behind the cut given the relatively small amount of money involved and the immeasurable return for society.</p> <p>I am sure I speak for most men when I say that a lot of us find it difficult to talk, to open up and discuss how we are feeling, especially when we are feeling down.  The Men's Sheds Association reaches out to people who are going through difficult times and offers them a base where they can meet people, have a chat and a cup of tea and get involved in voluntary and community projects.  It has been a great success story.  For that reason, I am astonished that the Government would decide to cut its funding.  I ask the Leader to bring this up with the Minister for Health and get the funding reinstated as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

It brings &euro;270 million into the country.  Projects are 85% funded from Europe.  Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth and Sligo directly benefit.  The programme funds shared educational initiatives for children and young people among other projects.  It is a very important fund.  For example, Cavan County Council gets in excess of &euro;1 million for PEACE projects.  Its importance is highlighted in particular in the context of the fighting and trouble in Derry over recent nights.  The fund is crucial.</p> <p>The European Social Fund is also crucial for employment.  It has funded a number of initiatives throughout the country.  I am very familiar with a number of them in Cavan and Monaghan.  I call on the Leader to arrange a special debate in this House to discuss with the relevant Ministers - if necessary we could have more than one debate - how to keep the funds in place and to prevent them being reduced following Brexit.  Even though we will be losing the UK from the EU the funds should be maintained at the same level.  The European Social Fund, which deals with unemployment in general and the creation of employment, would be much more crucial in a post-Brexit situation.  We need to protect PEACE IV, the European Social Fund and regional funding for the entire Border area.  I call on the Leader to provide a debate on the issue to ensure that none of the funding is lost.  I previously called on the Leader to arrange a debate to hold on to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, in its entirety but, similarly, I want to ensure we can hold onto those programmes because Ireland needs them.  Such a debate is urgently required.  Now is the time to address this issue.</p></speech>

Given the increased stocking levels of an extra 365,000 cows in the country I accept there is a stocking crisis and a fodder crisis.  As Senator Grace O'Sullivan said earlier, there is an environmental crisis.  Senator Lombard has an opportunity this evening to vote against the Heritage Bill, which attacks the very environment we have been trying to protect over a long period in this House.  When the vote is called this evening I hope he puts his vote where his mouth is and votes down the Bill.</p> <p>I have great respect for Senators Noone and McFadden who voiced their opinions on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  I recognise that Fine Gael has made an agreement with the Independent Alliance on the programme for Government.  I can very well understand Senator Noone's remarks that she is better staying within Fine Gael and fighting for change and I respect that but perhaps Fine Gael would try to assist the Minister, Deputy Ross, in his ten core principles and priorities that are laid down by the Independent Alliance.  One of those is to abolish the party whip in Leinster House.  I suggest that perhaps we would have a conversation with the Independent Alliance and that Fine Gael would assist it on a trial basis on this occasion in that the whip would not be applied on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill and that one of the Independent Alliance's core principles would be trialled over a number of days and let all parties vote without the whip being applied on a very important pillar of our democracy.  Perhaps no party should apply a whip on this occasion and let people vote according to what they see as being the correct thing to do.</p></speech>

I commend the Irish Air Corps, which helped put out a forest fire in Slieve Gullion in County Armagh.  This cross-Border co-operation sometimes goes unnoticed but we must welcome it.</p> <p>I welcome Prince Harry and Meghan to Ireland.  I have worn my Commonwealth tie today for everyone to see, to commemorate the occasion.  What is happening is absolutely incredible.  We have had the Taoiseach visiting east Belfast and the Orange Order and being welcomed and asked to come back again.  We have had Prince Charles and Camilla coming to Cork and being welcomed.  Today we have Harry and Meghan in Dublin.  This all comes off the back of the most successful visit of the Queen and Prince Phillip to Dublin in 2011 and the reciprocal State visit of the President to the United Kingdom.  The charm offensive is certainly working and most of the Irish public is falling for it.  We need to counteract this successful charm offensive.  The President should go on another State visit to the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

It is a do or die day for Prime Minister May.  The print was hardly set on the paper when it was denounced by David Davis and Boris Johnson, who have both walked out of Cabinet.  It does not augur well for the White Paper becoming official policy if there is a<i>coup d'&eacute;tat </i>against Prime Minister May in the next few days.</p><p>Nevertheless, if the White Paper is agreed on and presented to Mr. Barnier, our diplomats and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, should be proactive in working with the British Government in respect of a good deal for the United Kingdom.  A good deal for Britain should be a good deal for Ireland.  We have so much in common and there is trade of &euro;1.1 billion a week between our two countries.  We have the most to lose in these negotiations.</p><p>I was in Vienna on Monday at a meeting of the chairmen of all the European affairs committees in the EU, including representatives from the UK Government.  I reminded my colleagues that we are an island off an island off the mainland of Europe.  We are more affected than any other region in the European Union.  That is why we have to get special concessions.  If the White Paper is agreed and becomes part of the negotiations, I am hopeful there will be a good outcome allowing free trade between the United Kingdom and Ireland on a constant basis without any barriers or borders and with freedom of movement of people, goods and services.</p></speech>

It was an amazing achievement in extremely difficult terrain and a very complex path.  The best divers in the world took part.  The story captured the hearts and minds of the entire world.  I am delighted that one of the key people involved in the rescue was a gentleman living in Ennis, County Clare, called Jim Warny.  He is originally from Belgium but lives and works in Ennis and is a very important member of our community in Clare.  It shows that the outdoor physical activity that is taking place in Clare is bringing the best people in the world to live in and enjoy our county.  It was wonderful to think somebody from Ennis was able to fly out last Friday and play a crucial role in the rescue of those 12 boys and their coach.  I suggest that the Leader might write to the gentleman in Clare and pass on the admiration of the Upper House to him.  It is great to think we have such heroic people living among us.

All of us condemn the provocation and attacks.  As Senator Daly mentioned, we are on the edge of the marching season and of tomorrow's events in particular.  I hope all who take part in tomorrow's marches are cognisant of all communities who live in the North of our country.  We have made great progress and I hope tomorrow will be a day of peaceful demonstration and of parades.  I do not use the word "demonstration" in the sense of protest.  I welcome the decision of Ms Justice Keegan in the court in Belfast regarding bonfire size.  As Senator Norris expressed, I hope that tomorrow we can all share in what is good and recognise that we have to live together on our island.</p> <p>Senator Daly also made reference to the issue of home help.  The Government has invested significantly in home help hours.  As Senator Humphreys said yesterday, there is a road blockage somewhere regarding the allocation of home help hours and home care packages.  I know from my own experience that there is a blockage somewhere in the system.  I agree that we need to ensure that the system frees up that allocation of resources so that those who need home help hours or home care packages are able to avail of them.  </p> <p>Senator Daly also raised the Ryanair strike.  We hope the strike will not discommode the travelling public.  It is a matter for the industrial relations mechanisms of the State and it is a matter between Ryanair and its employees and their representatives.  I welcome the talks taking place today.

I thank the nurses' organisations and the nurses themselves for their work in our hospitals.  The INMO is a trade union of the nurses which came to the health committee with a particular vantage point.  There has been significant investment in the resourcing of our hospitals through recruitment, investment under the capital programme, and investment in upgrading facilities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are ongoing issues, so we must change the model as part of our overall work.

I will not take a lecture from anyone about the role of Fine Gael, as a party in government, in the appointment of judges, our support for the Judiciary or our support for the pillars of our society.  I would certainly be happy to participate later and outline some of the mistruths being told by people in this House.  If we are going to have a debate, let it be on the facts, not the personality of a Minister.  At times this week, I despaired at the level of debate and the carry-on of some.  It beggared belief.  We wasted so much time.  I appreciate that calling quorums and walk-through votes is a parliamentary device, and to be fair to my good friend, Senator Wilson, he was not the person calling the quorums, but some of the carry-on would not be seen in Tom Duffy's Circus.</p></speech>

If there are demerits, let us iron them out.</p> <p>Senators Lombard and Humphreys raised the issue of the effect of the drought and fine weather on the agriculture community.  There will be a knock-on effect.  Consider what Teagasc said last week about growth - there was no growth.  Yesterday, the Minister convened numerous meetings with stakeholders.  He has engaged daily.  I will endeavour to have him before the House next week for a debate on the matter, but it may not prove possible.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher discussed the Irish Men's Sheds Association.  There are 400 in the country, including 40 in Cork, which are doing great work, as the Cathaoirleach knows well.  I was not aware that there had been a funding cut.  I will endeavour to find out what that was about.</p> <p>Senator O'Reilly referred to PEACE funding.  I would be happy to arrange for a debate on that.  It is important that the Senator's concerns be addressed and that there be no slippage in funding.  Money should be put in place.  Particularly in this Brexit era, ERDF funding is important to the Border area.  A debate is necessary.  The Senator has often expressed his views on the need to keep the PEACE projects.  I would be happy to support him in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Humphreys also discussed climate change.  I would be happy to arrange for an ongoing debate.  The Senator also referred to the Whip system.  I am amused by the Labour Party's late conversion to it.  I hope that the party will apply the Senator's proposal to all votes instead of just a particular Bill.</p> <p>I join Senator Feighan on congratulating the Air Corps on its wonderful assistance this week.  It illustrates the importance of North-South joined-up approaches.  I also join Senators in welcoming Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, to the country.

I welcome to the Public Gallery members of the Traveller community and Traveller organisations whom I thank for this Bill.</p> <p>The proposal for a Bill emerged after consultation between Oein De Bhairduin from my office, Bernard Joyce of the Irish Traveller Movement and other national and local Traveller representative organisations.  The reasons for the Bill arose from, among other things, consistent reports and research highlighting the gross, disproportionate outcomes for Travellers in education as compared to the wider community.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colette Kelleher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As such, I present today the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill.  It is a Bill seeking to right some of the wrongs in our education system which particularly affect people from the Traveller community.  Hannagh McGinley, is a PhD candidate, co-ordinator of the module on Travellers, rights and nomadism at UCD, a teacher in the school of education at NUIG and an Irish Traveller herself.  As Hannagh puts it:</p><blockquote>The times we are living in are momentous.  This Bill has been a long time coming and it is wonderful to see our community at this juncture where they feel they have the right to demand a better quality of education for our children.</blockquote><p>The proposed Bill seeks to amend the Education Act 1998 to formally include Traveller culture and history in education.  Education is a key means to encourage social acceptance of diversity, fight discrimination and redress disadvantage.  The inclusion of Traveller culture and history within the curricula of Irish primary and post-primary schools is a logical and necessary extension of the State's historic recognition of Traveller ethnicity in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in March 2017.  The content of the Bill is in line with the equality and education policies developed by recent Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, as well as with Ireland's international obligations.  The report and recommendations on a Traveller education strategy, developed by the Department of Education and Skills under the then Minister, Mary Hanafin, in 2005, recommended that Traveller culture should be an integral part of the intercultural curriculum and represented positively in Irish primary schools.  Similarly, the Department of Justice and Equality's National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 commits to developing education resources on Traveller and Roma culture and history for use in primary, post-primary and adult education settings.  Including Traveller culture and history in the State's education system responds specifically to the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 2009, including that Roma and Traveller history and culture should be appropriately reflected in the general curriculum of schools.<br/><br/>As Ireland's most long-term disadvantaged group, Travellers experience gross disparities in educational attainment compared with the general populace.  According to a 2017 ESRI report, Travellers are over 50 times more likely to leave school without the leaving certificate than persons in the general population.  Only 9% of 25 to 34 year old Travellers have completed second level education compared with 86% of all persons nationally.  Including Traveller culture and history within the curricula of Irish schools would have a transformative effect on young Travellers' relationship with the education system.  It would recognise and validate their distinct culture and work against feelings of exclusion and high rates of school leaving and towards greater levels of educational attainment.  The potential to improve the educational attainment of minority students through the recognition of a minority culture within a school curriculum was demonstrated by the Te Kotahitanga project in New Zealand where the adoption of Maori-centred education for over 1,000 Maori students in selected schools significantly increased the retention rates and academic results of participants relative to Maori students in other schools.  That project helped to encourage the New Zealand Government to adopt a large-scale policy at national level to give Maori culture and history a central place in education.<br/><br/>In recognition of the shocking disparities in educational attainment for Travellers in Ireland, we must legislate.  We must also reverse the shocking 86.6% cuts introduced in 2011 to Traveller-specific education supports through the withdrawal of resource teachers for Travellers at primary level, teaching hours for Travellers in post-primary and of visiting teachers for Travellers generally, as well as the phasing out of senior Traveller training centres.  A serious degree of discrimination is faced by the Traveller community in Ireland at all levels of the education system and it must be reversed.  The disproportionate education cuts must be reversed.<br/><br/>As well as reversing the cuts mentioned, the recognition of Traveller culture and history within the education system through the implementation of the provisions of the Bill would also be of great benefit to all pupils and teachers, allowing them to learn about an important element of the rich mosaic of Ireland's cultural heritage.  The uniqueness and depth of Traveller culture has led to academic interest in the Traveller way of life over time in the disciplines of anthropology and folklore studies in Ireland and beyond.  Learning about aspects of this culture, such as the Gamin language, Traveller music, the historical barrel-top way of life and Travellers' fight for inclusion and dignity would broaden the cultural and historical education of Irish pupils and students in the way Black History Month has for students in the UK and the USA.<br/><br/>Enacting this legislation would help to counter the discriminatory attitudes and negative myths regarding Travellers that exist among members of the wider community.  It needs hardly to be demonstrated that these attitudes are all too common in Irish society.  According to the Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes national Traveller survey in 2017, only one in ten non-Travellers said he or she would employ a Traveller.  These myths have caused the perpetuation of a cycle of victim blaming, as described by psychologist William Ryan, whereby members of a dominant community see features of the social life of a marginalised community that are the result of poverty and marginalisation as essential features of that community's culture and use this observation to justify racist attitudes that cause this cycle of poverty, exclusion and marginalisation to continue.  It is common in Ireland today to blame Travellers and as such to blame the victims of discrimination for discrimination.  In 2018, we can no longer afford to blame victims.  We can do better than that and we need to act.<br/><br/>Since the launch of the Traveller Oireachtas group and the launch of the Bill last week, I have received many positive messages and correspondence.  However, I highlight a particular email I received which has convinced me more than ever of the need for and merit of the proposed Bill.  The correspondence was from a person working in a school, possibly even a teacher, who wrote:</p><blockquote>I am outraged to read your article stating how Traveller Children are 'discriminated against and bullied' in Irish Schools [...] forget introducing the history of the traveller culture as mandatory in Irish Schools.  We have enough of their culture.  Perhaps introducing a mandatory code of practice/behaviour class for travellers to take before their acceptance into mainstream education would be a wiser option or else provide them with education facilities in their own communities and stop their discrimination against us.</blockquote><p>I am horrified that a person with such beliefs and prejudice has any role in the education of children, let alone Traveller children.  This person is not fit to work in a school in any capacity.  Faced with such naked prejudice, is it any wonder that Travellers have such high rates of mental ill-health?  The rate of suicide in the Traveller community is six times higher than in the wider population.  Faced with such bile, is it any wonder Travellers leave school early when met on a daily basis with such ignorance and such prejudice?<br/><br/>The Bill proposes to amend sections 9 and 30 of the Education Act 1998 to provide that the Minister shall prescribe that Traveller culture and history is taught in recognised Irish schools.  Given that previous Government education strategies regarding the Traveller community did not culminate in an implementation plan, including the 2006 Traveller education strategy, the adoption of legislation by the Oireachtas is the best way to ensure that the Department of Education and Skills honours its commitment to develop primary and post-primary curricula which include Traveller culture and history as mandatory elements of primary and second-level education.<br/><br/>Enacting this legislation would also allow the Minister to consult with representative bodies, including the Irish Traveller Movement and other Traveller community groups, to establish in what way Traveller history and culture could best be introduced in school curricula.  As community bodies representing a large number of Traveller parents, groups such as the Irish Traveller Movement are legally entitled to participate in the development of elements of the national curriculum covering Traveller culture and history.  This reflects Article 42 of the Constitution, which gives parents the primary role in determining their children's education.  The Bill would therefore make it mandatory for recognised schools to promote and teach Traveller culture and history.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the Minister does in fact have the power under current legislation to provide for the inclusion of Traveller culture and history in the curricula of recognised schools.  This power is found in section 30(1) of the Education Act 1998 which provides that the Minister may prescribe the curriculum for recognised schools.  While the Minister has enjoyed this power since 1999 and, as such, had this power for 20 years, Traveller culture and history have not been included in curricula.  Under the provisions of the proposed Bill, the Minister would be required to make an order under section 30 of the Education Act 1998 to stipulate the precise content to be included in curricula.  In other words, the Bill requires the Minister to act.  Currently, any reference to Traveller culture or history is left to the discretion of the individual teacher.  The inclusion of a unique element of Irish history and culture should not and cannot be left up to the decision of individual teachers.  Teachers should be provided with a basis in the curriculum to educate a more diverse school-going population on Traveller culture and history.  Teachers should be provided with the necessary training, skills and cultural awareness to carry out this work sensitively, confidently and affirmatively.<br/><br/>The provisions contained of the Bill represent a strong tool to create a fully inclusive curriculum that values all of Ireland's rich culture and heritage; a culture and heritage that recognises and includes Travellers.  This legislation can help us to create a more respectful, inclusive and fair education system which can combat long-lasting and deep-rooted prejudice and discrimination and lead to a more respectful and equal society in Ireland.  The Bill is also about implementing existing Government policy in commitments in policy guidelines issued by the Department of Education and Skills in 2005 and by the Department of Justice and Equality in 2017.  The Bill will bring Ireland further into line with international obligations and standards regarding Traveller education and conform with recommendations issued by the Council of Europe in 1989 and 2009 and with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was adopted in 1989.<br/><br/>Enacting the Bill will give Travellers a real stake in the education system.  Similar initiatives in countries such as New Zealand have shown that curricula inclusive of minority group culture can have a positive effect.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colette Kelleher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Bill would also assist in the process of redress for internalised oppression and combat against related future mental health issues faced by Travellers and associated with the educational and cultural repression they have endured.  The Bill will foster a real enrichment of the Irish education system, developing a more open, inclusive and diverse curriculum which is inclusive of Traveller traditions of language, music, oral culture, nomadic lifestyle and community activism.  The Bill will be a positive step forward in combatting one of Ireland&rsquo;s most shameful and widespread forms of discrimination.  It will help realise the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar&rsquo;s aspirational statement following his election that, &ldquo;Prejudice has no hold in this Republic&rdquo;.</p><p>I ask the Minister and colleagues in the Seanad to support the Bill.  The Bill&rsquo;s passing into law would be a strong and unequivocal message in favour of a more inclusive Ireland, an Ireland that welcomes and celebrates diversity, an Ireland that respects all its citizens, an Ireland that nourishes, promotes and protects its diverse set of cultures and histories, and respects the unique Traveller culture and history that forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s heritage.  The inclusion of Traveller culture and history in the curricula of Irish primary and post-primary schools is the logical and long-awaited next step following on from the historic recognition of Traveller ethnicity by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 1 March 2017.  I thank the Cathaoirleach, the Minister and all my colleagues for the support.  I commend the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I am honoured to support this legislation and I am encouraged by the broad support for it in the House.</p> <p>After hours of thinking about what I wanted to say and how to phrase how important I think the Bill is, I came to the realisation that I was finding it difficult because, while I can speak about my own experience of stigma, social class, barriers in education, experience of deprivation and so on, it must be said that no matter how difficult what I have experienced has been, my Traveller friends have experienced so much more.  The expectation and aspiration that I could have gone on to do my leaving certificate was very much there for me but it was not for my Traveller friends.  I remember starting first year and noticing the Travellers in my classroom in primary school had not arrived for their first day of secondary school.  I remember the first time my friend invited me into his home.  I had known him for ten years but I heard him as a young Traveller man for the very first time that day.  We were only kids and I asked him why he did not talk like the rest of his family when we were out on the street.  His reply was, &ldquo;I will get only slagged, Lynn."  Imagine spending your day with your settled peers, having to master their use of language and their accent, and suppressing your own identity to avoid comment or jeering from friends.</p> <p>History and culture was very important in the 19th century to progressing the cause of identity and self-determination.  When a people&rsquo;s culture and history is validated and supported at State level, it will create a more inclusive Ireland.  More importantly, it will give the Traveller community a sense of belonging to the State, and the State will be displaying ownership of all its people and cultures.  Traveller history and culture is Irish history and culture; it is part of the multicultural history of Ireland.  It will not only benefit the Traveller community but the majority of the settled community just as much.  It will allow for a far more open discourse in the coming decade on what it is to be Irish in a continuously changing society.  Imagine if my friend could have expressed his identity, history and culture, and that we, as a State, supported and validated who he was throughout his life.  Imagine that we, as a State, had not imposed the stigma and marginalisation that we did in past oppressive policies.</p> <p>Over the last week or so, after conversations with friends and organisations in the Traveller community, a similar theme came through in what they all said.  Travellers in school are made to feel ashamed of their identity.  This happened without any of us actually taking the time to know what their history and culture is, or what it means to be a Traveller.  We have stigmatised and shamed the Traveller community out of ignorance and in an effort to force them to be us - to be settled - as if we were somehow superior.  Just as Thomas McCann said last week at the launch of the cross-party Oireachtas group on Travellers, the 1963 Government report from the Commission on Itinerancy described Travellers as &ldquo;problems&rdquo; for which there would be &ldquo;no final solution.&rdquo;  Ultimately, this State considered Travellers as failed settled people.  We must undo this.  We can begin by educating all of the generations to come on Traveller history and culture.  Education, awareness and acceptance are at the foundation of ending discrimination.  I believe the onus is on the State to be front and centre of ending that discrimination.  It was largely a State-imposed discrimination dating back over several decades.</p> <p>There is an absolute need to develop tools to include the history of Traveller culture in all parts of the primary and secondary syllabus.  We would look to include it in the CSPE programme but we can also look at social geography.  Nomadism should be included as a definition with reference to other indigenous peoples.  In the social and scientific area, the definition of family should be expanded to include the model of extended family.  Traveller music from musicians such as Johnny Doherty and Paddy Keenan should be included in the curriculum.  Regarding art, curriculum projects should include Traveller artistic contributions as one of the options alongside still life, for example.  In short, Traveller culture should be throughout the curriculum at all stages of education, not solely as a once-off module in a once a year class.</p> <p>This is one phase of addressing the inequality and discrimination for Travellers but we must be aware of the fact that we have much to do in regard to resources and accommodation.  Recognition of ethnicity does not magically bring Travellers up to a place of equity with the rest of society.  It does not erase the harm we have done to their community and their lives.  Some of the ways in which education can be a tool to achieve this are as follows: culturally appropriate primary school programmes; Traveller resource teachers to be reinstated; Traveller special needs assistants and teachers to be employed; Traveller home liaison supports; specific training projects for young Traveller men; and Traveller organisations to be resourced to develop a national network committed to supporting Traveller men.</p> <p>To conclude, we must ensure an inclusive and culturally respectful education system is available to all and it is imperative that the education sector meets that need.  This includes mandatory diversity awareness training for all educators and investment in culturally appropriate learning environments.  In addition, culturally appropriate learning materials must be developed for all sectors of the education system.  I truly regret that I spent my school years oblivious to the harm being inflicted on the Traveller community and on my Traveller friends.  I hope this Bill can start to change that for Traveller children in generations to come.</p></speech>

I commend her for initiating that group and also for this Bill, which is very important.  As others have described, the policy of the State for far too long, and made very explicit in the 1963 policies, was a policy of absorption and assimilation - of effectively disappearing Travellers and their contribution and history within the State.  For far too long, many Travellers who have attempted to navigate the education system, which has at times been openly hostile, have felt they had to choose between prejudice or invisibility, a tension which nobody should be asked to face, rather than having the opportunity to be recognised, celebrated and supported in the fullness of their identity.</p> <p>That invisibility has also done damage to the wider community and has made our history incomplete.  When we talk about our history and culture in Ireland, Travellers and the Traveller community have made a huge contribution and are part of that history and culture, part of the fabric of what has made us.  In our recent commemorations, we have been looking at how we mark history and looking, for example, at the contribution of women in shaping our State and ensuring that is written in.  This is not simply important for women; it is important for us to really understand who we are as a nation and all of the facets of that.  If we look at a particular area of culture such as music, at times when elements of Irish culture and music were banned and under pressure, and when we had gaps over centuries, it was Traveller culture that kept alive much of Ireland's musical tradition.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, when these aspects of our culture re-enter the mainstream, the contribution and work of many Travellers, whether the Doran family or the Dunne family, can be lost.  Travellers have contributed not only to our national culture and history but also to Ireland's international connections.  I have in mind, for example, the travels of Pecker Dunne in Australia and the connections he made at that time.  I applaud the University of Limerick, which has done great work to highlight Traveller culture.</p><p>This is a chance to ensure our education system truly reflects and supports all who participate in it.  It is important for the rights of the child and of indigenous persons, which are enshrined as UN principles, and for having a good education system for everyone.  We should look to the role of history across all aspects of our education system, although I recognise this Bill seeks to ensure these issues are reflected in many strands.</p><p>As I stated previously in the House, the former National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism sought to work across all Departments to ensure we turn these principles and high-level statements on ethnicity into real action.  I would like this Bill to be an opportunity to reignite a positive constructive questioning across all Departments about how we can do better to integrate and recognise the Traveller contribution across society.</p><p>In recognising culture and history, we empower the next generation of young Travellers in our education system to take ownership and be proud of their culture and to shape its future because it is an evolving and changing thing.  That is important to recognise.</p></speech>

The approach encapsulated in this draft legislation is a very good and one we should adopt.  The education system in Ireland operates, or at least should operate, on an inclusive basis in keeping with our obligations under the Constitution and national and international law.  An ESRI report from 2017 entitled "A Social Portrait of Travellers in Ireland" was commissioned by the Department of Justice and Equality drawing largely on data from the census of 2011.  The report highlighted the lower levels of educational attainment among Travellers and the unsurprising fact that greater chances of gaining employment are associated with higher educational attainment levels.  The report also references the withdrawal of educational supports following the austerity budget in 2011.</p> <p>While Traveller children are more likely to attend a Developing Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, school than non-Travellers, and thus avail of additional supports in these schools, the report references that not all Travellers attend DEIS schools.  In particular, it states that mainstreaming without specific intervention for Travellers may result in Traveller needs not being met.  It is intended the learning from the ongoing cross-sectional pilot, which was proposed under the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy and led by TUSLA, will address some of these issues.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's comments on the pilot.</p> <p>In accordance with the Government policy of inclusion, the policy on Traveller education is that Traveller children attend mainstream schools with previously segregated provision now funded as part of the mainstream system.  A number of Traveller-specific supports remain in the system to assist with the transition to the mainstream system of pupils previously provided for in segregated provision.  These comprise 141 alleviation resource teacher posts for schools with significant numbers of Travellers at a current cost &euro;8.46 million, additional pupil capitation for Travellers at a rate of &euro;70 per pupil for primary and &euro;201 per pupil for post-primary at a current cost of &euro;1.11 million.  In 2016 and 2017, there were 7,901 pupils in mainstream primary schools who identified as members of the Traveller community.</p> <p>The Minister will no doubt go into more detail about the DEIS plan which in 2017 recognised that engagement of Travellers and Roma in education is a continuing challenge.  Aspects of Traveller and Roma culture, together with past experiences of some parents and grandparents with education, can give rise to difficulties with school attendance, participation and retention.  It is important existing good practice and innovation in schools and ancillary support services are harnessed to improve the education experience of Traveller children in school.  The legislation encapsulates much of that.</p> <p>I support this very important legislation to which I am hopeful of a positive response from the Minister.</p></speech>

The Senator should not have to introduce legislation to have the proposed measure implemented.  It should already be in place as a structure for doing so is in place in the education system.  If the Minister and his officials were so inclined, they could issue a directive requiring that this subject be on the curriculum of primary and post-primary schools from September onwards.  I encourage him to do so.  This Bill will become law.  I very much support it and I hope, in the interests of justice, fairness, equality of opportunity and equality in general, that the Government will also support it and allow it to pass in both Houses.  Once passed in this House, it should swiftly move to the D&aacute;il and become law. </p> <p>We should educate mainstream - if one can call them that - settled children on the culture of Travellers in any case.  We have a responsibility to do that because Travellers are a recognised ethnic group in this community.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, to his eternal credit, ensured before he left office that Traveller ethnicity was recognised by the Government.  That decision changes the landscape completely.  We have now recognised Travellers as an ethnic group, which brings with it responsibilities to educate our young people about the diversity, uniqueness and rich culture of one of our traditional ethnic groups.  It is a priority that this should become part of the educational curriculum.</p> <p>I take the Bill as read because it will be passed, and rightly so.  Senator Kelleher has championed these issues since she came into these Houses, and with great success.  Education within the Traveller community has not received sufficient resources.  Schools trying to provide equal opportunity and access to education to Travellers need to be provided with the supports to do so.  The one way we see members of the Travelling community get out of poverty and get opportunities is by giving them as much access as possible to education.  It has been proved time and again that Travellers who have benefited from education have gone on to make an enormous contribution to this country and its culture and identity.  The more members of the Travelling community who have access to education, the more their abilities will be brought to the fore and they will be able to make an even greater contribution to society.  That percolates through all minority groups, but particularly Travellers.  The number of Travellers who go on to third level is very small.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not have the figures but I know it is very small, which should not be the case.

If they had opportunities they could have developed their skills to a very high level.  We are only at the start of fulfilling our responsibilities towards the Traveller community.  The Bill is an important incremental step in the right direction and I sincerely hope it will be supported.</p></speech>

I congratulate and commend Senator Colette Kelleher on bringing this Bill forward and everyone else who fed into the process.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il believes that Traveller culture should be an integral part of an intercultural curriculum and should be represented positively in each school.  For far too long nothing has happened to make this a reality.  In the wake of the 2017 recognition of Traveller ethnicity it is even more important that it be put on the curriculum.</p> <p>Last year's recognition of Traveller ethnicity must now be matched by action.  It is critical to ensure that the aspirations and ambitions of the Traveller community for the younger generations be realised in order that they can fully participate in society without discrimination or exclusion and with meaningful participation in employment, education and health and all other aspects of services and cultures in the State.</p> <p>Travellers have been a major and unique part of our history.  They are a significant, diverse and cherished element of wider Irish culture and society.  There has, however, been an unavoidable history of misunderstanding and suspicion and - for far too often - a strained relationship between the rest of society and the ethnic community.  When debating Traveller issues, it is an unfortunate truth that the most compelling inclination has been to debate the Traveller community in the context of strategy or as a challenge to society at large.  It is imperative that we display respect for cultural difference within our overall identity, and understand that recognising the distinct ethnic identities of Irish people strengthens rather than undermines Irishness.  In that context, Traveller culture and history should be part of the curriculum.  Placing it on the curriculum would be a further positive recognition and would show that we know and appreciate that Travellers constitute a unique ethnic group in society.  It would help by giving the Traveller community greater confidence and security and would be a very positive step in the right direction.</p> <p>We need to foster conditions conducive to pluralism in society.  We need to raise children's awareness of their culture and attune them to the fact that there are other ways of behaving and other value systems.  We need them to develop respect for lifestyles that are different from their own so that children can understand and appreciate each other better.  We need to foster a commitment to equality and enable children to make informed choices and take action on issues of prejudice and discrimination.  We need to appreciate and value similarities and differences.  We also need to enable all children to speak for themselves and articulate that they are the creators of their own destinies.  Ultimately, we are trying to ensure that all children are treated equally and can achieve in life whatever they want to achieve.</p> <p>I note Senator Martin Conway's contribution.  I look forward to the Minister's response to the Senator's comment that while it is important to put this legislation on the Statute Book, a direction from the Minister and his Department to schools could result in immediate action being taken on the matter.</p> <p>I congratulate Senator Kelleher on her great and continued work in this area.  I welcome those in the Public Gallery today and I acknowledge their input into this process.  Bualadh bos to all concerned.</p></speech>

I also welcome the members of the Traveller community who have come to the House today to watch this important debate.  Senator Kelleher asked me to support her legislation and I have indicated I will support it.</p> <p>Hardly a word has been spoken in this debate thus far with which I do not agree, but there are points I want to personally emphasise.  Travellers are not the challenge; the challenge is the statistics given about dropout rates, suicide rates, marginalisation, economic exclusion and so on.  The figures portray an exclusion and a sense of being an outsider and to some extent a determination on the part of the settled community to keep Travellers in an outsider status.  This is undesirable, wrong, unfair, unrepublican and unpatriotic and we have to work to deal with it.</p> <p>Not everything centres on education but a decent education is an absolute prerequisite to economic, social and citizen equality in any republic.  From that perspective, the dropout rate of Travellers from the education system, whereas it may have economic and cultural explanations, is nonetheless a challenge in itself.  It must be the case that the educational curriculum, not merely in schools Traveller children attend and in which they receive an education but also in schools where Traveller children are not present, should emphasise that every citizen of Ireland is to be valued and should not be ashamed of his or her economic, social, cultural or ethnic identity.  Every school in Ireland should have these values as the ethical cornerstones of the moral education of children.  More important than that proposition, as Senator Kelleher emphasised, is that a Traveller child entering a school should see it as a place into which he or she enters, not as some kind of privilege or concession, but as of right.  This is not a bare legal right but a moral right to receive education in a manner that receives and understands and is a warm place to them.</p> <p>Having said those few words, I commend Senators Kelleher, Ruane and Grace O'Sullivan for bringing forward the legislation.  Some speakers have noted that a legislative basis may not be necessary for the required action to transform our curriculum and to ensure this curricular transformation takes place.  The very fact that these actions have not been taken for many years suggests that this is not simply a legislative gesture, but seems to be a legislative necessity.  It also seems to be the case that those who have failed in the past to transform education to make it Traveller friendly and Traveller appreciative in the way this Bill intends includes an entire political generation.  I include myself in that and I do not pretend otherwise.  Those in the past who failed to advance the particular aims set out in this legislation need to have the duty cast in a very clear way that does not admit any further delay, prevarication or time-serving as regards this equality measure.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Having made those points, wished the proposers of the Bill every success in its passage and come to the view that there are no obstacles to its passage into law, I urge the Minister to accept the Bill, the reasoning for it and the opportunity it offers the State to make a real and significant difference to the experience of the Traveller community in the educational process.  It would also make a significant difference in terms of the education of the settled community on the reality of the life, attitudes and culture of the Traveller community and the discrimination it has faced.  I warmly support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1400" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#T00200"><p>I commend Senator Kelleher and the Senators who supported her in bringing forward this timely and very important Bill.  On 10 October 2015, in awful circumstances, ten members of the Traveller community lost their lives in a fire.  Five of them were children.  Soon thereafter, I looked at a report on the events published on the <i>journal.ie</i>news website.  Below the article were several comments such as &quot;rest in peace&quot;.  Hundreds of citizens of this State gave those comments a thumbs down and disagreed with comments expressing the wish that five children and five adults who were burned to death in the most appalling circumstances would rest in peace.  That attitude is evil.  It is a serious problem and we have ignored it for too long.</p><p>All those in the Chamber and listening to the debate have heard phrases such as &quot;dirty knacker&quot; and &quot;dirty tinker&quot; used in polite society.  None of us could deny that.  I was once at a GAA match and, after a tackle was made by a defender, a woman behind me screamed at the player &quot;You dirty knacker.  You dirty tinker.&quot;  I turned and saw that she was the type of woman who one would assume is an upstanding citizen involved in her GAA club and a decent person in every way except in the attitude displayed by her words.  How did our society reach this stage?  Such attitudes are evil and racist.  From where do they come?</p><p>The briefing given by Senator Kelleher draws our attention to the work of the psychologist, William Ryan, who in the 1970s wrote a book <i>Blaming the Victim</i>.  The briefing outlines that the book addresses the situation whereby members of a dominant community see features of the social life of a marginalised community that are the result of poverty and marginalisation as essential features of that community's culture and use that observation to justify racist attitudes that cause the cycle of poverty, exclusion and marginalisation to be perpetuated.  I could not have put it better myself.  From where has this come?  What does it say about our society that the woman behind me who I am sure is quite decent in every other respect said something like that in front of children and others around her?</p><p>The roots of this issue go very deep but I will point to the role of the Commission on Itinerancy in 1963.  When the justice committee of the previous Oireachtas tasked itself with looking at the issue of Traveller ethnicity, it brought in a range of witnesses.  I was the rapporteur for the report.  I am proud to say that we recommended on an all-party basis that the State recognise the ethnicity of the Traveller community.  However, we were deeply shocked when we examined the Commission on Itinerancy.  No Travellers were on the commission or participated in its work.  It was about Travellers but they did not have any say.  The terms of reference decided upon in 1960 were to inquire into the problem arising from the presence in the country of itinerants in considerable numbers, to examine the economic, educational, health and social problems inherent in their way of life, to promote their absorption into the general community and, pending such absorption, to reduce to a minimum the disadvantage to themselves and the community resulting from their itinerant habits.  It goes on to state that itinerants, or Travellers, as they prefer to be called, do not constitute a single homogenous group.  It denied Travellers their ethnicity, history and culture without any academic, anthropological or sociological evidence for so doing.  That is at the root of where we are today and why the Bill is so important.</p><p>We must reverse the attitude engendered by the Commission on Itinerancy.  We must teach our children that our Traveller community, similar to native Americans, Maoris and Aborigines, were indigenous to this land and continued with nomadic ways while the majority of our people settled and decided they wished to have a roof over their heads and live in one place.  The majority rejected the old ways and rejected people who continued with the old ways to such a degree that that report was written in 1963.  The report has been consigned to history by the recognition of Traveller ethnicity last year but we cannot stop at that.  The declaration by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, on that famous day last year means nothing unless we bring in legislation such as that proposed by Senator Kelleher.  I cannot overstate how vital it is.  There is no point discussing Traveller health, mental health and education until we value the Traveller community and its contribution to our history.</p><p>My mother was born on the side of a road in 1951, the child of Traveller parents who went on a journey to move away from their roots.  While I was a child, my grandmother, who I loved dearly, tried to move away from her Traveller background and settle, like so many other Travellers, because it was so difficult to live in that community.  It is wrong that she and so many other Travellers felt under such pressure.  I owe it to my grandmother who was nearly forced to deny her past in order to be accepted in society and to make a better life for me and her daughter, my mother, to tell her story.  Travellers watching these proceedings owe it to those who came before them to tell their story and of the injustice they faced.  We must be honest and tell those stories in our schools because the only way we can learn from the mistakes of the past is to accept that they were mistakes and move on from them.  We will never turn around the fortunes of the Traveller community until we say it is valued and that its contribution to our country is immense, core and central.  Its music and nomadic ways are part of who we were and who Travellers are and will continue to be with our support and love.  That is the only way to stop hundreds of people from going onto a news website and giving a thumbs down to a message hoping that five children burned to death will rest in peace.</p></speech>

I was unsure of the order of speakers.  It will be very hard to follow the speech of Senator Mac Lochlainn.  I commend him on his very strong and eloquent language in support of this important Bill.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to the House and offer apologies on behalf of my colleague, Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, who cannot be here but asked me to express the strong support of the Labour Party for the Bill.

I warmly welcome the groups and individuals in the Gallery to watch the debate, including my colleague, Dr. Ronan McCrea, who is an expert in equality law.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I view this Bill as part of a process by which we have come to assert a stronger recognition of Traveller rights and culture.  Senator Mac Lochlainn has played a huge role in this.  He was a colleague of mine on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality when we produced an important report on the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  All colleagues who served on that committee will recall the expert evidence given to the committee was very clear that legislation was not necessary in order to ensure the State would recognise Traveller ethnicity.  That report led ultimately to the historic declaration by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, in March 2017, to which Senator Kelleher and others referred.That very important historic declaration of recognition of ethnicity has paved the way for initiatives such as this Bill.  I see this Bill as a measure which would give practical effect to the spirit behind that declaration of ethnicity.  Clearly, there are many more steps that need to be taken, and others referred to the continuing and most distressing anti-Traveller attitudes we are seeing in many areas.  We know that more needs to be done in the promotion of better healthcare measures, including mental healthcare measures, for Travellers.<br/><br/>I also listened, with interest, to the words of Senator Conway.  I hope the Minister will support the Bill, as Senator Conway has indicated his support for it.  The Senator also pointed out it may not be necessary to enact legislation in order to make a change to the curriculum in our schools to ensure children will be taught about Traveller culture and history.  I would hope we might see such a step being taken.  It might well need statutory underpinning and it is important it would have that to ensure it would be rolled out across all schools.  It would be good to see immediate steps being taken to ensure the curriculum would include reference to Traveller culture and history.  This is vital not only for children from the Traveller community but for all our children.  Senator Kelleher eloquently spoke about that.  This is a way of enriching our education system much more generally.  This would broaden the cultural and historical education of Irish students.  She pointed to the initiative of Black History Month as the way in which an initiative of this type can enrich education more generally.  <br/><br/>We are also indebted to Senator Kelleher for providing us with a legal opinion in support of the legislation from James Kane in the Law Library.  He rightly points out that Article 30 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides for the rights of children belonging to a minority or who are indigenous not to be denied the right to enjoy their own culture and so on.  That is an important right relating to children from ethnic minorities such as the Traveller community but there is also the broader statement of the rights of children to receive a more inclusive education.  That is well stated by the European Court of Human Rights in the Orsus <i>v.</i>Croatia case, where the court observed the emerging international consensus among member states of the Council of Europe, recognising the special needs of minorities and an obligation to protect their security, identity and lifestyle, not only for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of the minorities but to preserve a cultural diversity of value to the whole community.  That is a very important point to emphasise, namely, that in a Bill of this nature the Minister would prescribe that Traveller culture and history would be taught in recognised schools and he would prescribe the content of the syllabus to be taught in that regard.  This is important to enrich our education system as a whole in order to preserve the cultural diversity that is of value to our entire community.  That is very important and it is the type of measure that will change the dreadful attitudes, to which Senator Mac Lochlainn referred.  It is a very important practical step.<br/><br/>Within the Oireachtas this year, we have taken some very important steps with the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 committee, of which I am proud to be chair, to ensure that our school children are being taught more about the history of women's rights and of equality for women in Ireland and Irish society.  We saw in this Chamber in April a group of wonderful transition year students debating the impact of women achieving the right to vote, as we mark the centenary of women's suffrage through our D&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht na n&Oacute;g.  That shows how changing the curriculum, ensuring that children receive education about the winning of rights and the gaining of equality in Irish society, can enrich children's educational experience generally.  This Bill is an important measure in that vein.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I am very happy to support it.</p></speech>

This Bill is a no-brainer.  I am delighted to have been invited to be a co-signatory of the Bill by Senator Kelleher, and I am very proud of that.  The Bill advocates a simple and sensible change which will help not only to improve the level of knowledge of our future citizens but to shine a light on a neglected and often misunderstood community which is an integral part of our Irish society.  I commend Senator Mac Lochlainn on his contribution to this debate.</p> <p>We cannot live up to our proud claim to cherish all the children equally if we turn our backs on this important yet modest legislation.  I would hope it will be put into force, sooner rather than later, by the Department of Education and Skills with the full support of the Government.  For too long Traveller culture, the living, breathing and evolving culture of Ireland's largest minority ethnic group, has been ignored.  We heard this morning from Catherine Joyce of the Irish Traveller Movement who illustrated this point in detail in her briefing on the importance of this Bill.  That ignorance has resulted not only in members of the Traveller community experiencing exclusion and racism on a daily basis but has allowed a wider acceptance of misunderstandings and ignorance prevail.  The role of the community in protecting and transmitting our cultural history, for example, is not known to most Irish people.  Many aspects of our musical heritage, as just one example, would not have survived through to contemporary times without the nurturing and sheltering given by the Traveller community.  Have they received acknowledgement for this?  No, I believe they have not.</p> <p>As we heard from Thomas McCann, the manager of the Traveller Counselling Service, who is in the Gallery today, this Bill is about human rights.  It is about inclusivity and an intercultural approach to learning and knowledge.  It is about recognition of the contributions made by the Traveller community and the importance that recognising such contributions can have in informing the rest of Irish society's views.  It is about enhancing the cultural education of all our children.  They will all benefit from a wider understanding of the colourful array of ethnicity and cultural backgrounds and the human diversity that will make us stronger as a nation.</p></speech>

I particularly welcome all those in the Gallery.  I will start by reading a poem <i>Checking Out Me History</i>by John Agard, which might be appropriate for a number of reasons.  It reads:</p><p>Dem tell me</p><p>Dem tell me</p><p>Wha dem want to tell me</p><p>Bandage up me eye with me own history</p><p>Blind me to me own identity</p><p>Dem tell me bout 1066 and all dat</p><p>Dem tell me bout Dick Whittington and he cat</p><p>But Toussaint L&rsquo;Ouverture</p><p>No dem never tell me bout dat</p><p>Toussaint</p><p>A slave</p><p>With vision</p><p>Lick back  [the French]</p><p>[Lick back] Napoleon</p><p>Battalion</p><p>And first Black</p><p>Republic born</p><p>Toussaint de thorn</p><p>To de French</p><p>Toussaint de beacon</p><p>Of de Haitian Revolution</p><p>Dem tell me bout de man who discover de balloon</p><p>And de cow who jump over de moon</p><p>Dem tell me bout de dish ran away with de spoon</p><p>But dem never tell me bout Nanny de maroon</p><p>Nanny</p><p>See-far woman</p><p>Of mountain dream</p><p>Fire-woman struggle</p><p>Hopeful stream</p><p>To freedom river</p><p>Dem tell me bout Lord Nelson and Waterloo</p><p>But dem never tell me bout Shaka de great Zulu</p><p>Dem tell me bout Columbus and 1492</p><p>But what happen to de Caribs and de Arawaks too</p><p>Dem tell me bout Florence Nightingale and she lamp</p><p>and how Robin Hood used to camp</p><p>Dem tell me bout ole King Cole was a merry ole soul</p><p>but dem never tell me bout Mary Seacole</p><p>From Jamaica</p><p>She travel far</p><p>To the Crimean War</p><p>She volunteer to go</p><p>And even when de British said no</p><p>She still brave the Russian snow</p><p>A healing star</p><p>Among the wounded</p><p>A yellow sunrise</p><p>To the dying</p><p>Dem tell me</p><p>Dem tell me wha dem want to tell me</p><p>But now I checking out me own history</p><p>I carving out me identity<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Mr. John Agard authored that poem.  He was born in British Guyana of a Creole mother and a Scottish British army officer.  It struck me as highlighting the importance of a dominant, sitting culture giving space to another culture.</p><p>Mr. Johnny Doran died in 1953 when a wall fell on his caravan on North King Street.  He was a magnificent player of the fiddle.  Many of us would have heard of Ms Margaret Barry or, if not her name, then recordings of her street singing.</p><p>I do not want to say much more other than to point out that we have the ball at our toe as the dominant culture.  We have to learn to share and to use our two ears to listen and embrace.  Senator McDowell made a point about the school needing to be a welcoming and warm place for everyone.  In a republic, the school presents a great opportunity for everyone starting out.  It is magnificent.  I often give credit to recent Governments for what they have done for young pupils with disabilities.</p><p>I have known Travellers with disabilities.  Listening to Senator Mac Lochlainn, I was reminded of one or two who found that they had to deny their own families.  A wound was done to them.  One person from the Traveller community, who has since become an important person - actually, I should not say that, as no one is more important than another, so I should instead say "well known and respected person" - was not allowed to have her family visit her in a particular institution.  That was within the past 40 years.  There is an ingrained problem.  Legislation should not be necessary, but it has to be used in such circumstances.</p><p>I am happy to support this Bill and commend Senator Kelleher on what she has done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#V00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity for this important debate.  I will not oppose the legislation.</p> <p>The decision by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, in 2017 to recognise the ethnicity of the Traveller community was a significant milestone.  We in government and the Oireachtas must see that the vision underpinning it is realised.  This legislation is proposed very much in that spirit.</p> <p>I draw Senators' attention to the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, which is being implemented by the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  It contains 149 actions across ten distinctive themes, including education.  Some of them are worth recalling, given that they are works in progress.  For example, action No. 4 calls for "collaboration with Traveller and Roma organisations to develop education resources on Traveller and Roma culture and history for use in primary, post primary and adult education settings."  Under action No. 10, it commits to "early intervention education welfare supports to promote and support Traveller and Roma attendance, participation and engagement with the education system and retention to the Leaving Certificate or equivalent."  Under action No. 16, my Department will "review policy on admissions to school in line with the Programme for Government" to take account of possible discrimination in admission policies.  Under action No. 17, it commits to implementing "community-based supports to assist retention of Traveller and Roma children in the education system."  While not in any way denigrating the legislation before us, 149 actions across ten realms of government are being implemented.  It is important that we deliver them and ensure that the work being co-ordinated by the Minister of State has the full support of the Oireachtas.  There must also be pressure from the Oireachtas to ensure that we deliver on these actions in a timely manner.</p> <p>Given that it is a view expressed by every Senator in the context of this debate, it does not need repeating that there is scope and a need for major improvement in education.  Thankfully, we are in a post-crash Ireland and have created a solid foundation on which to plan for the future.  We are doing so, taking ten-year perspectives across a range of important infrastructural and social needs.  This issue equally needs that long-term approach.</p> <p>The Bill deals mainly with the curriculum.  I examined the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, guidelines for primary and post-primary schools.  They date back to 2005 or 2006, so they are old, but they also give us insight into the nature of the problems we are trying to address, as they discuss how indirect discrimination can arise in a range of areas, including entry criteria and the way in which schools develop their service provision, policies and approaches, which can act as barriers.  Also covered are the lack of professional expertise within the school to deal with some of the challenges of inclusion, the lack of systematic data gathering on the impact of policies on minority groups, and the lack of workable facilities for consultation with and listening to minority groups, be they parents or students.</p> <p>One of the lessons that has to be recognised is that this issue is deep-seated.  It is not just a question of writing legislation and, hey presto, the issue being solved.  Legislation may hold an important role, but a great deal of work will be needed to build the underpinning and foundation for systematic change.</p> <p>To be fair to my Department and the authors of the inclusion strategy, a number of important vehicles are in development or already in place.  Last night, the D&aacute;il passed the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which outlaws for the first time discrimination.  Every admission policy of every school in the country will have to have written into it a policy of no discrimination on any ground, including on grounds of being from the Traveller or Roma ethnic group.  The legislation also does away with waiting lists, which have been a way for communities to create a barrier against those who are not in stable environments, meaning they could have been on lists for a long time.  It gives Tusla the power to require a school to take children where the school might not otherwise do so.  The Bill is an important vehicle and it was crucial that we got support.</p> <p>Also in development is a parents and students charter, which has been accepted by the Oireachtas committee.  It embraces students and parents as key players who need to be listened to, which is an area in which we have perceived weaknesses.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have a well-being programme which is being rolled out at junior cycle but which will also become a policy of every school when we publish a well-being policy statement very shortly.  It deals very explicitly with some of the issues that have been addressed here, such as the resilience of students, their capacity to integrate, the way in which anti-bullying policies are rolled out, and the relationships that teachers build with individual students so that they have the confidence to stay within the school.  As Senator McDowell described it, school should be a warm place to be for any student, regardless of their background.  That is at the heart of what the well-being strategy is about, and there will be very detailed implementation to ensure that we support children, particularly children who are at risk of dropping out.</p><p>The other thing that is worth bearing in mind is that over recent years, and it predates my time, the Department has moved away from the policies of separate arrangements, like visiting teachers and segregated approaches, and I believe it has done this with general support from the broader community, the Traveller community and the wider education bodies.  Segregation is not the way to deal with this.  We need to have integration.  If integration is to succeed, we need to have much better approaches than we have in place.  Senator Kelleher referred to the numbers, and I was looking at the ESRI report which bears out the numbers for people who have left.  They are 2011 data and it is people over the age of 25 back in 2011, so it is somewhat old in terms of the data.  They show the remarkable and dramatic differences in the experience of people who have left school, both Travellers and non-Travellers.  Those who have left school early with only primary education or less make up 78% among the Traveller community and 10% among the settled community.  Even now, the numbers in the national strategy show that the percentages completing second level are 13% versus 92%, which are the current data.  For those going to third level, the percentages are 1% among the Traveller community versus 66% among the wider community.  We have a huge gulf to make up.</p><p>Looking at some of the material that has been in place, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, guidelines are good and they address many of the issues, but we have 4,000 different schools.  The big question is to what extent schools are implementing these policies.  There are some good resources available that can enliven the curriculum and make sure that it recognises the Traveller contribution to our culture and way of life.  There are some excellent practices where schools are very good at doing this, there are some excellent teachers, and indeed there are some good networks for sharing good practice.  The overall picture, however, would be one of this not being sufficiently prevalent across the education system generally.</p><p>I intend, on foot of this legislation, to get the NCCA to audit the whole realm of this, not just the curricular content but the quality of teaching and resources and the extent to which it is being implemented.  We need to identify the weaknesses in the curricular content.  We need to identify the weaknesses in what the jargon in the Department describes as CPD, continuing professional development, which is the upskilling of teachers to teach in this area.  We need to ensure that our inspectorate, which is ultimately the way in which we implement quality control across the system, and not always through the traditional cigire with the red pencil saying one is wrong but supporting good practice as well as correcting poor, is very alive to the need to ensure good practice in this area.</p><p>We also need to develop much more local innovation.  Integration is the right approach to take but it will only succeed if we have tailored interventions to support Traveller children.  I know that, across the three Departments, predominantly Justice and Equality, Children and Youth Affairs and ourselves, a pilot scheme is being developed which I understand will go live this coming school year.  It is designed to look at how we strengthen the support for children from the Traveller community attending and staying in school.  It will not only have the normal interventions of the home school community liaison but will also work with the Traveller community itself and with schools.  It will be tested in pilot areas to see how we shift the practice in schools on the ground, because we need to shift practice as well as pass legislation at this level.</p><p>We could pass legislation of this nature and nothing would change.  We all know that.  Such legislation has been passed.  If it is not supported by the sort of work that I am going to put in place in terms of the audit, the identification of weaknesses, the piloting and, following that, the mainstreaming of interventions that can correct this, we will not succeed.</p><p>The other dimension of this, and Senators have referred to this, is that it is not just about ensuring that schools are more welcoming and that we get better school attendance, but about shifting the understanding of the Traveller community within the wider community.  We need to ensure that people are welcomed on a broader base, and education is a place where that can happen.  That shows the importance of Senator Kelleher's ideas of having content within our curriculum that embraces the Traveller community.  We need to have that developed and used.  There are many opportunities for doing that and doing it better.</p><p>The one quibble I would have with the legislation, and it was picked up in Senator Conway's comment, is that curriculum in Ireland is not developed by the Minister making a fiat that, as and from tomorrow, this is the way curriculum is going to be taught.  For many good reasons, we have developed a stakeholder approach, led by the NCCA, which works with others to ensure that the curriculum is developed in a way that is implemented, embraced, delivered and bought into across all 4,000 schools.  It is not a ministerial fiat that changes things by a stroke, nor is it for the Oireachtas to try to specify what goes into the curriculum.  Broad-brush principles of what should be included are fine, but we should refrain from getting into very precise specification of curricula if that is what was intended.  I do not believe that this is inherent in the Bill, but when we come to look at this on Committee Stage, I would say that my Department will be urging the Oireachtas to be careful about seeking to create a legislative straitjacket that prevents the sort of innovative thinking and flexible application that the best education systems have.</p><p>I have aspired as Minister in the Department that by 2026 - it was ten years away, it is getting closer - we would have the best education and training system in Europe.  Those who would have leadership positions, such as those in Finland, for instance, are characterised by a looser, less prescriptive approach, but they still ensure, nonetheless, that high standards are delivered and that people use that scope for innovation and not to exclude people but to best accommodate the children for whom they are catering.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is the one thing I would warn against.  I employ more than 100,000 people in the school system.  We have phenomenal stakeholders such as teachers' unions, the NCCA and the National Educational Psychological Service.  We have many good players and for us to succeed in respect of our ambition in this area, we need have them supporting the capacity of schools to do it so we do need that way of evolving policy that is consultative as well as the Oireachtas signalling what it is.  I think it is a shared desire in this House that we get a better approach.  We cannot tolerate the continuation of those sort of numbers - 13% completing second level and 1% completing third level.  They are not acceptable in any society that has just taken the significant step of recognising an important part of our culture and heritage.  </p><p>In not opposing this Bill, I hope that Senators will work with the Department and me to evolve much better and much more effective policies and to work with the Traveller and Roma communities to implement those changes.  There is an appetite there and there is a lot of goodwill.  There is a huge number of Departments that are obliged to put their shoulders to the wheel.  We in the Oireachtas can seek to ensure that this impetus is maintained as we develop this.  I thank the Senators for the debate, which has been very interesting and well informed.  From the presence in the Public Gallery, clearly, there is a lot of support for and interest in seeing us make progress in this area.  We will not be opposing this legislation.  </p></speech>

I accept his invitation to work with him to develop the principles and spirit that have been captured in the Bill.  As Senator Conway said, the Minister has significant powers in this area without the legislation.  It is heartening to know that he will be using those powers, for example, with the audit he is proposing for the NCCA.  I urge him to work with the Traveller community in that audit because, again, it should be a case of "nothing about us without us."  In the past, we have formed policy without involving people who are directly affected by that policy.  That would be an important point to make.</p> <p>Senator McDowell said that the legislation is necessary.  I believe that it is but it is not sufficient; we need to strike the right balance between the direction and will to address the fact that the situation for Travellers in terms of prejudice, discrimination and educational attainment is not acceptable and being prescriptive about it.  I appreciate the points made by the Senator.  </p> <p>Senator Ruane had some very interesting ideas about how we can weave Traveller history and culture into curriculum across the piece rather than it being a case of "it's the third week of the month and we're now doing Traveller culture and history" and then forgetting about it.  Senator Gallagher spoke about matching recognition of Traveller ethnicity, appreciating the similarities we have and appreciating and respecting difference.  That was endorsed by Senator Noone as well.  </p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn spoke with great authenticity and first-hand experience of what internalised depression is and the fact that people feel they must hide their identities.  Nobody should have to pretend to be somebody he or she is not.  Schools should be warm places that encourage people to be themselves and to able to be out and proud about their identity in all shapes, shades and forms.  I also thank Senator Grace O'Sullivan for discussing a neglected and misunderstood community and the points she made.  We actually know little about Traveller culture and history formally and that is an important end in itself in the legislation.  </p> <p>Senator Dolan read a poem from John Agard and talked about Mary Seacole.  I discovered those individuals when my children were attending a primary school in Tottenham because it had Black History Month.  I had never heard of Mary Seacole, who was even more impressive than Florence Nightingale in terms of her nursing skills and ability but was written out of history.  We need to make sure that people are written into history and that this history is taught across the piece and also has a knock-on effect in terms of people feeling valued and that they want to be in the educational system and part of the wider system.  We need to tackle the disparities - 9% of people in the Traveller community between the ages of 24 and 35 complete the leaving certificate as opposed to 86% in the settled community and only 167 go on to third level.  I could not count the people I know who have third-level education but that is the whole of the Traveller community.  It is a community that has huge ability like every other community.  It is just not given a chance or expression.  </p> <p>I am delighted the Minister is accepting the Bill and I am delighted by the support of fellow Senators.  I thank Bernard Joyce from the Irish Travellers Movement for making this happen, Oein De Bhairduin, Jacinta, Sam and Ben in my office, who must put up with me on a daily basis.  I thank the Civil Engagement Group, James Kane, Rachel and fellow Senators.  I look forward to working constructively with the Minister in taking forward this important initiative for the benefit of Travellers but also for all our benefit and, ultimately, Irish society.  </p></speech>

I thank the House giving me for the opportunity to speak about this important subject which means a lot to me.  We began debating the Bill in January.  I appreciate that the action of Senator Frances Black and other Senators, in facilitating a six-month adjournment, was helpful.  As the Seanad will conclude its debate today, I am happy that time has been made available for statements on the situation in Palestine which allows us to further discuss the issues at play.</p> <p>The Middle East peace process has been a priority for me, personally, since I took up the role of Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In fact, it is true to say that after Brexit and other EU-related matters, the Middle East peace process has taken up more of my time than anything else.  I have visited the region three times.  I have visited Egypt, Jordan and Cyprus.  I have visited Ramallah and Jerusalem three times and Tel Aviv twice.  I will continue to visit the region and try to do everything I can to ensure Ireland can influence the political debate and the decisions being made to alleviate the tragedy and injustice that is continuing.  I believe Ireland can play a positive role in the Middle East peace process in working towards an agreed solution to the conflict, with people in the two states involved, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and prosperity.  I am convinced that this is the outcome that is in the best interests of both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples, with whom Ireland enjoys a long-standing relationship with and friendship.</p> <p>Last January I made it clear that I fully respected the motives and intentions of the proponents and supporters of the Bill.  I reject and have publicly opposed attempts made in other jurisdictions to demonise people who sincerely support this political approach and will continue to do so.  Sadly, what has happened in the intervening months has only increased the sense of frustration many feel about the Middle East peace conflict.  The sense of helplessness and deep sense of injustice that so many Irish people hold about the plight of Palestinians have intensified in recent months and for good reason.  The unacceptable shooting of demonstrators in Gaza and the attempted demolition this very week of the homes of vulnerable Palestinian Bedouin have led to a strong feeling we must do more from an Irish perspective.  It is a feeling I share.</p> <p>I agree that settlements are at the heart of the conflict and should be a particular focus for action.  However, speaking on behalf of the Government, I am unable to agree that the Bill is the right way forward.  I wish to set out carefully for the Seanad why I believe this is so.  There are three broad reasons: legal; political and the practical effects.  The overriding point that frames the Government's view is that the Bill asks the State to do something that is not within our power.  Ireland is part of a single unified EU market.  External trade policy - third countries trading into the European Union - as well as trade between EU member states, is an exclusive competence of the European Union.  We are not in a position to raise a barrier and declare that goods legally available elsewhere in the European Union cannot be brought into Ireland for sale.</p> <p>There are other legal difficulties with the Bill, but I shall leave them aside for now.  The following is the essential point and it does not just concern how the legislation has been framed or drafted but also the very ability of Ireland to enact such legislation within EU rules.  Passage of the Bill, therefore, would be in breach of European law and expose Ireland to potential legal action by the European Commission or affected individuals and, potentially, fines and damages that could continue as long as the Bill remained in force.  This is not a course any Government could support.  Successive Irish Governments and Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade, across the political spectrum - I remind Fianna F&aacute;il of that fact - have taken the same view while in office.  I have obtained the formal advice of the Attorney General on this matter.  It confirms the view taken by successive Governments that measures of the nature proposed in the Bill would be contrary to EU law, by which Ireland is bound.  I have a letter from the Attorney General that contains 52 paragraphs which explain in detail why that is the case.  </p> <p>Senator Frances Black and others have relied on legal opinions, which I accept.  I realise this is not a Bill that has been put forward lightly.  We spoke about this aspect for up to two hours as late as yesterday.  The legal opinions argue that a national ban is possible under EU law by invoking certain exceptions.  The central legal issue is whether the Bill would be permitted under a particular exception allowed for in EU law for national action on trade restrictions, specifically the public policy exception.  I am advised that the European Court of Justice has shown in previous cases that it will not allow this term to be interpreted as broadly as is being suggested by supporters of the Bill and that, consequently, this exception cannot be relied on to defend the Bill.  For all of these reasons, the Government remains clear that a ban on settlement products could only be adopted successfully at EU level.  Of course, we will give full and due consideration to any proposal brought forward at EU level.  In fact, Ireland contributes actively to that debate.</p> <p>The political effects of the Bill are also a key consideration, perhaps the most important.  Ireland is a small state located far from the region, but it has a strong voice and greater influence in dealing with Middle East issues generally at UN and, in particular, EU level than its size alone would justify.  That is where we are able to be of most help to the Palestinian people - indeed, both peoples - in achieving peace.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have achieved this influence by the consistent application and focus of Governments, Ministers and the Oireachtas over a long period, with the support of the Irish people.  However it is, and has always been, a matter for careful and sober judgement.  If we get too far out in front of the consensus, then perhaps we cease to shape it.  If we allow ourselves to be discounted in the calculations that other states make about where the centre of gravity on an issue lies, then perhaps we cease to shape that centre of gravity.</p><p>I am in no doubt, from my experience of discussions on this issue at EU level, that a unilateral move by Ireland on this matter would weaken our ability to influence overall EU policy, not strengthen it.  In the current climate there are several EU governments that are much less supportive of the Palestinian cause than we are in Ireland.  We spend a great deal of effort in Brussels, New York and Geneva arguing for a common EU policy on the Middle East.  A position on which the EU can agree may fall short of our highest ambitions but it also ensures that important norms around the final status issues and the two-state solution continue to have a powerful and united global advocate.</p></speech>

Ireland played a central role in achieving many of the EU measures on settlements, such as product labelling guidelines.  There are also differentiated EU tariffs at EU level for goods coming from settlements and Israel.  We were among the first advocates of a policy emphasis on differentiation between Israel and the settlements, which has come to be embodied in many EU measures.  We continue to advocate for such actions.</p> <p>Like many here today, I am frustrated that the growth of settlements has not stopped but I am proud that Ireland has been a consistent and influential advocate in support of Palestinians.  My fear is that if Ireland is to adopt the course of action in this Bill, we would be choosing instead to be a principled voice in the wilderness satisfied in the righteousness of our course, but largely unable to influence the real action.  This is my biggest concern about the legislation.</p> <p>I ask the House to listen to me on this point.  I have spent hours trying to build relationships with people who will be involved in decision making that can bring about peace - Palestinians, Americans, Israelis and others in Jordan, Egypt, Cyprus and many other neighbouring countries.  I fear the consequence of Ireland taking a significantly different position from everybody else in the European Union and the world would be to suddenly undermine my capacity to be seen as someone to whom both sides can at least talk, even though I clearly advocate strongly for Palestinians all the time.  This is a real fear.  I do not say this for convenience because this is awkward legislation or I am being heavily lobbied.  I say it because, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I care about this issue.  I have spent a significant amount of time on it and I want Ireland to be at the centre of these discussions, where it matters and we can help a vulnerable and exposed community of Palestinians who are part of a deep injustice that has lasted for decades.</p> <p>I suspect this Bill will pass today.  By passing it, Senators may believe we are striking out in solidarity with Palestinians, which we are and that is how it will be seen, but one week later, where will an Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade be with regard to the relationships we have worked so hard to build up over the past 12 months?  I have spent a substantial amount of taxpayers' money funding my travel in these endeavours.  We are trying to help Palestinians and to ensure that teenagers in Gaza are no longer shot dead.</p></speech>

I will address that because I believe we have the potential to influence.  I also reiterate the point I made here in January about what Ireland can do to be of practical help to Palestinians in ways that make fewer headlines than this Bill does, but which will change the position on the ground.  I have invested a great deal of time and effort in the last year in establishing relationships with the governments of both Israel and the United States on Middle East issues, despite our very different views on these matters much of the time.  I am realistic about the chances of success of the peace process, but we have to use all the possible influence we can bring to bear.</p> <p>On the practical ideas to assist the situation in Gaza, I have reached a much greater degree of understanding in both Israel and Washington for the measures we are now trying to take forward with Palestinians.  Ireland is committed to developing a solar energy project to alleviate the energy shortage in Gaza, on which we will spend &euro;10 million.</p></speech>

That is what I am interested in.</p> <p>We are also advancing an expanded programme for scholarships for Palestinians.  We continue to advocate strongly for a commercial port for Gaza in the medium to longer term and have placed the issue of pre-checking goods in the EU - in Cyprus - prior to arrival in Gaza as a potential means of loosening or breaking the blockade, which has caused untold suffering.  We have managed to place that back on the agenda for consideration by all interested parties.  It is not only Ireland working on this but we have advocated forcefully on this issue for a year.  We were getting nowhere one year ago.  Six months ago, we were getting somewhere and now the Israeli Government is actively talking with Cyprus about how a Cypriot port could be used to facilitate commercial traffic in and out of Gaza port for Palestinians.  This would be a breach and breaking of the blockade through diplomacy and politics, which is what I am interested in achieving, as opposed to protest.</p> <p>These are the kinds of issues on which Ireland is exerting influence and which I have spent my time trying to bring forward.  They are tangible, practical projects to improve daily life on the ground, but we need some political space to be able to deliver them.  All of this effort could come to naught if we choose to go it alone by isolating Ireland in policy development in this area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The third basis on which the Government must oppose the Bill is the assessment of its practical effects.  Targeting settlement products is not a magic bullet.  The settlement project is motivated by predominantly political, security and, unfortunately,  ideological considerations, not economic.  Settlements are hugely expensive for Israel and contribute little.  Their exports are not an essential prop, without which the system would collapse.  Most settlements produce nothing, except a great deal of hassle for many.  It is estimated that almost all settlement goods could be absorbed by the Israeli domestic market, if exports were impossible.  The volume of settlement goods reaching Ireland is thought to be very small.  The effect of a ban as envisaged in the Bill would be largely symbolic, rather than practical in deterring settlements, as I believe most of us would accept.  However, the practical challenges and costs of compliance for businesses would not be negligible.  The Bill would risk putting companies based in Ireland in a position where they would face conflicting legal obligations in Ireland and other jurisdictions where they operate.  For example, the careful distinction made in the Bill, in focusing only on settlements in the occupied territories, not Israel, is one which is not always reflected in the drafting of anti-boycott legislation at federal and state level in the United States.  As we know only too well, these careful distinctions are too frequently lost in reporting internationally on the type of proposal under consideration.</p><p>I fully accept that the Bill, if enacted, would provide solace and support for Palestinians at a difficult time.  From that perspective, emotionally, I can connect with it.  We constantly need to think of ways to do more to protect the Palestinians and raise their cause internationally, but it may only be a moment - a once-off boost to morale and an act of solidarity - that will quickly diminish in effect when Ireland finds on the international stage that it is no longer as influential as it would like to be.  I have stated the Government has clear and consistent advice that the Bill would put Ireland in breach of EU law.  Even if that were not so, the balance of positive and negative impacts argues strongly against this unilateral move by Ireland at this stage, however strongly it may appeal to our sense of right and desire to act.  Believe me, it is a strong sense from my perspective, but it would damage Ireland domestically and, more importantly, in the context of our ability to help Palestinians internationally, to which I am absolutely committed to doing.  For these reasons, I am opposing the Bill.</p></speech>

His understanding of the complex nature of the issue is beyond question.  He has a good grasp of the problems facing the Palestinian people when it comes to the settlements, the ongoing occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p> <p>In 1980 Ireland was the first state to call for the establishment of a Palestinian state.  We were on our own; nobody else supported us as nobody had thought of it at the time.  We were seen to be ahead of the European Union and everybody else in the world in leading the way.  When Ronald Reagan was elected President of the United States, there were 40,000 illegal settlers on the West Bank; today, there are nearly 500,000.  </p> <p>I commend the Minister on the issue of having a port, but such access could end at any time.  We have been talking about improving conditions the prisoners when they should not be prisoners at all.  They should be released from captivity in the Holy Land.  The Knesset is putting a Bill through which provides for full annexation of the settlements to be recognised.  Does that sound like that anybody is trying to make things better?  I know the work the Minister is doing on the issue of a port, scholarships and the solar energy project.  I was in Washington the last time the Gaza Strip was attacked.  There was the firing of rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel and the consequent response was the levelling of every piece of infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.  Water pumps, sewage treatment plants, factories, schools, and hospitals were levelled and that is what will happen again.</p> <p>I note the point the Minister made about the politics of the issue, but the practicalities are a peace process has four fundamental elements.  It needs stalemate on both sides, but that is not happening.  It needs an independent outside actor.  The European Union will not even invoke its own human rights clause in Article 4 of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement with Israel.  Why does it not do so and state there has been a breach of human rights?  Will the Minister answer that question?  Another fundamental point is that in a peace process there is a need to ensure there are no third parties acting as outside agitators.  Of course, that is what is happening.  The timing also needs to be correct.  None of the four elements required in a peace process is present in the Middle East.  We had all four at the time of the Good Friday Agreement 20 years ago.  None of them is present in Israel.  </p> <p>What the Minister is asking us to do is to seek to improve the conditions for people in the Gaza Strip at a time when conditions are getting exponentially worse by the day.  The Oslo Accords, for anyone who knows the details, were a disastrous solution.  Almost 40% would not be controlled by the Palestinian people, but that would be much better than what they are experiencing.  We have letters from the Knesset.  I remember Arab Palestinian Members of the Knesset asking us to put this Bill through.  They are on the ground and asking for something to be done because something is a lot better than nothing.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister.  I am well aware that he is very concerned about and interested in this issue.</p> <p>In 2002 or 2003 I established the Friends of Palestine group with about 100 people in the Oireachtas.  It was chaired by the then Deputy Michael D. Higgins, now President of Ireland.  At the time I travelled to Palestine with former Deputies Eamon Gilmore and John Gormley, the late Tony Gregory, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, the then Senator John Paul Phelan, now a Minister of State.  I led the delegation.  We witnessed at first hand the effects of the settlements and saw raw sewage being poured onto small farms in the occupied territories.  That is a fact.  Is this the right way to assert influence in the settlement of the problems in the region?  </p> <p>When I was a Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing, I travelled to the Islamic Republic of Iran and many other countries to promote trade with this country.  We should remember that a boycott is a two-edged sword.  If we boycott goods from Palestine, we could boycott the export of goods from Crimea which is occupied by the Russian Federation.  We could also boycott goods from Cyprus which is occupied by Turkey.  We could boycott all goods from China which occupies Tibet.  Ukraine is occupied, as is Northern Ireland.  We could go down that road very easily.  </p> <p>In 2017 we exported $868 million dollars worth of goods to Israel, from where we imported $63 million dollars worth of goods.  These at the facts I have at my disposal.  The World Bank has stated goods to the value of about $1.6 billion have been exported during the years.  We should bear this in mind.  The repercussions would be serious.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The repercussions are serious.  Boycotts are serious.  I do not recall a Bill being introduced here when South Africa had apartheid.  The boycott was carried out by the workers in Dunnes Stores and followed up by the public.  I would certainly boycott products coming from occupied territories sold by the Israelis on the international market, but it is a different thing for a state to involve itself directly in this area.  I advise caution.  Like the Minister, my heart is behind this.  I was there and I witnessed the situation at first hand, as did the Minister.  We were not allowed into Gaza, which is an open prison.  We have no doubt about what is happening in that region, but introducing a boycott would mean one would lose one's influence to go to Israel and make the point to the Israeli Government about what one feels.  We will continue the argument in that regard.</p><p>In terms of the Bill and the respect and support it will be offered this afternoon, I have been trying to introduce a Private Members' Bill for approximately ten years and I have failed.  Senator Frances Black should not bet her bottom dollar that this Bill will ever become legislation.  Let us be clear about that.  The process in this House is very slow.  Very few Private Members' Bills get through.  There is a question about the Bill's legality and our responsibility under European Union law.  The Attorney General, whom I respect, has given advice in that regard.  I issue that health warning.  I am very concerned about the effect a boycott could have on jobs in this country.  We need every job possible.  We are facing a terrible dilemma in relation to Brexit and at this point we can ill afford another trade war with another country which has a legitimately elected government.  We are in favour of the two-state solution.  The late Brian Lenihan senior was the first Minister in this country and Europe to bring forward the right of Palestinians to self-determination and their own country.</p></speech>

As someone who has lived in a charged and sometimes very toxic environment, when I look at the Bill that has been proposed I struggle with it on the basis that public perception is often key to such discussions.  As someone who has lived in Northern Ireland through a difficult time, I know the message that was often portrayed globally was not what I experienced on the ground.  Therefore, one has to be careful about the message one gets out of such an area.  One man's occupied territory is another man's homeland.  One's man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter and one's man's active aggression is another man's act of self-defence.  I think we must be cognisant of that, because no one in this building today truly understands the complexity of this discussion.</p> <p>We cannot attribute blame to one side or the other in this discussion.  All involved must be accountable and we must fully understand the objectives of the Bill.  In my view, the objectives are to protect the Palestinian people and to lead a change in attitude to this long-running issue to achieve a resolution.</p> <p>I work part-time in a university environment.  As many in the Chamber are aware, universities are judged by output and impact.  What will be the output and impact of the Bill?  I am not convinced it would deliver the desired outcomes.  The Good Friday Agreement demonstrated the value of dialogue and talking and even though that is a long, slow and tedious process, it is the only process that will deliver results.</p> <p>Ireland's role, as an independent state, should be to support and facilitate dialogue and conflict resolution in the area.  If enacted, the Bill would be applicable to many territories around the world, and I do not think that is going to happen.  For that reason, I oppose the Bill and support the Government's position of facilitating dialogue and support.  An embargo in such circumstances would probably create more problems that it would resolve.</p></speech>

I fully respect the views just expressed by Senator Marshall.  I also take into account what the Minister said today and what Senator Leyden has said on the issue.  However, I have a different view.  Since 1967 and the subsequent illegal occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and west Jerusalem and the annexation of Golan by the Israeli armed forces, there has been a constant, deliberate and systematic defiance of international law.</p></speech>

It violates international law.</p> <p>If, like Senator Marshall, I took the view that things were progressing in the right direction and we were in the middle of a delicate peace process that could be destabilised by unilateral statements from the outside from people who are not exactly involved in the process, I would hesitate.  However, I see a different scenario which I will state emphatically.  I see the American intervention in Israel under President Trump.  I see Jared Kushner's involvement.  I see what has been stated by the American Secretary of State and its ambassador to the UN on these issues and it is all going in the wrong direction.  I believe the government of Benjamin Netanyahu has to get a message-----</p></speech>

Those are the minimum aims.  I do not say this has to be done tomorrow but those are the minimum aims of establishing peace in the Middle East.  Therefore, no matter how complicated our position is by virtue of our membership of the European Union and no matter how ineffectual the passage of this Bill may be economically on the state of Israel, as somebody who has always supported the right of Israel to exist, I believe the passage of the Bill may begin to set off similar gestures and stances in other countries across the world to give a message to Benjamin Netanyahu that the annexation of the occupied territories must stop and be reversed and that Israel must commit itself to doing so.  That is why I am supporting the Bill.</p></speech>

I do not think anyone in the House is disputing that.  I commend Senator Black on introducing the Bill.  In essence, there is not a person in this House, and very few outside it in this country, who in any way countenance the settlements.  They are a horror to all of us.  They are illegal and they are wrong on every front.  There is discrimination in the supply of water and energy.  There is 40% unemployment in Gaza.  The list goes on.  It is a horror and it is wrong.  There is no ambiguity about that.  We are unequivocally of that view.  That is the T&aacute;naiste's view and the view of every Member of the House.  I am sure that is the view of the great majority of the people outside this House.  We are all unambiguously clear on the issue.  It is also a horror that 130 Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks during protests.  The Israeli reaction has been deemed to be excessive by the UN.</p> <p>The questions before the House are how to respond to that and what is the proportionate and wise response.  There is no question about the horror involved and we could all speak for an hour on that.  I would like to have spoken much more graphically on the issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The question presented today is whether we take the T&aacute;naiste's advice based on the advice he received from the Attorney General, his experience internationally and, more important in this context, his experience of visiting the Middle East on a number of occasions and interacting on this issue with colleagues at all levels in the European Union.  The T&aacute;naiste's advice is to hold off on this because he believes its impact will be minimal and it will diminish Ireland's moral authority and the possibility, as a small neutral state, to politically impact on the situation.  It will not, therefore, have a proportionate effect.  The question is which position which will have more impact.  Should we continue to make progress and work strenuously as a neutral state with moral authority and a tradition of respect for the human being, freedom, independence and justice or, by doing this against the T&aacute;naiste's advice, should we put ourselves out of that frame in respect of the same kind of moral authority and politically impactful role?  Coupled with that, we have the legal advice from the Attorney General, which does not need further elucidation.  The real issue is the first question I posed.</p><p>I appeal to my good friend and colleague, Senator Black, in this instance.  She showed great maturity and political cop-on in previously accepting the T&aacute;naiste's advice to wait.  I know it is hard to do so twice but that advice has not been given lightly.  Perhaps it would be more impactful to comment and protest but to see whether we can deal with the question diplomatically and keep it under review.  My colleagues have two other specific points they want to make.  That is, in essence, the question before the House.  </p></speech>

It is completely opposed to the construction of settlements and has consistently condemned their expansion.  On an emotional level, the Bill has a strong appeal and I respect the motives of those supporting it.  However, the Minister has made clear that the Government does not support boycotts of Israel believing such actions would be ineffective and counter-productive in respect of those who agree with the resolution of the conflict and would potentially isolate Israelis from interactions in which diverse views on these issues are expressed.  Successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs have taken this view.  Taking the Bill forward would isolate Ireland in terms of dialogue.  The Government believes Ireland would find it much more difficult to maintain dialogue, which currently provides opportunities to raise these very difficult issues and press for action towards peace.  Some may dismiss this dialogue but, ultimately, how are we to achieve peace in the Middle East?</p></speech>

As noted by previous speakers, we are unified on the need to improve the position and conditions of the Palestinian people.  That is the first thing.  The question is whether this can be done by continued diplomacy and work by Ireland led by the T&aacute;naiste.  I was highly impressed by the passion he displayed in setting out how he intends to do this and the other arguments.</p> <p>I had not intended speaking at all and I thank Senator O'Reilly for sharing time to allow me to contribute for a couple of minutes.  The question I must ask is whether we can keep both avenues on the table.  I know the Bill has been postponed since January.  This is not about trying to kick anything down the road.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste whether there is any possibility of tangible progress being made by September or October.  If there is no prospect of progress, I would support this statement being made by this House at that stage.  I would have no problem with that.  Could the T&aacute;naiste give some assurance that progress is possible in the next few months?  We could then ask both sides to keep both avenues on the table in order that we can reach a conclusion on this matter.  As Senator Marshall said, at the end of the day, it is dialogue that solves most problems.  </p></speech>

Cuirim fearadh na f&aacute;ilte cro&iacute;&uacute;il roimh iad si&uacute;d at&aacute; sa Ghaileara&iacute; linn don d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht freisin.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his contribution.  Listening to him, I could not help but think of Einstein's definition of insanity, which involves doing the same things over and over again and expecting different results.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about the issue of solar panels, electricity and water for the occupied territories as if Israel would not continue to shut off and control people's water and electricity.  He spoke about advocating strongly for a commercial port in Gaza knowing full well what happens to fishermen in Gaza and what happens to children when they are playing soccer on the beach in Gaza.  I do not doubt the T&aacute;naiste's bona fides in this regard but based on fact and reality, I do not share his hope in that regard.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste also cited the peace process as cause for the State not to support this Bill.  He then outlined the litany of executions, slaughter and mass murder, the imprisonment of children in military courts, the continued demolition of homes and further illegal incursions into Palestinian lands.  There is no peace process in the Middle East and it is a flag of convenience, a cloak and a cover to try to use that as an excuse not to support this Bill.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste said he does not want to place himself on a particular side or be accused of being partisan.  As I stated during the previous debate on this issue, sometimes in peace processes, we need to place ourselves in a particular partisan position.  Sometimes we need transformative decisions to be taken on the international stage.  The most glaring, obvious and relevant example in our own peace process was when the British Government, the European Union and the US domestic and foreign intelligence agencies told President Bill Clinton not to grant Gerry Adams a US visa.  All of the great and the good , all of the so-called experts and all of those who were opposed to the advance of dialogue and a peace process said, "Don't do this."  What was required, however, was a decisive and definitive political decision.  We have seen the fruits of that decision play out and the impact it had on our peace process.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that he needs to take a definitive decision in this regard and support this Bill.  </p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste also cited legal, political and practical effects as reasons not to support the Bill but to oppose it.  It struck me that he did not once mention the morality of this issue.  </p></speech>

Through the Chair, we have acknowledged, as has the Minister, that people have deeply held and passionate views on these issues, so the Leader should at the very least afford us the courtesy of an opportunity to express those views without the kind of interruption we have seen.</p> <p>Nelson Mandela attended a joint sitting of the Houses in the early 1990s.  He said that what had made the practical difference on the part of the Irish people was definitive action in the form of their boycott and solidarity.  That can make the difference in the Bill that will be before the House today.  The Minister asked where supporting that Bill would leave him as an Irish Government Minister.  It would leave him on the side of right.  It would leave him on the side of Mandela.  It would leave him on the side of justice.  I encourage the Minister, the Government and colleagues in Fine Gael to reconsider the Bill and what is happening in Palestine and to look at the will of the House and the majority of Irish people, who want to see us take this mode of solidarity.</p></speech>

The strike that followed on from that action lasted three years.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste is familiar with the history of that.  In 1987, we became the first State in the western world to introduce economic sanctions against South Africa.  We led the way.</p> <p>I believe that the views the T&aacute;naiste has articulated in this debate are sincerely held, but Senator Black's Bill will be our Dunnes Stores moment as regards Palestine.  We will get a chance to break a consensus that has failed the Palestinian people and to take decisive leadership on this issue.  Under international law, the development of illegal settlements is a war crime.  We are engaging in commerce with people who are committing war crimes.  We are waiting for our European partners to do what is right, but they are not doing it.  Not only that, but they cannot even criticise the decision of President Donald Trump to put an embassy in Jerusalem.</p> <p>In the absence of leadership at European level, this is our Dunnes Stores moment.  This is when our State once again takes decisive leadership in the absence of international leadership and stands by an oppressed people.  I commend Senator Black.  The Bill will be her Mary Manning moment and the House's Dunnes Stores moment to do what is right yet again.</p></speech>

I want to ensure that I say everything I need to.</p> <p>Last night, I welcomed two amazing Palestinian farmers to Dublin.  Mona and Fayez travelled all the way from the West Bank to meet ordinary Irish people and groups that had been fundraising, holding public meetings and sending support.  They are watching from the Gallery and I extend to them a sincere welcome on what I hope will be an historic occasion.  They have been living in the shadow of Israel's illegal annexation wall since 2003, fighting against the demolition of their home and the confiscation of their land.  The wall has literally cut their farm in half, and the impact it has had on their family is devastating.  Sadly, their story is not unique.  It is repeated endlessly across the West Bank, where over 42% of land has now been confiscated, seriously undermining the viability of a sustainable Palestinian state.</p> <p>Though these settlements are repeatedly condemned as illegal by the EU, UN and Irish Government, they continue to extract valuable natural resources and agricultural produce.  These goods are then exported and sold on shelves around the world, including in Ireland, to pay for the occupation.  There is a clear hypocrisy here.  How can we condemn the settlements as illegal, as theft of land and resources, but then happily buy the proceeds of that crime?  We must be clear on this - Israeli settlements in the West Bank are war crimes.  That is what we are dealing with, and I am amazed at how relaxed people can be about it, as if trading in the proceeds of war crimes is not a big deal.  For a country that prides itself on upholding humanitarian principles and international law, this is unacceptable.  It is time we stood clearly against this injustice.</p> <p>I have had long conversations with the T&aacute;naiste on this matter.  I know his passion and commitment, I respect him so much and I recognise the great work he is doing, but I fundamentally disagree that the current policy is working.  For 25 years, Ireland and the EU have issued statement after statement of condemnation, but settlement expansion has continued and more homes have been demolished.  It is getting to the point now where there will soon be no Palestine left to recognise.  As long as the settlements stay profitable and we buy their stolen goods, nothing will change.</p></speech>

We are not looking to go it alone, but to lead.  This is not a radical demand.  We are simply asking for consistency in our foreign policy and a disassociation from clear violations of international law.</p> <p>The Bill will not end trade in Israeli produce, only goods produced in the settlements beyond its borders - this is not a case of boycott, divestment and sanctions, BDS - that have been long condemned by Ireland and its EU partners as illegal.  This distinction is important.  I have listened to the argument that, as an EU member state, we cannot change trade policy unilaterally, but I strongly disagree.  The legal basis of the Bill is outlined in great detail in the legal opinions I have shared with colleagues across the House.  They are written by Mr. Michael Lynn, senior counsel, and Judge James Crawford, professor of international law at the University of Cambridge and a sitting judge at the International Court of Justice.  The Government may disagree, but these are some of the most eminent and authoritative legal scholars in Ireland and the world.  Their input carries weight.  I also thank Senator McDowell, a former Attorney General, for offering his legal support to the Bill.  It meant so much.</p> <p>The fundamental argument offered by Judge Crawford and others is clear, in that Ireland is entitled under Article 36 of the treaties to end its support for what the EU itself says are violations of international law.  Our capacity to take this measure rests precisely on the overwhelming consensus that the settlements are illegal.  Article 36 can be read narrowly, but cases like this are exactly why it exists: for limited, proportional restrictions on trade justified on the basis of our other obligations, such as upholding and respecting international humanitarian law and human rights.</p> <p>I disagree on concerns over enforcement.  Under the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015, for example, bottles will only be imported and sold into Ireland from other EU states if they display Government-mandated health warnings.  This is another modest and proportional restriction that does not require extensive customs checks, only simple instructions that our supermarkets and businesses can follow.  The same applies in this instance.</p> <p>As I am limited on time-----</p></speech>

In terms of the subject matter we are debating here, we should point out that we actually have a remarkable level of consensus in this Chamber.  There is a broad consensus that the Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal.  In the words of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, from our January debate: &ldquo;The relentless expansion of Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory is unjust, provocative, and undermines the credibility of Israel&rsquo;s commitment to a peaceful solution to a conflict to which we all want an end.&rdquo;</p> <p>There is also a broad consensus that Ireland should act to intervene and, indeed, considering our own historical experience, that we have a moral obligation to do so.  We now have a majority supporting the withdrawal of economic support from goods and services originating in occupied territories as the means by which we vindicate our commitments under international law.</p> <p>If we have consensus on the principles behind the Bill, the aims of the Bill and the means by which to achieve those aims, it is important to note and consider that.  It seems, therefore, the main point of contention left is the compatibility of the Bill with our trade policies and the EU Single Market.  The Government contends that trade is an exclusive EU competence and member states have no latitude to act unilaterally.  We contend that the public policy exemption in Article 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes this Bill legal, as this Bill is justifiable on public morality grounds, a view supported by several eminent legal scholars.  The Government counterclaims this exemption has been interpreted narrowly by the European Court of Justice and that this Bill would not stand.  In response, I would personally be proud to see Ireland move to becoming a leader on using trade policy as tool to defend morality and human rights within the Single Market.  That is what this Bill could represent.</p> <p>The Minister said that Ireland cannot go it alone on this issue and that we need an EU-wide effort.  This Bill, in fact, could be what jump-starts that EU-wide effort.  We may be the first to use the public policy exception to stand up for the rights of the people of Palestine but I can guarantee we would not be the last as we would be setting an example, and one that could be followed.  At a time when Ireland too often hits the headlines for falling foul of EU law and initiatives in negative terms, whether that be failing climate change targets or illegal state aid in the Apple tax case, this is our chance to push the boat out and lead Europe in standing up for occupied territories, the people of Palestine and international human rights law.  Why should we only look to push EU legal boundaries in support of corporations and tax avoidance and not the rights of oppressed people in desperate need of our support and solidarity?  Today, we can set an example and blaze a trail that other EU states can follow, where Ireland took an intimidating but bold first step.  I hope that is something the T&aacute;naiste will consider as the Bill moves further through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I have been going backwards and forwards to Israel and Palestine for 40 years.  I had an apartment in Jerusalem for many years which I shared with my partner, Ezra Yitzhak Nawi, who is an Israeli Jewish civil rights activist who has been victimised by the Israeli State for his strong support for the Palestinian people.  I am honoured to be a signatory of this Bill.  I think it is a remarkable initiative.  I hope very much that this Bill goes to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has the courage to pass it and send a direct message to the Government.  I would say to the Government today that people all over Europe, people in parliaments all over Europe, are watching this debate; they will take courage from it and they will pass similar legislation.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste said: &quot;We are not in a position to raise a barrier and declare that goods legally available elsewhere in the EU cannot be brought into Ireland for sale.&quot;  They are not legally available elsewhere.  This is a violation of international law.  Importation of goods and services coming from settlements in occupied territories is illegal under international law and prohibiting trade with settlements does not violate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which does not apply in such circumstances.</p><p>Very significant people in Israel have signed a letter that states: &quot;As concerned citizens of Israel who wish to live in peace with our neighbours, we once again urge Ireland to support this legislation that will ban trade between Ireland and Israel&rsquo;s illegal settlements in the West Bank.&quot;  It is signed by Uri Avnery, the ambassador, professor Elie Barnavi, the ambassador Ilan Baruch and a whole series of ambassadors, as well as the speaker of the Knesset.  This is the voice of the real conscience of Israel.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste said we could be a principled voice in the wilderness.  Let us be such.</p></speech>

If Ireland accepts this Bill, the voice of Ireland will be heard throughout the ages as well.</p> <p>United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 of 23 December 2016 reaffirms that Israel&rsquo;s establishment of settlements in occupied Palestinian territory has no legal validity and that Israel's settlement enterprise is a flagrant violation of international law.  It call upon all states to, "distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory and the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967".  There is our justification from the United Nations itself.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste has spoken about very admirable projects, such as solar energy projects.  I raised &euro;55,000 to put in solar energy and water treatment plants and I saw them being demolished and bombed by the Israelis.  That is what happens.  The T&aacute;naiste talked about the solar energy plant and he said, as if it was something positive, that it was in Israeli-controlled territory.  What do the Israelis do?  Every time they feel like it, they switch the electricity off.  I have seen pathetic little houses demolished by Israeli bulldozers.  I have seen the results of the bombing of hospitals, of schools, or sewage treatment plants.  It is appalling.  The T&aacute;naiste claims to speak on behalf of the people of Palestine.  If he wants to know what the people of Palestine want, ask the Palestinian farmers in the Visitors' Gallery and they will tell him.  I will surrender my time to my colleagues.</p></speech>

I want to confirm the strong support of the Labour Party in the Seanad for this Bill.  I spoke in January to express our support for it then.  I commend Senator Black and her colleagues for bringing it forward.</p> <p>Since January, when we commenced the debate on the Bill, the case for the Bill has become even more compelling.  We have seen appalling atrocities, including the killing of Palestinian civilians.  Looking at the UN figures, in Gaza between 30 March and 18 June, 137 Palestinians were killed, with some 14,800 injured, including 3,943 by live ammunition and gunshots.  We have seen no progress on the peace process; indeed, we have seen a roll-back on US intervention in the peace process.  Therefore, we have no choice but to try to take a lead on this.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Labour Party has a long-standing position in support of the rights of the Palestinian people which is informed by the need for a two state solution.  We have always stood for the need for a comprehensive multilateral peace agreement between Israel and Palestine which respects international law.  We are seeing multiple violations of international law in the ongoing settlements.  As T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, who was then leader of the Labour Party, led the way in 2011 in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York in which he supported the Palestinian bid to become a full member of the UN.  We led then.  Sweden and other countries have led within the EU in unilateral actions recognising the state of Palestine.  It is time for us in Ireland to again lead on this issue and in asserting the rights of the Palestinian people by taking the modest step of supporting Senator Black's Bill.  I strongly urge colleagues to support the Bill in this House today.</p></speech>

I welcome to the Gallery many of our most distinguished guests about whom we are speaking.  I am very privileged to be a Member of the Upper House and to be an Independent one.  As legislators, all of us in this House are tasked with upholding, creating and developing laws which value life, equality, freedom, peace and the expectation of hope, meaning and happiness.  It is entirely right that a Bill such as this should come through the House.  We either believe in democracy or we do not.  There is something rotten in the way democracy is defined, lived and, most importantly, denied in the Israeli-Palestinian territories.  Democracy among Palestinians is more akin to annihilation.</p> <p>Since I came into this Seanad we have asked incessant and sincere questions daily about our own human rights in Ireland in respect of, for example, our sexuality, our partnerships, direct provision, the quality of educational opportunity, penal reform, our right to life and, this morning, the right to Traveller education within our culture.  These issues all pale into privileged insignificance when compared with the issue of human rights in Palestine.  All humans' rights are supposed to have the same value; at least that is where we are supposed to begin.  However, that is not the case with the rights of one Israeli soldier and those of 500 Palestinian children.  That is a war in which there are no rules.  Israel occupies a place in Palestine in which it obeys no rules.  </p> <p>I have had the privilege of visiting Palestine.  Throughout the years I have been in this House I have witnessed the greatest violation of human rights by one country over another, Israel over Palestine.  Senator Norris has described it most eloquently.  It is a living apartheid every day.  The wall has been mentioned.  It is higher and more evident now than it was when Senators from Fianna F&aacute;il were there.  It runs through people's homes, yards, farms, houses, business premises, olive groves and water, as was mentioned.  If the Israelis decide to turn off the water, that is what happens.  If they decide to turn off the electricity, that is what happens.  The wall runs through their fields, hills, trees and lives.  Whenever Israel wants to push it, pull it or further it, that will happen.  It gets bigger, thicker and fatter every day as it is built.  The Palestinians who are here with us today have to go around it because they cannot go over it.  They have no access to cross.  They have to cross at different places.  They queue for hours to go to work and to leave.  They queue to come home and to leave their homes if they have work.  They cannot drive on Israeli motorways without a pass.  They cannot live without a permit.  Every Palestinian I met there was living normally in captivity.  </p> <p>This House is supposed to be about upholding freedom, peace, justice and equality.  That is why I have the privilege of being here.  The people I met were living normally in captivity.  They live despite themselves.  One of the greatest culprits in this matter is a toothless and very insular Europe.  It is not the Minister, but a very toothless and insular Europe which only ever comes to the fore in here when we are talking about the great god called the euro.  If we are talking in Europe about the god called the euro, everybody is to the front.  God is the dollar and the dollar is god.  We have such arguments for it.  Somebody recently asked me who runs Europe.  I said the European Central Bank.  It does.  We can do nothing else.  That is also a dysfunction of the UN.  There is philosophy and policy, but where is the action?  There is also the United States of America.  We get the finest combination of onlookers, ignorers and willful powerlessness.</p> <p>What can the Seanad do?  We can do something.  Personally, I would like to see sanctions against Israel for crimes against humanity.  Is this Bill the way to go?  I took in all the arguments because I believe this is a House of listening as well as one of speaking.  I do not know.  What goods are we talking about?  How will we guarantee that such goods will be illegal?  Where is there such produce in our shops?  What is the produce?  What shops are involved?  How would it move democracy on?  How would it be implemented?  We are talking about &euro;250,000 and five years in jail if one violates the law.  </p> <p>I have two points.  I come from a background in the arts.  It was always the arts that elevated politics, death, destruction, denial and fraction into another area.  An example is Daniel Barenboim's West&ndash;Eastern Divan Orchestra in which Israelis and Palestinians come together to use the arts to elevate people from destruction.  However, I think in this instance Senator Black is correct.  I understand the arguments on either side but I am going to support Senator Black because if we do not we will continue with policy and with speaking and we will continue doing nothing while thinking we are doing something because we are speaking about it in 15 different languages.  I agree with the Senator and I am going to support her.  I thank her for the bravery of her Bill.</p></speech>

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, to this House again.  Once again I add my voice to those of my colleagues in support of Senator Frances Black's Private Members' Bill, which I was honoured to co-sign and which seeks to prohibit the sale of Israeli settlement goods in Ireland.  I also take this opportunity to yet again condemn the actions of the Israeli Defence Forces against unnamed protestors and to condemn the dramatic rise in the use of administrative detention, which would be more commonly known as political internment.  We have watched in horror as the events of past weeks, months and years have unfolded on our television screens and tablets.  We have seen the most desperate and brutal violations of people's right to protest against injustice, occupation and the taking of the very ground from under them.  We have seen the most reprehensible form of crackdown imaginable.  Placards, flags and stones are met with tear gas, live gunfire and shelling.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colette Kelleher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That Israel is fully committed to a two-state solution is very questionable.  It is a delusion.  Justice and peace for the Palestinian people have not been delivered.  The <i>status quo</i>has failed the Palestinian people.  It failed the more than 100 Palestinians who were shot dead in recent months and the more than 10,000 Palestinians who were wounded in protests.  It has failed the 4.3 million Palestinian refugees who are registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.  This is no new refugee crisis.  It has been happening since 1948.  For decades people have been stranded in camps that I saw for myself in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.  It has gone on for decades, which is why we are seeking a change.  How can the Minister continue with a policy that has failed the Palestinian people time and again?  Will the Government respond differently to the latest in a decades long series of violations of international norms in human rights?  Is the Minister be open to that possibility and will he listen to what we have to say?  Through the prism of the European Union, Ireland has significant influence.  The European Union is Israel's largest single trading partner and has shown a willingness to use trade to positive effect in other instances.  I ask that Ireland lead the European Union, not follow it.  How will the Minister and Ireland use their influence to effect change at EU level?  It must be a positive change to help to bring justice to the Palestinian people.  Will the Minister change his mind and listen to us?  Will he support Senator Frances Black's Bill which is a modest proposal but not radical?  I disagree with Senator Billy Lawless.  I believe the state of Israel is very vulnerable to criticism and that it is very sensitive to public opinion.  What we are doing will be noted and looked at.  Therefore, Ireland, is in a position to lead.  I know that the Minister is a man of conviction.  Therefore, I ask him to take seriously what we are asking him to do.</p></speech>

I will address a couple of issues that have arisen.  </p> <p>Members referred to the analogy of apartheid in South Africa.  In that instance the boycott was led by the demand made by the people.  The State then took an important action.  I looked back at some of the debates that took place at the time and the arguments made were remarkably similar.  They were based on our membership of the European economic area and concerns about inadvertent consequences in the areas of commerce and business.  The language used was very similar.</p> <p>Trade is an issue in which I have a strong interest and a record of examining.  Let us be clear - the Bill would not impact on international trade law.  Eminent opinions have been cited by my colleague Senator Frances Black.  World Trade Organization rules apply only to recognised territories.  They do not apply to unrecognised territories.  Signed EU free trade agreements are very clear - they explicitly exclude goods from settlements.  The European Union is clear that it does not have a free trade agreement that encompasses goods from occupied territories.  Article 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, a core document, is clear - there are exceptions to the collective rules of trade that can be justified on the grounds of public morality, public policy, public security and the protection of health and human life.  I do not believe anybody would argue that the situation we have seen unfolding and that has been documented by so many bodies is not dangerous.  Action is needed to protect the health and lives of humans, as well as in looking at issues such as public morality and public policy.  In that regard, we know that there is a precedent and that Ireland would not be on its own.  Germany has exercised the right to provide for exceptions under Article 36.  It is standard practice; it is in place for a reason and to be used.  I cannot think of a better use for it.</p> <p>The Minister spoke about not wanting to take a different position from others in Europe or elsewhere in the world.  We would be taking the same position taken by the United Nations and many in Europe.  We would, however, be taking it seriously and stand by it.  That is what is important.  If we are passionate and serious about multilateralism, we must let it be our guide.  This is not about Ireland being a voice in the wilderness but about it being a voice against the idea that we must bow to big powers.  Yes, we must work with others and diplomacy and conversation are crucial.  Everybody wants to see Ireland using its soft power through diplomacy, but part of using it is being willing to recognise that it means taking international law seriously.  It also means taking appropriate diplomatic measures such as this and recognising that we do not have to wait for Washington to be on board.  We will be waiting quite a while for that to happen.  We need to have as our guide the United Nations Human Rights Council, UNHRC, which Washington has, unfortunately, chosen to leave.  In the legal opinions cited by Senator Frances Black the UNHRC was very clear on our responsibilities.  Ireland needs to be serious about this issue.  If we want to be taken seriously in the context of the United Nations Security Council, Ireland needs to show that it takes UN rules, mandates and international law very seriously.</p> <p>This is a thoughtful Bill.  It would set as the bar the International Court of Justice, which is the highest arbiter of international law.  There are other countries such as West Papua that have sought to be recognised as occupied territories.  This Bill might have implications for them in the future also.</p></speech>

I assure her that she and the Bill have the full support of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party in the Seanad.</p> <p>It is a fact that goods produced are the result of war crimes.  We cannot condone this and have to use every instrument available to us.  The Bill is an instrument of peace.  There is no other way it can be seen.  We cannot allow international law to continue to be ignored.  We have to stand up and be counted.  This is an opportunity for us to be courageous, different and a leader.  We can lead the way on this issue.  I thank Senator Frances Black for doing so and assure her we will be behind her.  I am aware that the Minister has come to the House to convince us differently.  I acknowledge the place from which he is coming and the pragmatic things he has done, but I ask him to reconsider and support the Bill in order that there can be unanimity in the House.</p></speech>

We have heard voices across the Chamber, from all parties, that have acknowledged that Israel is an apartheid state.  Any of us who has been there knows this and once one knows it it changes a person.  Just as it was completely untenable in the 1980s to say we had to keep talking to the apartheid regime in South Africa and try to work with it, it is the same now - it is completely wrong.  Like others, I acknowledge the Minister's sincerity, but the Israeli Government and the Trump regime are the last in which one would place one's trust.  I ask the Minister to listen to all Senators across the Chamber.  From the right to the left to the centre, we are all together in acknowledging Israel as an apartheid state.  We must stand against apartheid.</p></speech>

That gives me more time than I thought I would have.  I thank everyone who has contributed to the debate.  I also thank Senator Black and the other co-sponsors of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 for facilitating it.  When we debated this issue in January, it was agreed by everybody that we would extend the debate and resume it in July before the summer recess.  We are now following through on that commitment to conclude today.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Bacik that, if anything, those months have reinforced the concerns and frustrations of many over the lack of progress in the Middle East peace process.  I would not criticise anybody for that growing frustration and sense of helplessness, as I said earlier, despite the fact that Irish people do feel a real sense of injustice about what is happening to the Palestinian communities.  That is very deeply held, not just within political parties but across Ireland generally.  We have had a presence in the Middle East for many years, predominantly through our peacekeepers of whom we continue to have a significant number today in southern Lebanon and on the Golan Heights, and indeed through NGOs working with Palestinians.  We have quite a significant humanitarian programme that I intend increasing significantly.  That process is under way.</p> <p>The politics of this is what we are debating today.  There is no doubt that this House is a very powerful voice for the Palestinian cause.  We have heard that today and not for the first time.  The first time I visited Gaza was with Senator Norris.  I remember it very well.  It was a very emotionally charged time.  The week before we arrived at the Erez Crossing, the first female suicide bomber had blown herself up, killing many young Israeli soldiers and, of course, herself, in an act of desperation and violence.  I remember when we came back to Jerusalem the difficulty that Senator Norris found in that his former partner had been thrown into prison, as the Senator might remember.</p></speech>

What I would say to Palestinians who are listening is that they have a very powerful voice in this House and in our Lower House as well across the political parties, my own included, who will continue to speak up and advocate for progress in the Middle East peace process, as will I.</p><p>What we are debating tonight, however, is not the commitment towards changing an injustice that has sustained for far too long but how we change it and how Ireland is to use its influence on the international stage, at UN level and EU level, to find a way of changing the <i>status quo</i>and moving towards the two-state solution about which so many people are becoming increasingly sceptical because of the expansion of settlements, particularly in the West Bank.  I think I have told this House before that we are seeing today the pouring of concrete on land that belongs to somebody else and is subject to a negotiated solution that will result in two states, while one of those states is becoming increasingly unviable because of the relentless expansion of settlements.  Let there be no doubt about our concern about that, our calling it out for what it is, which is illegal activity in an occupied land towards which Israel has a responsibility and on which responsibility it is not following through in a manner consistent with international law.  The issue and injustice are clear.</p><p>My problem is that the nature of the proposal we are debating today, given the current politics of the Middle East, is unlikely to contribute to changing that in the short or medium term, unless something happens on the back of this Bill being passed that I am not expecting.  I am honestly saying that, having spent a lot of time in New York, Washington and in the parts of the Middle East to which I referred, and having spoken to some of the key people who have been named in this debate today.  I have got to know them and have disagreed with them on many issues in this perspective, such as the status of Jerusalem, expanding settlements or the need to support UNWRA financially because millions of Palestinians are relying on that UN body for basic healthcare, food demands and so on.  We are working, as I say, to try to influence outcomes.</p><p>I remember very well being in New York at the UN General Assembly last September and meeting the Palestinian delegation there.  Minister al-Maliki, whom I have got to know very well and whom I respect, and the Palestinian Prime Minister had just met the US President and there was a sense of optimism that perhaps we were moving towards a new initiative that Palestinians could buy into as well as Israelis.  Unfortunately, that optimism disappeared in the months that followed, especially in the context of statements that were made in respect of Jerusalem and, subsequently, the tragedies we have seen on the Gaza border and the continuing expansion of settlements.  My point is that through that period of negativity, Ireland has been working away, trying to find ways of making things happen through persuasion, things that were not being considered a year ago and that are being considered now.</p><p>It is not just about humanitarian relief, because this has to be about something bigger than that in terms of political change.  It is also about trying to find a way of creating a context for a new peace initiative that can work.  In my view, the passing of this legislation moves us further away from the context that would allow that to happen, not closer to it.  This is a divisive mechanism and it is deliberate.</p><p>By the way, if I were to give up on persuasion and diplomacy, then I would look at supporting actions like this if I got legal advice from the Attorney General that it was possible to do it.  I have heard the Senators' explanations in terms of the legality of the Bill, but I am a Minister and I am the T&aacute;naiste.  I have to rely on the legal advice that the Government has in the Office of the Attorney General.  A former Attorney General who is a Member of this House will understand that.  I have very detailed advice which was not rushed and has been checked and double-checked in respect of our capacity to support the legislation and to implement it.  I have to be guided somewhat by that.</p><p>My primary response is one of the politics of this given the conversations and meetings I have been involved in and the progress we are trying to make towards an outcome that can help Palestinians and that can give them some hope for the future.  I will continue to pursue that despite the expectation that this legislation will pass Second Stage today.  I expect it will.  I respect this House and its decision.  I respectfully disagree with the tactic of it in the current environment, which is a very heated one in the Middle East.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Passing the Bill would fan those flames; rather, we should ensure Ireland can create a stronger, unified position within the European Union and in discussions on the issue with key actors in the United States, Ramallah and Tel Aviv.  I expect to debate the legislation again on further Stages, at which point I hope Senators will see developments along the lines I am advocating.  That will show that there are other ways by which to make progress in dealing with a problem that should have been solved decades ago and which has resulted in misery, death, violence and total hopelessness, particularly in the Gaza Strip but also among a new generation on the West Bank, because of the inability of those in power to progress a peace process that I hope can find a way forward in the coming months.</p></speech>

The parliamentary party has decided the Bill has merit in sending a message to Israel that we are not satisfied with developments in Palestine and not impressed by the oppression of the Palestinians and the way they have been treated like dirt in their own country.  Irish people have experience of being treated in a similar manner and know that action must be taken on the issue.  Fianna F&aacute;il has a long history of commitment to the Palestinian issue and no party has worked harder to seek a resolution.  At one stage, the late Brian Lenihan Snr was the only Minister in the European Union to call for recognition of the right of the Palestinians to self-determination.  That stance was not popular with other European Union member state, but he was visionary.  I recommend that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, take a similar stance.  I know that his heart is in the right place, that he is dong his utmost and that he is courageous.</p> <p>I went to the Gaza Strip with Senator David Norris who I commend for making one of the most emotional speeches I had heard in the House since I was first elected 16 years ago.

I am also very proud that this House established the Friends of Palestine group.  In no other country was the same level of support received from Members of all parties and none as in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am very proud of the work done by President Michael D. Higgins when chairman of that group and whose courage was evidenced by his visits to Palestine and the surrounding region.  I wish him well in seeking re-election as President of Ireland.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party and I are very proud to second his nomination.</p></speech>

I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I will not take up much time.  </p> <p>I understand the position of the Minister, but I support Senator Frances Black.  For far too long, we have heard of initiatives to try to solve the problems, but sometimes we need to take a bold step.  We cannot stand by and watch the destruction of an entire population.  I understand the Government will fight the good fight to try to stop the Bill which I hope will be passed.  Olive groves that had been in place for thousands of years have been destroyed, as have other crops, as Israel takes over properties as it sees fit.  The Israeli army destroys not one but two, three or four streets in retaliation for each rocket fired into Israel.  It is beyond belief the world has sat back for as long as I can remember and watched the conflict.  Sometimes a bold step is taken.  I compliment Senator Frances Black on the bold step represented by the Bill which I will support.  I deeply regret that Ireland has had to take the lead on the issue.  There are far more powerful countries that should and could have acted before now.  Those arming each side involved in the conflict need to look at what they are doing.  As Palestinians have suffered more than any other people, I support the Bill.</p></speech>

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party and, of course, the Independent Senators who support it.  I especially thank Fianna F&aacute;il.  Deputy Niall Collins travelled to Palestine to educate himself on the issue.  When he came back, he was clear about how he felt.  He saw the situation in Palestine at first hand, as I did.  I am delighted that the Bill now has the support of every political party and grouping in the Oireachtas, except those in government.  I regret that that is the case, but I remain hopeful the T&aacute;naiste will hear us out and come on board as the Bill progresses.</p> <p>I am pursuing this initiative because I want Ireland to take a stronger lead on issues of human rights and social justice and do not believe such a stance would hinder our international standing but, rather, that it would enhance it.  I saw the impact of settlement expansion when I visited the West Bank earlier this year.  I spoke to the T&aacute;naiste about it yesterday.  I witnessed the restrictions on movement, the shrinking space for housing and healthcare facilities, a chronic lack of supply of electricity and the crushing indignity of a Palestinian community having been cut off from its water supply which had been diverted to support an Israeli chicken farm.  That is horrendous and the injustice of it will stay with me forever.  That commercial settlement built on stolen land beyond Israel's internationally recognised borders is a war crime.  I know that I am repeating myself, but I ask my colleagues across the House whether the moral response is to condemn that action as illegal but then ask how much the eggs cost?  There is deep hypocrisy in such a position.</p> <p>Senators and the Minister have spoken at length about the legal aspects of the issue and our obligations as an EU member state.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In researching my speech today, I was reminded of similar debates that took place in the early 1980s, when courageous Dunnes Stores workers refused to sell goods from apartheid South Africa.  Faced with clear injustice, they followed their conscience and changed history, but their courage was not always matched here in Leinster House.  There is a great set of State papers, covered in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>a few years back, that show the opposition from Government and senior officials at the time.  As the <i>Irish Examiner</i>reported, &quot;State papers show that the Department of Foreign Affairs had no objection on political grounds to the proposals, but expressed concern that they could cause legal difficulties because of Ireland&rsquo;s Membership of the EEC&rdquo;, now the EU.  In fact, the Attorney General advised at the time that we could not legally ban apartheid produce unilaterally, a position that was of course later reversed.<br/><br/>The papers are interesting because they show that even on one of the most internationally applauded stances we have ever taken, there was still an unwillingness for Ireland to be the first to act.  We see the concern that no other EEC state had moved before us.  The papers quote a Minister who worried that &quot;a unilateral ban on trade with South Africa is inappropriate at present in that it would be unlikely to influence the South African Government&quot;.  The Minister went on to say that the huge amount of global attention could have &quot;damaging consequences for the country&rsquo;s international reputation.&quot;<br/><br/>The cases of South Africa and Palestine are not identical, but the parallels struck me all the same.  We see that same fear of taking the first step, of making a novel legal argument, of charting a course for others to follow.  Ultimately, history has shown that the brave stance in favour of justice and human rights did not undermine Ireland&rsquo;s reputation but instead greatly enhanced it.  We sent a signal to our partners that tangible, credible steps could be taken that went beyond empty condemnation, and others followed.  We did not isolate ourselves; we took the opportunity to lead.<br/><br/>We may have a long path ahead of us, but I believe that Ireland can play that role again.  When we look at how the settlement project is crippling the West Bank, the damage on the ground and the unforgivable human cost, it should summon in us the same sense of injustice and anger that compelled us to action in the 1980s.  Ultimately, the striking Dunnes Stores workers forced Irish politicians to stand up and show some leadership.  The same applies today.  I actually met one of the original striking workers, Tommy Davis, outside Leinster House this morning, and it was inspiring to see them coming to show support for this Bill.<br/><br/>We have made the case clearly that Ireland has the legal capacity to pursue this, if the political will is there.  Today I am calling on my Oireachtas colleagues to show that it is and to state firmly that Irish foreign policy will always stand on the side of international law, human rights and justice.  Go raibh maith agaibh.</p></speech>

Deputy Alan Kelly introduced this Bill as a Private Member's Bill in the D&aacute;il where it received broad support from all sides of the House.</p> <p>The principal purpose of the Bill is to create a new retail licence that will allow craft breweries and distilleries, many of which have sprung up in recent years, to sell intoxicating liquor manufactured on the premises to tourists and visitors who have participated in a guided tour of their facilities.  These premises already hold a brewer's or distiller's excise licence, or a similar manufacturer&rsquo;s licence, which authorises the licence holder to manufacture intoxicating liquor on the premises.  The Revenue Commissioners have indicated there are approximately 165 such licences in the State at present.</p> <p>We have seen a marked increase in the number of craft breweries and distilleries in recent years and this trend is set to continue.  This is a dynamic and entrepreneurial sector with real growth potential.  It goes without saying that the Government is fully committed to promoting regional and local development and, in that context, to fully supporting the job creation potential of artisan food production and local tourism initiatives.  </p> <p>Some craft breweries and distilleries already admit tourists and visitors for guided tours of their premises.  This not only serves to increase tourism activity in local areas but also creates local employment opportunities.  It also contributes to the local activity of an economic nature by generating demand for ancillary services such as accommodation, catering and transport.  Having completed a tour of such premises it is only natural that tourists and visitors may wish to purchase some of the intoxicating liquor products being produced on the premises.  They may wish to consume the products in a bar or caf&eacute; on the premises where such facilities exist, or to purchase the products for later consumption off the premises.  Members will be aware that some of the larger breweries and distilleries have already obtained public house licences, which enable them to sell alcohol products, including those produced on the premises, to visitors.  For smaller craft brewers or distillers, that may not be an option, not least because of the outlays required to extinguish an existing public house licence.  The purpose of this short Bill is to cater for their needs.   </p> <p>I am pleased to welcome many such entrepreneurs to the Public Gallery this afternoon and also the sponsor of the Bill, Deputy Alan Kelly.  </p> <p>The Bill provides that a person who already holds a relevant manufacturer&rsquo;s licence, namely, a brewer of beer for sale licence; a distiller of spirits licence; a maker of cider or perry for sale licence; a maker for sale of sweets licence or a rectifier or compounder of spirits licence, may apply to the Circuit or District Court for a certificate entitling him or her to receive a retail licence from the Revenue Commissioners.  In order to apply for such a certificate the applicant must show to the court&rsquo;s satisfaction that a manufacturing licence is in force in respect of the premises and that an appropriate mechanism is in place to limit the sale of intoxicating liquor produced on the premises to persons who have completed a guided tour of the premises.  During the passage of the Bill through the Dail, this latter condition has been relaxed, and I will return to that point shortly.</p> <p>The court will grant the requested certificate unless it prohibits the issuing of a licence on the grounds of the character, misconduct or unfitness of the applicant, the unfitness or inconvenience of the premises, or the unsuitability of the premises for the needs of persons residing in the neighbourhood.</p> <p>The successful applicant must then apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a licence.  This is the standard procedure for the granting of new retail licences under our Licensing Acts.  A licence issued under this legislation will permit the sale of intoxicating liquor produced on the premises for consumption on or off the premises to persons who have completed a guided tour.  Arising from an Opposition Report Stage amendment that was carried in the D&aacute;il, the licence will also allow for the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption off the premises to persons who have not completed a guided tour.  The licence will authorise such sales between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. on every day of the year except, 25 December, Christmas Day.</p> <p>The remaining provisions in section 1 are standard provisions in the Licensing Acts.  Subsection (3) provides that a licence issued under the Bill will expire on 30 September each year and may be renewed, while subsection (4) provides for the renewal of the licence by the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>Under 1986 legislation, intoxicating liquor licences are renewed automatically by the Revenue Commissioners on payment of the appropriate excise duty unless an objection to renewal has been lodged with the District Court on the basis that the premises concerned have not been operated in a peaceable and orderly manner during the preceding year of the licence.  Subsection (7) provides for the duty to be paid in respect of a licence issued under this section; subsection (8) contains the standard tax clearance provision, while subsections (9) and (10) provide for offences for breaches of licence conditions.  Subsection (11) sets out definitions for the purposes of the Bill, including a definition of "guided tour".  The essential features of the definition of guided tour are as follows: the tour must include an explanation of, or information on, the process whereby the intoxicating liquor is manufactured; it does not necessarily require a physical inspection of parts of premises that may present a risk to the health or safety of individuals; the tour may be led by a guide, or be self-guided; a ticket must be issued to participants in the tour, irrespective of whether an entrance fee is charged.  It is not necessary, therefore, to charge an entrance fee for the tour.  Inclusion of this definition will assist licence holders by clarifying the essential requirements of a guided tour and will enhance legal certainty for all concerned.  </p> <p>The purpose of section 2 is to prevent premises that obtain a licence under this legislation from benefiting from general exemption orders, special exemption orders and occasional licences.  These limitations formed part of Deputy Kelly&rsquo;s original Bill and are Intended to limit the risks of abuses.</p> <p>Section 3 contains technical amendments to the Licensing (Ireland) Act 1833.  </p> <p>Section 4 amends the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and has been requested by the Revenue Commissioners in order to ensure tax compliance on the part of applicants for licences.  </p> <p>Section 5 is a standard provision in regard to the Short Title, commencement and collective citation of the Act.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised that once the Bill is enacted, which I hope will happen very shortly, they will put the relevant information technology, IT, and administration requirements in place for the processing of applications and collection of the excise duty in respect of the licences.  It will not be possible to commence the Bill until these measures are in place.</p> <p>Before concluding, I want to refer briefly to the subject matter of the two Committee Stage amendments I have tabled with the approval of the Government.  As I mentioned, Opposition amendments were carried in the D&aacute;il which will permit off-sales to persons who have not participated in a guided tour of the premises.  This represents something of a departure from the original purpose of the Bill, and it broadens its scope.  I want to stress that the Committee Stage amendments I am proposing, which we will discuss shortly, are not intended to reverse the off-sales option but to address difficulties with the amended text that have been identified by the Office of the Attorney General.  Unless these difficulties are addressed now, implementation of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions may encounter some difficulties, and I do not want there to be such difficulties.  I am very keen to ensure that we continue in this House with the all-party support for the Bill that we enjoyed in the Lower House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I acknowledge the contribution of Deputy Kelly.  I was very pleased to accept his Bill on behalf of the Government and was very pleased to liaise with him both at my own level but also at the level of officials to ensure we have legislation that is fit for purpose and is compliant with his wishes in consultation with those persons involved in what is a very exciting and innovative industry, namely, craft brewers and craft distilleries.  I also refer to cider and some Irish vineyards, with which we may not be particularly familiar.  Having regard to the fact that the summer of 2018 is the start of new weather patterns in Ireland, the concept of the Irish vineyard may become very much a reality into the future.  I am very keen to ensure that Irish vineyards and their products are included in this small but nevertheless important legislation.</p><p>In deference to observations, amendments and submissions that will be made by Senators over the course of the next while, I am really keen to ensure the passage of this Bill in its entirety between now and the end of term.  We are already halfway through the summer season and are experiencing what is yet another record year in terms of tourism.  The import of this Bill is to facilitate a tourism product that will be memorable on the part of everybody who wishes to experience at first hand the craft beer or craft distillery industry in Ireland.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to dealing with any questions Members may have in the course of its passage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1376" speakername="Lorraine Clifford Lee" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#QQ00500"><p>I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill to the House.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I am happy to support the Bill.  I hope the Minister does have the same cross-party in this House that he enjoyed in the other House.  I acknowledge the input of Deputy Kelly into this Bill.  This is a very well thought-out Bill and it is excellent to see it before the House today.</p> <p>As the Minister noted, the craft microbrewery industry is very innovative and exciting.  It is an exciting emerging market in Ireland and we should do everything in our power to encourage and support it.  There has been an explosion in microbreweries in recent years.  I note there has been a 29% increase in the number of production microbreweries from 48 in 2015 to 62 in 2016.  This figure has quadrupled since 2012.  It is a huge area that has the potential to grow even more.</p> <p>There is potential to develop this industry and this Bill lends support to the industry.  It is a practical step that we can take to encourage the industry and tourism.  Tourism is so important given the context of Brexit.  We need to enhance our tourism product and do more to encourage people to visit not only Dublin, large urban centres and large tourism centres but other areas of the country that have a lot to offer.  Emerging microbreweries in certain areas can do a lot for the local economy and local employment, and it is right and proper that we do everything to encourage that and enhance local employment in the area.  </p> <p>It is worth noting the food and drinks industry, how it has developed over the years in Ireland and how important it is for our economy and tourism sector.  The microbrewery and craft brewery industry does a lot to enhance our international reputation.  It is worth noting that the alcohol product is, by and large, consumed in a very different manner to other alcohol products.  It is consumed by connoisseurs along with food and is not abused in the way other alcohol products have a tendency to be abused, so we should encourage this type of alcohol production and consumption and the promotion of Ireland in this manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.427" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#QQ00600"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We are enjoying a new industry that is growing in Ireland.  Although we realise the need to reduce access to alcohol and alcohol consumption, this Bill is not about promoting consumption.  It is about supporting many craft brewers and distillers.  It sorely needs to be passed and enacted so that we can help small businesses create employment and drive tourism.  I have many friends and their family members in Carlow and Kilkenny who are very grateful for the growth of this industry because the breweries and distillers, which are labour-intensive, create significant employment - certainly in my own constituency.  We have the wonderful Walsh Whiskey Distillery in Royal Oak, County Carlow, and O'Hara's Brewery, while Carlow Institute of Technology even has a unique brewing and distilling course.</p> <p>The brewing and distilling industry in Ireland is growing rapidly and includes a beer sector that employs 2,000 people.  It supports thousands of farming families, direct employment in distilling and will see growth of 30% by 2025 with massive growth in microbreweries, with 100 expected by 2025.  There are plans to invest &euro;1 billion in the whiskey industry and to grow market share by 300%.  A total of 28 distilleries and 62 microbreweries are now operating or are being developed on the island of Ireland.  These small ventures are started by families and friends and they pride themselves on their local product.  They put their heart and soul into this ancient tradition and give good jobs to good families.  They can form the backbone of a tourism boost for areas without sufficient historical monuments or archaeological sites.  According to figures from the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland, turnover at Irish microbreweries rose to &euro;52 million in 2016 from &euro;8 million in 2012.  This is a growing industry.  Brewing is an ancient tradition in Ireland and is something we can and should show off to our visitors.  While the concept of a tour of the brewery, which also creates employment for tour guides, is all-important, I firmly believe in the need to allow people to buy on the premises and to take home a sample of a high-quality locally produced item.  Let them take home a taste of Carlow and they will know why I am always singing about it.  </p></speech>

It is a perfectly reasonable, necessary and intelligent piece of legislation that I strongly support.</p> <p>I have two queries for the Minister.  Perhaps my passing acquaintance with the law relating to intoxicating liquor explains why I am asking this question.  Does section 1(6) restrict sale to persons over the age of 18 or is that provided for somewhere else in the Intoxicating Liquor Acts that is not referenced in the Bill?  It states that notwithstanding anything contained in the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018, alcohol can effectively be sold to persons who have completed a guided tour on the premises or to persons who have completed a tour where the sale is an off sale?  Does it definitely exclude the sale to people under the age of 18?  I just wanted clarity on that because if it does not, the Minister could put in a definition of "person" to mean a person over the age of 18.</p> <p>I was not a great fan of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which was recently passed by this House.  I think it is excessive in many respects and has now gone to the D&aacute;il.  Are the terms of this Bill now before the House such as to require an amendment to the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill?  The latter Bill included all sorts of restrictions about places near schools, advertising and the like and I want to make sure we are not pursuing two different legislative aims at the same time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I assure the Minister that if there is any conflict between this legislation and the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill I would be in favour of this Bill passing and the latter Bill being amended to accommodate it.  I have no further comments.  </p></speech>

I have seen the impact small breweries have on employment and expansion.  I have worked closely with a small brewery in Limerick, Treaty City Brewery, on a number of issues recently.  It has been granted a licence to expand its business into the historical part of Limerick, only a stone's throw from St. John's Castle.  I have seen the impact the licence has had on the development of the brewery's business.  The brewery has developed different types of beers and provided employment not only to members of the family who own it but to other people as well.</p> <p>Craft breweries have had a positive impact on tourism.  In Limerick, for example, the Treaty City Brewery is a tourist attraction, which offers visitors an opportunity to taste a variety of beers.  Breweries have done a great deal of work employing chemists to develop the variety of beers on offer.  Beer is an acquired taste.  The development of breweries is very positive overall.</p> <p>The Intoxicating Liquor Act refers to people who are over 18 years and I am sure the people visiting these breweries will be over 18 years of age.  Breweries are a very positive tourism attraction.  It is also positive that many local pubs sell the beers produced by small local breweries.  Larger breweries and drinks companies have operated here for many years.  I highly commend small breweries on expanding and developing a variety of beers.  I wish the Bill a safe passage.     </p></speech>

I acknowledge also that the Deputy's Bill is a recognition of a unique and growing sector of entrepreneurs in Ireland, namely, the microbreweries, distilleries and cider makers of Ireland. </p> <p>I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality on developing the Bill further, bringing it through the D&aacute;il and introducing it to this House.  I thank the Leader of the Seanad, Senators from all parties and Independent Senators for supporting the passage of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess.  Enactment of the legislation will prove beneficial to the businesses in question and will encourage the creation of tourism jobs over the summer period, which is the right thing to do.</p> <p>Heretofore, it was impossible for entrepreneurs and microbreweries to sell their product on site.  People visiting these premises to see how beer, cider and other products were produced were puzzled that they could not purchase anything.  The measures we are taking in this legislation will cater for the tourism sector.  As Senator Clifford-Lee stated, Ireland has a strong reputation for great food, beverages and food festivals.  I invite the Minister, Deputy Kelly and their friends to visit West Waterford Festival of Food to experience the wonderful foods available in County Waterford, including the excellent craft beers produced by the well known Dungarvan Brewing Company and Metalman Brewing Company in County Waterford.</p> <p>I support the Bill.  As I stated, it is common-sense legislation which recognises a gap that exists.  It also recognises that our unique brewers and distilleries that produce craft beers and ciders require the support of the State.  It is a reasonable Bill which will allow them to trade and do what they do best, namely, produce quality products that taste good, thus encouraging tourism and visitors.</p> <p>As previous speakers noted, the legislation will encourage the responsible consumption of alcohol.  I encourage people not to overindulge but to enjoy the taste of these products and appreciate the unique products that are produced in many localities around Ireland.</p> <p>I commend Deputy Kelly and the Minister for Justice and Equality and offer the full support of the Fine Gael side of the House.

I, too, welcome Deputy Alan Kelly and his colleagues to the Gallery and those who have an interest in the Bill.  I welcome this important Bill which was initiated and sponsored by my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Kelly, in the D&aacute;il.  The Bill passed through the D&aacute;il in the past week having been initiated in the other House last year, with cross-party support.  I also acknowledge the support expressed both in this House and in the D&aacute;il by the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p> <p>As Deputy Kelly said in the D&aacute;il, this is a small but important Bill.  He acknowledged that the White Gypsy Brewery in Templemore initiated the idea that inspired the legislation.  He spoke of the story Mr. Cuilan Loughnane, the owner of the White Gypsy Brewery, told him about a number of visitors to his brewery from the US who could not believe they were unable to purchase beer from him on the premises.  This is a common-sense Bill that seeks to address the anomaly whereby people who take tours of distilleries, breweries and vineyards are unable to purchase products on site.  Clearly, this is an anomaly in the licensing legislation, which it is important to address because, as the Minister said, microbreweries and distilleries are a dynamic and growing area of tourism in Ireland.  It is also a labour intensive area.  We know from the 2016 production levels that microbreweries alone employed 439 persons of full-time equivalent status.  Other Senators spoke about the phenomenal growth in new enterprises.  As many as 33 of the 62 production microbreweries commenced production in the 2014 to 2015 period alone.  The need to encourage growth in this sector is recognised by all the arms of the State.  In that regard, I note F&aacute;ilte Ireland sponsored and assisted the launch of the Bill in 2017 in recognition of the potential growth in tourism.</p> <p>I recently had occasion to visit both the Jameson distilleries in Dublin and Midleton.  I was very impressed by both of them and struck by the number of people who visited both premises.  I also noted the enormous goodwill they generate locally.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is also an issue of equity here to which the Minister alluded in his speech.  Some of the larger breweries and distilleries have already obtained public house licences in order to ensure that they can sell alcohol products to visitors, including those they produce on their premises.  However, there is an issue of equity because that might not be an option for smaller craft breweries, in particular microbreweries and smaller distillers, because of the cost of extinguishing an existing public house licence.  In my area of Dublin we have the Teeling Distillery in Newmarket Square which has regenerated an area that lacked investment for some time so this is the sort of initiative we want to encourage.<br/><br/>As chairperson of the Vot&aacute;il 100 committee I was delighted to see my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, speaking in the D&aacute;il in support of this Bill and noting that a number of prominent distillers are women, including the craft distillery in Midleton.  She also noted that it is increasingly the case with craft beer that more women are getting involved as entrepreneurs.  I am indebted to Ursula Ni Choill in my office for pointing out to me a recent profile in <i>Image</i>magazine of five Irish women brewing craft beer that was published in February 2018.  The article noted that Irish women are now at the forefront of craft beer brewing and are breaking all number of glass ceilings to earn their place in the fast moving beverage industry in Ireland.  They referred to Metalman Brewery in Waterford, to which Senator Coffey referred, but also to Two Sisters Brewing, Rascals Brewing Company in Donegal, West Kerry Brewery in Kerry and N17 Craft Beers in Galway.  In all corners of the country we are seeing not only a growth in craft beer brewing but also in the number of women entrepreneurs.<i>Beoir</i>magazine in 2014 pointed out that the tradition of women brewing is a long one in Ireland.  We may think that it is a recent development-----</p></speech>

According to this source it seems that St. Brigid herself had her hand in miraculous brewing.  Given that we have had some strong cultural allusions in the many debates we have had earlier today I thought it would be nice to conclude with an 11th century Irish poem, St. Brigid&rsquo;s Ale Feast.  When asked what her view of heaven was St. Brigid replied:</p><blockquote>I would like to have a great lake of beer for Christ the King<br /><br />I would like to be watching the heavenly family drinking it down through all eternity</blockquote> <p>While Irish vineyards may be a new phenomenon it seems Irish craft brewing is not a new phenomenon and the increase in the number of women involved in the craft brewing industry is not a new phenomenon.</p><p>Joking aside, this is a small but important Bill and it could contribute to the growth of a dynamic and fast growing sector in the economy.  It would also contribute to an increase in tourism.  It is something all Members on both sides of the House can support.  It is about responsible consumption of alcohol.  I am sure the Minister will respond to Senator McDowell's important point about persons who are over 18 because this is about responsible consumption and that is something that needs to be stressed.  When we see people having a small glass of Guinness in the Guinness Storehouse, which is also near where I live in central Dublin and we see the phenomenal number of visitors to that store; it is not about drinking large quantities of alcohol, it is about the experience of seeing the way in which Guinness is produced and being able to consume a small amount of alcohol as part of that experience.  That is also a very important point to make in support of this important Bill.</p></speech>

I think he is enjoying his visit to the Seanad this time more than on previous occasions in recent days.  I will certainly not upset his merriment.</p> <p>As Senator Bacik said, it is about the responsible drinking of alcohol.  In many ways moderate consumption of alcohol is good.  The Bill was introduced by Deputy Alan Kelly and the Minister has helped it to get through both Houses.  What I like about the Bill is that it will help to spread tourism around the country.  Craft brewing and distilling allows not only for the development of a sense of place but a sense of taste because each area has a unique element to it.  I remember when former Deputy Ciara Conway was promoting the Waterford blaa and she served it to people.  The uniqueness of different areas is important.  Small microbreweries can develop that uniqueness right across the 32 counties of Ireland.  Senator Bacik gave me a route map for my summer holidays.  I will now be visiting many of those women who brew such good craft beer.</p></speech>

For the remedy thereof, I suggest that we simply say that the term "person" means a person over the age 18 and that could be included in subsection (11) as a definition.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#TT01400"><p>The purpose of this amendment is to address a potential difficulty arising from an amendment carried in respect of section 1(1)(b).  I will briefly refer to the background.  The Bill originally provided for the granting of a retail licence to craft breweries and distilleries that would permit them to sell intoxicating liquor produced on their premises to tourists and visitors who had participated in a guided tour of the premises.  Both on-sales and off-sales would be permitted.  In all cases sales would be restricted to intoxicating liquor produced on the premises and only to those who had participated in a guided tour of the brewery or distillery concerned.  This Bill still provides two application options.  An applicant may apply to the Circuit Court for an on-licence, that is, a licence permitting consumption on the premises, or to the District Court where the applicant has no facilities for consumption on the premises and intends instead to sell only for consumption off the premises.</p> <p>During discussions in committee it was suggested by Deputies that licensees should also be permitted to engage in off-sales to persons other than those who had participated in guided tours of the premises, and an Opposition Report Stage amendment to that effect was carried.  My concern and the concern of the Government was such that a widening of the Bill's scope would create a new form of off-licence that could lead to abuses and could also lead to potentially unfair competition from other off-licences such as the specialist off-licence sector.</p> <p>The Opposition amendment inserted the words "for consumption on the premises" in section 1(1)(b).  The intention was to restrict the guided tour requirement and not apply it in the case of off-sales to those who had not participated in a guided tour of the premises.  While the revised wording appeared to achieve the desired objective, dropping the guided tour requirement in the case of off-sales, the Attorney General's office has identified a potential difficulty arising from the revised text of subsection(1)(b).  A literal interpretation of the revised text suggests that a craft brewery or distillery intending to apply for an off-licence, which may be obtained from the District Court, must nonetheless satisfy the court that a mechanism is in place that permits sales for consumption on the premises only to those who have completed the guided tour of the premises.  Clearly, that was not the intention of those who proposed the amendment since it would create an insuperable obstacle to applications for an off-licence.</p> <p>The Attorney General's office has advised that the words "for consumption on the premises" be removed from subsection (1)(b), and that is the purpose of this amendment.  I am assured that the removal of these words will in no way restrict the possibility of off-sales to those who have not participated in a guided tour of the premises because subsection (6)(b) now makes specific provision for such off-sales.</p> <p>I assure the Senators that my purpose in tabling this amendment is not to frustrate in any way the objective of the Opposition amendment to permit off-sales to those who have not participated in a guided tour but rather to remove a potential obstacle to the operation of the licensing mechanism.  In this regard, I commend the amendment to the House.</p></speech>

As was acknowledged by the Minister, I commend Deputy Kelly on his stewardship of the Bill.  As the Leader of this House, I advise it is important to get this legislation passed and enacted as quickly as possible.  It will benefit local economies, support local entrepreneurs who provide employment, create an alternative to conglomerates, and ensure that Irish craft beer is able to be produced, marketed and sold.  As the Minister eloquently pointed out, it testifies to the growing diversity in our country, and I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

This will permit off-sales to those who have not participated in a guided tour of the premises between the hours of 10. a.m. and 7 p.m. on every day of the year except Christmas Day.  This is in conflict with the licensing hours applicable to all other off-licences.  Under current licensing law, public houses and off-licences are not permitted to sell intoxicating liquor before 12.30 p.m. on Sundays or St. Patrick's Day.</p> <p>The Attorney General's office has advised that allowing craft breweries and distilleries to engage in off-sales to those who have not participated in a guided tour of the premises before 12.30 p.m. on Sundays and St. Patrick's Day under this legislation would give rise to an anomaly.  It would create a risk of legal challenge on the basis that it seems to favour craft breweries and distilleries over other categories of off-licences.  For this reason, I have tabled an amendment to section 1(6).  To prohibit off-sales in the absence of a guided tour before 12.30 p.m. on Sundays and St. Patrick's Day, off-sales to those who have participated in a guided tour of the premises will continue to be permitted from 10 a.m.</p></speech>

It provides as follows:</p><blockquote>(1) The Commission shall hold such and so many meetings as may be necessary for the due performance of its functions.<br /><br />(2) The chairperson shall fix the date, time and place of the first meeting of the Commission which shall be a date no later than 3 months from the establishment day.</blockquote> <p>I find it difficult to understand why such a time limit has been put in.  It is extraordinary that the chairperson would not convene a meeting less than three months after the establishment day.  It goes on:</p><blockquote>(3) At a meeting of the Commission&mdash;<br /><br />(a) the chairperson shall, if present, be the chairperson of the meeting, or<br /><br />(b) if and so long as the chairperson is not present or if that office is vacant, the other members of the Commission, as the case may be, [which includes the judicial and legal members] who are present shall choose another one of its lay members to be chairperson of the meeting.</blockquote> <p>It is extraordinary that a majority of people, who may be lawyers, are obliged to choose which of the lay people they want to be the chair of the meeting.  The people who are there in the absence of the chairperson cannot choose anybody else to be the chairperson of the meeting.  The significance of the chairperson being a lay person is emphasised by subsection (6), which states:</p><blockquote>(6) Where there is no consensus on a question at a meeting of the Commission, the question shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the members of the Commission present and voting on the question, and, in the case of an equal division of votes, the chairperson shall have a second or casting vote.</blockquote> <p>The curious thing about this provision is that it means the lay persons would, theoretically, have a majority, even where there is an equality of lay and non-lay people present.  It makes one wonder why a red-line issue was put in place about a majority of lay people being on the commission.  This provision gives a lay majority via the second, or casting, vote of the chairperson.  The song and dance about the necessity of having a lay majority on the commission is undermined by this provision.  If the Bill had been drafted to give an equality of numbers as between lay and non-lay members, the lay people would have an effective majority by virtue of having a lay chairman.  I wonder why we went to all the bother about a lay majority when there was always to be an effective majority, in the event of a division of opinion, in favour of the lay members present.</p><p>It is not to be assumed for one minute that the lay members will be a cohesive group or that the lawyers and judges present will be cohesive and of one mind on any issue.  It is fanciful to believe there will be a bloc on one side or another on the issues that arise.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is much more likely that the commission will operate on the basis of an <i>ad hoc</i>expression of views on each subject, regardless of whether a person was a lawyer or judge or a lay person selected in the manner provided for in the Bill, whatever that ends up being.  It is unlikely, if they were just dealing with the merits or demerits of an individual, that there would be unanimity on either side in terms of a block of lay persons and another of legal people.  When one imagines that the lawyers are effectively confined, in every situation as far as the Bill can have its way, to being a permanent minority no matter what way the issue goes, unless the lay persons divide among themselves - considering that this is the apparent aim of the Bill, it does occur to me that the one occasion on which all the lawyers decide to oppose something will be when the lay persons are going to do something very foolish indeed.</p></speech>

A message has been received from the D&aacute;il concerning amendments made by the Seanad to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016.  The message has been set down on the Order Paper.  The list of amendments made by the Seanad and considered by the D&aacute;il has been circulated for the information of Members.  The D&aacute;il has not agreed to amendment Nos. 41 and 42 and desires that Seanad &Eacute;ireann should not insist thereon.  Senators may move, in respect of the original amendment Nos. 41 and 42, either "That the Seanad do not insist on the amendments" or "That the Seanad do insist on the amendments".  Senators may speak once only, except the proposer of the motion who has the right of reply.  Any Senator who wishes to move either of the permissible motions may do so now.</p></speech>

We outlined the case in this regard quite strongly here on the day, and last week in the D&aacute;il we went over the need not to have this amendment and over how it would affect the Bill if adopted.  The Bill as drafted already provides that any draft of a revised or new framework must be submitted for the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas rather than a vote.  This is a sufficient and indeed appropriate provision in this regard.  It is also important to be clear here that the introduction of this amendment would not apply retrospectively to the current framework which has already been adopted and published by the Government for the purposes of section 2 of the Planning and Development Act.  The current framework is on a statutory footing afforded by the provisions of existing legislation and would not have been impacted by the introduction of this amendment.</p> <p>There was a further issue of concern with the proposed amendment.  Introducing it would have placed new and onerous statutory obligations on the Oireachtas relating to complying with European environmental law.  This is because the amendment would have had the effect of making D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann the designated competent authority for the purposes of considering and approving the environmental report under the strategic environmental assessment directive and appropriate assessment under the habitats directive.  We did speak on that on the day.  I went through it in detail and asked Members to understand that they could consult with the Department if they wanted to get a bit more information.  I am conscious that quite a few Members did do that and they got some advice and direction in that regard.  It would be quite a serious thing if the D&aacute;il also became the responsible authority for those matters.  It is not as straightforward as having a final vote.  Members might reflect on that.</p> <p>The amendments also propose that the framework be subject to an annual review.  As a long-term strategy the national planning framework is not readily amenable to annual review.  This Bill already provides that the national planning framework will be reviewed every six years, which is a more meaningful timeline, particularly for data gathering and analysis of outcomes.  Another aspect of these amendments was based on a misunderstanding of the legislative meaning of an appropriate assessment report, which is wholly separate from the public spending code.  Consequently to have linked the two in legislation, as was proposed, based on an entirely erroneous assumption would have been a serious mistake.  Again I ask Members to accept the decision of the D&aacute;il on these amendments.</p></speech>

I am particularly disappointed that Fianna F&aacute;il Members of this House had supported the amendments and yet Fianna F&aacute;il abstained on the same vote in the D&aacute;il, making it inevitable that those amendments would fall.  Without rehearsing the previous debates, when the planning framework was launched in February Sinn F&eacute;in began raising questions about the validity of the plan without a vote in the Oireachtas.  Other parties articulated their concerns at the time.  Deputy Barry Cowen said, "Fianna F&aacute;il has put down a number of amendments in the Seanad to strengthen the role of the Oireachtas in overseeing the National Planning Framework."  We can discuss the era of new politics all we want but when we are faced with the notion that processes should be outward-looking, open and transparent it seems the powers that be consistently buckle.</p> <p>We have had this conversation before.  The planning framework is a huge undertaking of State capital and taxpayers' money.  These processes should not go unvouched and unchecked by these Houses.  It demeans the work of Deputies and Senators.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy English, has in debates on these amendments committed to constant interaction with Members on regional and county plans.  However, this should be open to public discourse and scrutiny rather than interaction in the privacy of Government Buildings.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> While I am frustrated about the important amendments that have been dealt a blow in the D&aacute;il, I accept the decision.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#BBB00200"><p>I, too, am disappointed that a vote will not be taken in both Houses.  The Minister of State referred to the Attorney General's legal advice about the statutory footing.  It is important that people understand this.  I am of the firm belief that the national planning framework will have a significant impact on people's lives in the form of their local authorities, work and so on.  As such, it is crucial that we review it every six years.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for listening to me.  Like other Senators, I was on a council for years.  Be it a local authority development plan or a national plan, a planning framework can be major for a constituency, Ireland or everyone in general.  The impact can be crucial.</p> <p>I am disappointed, but we must accept the Attorney General's advice about the statutory footing.  It is important that everyone, including Senators, submit recommendations when our national planning framework is reviewed.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  It is clear from what he said that upholding the Seanad amendments would only have delayed the Bill's enactment by three months.  That is not necessary and would not have had the material effect that some Senators within the Chamber want.  I must put it on the record that Fianna F&aacute;il Senators in particular have been in contravention of their party's position in the D&aacute;il.  That is their right.  Senator Murnane O'Connor asked the Minister of State to listen, but it is a great pity that she did not listen to him.  In our previous debate, he outlined clearly the advice of the Attorney General and that this would be critical if the Bill was to proceed and establish the office of the planning regulator, which most parties want.  It is also critical that we put the national planning framework on a statutory footing if we are to give it the teeth we want it to have throughout our regions, local authority areas and local communities.  What is set out in the national planning framework will have a positive impact on the country.</p> <p>I will say no more.  It is unfortunate that the Minister of State had to revert to the House and clarify the situation and that the D&aacute;il had to rectify matters.  I support the Minister of State's position.</p></speech>

Since the framework's launch, we have had a discussion about the importance of planning and being able to prepare for the future.  During an Order of Business last week, Senator Davitt spoke about going on a mystical tour of Ireland.  I would love to take him on a real tour and show him the import and future consequences of the national planning framework.</p> <p>I will not personalise my next remark in any shape or form but, as Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said, we must be a listening House.  That means the Government side listening to other Members, which we do, and Members listening to the advice of the Attorney General or Ministers.  It is also about ensuring that we deliver greater transparency, efficiency and integrity in the planning system.</p> <p>If the Acting Chairman will indulge me for a minute, my next remark will be made in the context of the need for a planning regulator.  I am disappointed by the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to award a waste incineration licence to Indaver at Ringaskiddy.  It is regrettable, not least because the oral hearing, which was held in a transparent manner, demonstrated to me and many others like me that there was no compelling case for the awarding of the licence.  There has been much political commentary on the matter.</p> <p>We must ensure that there is accountability in planning.  We have touched on various tribunal reports that dealt with planning matters.  It is probably not popular to say it, but we as elected Members need some type of engagement with planners.  I am talking about having a role in, rather than influence over, the planning process.  Sometimes, decisions are made purely by the book, that is, the learned opinion is A, B and C whereas the lived reality is different.  I am confident that the national planning framework will deliver for people in a multiplicity of communities across the country.  For example, Cork city will become a real rival to Dublin in light of the former's growth projections.  I welcome that the city will have an increased footprint.  This is why there is a need to make provision for what is contained within the national planning framework.  This is about Ireland in 2040.</p> <p>As I was walking down the marina last Sunday, I looked across the river at the Port of Cork and could not help thinking about its potential for growth.  On yesterday's Order of Business, Senator Humphreys referenced the Irish Glass Bottle Company site.  Similarly, we in Cork have an opportunity to grow and develop our city, increase its population and make it a city of scale that will attract further investment.  This is why the framework is important.  I commend the Minister of State, who gets what this is about in terms of housing delivery and holding local authorities to account.</p> <p>Despite our back-and-forth discussions at times, I understand where Senator Murnane O'Connor is coming from on this.  We need accountability and to see deliverables.  We have not forgotten the Fianna F&aacute;il Government's national spatial plan with its hub towns that never existed and buildings that are now empty because of bad decision making.</p> <p>Senator Humphreys and I have discussed housing many times.  He is right about Airbnb, but the ghost estates are nearly all gone.  Seven years ago, our country was awash with them.</p></speech>

He was right on many matters, for example, density and balanced regional growth.  We want to deliver sustainable communities, not just in Dublin, but also in Cork, Galway, Carlow, Kilkenny and many other places.  There is significant potential in areas like unused docklands.  The structures of the strategic development zones present an opportunity to pursue that in a planned way.  However, there must also be quality and sustainable communities.</p> <p>When the Bill was before the Seanad previously, I voiced a concern when the Minister of State tabled an amendment on shared living spaces.  I will flag it again now.  One of the major flaws in the Bill is the amendment on what I call "student living for adults".  I have checked our previous debate.  The Minister of State said that the market would decide.  Unfortunately, my discussions since then with real estate investment trusts, REITs, and people working in the business have shown that shared living is what will be offered to young people who are leaving college or going into work.</p></speech>
