    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1416" speakername="Martin Conway" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#A00400"><p>I apologise for being slightly late.  I have come directly from a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality.   I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to the House.</p> <p>I raise this Commencement matter because there is an inequity in the system.  Pay restoration is a fundamental principle across society, whether in the private or public sector.  Many members of the public took a hit from 2008 or 2009 until 2014 or 2015 and their pay is now gradually being restored.  There have been numerous examples of pay restoration, in particular across the public sector.  It is likely that full pay restoration will be achieved in the next budget or the one thereafter.</p> <p>However, in budget 2012 the pension guidelines, entitlements, structures and so on  were changed for a group of pensioners who, prior to 2012, had a legitimate expectation to a specific level of pension entitlement when they retired.  Under the new guidelines, many of those born in 1948 lost benefits to which they would have been entitled had they been born a couple of years later.  A specific number of people have been affected by the changes.</p> <p>The entire cost of reverting to the pre-budget 2012 guidelines would be approximately &euro;270 million.  An inequity has been created by the changes.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, should consider reverting to the pre-budget 2012 guidelines.  Doing so would not open a floodgate but, rather, help a specific number of people at a cost of &euro;270 million.  I do not ask for the entitlements to be backdated but, rather, that the former level of benefit now be restored.  If that cannot be done immediately, I ask that a timeline for such be put in place.</p> <p>The Department is fully aware of the circumstances of the issue because a constituent of mine has gone to the trouble of researching the matter, putting the figures together and making a case to the Department.  Parliamentary questions on the matter have been tabled by Deputies.  The case put forward by my constituent is fair and well articulated.  This is a question of equity and fairness.  I sincerely hope the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, will right the wrong done to these people, who have paid their taxes, served their country well and done their duty, or at least give a timeframe for that to be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#A00500"><p>I thank Senator Conway for giving me the opportunity to address this issue on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty.  The current rate bands applying to the State pension were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000, and more accurately reflect the social insurance contribution history of a person.  A reversal of the rate bands for post-2012 pensioners to the 2000-2012 rate band percentages would carry an estimated cost of &euro;73 million in 2018, including inflows from other payments such as the non-contributory State pension and increases for qualified adults, and rise at a rate of &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million per annum.  That would mean an extra cost of approximately &euro;85 million in 2019 and &euro;97 million in 2020.</p> <p>Better-off pensioners who do not qualify for means-tested pension payments and did not make sufficient contributions to the Social Insurance Fund to qualify for a full-rate contributory pension would be the main beneficiaries of a reversal of the changes.  Prior to the introduction of the current rate bands, a person with an average of 20 pay-related social insurance, PRSI, contributions per year over his or her working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 to 52 contributions.</p> <p>The Government does not propose the reversal of the rate band changes.  Rather, it intends to introduce a total contributions approach to establish the level of entitlement for all new contributory State pension claims form 2020 onwards.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is currently the subject of a public consultation which stays open until 3 September and is available on the Department's website.  The total contribution approach, TCA, will ensure that the totality of a person's social insurance contributions, as opposed to the timing of them, will determine their final pension outcome.  In particular, it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace while raising families or in a full-time caring role.</p><p>The roadmap for pensions reform 2018-2023 sets out how it is intended to implement the TCA to calculating entitlement to the contributory State pension.  In the interim, on 23 January, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection announced the agreement of the Government to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated under a total contributions approach which will include up to 20 years of a new home caring credit.  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes, who are currently assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the contributory State pension.  A person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new home caring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where he or she satisfies the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to ten years of other credits, for example, awarded when on jobseeker's or illness benefit, may also be used, subject to the total credits not exceeding 20 years.  People whose entitlements were assessed after the September 2012 rate changes will have the option to be reassessed under a TCA option and be paid whichever is the more beneficial amount.</p><p>Work is under way to draft legislation to enable implementation of these arrangements.  In parallel with bringing in the legislative changes, information technology, IT, system solutions are being developed to implement the changes.  In the final quarter of this year, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will begin inviting relevant recipients of the contributory State pension to seek a review of their pension calculations with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019, backdated to 30 March 2018.  </p></speech>

I will advise my client to feed into the review.  It is an issue the House will address again in September because there is an inequity in this area.  Perhaps we will need to do more research to be able to articulate the inequity a little more.  I encourage everybody following proceedings who has an interest in this issue to feed into the review because it is important.  The more people participate in the review and engage with the process, the better and more reflective of society the outcomes will be.  I encourage people to participate.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to address this issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1396" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#B00400"><p>I welcome the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, to the House and thank him for taking time out of his busy schedule to be here.  It is much appreciated.</p> <p>I would like to discuss the North-South interconnector.  It goes without saying that An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision in 2016 regarding the North-South interconnector was met with a tsunami of disappointment, anger and frustration by the people affected.  If EirGrid thought that was the end of the matter and people would take this decision lying down, it was very much mistaken.  Two years on, the determination of the people affected is as strong as it has ever been.  I have attended a number of meetings throughout the Cavan-Monaghan area and have witnessed at first hand that resolve.</p> <p>Those affected received a shot in the arm by recent court decisions on both sides of the Border, one in Northern Ireland and a second in the Supreme Court.  The High Court in Northern Ireland ruled that planning permission granted for a &pound;240 million waste incinerator had been unlawfully authorised.  Planning permission for the facility had been approved by a civil servant in the Department for Infrastructure in 2017.  This landmark ruling would have a wide-ranging effect on the North-South Interconnector as it too was signed off on by a civil servant and not a Government Minister.  At this point, I am sure the Minister will agree that all of us would like to the institutions in Northern Ireland back up and running for the benefit of all.  I appeal to Sinn F&eacute;in and the Democratic Unionist Party to lead those who elected them to lead.  The other shot in the arm was the Supreme Court's decision in favour of a Meath lady by the name of Maura Sheehy, a landowner affected by the proposed line.  The court agreed to hear the case put forward by the North East Pylon Pressure Campaign.  I understand the case is due to be heard at the end of this month.  </p> <p>In 2017, the Minister signed off on a procurement process for the installation of 409 pylons both North and South of the Border.  At the time, we felt the Minister's decision was probably premature, to put it mildly, but I recall that he stated in his defence that it could be rescinded at any time.  Given the decision by the courts, the fact that planning permission no longer exists for the facility in Northern Ireland and the Supreme Court case on the proposal in the South, the time is now ripe for the Minister to rescind his decision and ask EirGrid to withdraw from the tender process for these pylons.  It would be a sensible thing to do and a good gesture on the Minister's part.  </p> <p>As the Minister is aware, the residents along the route, including in counties Monaghan and Cavan, remain resolutely opposed to the proposal.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas have passed motions which seem to have fallen on deaf ears.  Coupled with everything else that has happened over the years, this has only served to strengthen the will of the people that if this project is to go ahead, it must be undergrounded.  Here we are ten years down the road and much has happened and many changes have occurred in that period.  Technology moves on.  I recall that when this project was introduced, we were told it would be 30 times more expensive to underground than to overground it.  Most people on all sides now agree that undergrounding would not cost much more than overgrounding.  At the time, EirGrid told us that from an engineering perspective, it was not possible to underground the interconnector.  By its own admission, a few years on, the company now says it is possible to underground it.  We have seen examples of projects similar to this in Belgium and Germany that have been undergrounded.  </p> <p>It is ten years on and things have changed but the one thing that has not changed and is as strong today as at any time in the past is the will of the people to ensure this project does not go ahead.  From meetings I have attended and people I have spoken to, I assure the Minister that as far as the people and landowners along the route are concerned, not one single pylon will ever see the light of day.  That is the message I am getting loud and clear and it is the message I would like to give to the Minister.</p> <p>I congratulate the action groups in Monaghan, Meath and Cavan for their continued work.  I hail the resolve of the people who are as determined today as they have ever been.  I ask the Minister to instruct EirGrid to withdraw from the tender process to see where this is going because we are in a legal limbo at the moment and God knows how long it will be before we are out of it.  Question marks hang over the independent report that was promised.  We seek the report's publication.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#B00500"><p>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this issue.  The North-South interconnector is vital infrastructure in delivering the objectives of Ireland's energy policy, namely, ensuring competitiveness and security of supply.  It will also ensure a safe and sustainable source of energy for the jurisdictions of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The interconnector, as proposed as an overhead line, was granted planning permission in Ireland in December 2016.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Denis Naughten:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Following a planning process in Northern Ireland, the section of the project in that jurisdiction was also granted planning permission in January 2018.  The construction of the project and all related procurement activities are operational matters for EirGrid and ESB Networks in respect of which I have no function.  The 2012 Government policy statement on the strategic importance of transmission and other energy infrastructure states that "Government does not seek to direct EirGrid and ESB Networks or other energy infrastructure developers to particular sites or routes or technologies".  However, I respect fully that this project gives rise to concerns for a number of people, particularly those living in close proximity to the proposed project.  In fact, I was the first Minister in a decade to meet with the groups and listen directly to their concerns.</p><p>Following the planning decision in Ireland, two motions calling for an updated independent study into the North-South interconnector were passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and this House in early 2017.  I subsequently commissioned two studies designed to address the main points of the motions as well as key concerns expressed by those opposed to the development of an overhead line.  Some impacts such as environmental and health concerns will not be assessed since the statutory planning process is the appropriate method by which such impacts are assessed and evaluated.  The consultants undertaking the two studies have completed their respective reports and they were submitted to my Department earlier this year.  They have now been fully considered by my Department and submitted to me.  It is my intention that the reports will be brought to Government as soon as possible and made publicly available on my Department's website.</p><p>There are a number of ongoing legal issues in Northern Ireland which are ultimately matters for the authorities there.  The judgment of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland on 6 July relates to a different project, although it has been acknowledged that it could have wider implications for decision-making in Northern Ireland, not just in relation to infrastructure but to the operation of government and decision-making generally.  It is to be expected that the judgment will be studied over the coming weeks by authorities on both sides of the Border as to any implications for the North-South interconnector project.</p><p>To answer Senator Gallagher's question, I made it clear when I signed off on the procurement process that this could be paused or stopped at various stages in the process.  I gave that commitment to the D&aacute;il, definitely, and I may have given it here as well.  I stand over that.  It was the only basis on which I allowed the process to commence.  I am monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

There is a certain element of frustration in relation to the non-publication of the reports.  I wonder if the Minister has an actual date for publication or whether he can provide a timeframe within which we can expect publication to occur.  On the tendering process, the ordinary man or woman in the street will be of the view that if one is undertaking a major infrastructure project such as the one under discussion, one would not send out a tender document looking for people to price the construction of it until one was sure one had planning permission.  That is how one would approach a shopping centre project, for example.  This is because, with the passage of time, material prices may go up or down and one cannot be sure one is getting value for money.  With respect, the Minister is a sensible individual and the sensible thing to do here is withdraw the tender process until we see what the road ahead looks like.  At the moment, we cannot say how long that road will be or how long we will be in abeyance on both sides of the Border from a legal perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#C00300"><p>This tender process is not just for the construction or potential construction of the route.  As such, one cannot compare it to a shopping centre.  To go ahead with the development of a shopping centre, one needs to know where the doors of each unit and the exits will be and what the overall design is.  This process involves the design of transmission masts as well as the detailed design work.  This is in order to meet the set timelines.  As the Senator knows, there is a huge issue with electricity supply in Northern Ireland.  In fairness, it is on both sides of the Border.  All parties involved accept and acknowledge that there will be a severe shortage of electricity post the early 2020s in Northern Ireland which is an issue that must be addressed from an economic development point of view.  There are many other aspects to it.  The courts process in Ireland and Northern Ireland is not a matter in which I can get involved except to note that there are issues here and in the other jurisdiction which we are monitoring closely.  I am constantly engaged through my officials in relation to various aspects of this.</p></speech>

My D&aacute;il colleagues, Deputies Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh and Pat Buckley, raised the matter as a Topical Issue last night and I hope the Minister of State is not going to read out what was read out to them.  We need to move on and work to get this vital service restored for our young children and adolescents.  The Minister of State knows about Linn Dara.  Last year, half of the beds in the inpatient unit were closed down and on Friday that happened to the day programme servicing the inpatient unit and outpatients to keep people at home to be treated in the community as per A Vision for Change.  In 2006, it was announced that there would be 15 of these units opened across the country.  We had three and are now down to two.  We cannot stand over that.  We cannot stand over the chipping away, brick-by-brick, at child and adolescent mental health services.  The Minister of State has been frequently involved with the Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care and he knows about the absolute crisis in services for children.  Many services are not being provided.</p> <p>The Minister of State should not listen to the management of the HSE, he should listen to me and those people who are on the ground regarding their experience of how this service was shut down.  On 11 June, the consultant was told by the director of services of concerns regarding staffing in CAMHS at the Linn Dara day programme.  The possibility arose because the supporting CAMHS in Clondalkin was in dire straits.  The consultant was willing to support the services in Clondalkin and formulated a solution with staff to provide 50% of capacity to Clondalkin with 50% remaining in the afternoon.  It was half and half.  Staff would go to Clondalkin in the morning and return to Linn Dara to carry out the assessments, appointments and therapies in the diary to provide long-awaited services to adolescents and children.  As such, two members of staff went to Clondalkin and nothing else happened between 11 June and 27 June.  On 27 June, an email was circulated by senior management instructing and advising of the closure of the day hospital programme on 6 July, which was last Friday.  The senior manager went on to say the service should not inform any of the families directly about the closure and should continue to make appointments at 3.55 p.m. on Friday for children who have been on those waiting lists for a long time.  This order not to inform families was the entire concern of management.  They refused to communicate directly with the families or the staff.  They said they would not issue letters to cancel appointments because they did not want them to end up on the Joe Duffy show.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The closure was kept quiet.  Last Monday the team members were instructed to commence working in their new posts, but, again, they were not consulted.  The closure has caused massive distress and led to significant consequences for the adults involved and their families.  All of the adults were discharged prematurely from the day programme last Friday, 6 July.  In the space of just one week the families were informed of the closure and that their loved ones would be discharged from the programme.  The unit has ceased operations.  We have been told that it will be reopened in September or October, but that is absolute balderdash, as I know that staff have been told that the issue will be reviewed in November.  That does not mean, however, that the unit will be reopened.  Consultants have been offered the opportunity to return, but the same courtesy has not been shown to any of the team.</p><p>I urge the Minister of State to show leadership.  I want him to tell the HSE that enough is enough, that the people affected have had enough, that everything has changed and that it is the people of the nation and their children who are in dire straits.  I plead with him to show leadership and provide assistance for the people concerned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-07-11a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018071100002#D00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  It is the policy of the HSE, as reflected in its annual service plans, to provide an age appropriate mental health service for those under the age of 18 years.  I reiterate the Government's commitment, in view of the significant additional funding allocated in recent years for the development of all aspects of the mental health service, including services for young people.  I will continue to make the case for the allocation of further resources annually in line with evolving demands and in accordance with the commitments given in A Programme for a Partnership Government.</p> <p>The HSE service plan 2018 commits to further developing the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  This is against a background where the demand for access to CAMHS increased by 26% between 2012 and 2017 and where various youth mental health initiatives, other than the specialist CAMHS service, are also being progressed.</p> <p>We have 69 CAMHS teams and three paediatric liaison teams that are supported by around 75 CAMHS beds nationally.  Further beds are planned to come onstream as quickly as possible.  In addition, the Government has agreed to fund an extra 140 psychiatric nurse undergraduate places each year to help to improve the planning and delivery of services in the next few years.</p> <p>A key difficulty being addressed on a steady basis by the HSE is staff recruitment and retention, particularly in the sphere of CAMHS.  The recent appointment by the executive of 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists will help to develop counselling services in primary care.  It is anticipated that these posts will deal with the less complex child and adolescent cases and thereby reduce the demand on CAMHS.  In addition, I recently approved ten new posts of advanced nurse practitioners, ANPs, that will be specifically directed at the CAMHS service nationally.  The new ANPs will play a key role in delivering better service co-ordination where local service pressures are greatest.</p> <p>The HSE Linn Dara CAMHS service covers a region comprising County Kildare, west Wicklow and south west Dublin and reflects a total population of around 420,000.  There are seven multi-disciplinary community CAMHS teams for these areas.  The HSE has indicated that a decision was taken by the Linn Dara management team to temporarily suspend its day programme from Friday, 6 July.  This was to maintain essential community and inpatient services.  It is expected that the day programme will reopen in September or October.  The decision was taken owing to psychiatry and allied health professional temporary staffing shortages within the community sectors.  To maintain essential provision of services, psychiatry and multi-disciplinary staff have been reassigned from the adolescent day programme to maintain other key community-based Linn Dara services and manage their overall capacity at this time.  The small number of young people who were scheduled to attend the adolescent day programme will continue to attend their existing community CAMHS teams and receive appropriate individual and therapeutic programmes.</p> <p>The HSE has a statutory responsibility to ensure safe, adequate and sufficient service provision in all areas of the CAMHS service.  The Linn Dara inpatient unit will remain fully operational as normal, with 22 beds available, as well as functioning community teams.  The Senator may rest assured that I will keep this matter under close review and that all efforts will continue to be made by the HSE to address ongoing service difficulties at Linn Dara.</p></speech>

I implore the Minister of State to, please, change his script and find a way to resolve the matter.  He has mentioned that a "small number" of young people are involved.  The CAMHS service covers a region with a population of 420,000, yet only 45 young people are treated annually, while waiting times, as we know, are off the Richter scale.</p> <p>I welcome the recent announcement of ten new posts of advanced nurse practitioners.  I plead with the Minister of State to listen to me.  The unit's team provided a solution.  Superficially, it was accepted by the senior management team, but, sadly, a week later it reneged on the offer and the unit's team was told not to ask questions, to close the doors within a week and not tell the parents.  Management did not consult the staff.  We need to change that script in that regard.  A solution was provided this year, just as it was last year, but it was not taken on board.  As legislators, we cannot stand by as children's health is at risk.  Therefore, we need to show leadership by saying to the HSE senior management team that the closure will not happen and asking why it did not talk to us beforehand.</p> <p>The Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care will continue to pursue this matter.  The HSE turned down an invitation to appear before the committee today after initially accepting it to give its version of events which is the same as that of the Minister of State.  I urge him to find out more about the matter and not accept the HSE's bland excuses about staff shortages because they fly in the face of the evidence that I have in my possession.</p></speech>

There is an issue that affects staffing and it is cross-sectoral.  I am sure the Senator is well aware of the staffing issues, as she is very close to the staff.  Therefore, she understands the issues and the challenges.  However, I must view the issue at a policy level and identify the challenges at a national level.</p> <p>The day programme has been suspended temporarily for the summer months in order to accommodate and ensure continuity of inpatient and community services.  It is very important that best use be made of the available resources.  I support the HSE in its efforts to widen the scope of the service and ensure it will continue.  I understand the number of children impacted on by the change to the day programme is fewer than three.  When I say impacted on, I use the them carefully because the children concerned continue to avail of services in their communities.  The community CAMHS teams are delivering the services as opposed to the day programme run by Linn Dara.</p> <p>CAMHS has grown exponentially in the past few years.  The amount of money the State and the Government have put into developing it is astounding.  We have moved from a situation where 20,000 people were in institutional residential care during the 1960s to one where the number is just 1,000 people.  We have done so by building community teams and developing and growing CAMHS.  I, therefore, ask the Senator to withdraw her remark that attempts are being made to dismantle the service brick by brick because nothing could be further from the truth.</p></speech>

I recall that I made such a proposal about two years ago owing to increasing pressure on the State to provide long-term residential and respite care.  One of the proposals made called for the setting up of a biannual meeting of all of the key players.  They included the Department of Health, the HSE, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, the Irish Medical Organisation and Nursing Homes Ireland.  Such a meeting would allow them to meet and deal with challenges arising in the area.  Over 23,500 people live in private residential care settings under the fair deal scheme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have another 6,000 to 7,000 in community care services.  There is going to be a huge change in the demographics, with the number reaching 85 years of age increasing all of the time.  The number reaching 65 years of age is also increasing.  Therefore, there will be huge challenges.  Likewise, there will be huge challenges in hospitals because of the growth in population.  The figure used is that 51% of all hospital beds are occupied by people over 65 years of age.  If there is an increase in that demographic, there will be an increase in the demand for beds in hospitals.  Therefore, there will have to be a faster response from hospitals in trying to provide step-down care facilities.  It is in that context that I propose a forum be set up to deal with the issue of long-term care that would meet either once every three months or once every six months to tease out issues arising and that there be a fast response from both the HSE and the Department in order that they would act before issues arose that would have to be acted on urgently.  It is in that context that I raise the issue.</p></speech>

It is very real and there is no argument about it from my end, as the Senator is aware.  I support his endeavours to have it addressed in a broader context and have a facility for all stakeholders and all those with an interest in and a working knowledge of what is going on in the sector.  I have no difficulty in that regard.  As the Senator outlined, people are living longer than ever before and success in improving health outcomes and extending life expectancy has been achieved.  The projected numbers of older people are stark, to say the least.</p> <p>The report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, Sl&aacute;intecare, supports a significant shift in the model of care to one that is focused on prevention and early intervention and which will provide most care in the community.  It is crucial that the appropriate supports be in place to match each person&rsquo;s needs at whatever point he or she is at in the interaction with the healthcare system.  The Senator is a particular proponent of the policy of prevention, rather than cure, and that we work with people in the community to try to prevent difficulties, but we also know that it is a fact of life that a large population will invariably require long-term nursing care in a residential setting, no matter what efforts we make to avoid this.</p> <p>The Senator will be aware that the Department is developing a statutory home supports scheme.  An important step in the development of the new scheme was a consultation process which was carried out in 2017, the purpose of which was to allow everyone with views on this topic to have his or her say.  There was a very high response rate, with approximately 2,600 submissions received.  A report on the findings of the consultation process was published last month.</p> <p>Planning for future services will continue and it will be informed fully by the views and concerns of all stakeholders.  However, this is not an issue that can be readily progressed by the kind of forum proposed by the Senator.  The decisions that remain to be taken are less about what we need to do but about how to do it.  It relates in large part to resourcing and the balancing of priorities within the health sector and government overall.  I am pleased to inform the Senator that I will host a conference later this year on housing for older people which will bring together key stakeholders to share best practice and discuss how best to meet the needs of older people.</p> <p>As the Senator knows, I have a particular interest in addressing the long-term care needs of older people in communities and supported living environments.  Notwithstanding this, the Senator's point is valid.  I support the validity of his request, to have it considered furthe, that we have a specific forum, but what we do not want is a duplication of fora.  We want to ensure we build it in, but I do know from where the Senator is coming.  I have heard the case being made before and I am supportive and welcoming of it to ensure we can accommodate more voices at the table.  The Senator mentioned some of the stakeholders, including Nursing Homes Ireland and the IMO.  The conference we will organise in September, October or November will look at the long-term residential care needs of older people, not specifically in institutionalised settings but more in the community in supported housing.  All of the people whom the Senator mentioned will have a role to play and a contribution to make.  That will be part of the conversation.  As opposed to isolating it to residential care settings, we hope to broaden it out.</p></speech>

Likewise, when they go to the HSE, the response is that it must go and talk to the Department.  Their view is that even if such a forum was to meet only once every six months, all of the stakeholders would sit down to talk about the issues and how they could be addressed before they became a real problem.  It is in that context that they have raised the issue.  They are being told that one party has to consult the other.  As a result, they are finding that they have to go back and forth.  They state a meeting on a biannual basis would help in dealing with a lot of the issues that arise.</p></speech>

They are people who just want to be heard in a forum that is more complete in order that they are not potentially operating in a vacuum where one partner states it needs to discuss an issue with another.  I have discussed the matter with Nursing Home Ireland and understand from where it is coming.  Therefore, in the interests of completeness, I will certainly have the conversation on the Senator's behalf and progress the matter within the Department and the HSE to see if we can work out the detail of how it would work, be it a forum, a round table discussion or a biannual meeting.  We must ensure people's voices will be heard on a more regular basis in a more complete setting where every voice will be represented at the table at a given time in order that answers will be more readily available to them.</p></speech>

Youths have been arrested, shots fired at security forces and there has been a return to inter-communal strife between residents of the Bogside and Fountain areas of Derry.  Those issues must be addressed, although there will not be time to so do in this session.  The ongoing drift in Northern Ireland caused by the absence of a functioning Assembly in Stormont has led to a lack of decisions and inadequate progress in the peace process.  It is of concern to all Senators.  I ask the Leader to allocate time for us to comprehensively address that matter in the next session.</p> <p>All Senators are concerned by the health service.  The HSE has money lying idle for home helps but a staffing crisis is preventing it being used.  This issue does not affect only my county.  In Galway, Mayo and Roscommon there were 45,000 unused home care hours in the first three months of this year.  One in every four people in the country waiting for home help is in that area but no HSE staff are available to carry out the work.  There is a systems failure of monumental proportions not just in terms of the startling home help crisis but across the health service and that must be addressed.  A trolley crisis, equivalent to that in the annual January peak period, occurs daily.  That is another systems failure.  People arriving by ambulance at Cork University Hospital may wait for three hours before the ambulance can release them to the care of the accident and emergency department to receive treatment.  Step-down beds are available in hospitals such as those in Kenmare, Dingle and Tralee but there are insufficient staffing levels to be able to allow patients use them.  Meanwhile, the HSE is spending hundreds of millions of euro on agency staff.  All of those issues point to a systems failure in our health service.</p> <p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, is responsible for much legislation of huge importance which has come before the Seanad, whether from his Department or through the Department of Justice and Equality by proxy.  However, Ryanair has cancelled 30 flights and a proposed strike tomorrow will affect businesses and the economy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Despite this, while the Minister is willing to intervene in just about every other system and every other Department, he will not intervene in his own to ensure that flights continue between Ireland and the rest of the world.

The representatives outlined the stark reality of what work is like for their nurses.  I will read a short passage for the House:</p><blockquote>The reality of the ED Nurses daily/nightly experience is described as deep frustration and anger at the fact that they feel unable to care for their patient's fundamental needs in the way they would wish and are trained to do.  The physical environment where patients are crammed together within touching distance of each other, with little or no privacy, poor hygiene facilities are inadequate to maintain patient dignity or privacy.  This is a dehumanising and degrading experience for patients, their relatives and those that care for them is, and is now in its second decade.</blockquote> <p>That sums up what is happening in our hospital emergency departments and the conditions in which nurses have to work and in which patients are treated.</p><p>I refer to the previous speaker who talked about home help.  The fact is Fianna F&aacute;il went through this country and took hours from people who were vulnerable and elderly.  A 99 year old man in Westport was told that he could not even have two hours' home help a week under Fianna F&aacute;il.  That was the reality of it.  When it was supposed to stand up to the troika and protect our heath services, it offered them up as a sacrifice as it bankrupted the country.  I will not take lectures from Fianna F&aacute;il on what is happening within the home help service now.</p></speech>

There is now an opportunity for the HSE to get back into negotiations on the price, which it did not do in the first place, and to look at the conditions around the expert evidence available at the time.  I want the Minister for Health to outline the timeline and process involved in the approval of Translarna and to take responsibility for it.

This index is a measure of progress across all 17 sustainable development goals.  Countries like Sweden, Denmark and Finland are top of the ranking in terms of their progress towards achieving their goals by 2030.  It was no shock to see that, with regard to the sustainable development goals relating to the environment, Ireland is on the red list, which means we have a very poor status.  When it comes to the proportion of renewable energy in the total amount of electricity we consume, we have a red mark and a very poor rating.  When it comes to responsible consumption and production, again Ireland fares really badly.  On climate action and energy emissions, again we see a red dot and Ireland performing very poorly.  On sustainable development goal 14, life below water, Ireland receives a red dot in respect of ocean health.  Ireland again performs very badly.  We seem to be missing leadership when it comes to environment and water health.  In fact, with regard to life on land, Ireland is not performing and receives a red mark in respect of the annual change in forest area.  We are not, in any way, moving towards achieving the sustainable development goals we have signed up to by 2030.</p> <p>I want the Members of the House to be aware of this.  We have to work together and we have to try to meet our international obligations.

They show how dangerous it is to allow any opportunity for dissident republicans to take up this thing.  In fact, it shows how volatile the situation would be if there were any attempt to institute a Border again in this country.  With regard to setting a spark, incendiary activities and all the rest of it, these bonfires that the so-called Protestants set up are appalling.  I am glad that I am a member of the Church of Ireland, which is the reformed Catholic Church in this country and which is not associated with this shower up in the North of Ireland.  These monumental, enormous, vast skyscrapers are partly triumphalism and partly these people marking out their territory.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They seem to be very threatened, but I would say to them that the only way forward is by sharing.

I served with Bart on Cork County Council and his father, Mick Donegan, the girls' grandfather.  He was a great patriot and a great person and I worked very well with him over the years.  It is great to have them in the House.</p> <p>I raise the plight of the agricultural community that seems to have materialised following the drought, in particular in the past five to six weeks.  Four and a half months ago we had snow and now there has been no rain in my part of the country for the past five and a half to six weeks.  There is a knock-on effect on the water supply and grass growth has become a major issue.  Other crops are affected as well, in particular spring cereals.</p> <p>We must consider how we will manage the vast amount of stock in the future.  We have 365,000 extra cows in the country since 2013.  We must have a plan in place for when we have extreme weather events.  In the past five years, in both 2013 and 2018, we went to France to get fodder for the winter.  Given the scenario we are in at the moment we must come up with a long-term strategic plan so that we are not going to France when the situation develops into an emergency.  If we have to import fodder it should be done on a managed basis.  The situation is becoming dire in that most of the second cut of silage has been either grazed or cut and fed to cattle.  Fodder will be an incredibly important issue for the agricultural community for the coming winter.</p></speech>

Going forward, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine must be proactive in ensuring that winter fodder will be imported and be available.  We must put a strategic plan in place now to ensure fodder comes into this country not in March or April of next year but before the winter begins.</p></speech>

As Members know, the emergence of men's sheds is a fairly recent development and they are now located in many areas around the country.  I am familiar with the one in Monaghan town.  It has been a great development and offers great solace as well as outreach to men who for one reason or another feel isolated.  They could be retired or unemployed.  The groups are made up of tradespersons of all ilks.  It is a fantastic organisation that deserves great praise.  In light of all that, it is difficult to understand the decision by the HSE and the Government to cut funding to the Men's Sheds Association nationally by up to 7%.  We are talking about a cut of almost &euro;19,000.  That is most regrettable and will affect their ability to function as a national association.  It is difficult to understand the thinking behind the cut given the relatively small amount of money involved and the immeasurable return for society.</p> <p>I am sure I speak for most men when I say that a lot of us find it difficult to talk, to open up and discuss how we are feeling, especially when we are feeling down.  The Men's Sheds Association reaches out to people who are going through difficult times and offers them a base where they can meet people, have a chat and a cup of tea and get involved in voluntary and community projects.  It has been a great success story.  For that reason, I am astonished that the Government would decide to cut its funding.  I ask the Leader to bring this up with the Minister for Health and get the funding reinstated as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

It brings &euro;270 million into the country.  Projects are 85% funded from Europe.  Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth and Sligo directly benefit.  The programme funds shared educational initiatives for children and young people among other projects.  It is a very important fund.  For example, Cavan County Council gets in excess of &euro;1 million for PEACE projects.  Its importance is highlighted in particular in the context of the fighting and trouble in Derry over recent nights.  The fund is crucial.</p> <p>The European Social Fund is also crucial for employment.  It has funded a number of initiatives throughout the country.  I am very familiar with a number of them in Cavan and Monaghan.  I call on the Leader to arrange a special debate in this House to discuss with the relevant Ministers - if necessary we could have more than one debate - how to keep the funds in place and to prevent them being reduced following Brexit.  Even though we will be losing the UK from the EU the funds should be maintained at the same level.  The European Social Fund, which deals with unemployment in general and the creation of employment, would be much more crucial in a post-Brexit situation.  We need to protect PEACE IV, the European Social Fund and regional funding for the entire Border area.  I call on the Leader to provide a debate on the issue to ensure that none of the funding is lost.  I previously called on the Leader to arrange a debate to hold on to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, in its entirety but, similarly, I want to ensure we can hold onto those programmes because Ireland needs them.  Such a debate is urgently required.  Now is the time to address this issue.</p></speech>

Given the increased stocking levels of an extra 365,000 cows in the country I accept there is a stocking crisis and a fodder crisis.  As Senator Grace O'Sullivan said earlier, there is an environmental crisis.  Senator Lombard has an opportunity this evening to vote against the Heritage Bill, which attacks the very environment we have been trying to protect over a long period in this House.  When the vote is called this evening I hope he puts his vote where his mouth is and votes down the Bill.</p> <p>I have great respect for Senators Noone and McFadden who voiced their opinions on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  I recognise that Fine Gael has made an agreement with the Independent Alliance on the programme for Government.  I can very well understand Senator Noone's remarks that she is better staying within Fine Gael and fighting for change and I respect that but perhaps Fine Gael would try to assist the Minister, Deputy Ross, in his ten core principles and priorities that are laid down by the Independent Alliance.  One of those is to abolish the party whip in Leinster House.  I suggest that perhaps we would have a conversation with the Independent Alliance and that Fine Gael would assist it on a trial basis on this occasion in that the whip would not be applied on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill and that one of the Independent Alliance's core principles would be trialled over a number of days and let all parties vote without the whip being applied on a very important pillar of our democracy.  Perhaps no party should apply a whip on this occasion and let people vote according to what they see as being the correct thing to do.</p></speech>

I commend the Irish Air Corps, which helped put out a forest fire in Slieve Gullion in County Armagh.  This cross-Border co-operation sometimes goes unnoticed but we must welcome it.</p> <p>I welcome Prince Harry and Meghan to Ireland.  I have worn my Commonwealth tie today for everyone to see, to commemorate the occasion.  What is happening is absolutely incredible.  We have had the Taoiseach visiting east Belfast and the Orange Order and being welcomed and asked to come back again.  We have had Prince Charles and Camilla coming to Cork and being welcomed.  Today we have Harry and Meghan in Dublin.  This all comes off the back of the most successful visit of the Queen and Prince Phillip to Dublin in 2011 and the reciprocal State visit of the President to the United Kingdom.  The charm offensive is certainly working and most of the Irish public is falling for it.  We need to counteract this successful charm offensive.  The President should go on another State visit to the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

It is a do or die day for Prime Minister May.  The print was hardly set on the paper when it was denounced by David Davis and Boris Johnson, who have both walked out of Cabinet.  It does not augur well for the White Paper becoming official policy if there is a<i>coup d'&eacute;tat </i>against Prime Minister May in the next few days.</p><p>Nevertheless, if the White Paper is agreed on and presented to Mr. Barnier, our diplomats and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, should be proactive in working with the British Government in respect of a good deal for the United Kingdom.  A good deal for Britain should be a good deal for Ireland.  We have so much in common and there is trade of &euro;1.1 billion a week between our two countries.  We have the most to lose in these negotiations.</p><p>I was in Vienna on Monday at a meeting of the chairmen of all the European affairs committees in the EU, including representatives from the UK Government.  I reminded my colleagues that we are an island off an island off the mainland of Europe.  We are more affected than any other region in the European Union.  That is why we have to get special concessions.  If the White Paper is agreed and becomes part of the negotiations, I am hopeful there will be a good outcome allowing free trade between the United Kingdom and Ireland on a constant basis without any barriers or borders and with freedom of movement of people, goods and services.</p></speech>

It was an amazing achievement in extremely difficult terrain and a very complex path.  The best divers in the world took part.  The story captured the hearts and minds of the entire world.  I am delighted that one of the key people involved in the rescue was a gentleman living in Ennis, County Clare, called Jim Warny.  He is originally from Belgium but lives and works in Ennis and is a very important member of our community in Clare.  It shows that the outdoor physical activity that is taking place in Clare is bringing the best people in the world to live in and enjoy our county.  It was wonderful to think somebody from Ennis was able to fly out last Friday and play a crucial role in the rescue of those 12 boys and their coach.  I suggest that the Leader might write to the gentleman in Clare and pass on the admiration of the Upper House to him.  It is great to think we have such heroic people living among us.

All of us condemn the provocation and attacks.  As Senator Daly mentioned, we are on the edge of the marching season and of tomorrow's events in particular.  I hope all who take part in tomorrow's marches are cognisant of all communities who live in the North of our country.  We have made great progress and I hope tomorrow will be a day of peaceful demonstration and of parades.  I do not use the word "demonstration" in the sense of protest.  I welcome the decision of Ms Justice Keegan in the court in Belfast regarding bonfire size.  As Senator Norris expressed, I hope that tomorrow we can all share in what is good and recognise that we have to live together on our island.</p> <p>Senator Daly also made reference to the issue of home help.  The Government has invested significantly in home help hours.  As Senator Humphreys said yesterday, there is a road blockage somewhere regarding the allocation of home help hours and home care packages.  I know from my own experience that there is a blockage somewhere in the system.  I agree that we need to ensure that the system frees up that allocation of resources so that those who need home help hours or home care packages are able to avail of them.  </p> <p>Senator Daly also raised the Ryanair strike.  We hope the strike will not discommode the travelling public.  It is a matter for the industrial relations mechanisms of the State and it is a matter between Ryanair and its employees and their representatives.  I welcome the talks taking place today.

I thank the nurses' organisations and the nurses themselves for their work in our hospitals.  The INMO is a trade union of the nurses which came to the health committee with a particular vantage point.  There has been significant investment in the resourcing of our hospitals through recruitment, investment under the capital programme, and investment in upgrading facilities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are ongoing issues, so we must change the model as part of our overall work.

I will not take a lecture from anyone about the role of Fine Gael, as a party in government, in the appointment of judges, our support for the Judiciary or our support for the pillars of our society.  I would certainly be happy to participate later and outline some of the mistruths being told by people in this House.  If we are going to have a debate, let it be on the facts, not the personality of a Minister.  At times this week, I despaired at the level of debate and the carry-on of some.  It beggared belief.  We wasted so much time.  I appreciate that calling quorums and walk-through votes is a parliamentary device, and to be fair to my good friend, Senator Wilson, he was not the person calling the quorums, but some of the carry-on would not be seen in Tom Duffy's Circus.</p></speech>

If there are demerits, let us iron them out.</p> <p>Senators Lombard and Humphreys raised the issue of the effect of the drought and fine weather on the agriculture community.  There will be a knock-on effect.  Consider what Teagasc said last week about growth - there was no growth.  Yesterday, the Minister convened numerous meetings with stakeholders.  He has engaged daily.  I will endeavour to have him before the House next week for a debate on the matter, but it may not prove possible.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher discussed the Irish Men's Sheds Association.  There are 400 in the country, including 40 in Cork, which are doing great work, as the Cathaoirleach knows well.  I was not aware that there had been a funding cut.  I will endeavour to find out what that was about.</p> <p>Senator O'Reilly referred to PEACE funding.  I would be happy to arrange for a debate on that.  It is important that the Senator's concerns be addressed and that there be no slippage in funding.  Money should be put in place.  Particularly in this Brexit era, ERDF funding is important to the Border area.  A debate is necessary.  The Senator has often expressed his views on the need to keep the PEACE projects.  I would be happy to support him in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Humphreys also discussed climate change.  I would be happy to arrange for an ongoing debate.  The Senator also referred to the Whip system.  I am amused by the Labour Party's late conversion to it.  I hope that the party will apply the Senator's proposal to all votes instead of just a particular Bill.</p> <p>I join Senator Feighan on congratulating the Air Corps on its wonderful assistance this week.  It illustrates the importance of North-South joined-up approaches.  I also join Senators in welcoming Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, to the country.

I welcome to the Public Gallery members of the Traveller community and Traveller organisations whom I thank for this Bill.</p> <p>The proposal for a Bill emerged after consultation between Oein De Bhairduin from my office, Bernard Joyce of the Irish Traveller Movement and other national and local Traveller representative organisations.  The reasons for the Bill arose from, among other things, consistent reports and research highlighting the gross, disproportionate outcomes for Travellers in education as compared to the wider community.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colette Kelleher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As such, I present today the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill.  It is a Bill seeking to right some of the wrongs in our education system which particularly affect people from the Traveller community.  Hannagh McGinley, is a PhD candidate, co-ordinator of the module on Travellers, rights and nomadism at UCD, a teacher in the school of education at NUIG and an Irish Traveller herself.  As Hannagh puts it:</p><blockquote>The times we are living in are momentous.  This Bill has been a long time coming and it is wonderful to see our community at this juncture where they feel they have the right to demand a better quality of education for our children.</blockquote><p>The proposed Bill seeks to amend the Education Act 1998 to formally include Traveller culture and history in education.  Education is a key means to encourage social acceptance of diversity, fight discrimination and redress disadvantage.  The inclusion of Traveller culture and history within the curricula of Irish primary and post-primary schools is a logical and necessary extension of the State's historic recognition of Traveller ethnicity in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in March 2017.  The content of the Bill is in line with the equality and education policies developed by recent Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, as well as with Ireland's international obligations.  The report and recommendations on a Traveller education strategy, developed by the Department of Education and Skills under the then Minister, Mary Hanafin, in 2005, recommended that Traveller culture should be an integral part of the intercultural curriculum and represented positively in Irish primary schools.  Similarly, the Department of Justice and Equality's National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 commits to developing education resources on Traveller and Roma culture and history for use in primary, post-primary and adult education settings.  Including Traveller culture and history in the State's education system responds specifically to the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 2009, including that Roma and Traveller history and culture should be appropriately reflected in the general curriculum of schools.<br/><br/>As Ireland's most long-term disadvantaged group, Travellers experience gross disparities in educational attainment compared with the general populace.  According to a 2017 ESRI report, Travellers are over 50 times more likely to leave school without the leaving certificate than persons in the general population.  Only 9% of 25 to 34 year old Travellers have completed second level education compared with 86% of all persons nationally.  Including Traveller culture and history within the curricula of Irish schools would have a transformative effect on young Travellers' relationship with the education system.  It would recognise and validate their distinct culture and work against feelings of exclusion and high rates of school leaving and towards greater levels of educational attainment.  The potential to improve the educational attainment of minority students through the recognition of a minority culture within a school curriculum was demonstrated by the Te Kotahitanga project in New Zealand where the adoption of Maori-centred education for over 1,000 Maori students in selected schools significantly increased the retention rates and academic results of participants relative to Maori students in other schools.  That project helped to encourage the New Zealand Government to adopt a large-scale policy at national level to give Maori culture and history a central place in education.<br/><br/>In recognition of the shocking disparities in educational attainment for Travellers in Ireland, we must legislate.  We must also reverse the shocking 86.6% cuts introduced in 2011 to Traveller-specific education supports through the withdrawal of resource teachers for Travellers at primary level, teaching hours for Travellers in post-primary and of visiting teachers for Travellers generally, as well as the phasing out of senior Traveller training centres.  A serious degree of discrimination is faced by the Traveller community in Ireland at all levels of the education system and it must be reversed.  The disproportionate education cuts must be reversed.<br/><br/>As well as reversing the cuts mentioned, the recognition of Traveller culture and history within the education system through the implementation of the provisions of the Bill would also be of great benefit to all pupils and teachers, allowing them to learn about an important element of the rich mosaic of Ireland's cultural heritage.  The uniqueness and depth of Traveller culture has led to academic interest in the Traveller way of life over time in the disciplines of anthropology and folklore studies in Ireland and beyond.  Learning about aspects of this culture, such as the Gamin language, Traveller music, the historical barrel-top way of life and Travellers' fight for inclusion and dignity would broaden the cultural and historical education of Irish pupils and students in the way Black History Month has for students in the UK and the USA.<br/><br/>Enacting this legislation would help to counter the discriminatory attitudes and negative myths regarding Travellers that exist among members of the wider community.  It needs hardly to be demonstrated that these attitudes are all too common in Irish society.  According to the Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes national Traveller survey in 2017, only one in ten non-Travellers said he or she would employ a Traveller.  These myths have caused the perpetuation of a cycle of victim blaming, as described by psychologist William Ryan, whereby members of a dominant community see features of the social life of a marginalised community that are the result of poverty and marginalisation as essential features of that community's culture and use this observation to justify racist attitudes that cause this cycle of poverty, exclusion and marginalisation to continue.  It is common in Ireland today to blame Travellers and as such to blame the victims of discrimination for discrimination.  In 2018, we can no longer afford to blame victims.  We can do better than that and we need to act.<br/><br/>Since the launch of the Traveller Oireachtas group and the launch of the Bill last week, I have received many positive messages and correspondence.  However, I highlight a particular email I received which has convinced me more than ever of the need for and merit of the proposed Bill.  The correspondence was from a person working in a school, possibly even a teacher, who wrote:</p><blockquote>I am outraged to read your article stating how Traveller Children are 'discriminated against and bullied' in Irish Schools [...] forget introducing the history of the traveller culture as mandatory in Irish Schools.  We have enough of their culture.  Perhaps introducing a mandatory code of practice/behaviour class for travellers to take before their acceptance into mainstream education would be a wiser option or else provide them with education facilities in their own communities and stop their discrimination against us.</blockquote><p>I am horrified that a person with such beliefs and prejudice has any role in the education of children, let alone Traveller children.  This person is not fit to work in a school in any capacity.  Faced with such naked prejudice, is it any wonder that Travellers have such high rates of mental ill-health?  The rate of suicide in the Traveller community is six times higher than in the wider population.  Faced with such bile, is it any wonder Travellers leave school early when met on a daily basis with such ignorance and such prejudice?<br/><br/>The Bill proposes to amend sections 9 and 30 of the Education Act 1998 to provide that the Minister shall prescribe that Traveller culture and history is taught in recognised Irish schools.  Given that previous Government education strategies regarding the Traveller community did not culminate in an implementation plan, including the 2006 Traveller education strategy, the adoption of legislation by the Oireachtas is the best way to ensure that the Department of Education and Skills honours its commitment to develop primary and post-primary curricula which include Traveller culture and history as mandatory elements of primary and second-level education.<br/><br/>Enacting this legislation would also allow the Minister to consult with representative bodies, including the Irish Traveller Movement and other Traveller community groups, to establish in what way Traveller history and culture could best be introduced in school curricula.  As community bodies representing a large number of Traveller parents, groups such as the Irish Traveller Movement are legally entitled to participate in the development of elements of the national curriculum covering Traveller culture and history.  This reflects Article 42 of the Constitution, which gives parents the primary role in determining their children's education.  The Bill would therefore make it mandatory for recognised schools to promote and teach Traveller culture and history.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the Minister does in fact have the power under current legislation to provide for the inclusion of Traveller culture and history in the curricula of recognised schools.  This power is found in section 30(1) of the Education Act 1998 which provides that the Minister may prescribe the curriculum for recognised schools.  While the Minister has enjoyed this power since 1999 and, as such, had this power for 20 years, Traveller culture and history have not been included in curricula.  Under the provisions of the proposed Bill, the Minister would be required to make an order under section 30 of the Education Act 1998 to stipulate the precise content to be included in curricula.  In other words, the Bill requires the Minister to act.  Currently, any reference to Traveller culture or history is left to the discretion of the individual teacher.  The inclusion of a unique element of Irish history and culture should not and cannot be left up to the decision of individual teachers.  Teachers should be provided with a basis in the curriculum to educate a more diverse school-going population on Traveller culture and history.  Teachers should be provided with the necessary training, skills and cultural awareness to carry out this work sensitively, confidently and affirmatively.<br/><br/>The provisions contained of the Bill represent a strong tool to create a fully inclusive curriculum that values all of Ireland's rich culture and heritage; a culture and heritage that recognises and includes Travellers.  This legislation can help us to create a more respectful, inclusive and fair education system which can combat long-lasting and deep-rooted prejudice and discrimination and lead to a more respectful and equal society in Ireland.  The Bill is also about implementing existing Government policy in commitments in policy guidelines issued by the Department of Education and Skills in 2005 and by the Department of Justice and Equality in 2017.  The Bill will bring Ireland further into line with international obligations and standards regarding Traveller education and conform with recommendations issued by the Council of Europe in 1989 and 2009 and with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was adopted in 1989.<br/><br/>Enacting the Bill will give Travellers a real stake in the education system.  Similar initiatives in countries such as New Zealand have shown that curricula inclusive of minority group culture can have a positive effect.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colette Kelleher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Bill would also assist in the process of redress for internalised oppression and combat against related future mental health issues faced by Travellers and associated with the educational and cultural repression they have endured.  The Bill will foster a real enrichment of the Irish education system, developing a more open, inclusive and diverse curriculum which is inclusive of Traveller traditions of language, music, oral culture, nomadic lifestyle and community activism.  The Bill will be a positive step forward in combatting one of Ireland&rsquo;s most shameful and widespread forms of discrimination.  It will help realise the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar&rsquo;s aspirational statement following his election that, &ldquo;Prejudice has no hold in this Republic&rdquo;.</p><p>I ask the Minister and colleagues in the Seanad to support the Bill.  The Bill&rsquo;s passing into law would be a strong and unequivocal message in favour of a more inclusive Ireland, an Ireland that welcomes and celebrates diversity, an Ireland that respects all its citizens, an Ireland that nourishes, promotes and protects its diverse set of cultures and histories, and respects the unique Traveller culture and history that forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s heritage.  The inclusion of Traveller culture and history in the curricula of Irish primary and post-primary schools is the logical and long-awaited next step following on from the historic recognition of Traveller ethnicity by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 1 March 2017.  I thank the Cathaoirleach, the Minister and all my colleagues for the support.  I commend the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I am honoured to support this legislation and I am encouraged by the broad support for it in the House.</p> <p>After hours of thinking about what I wanted to say and how to phrase how important I think the Bill is, I came to the realisation that I was finding it difficult because, while I can speak about my own experience of stigma, social class, barriers in education, experience of deprivation and so on, it must be said that no matter how difficult what I have experienced has been, my Traveller friends have experienced so much more.  The expectation and aspiration that I could have gone on to do my leaving certificate was very much there for me but it was not for my Traveller friends.  I remember starting first year and noticing the Travellers in my classroom in primary school had not arrived for their first day of secondary school.  I remember the first time my friend invited me into his home.  I had known him for ten years but I heard him as a young Traveller man for the very first time that day.  We were only kids and I asked him why he did not talk like the rest of his family when we were out on the street.  His reply was, &ldquo;I will get only slagged, Lynn."  Imagine spending your day with your settled peers, having to master their use of language and their accent, and suppressing your own identity to avoid comment or jeering from friends.</p> <p>History and culture was very important in the 19th century to progressing the cause of identity and self-determination.  When a people&rsquo;s culture and history is validated and supported at State level, it will create a more inclusive Ireland.  More importantly, it will give the Traveller community a sense of belonging to the State, and the State will be displaying ownership of all its people and cultures.  Traveller history and culture is Irish history and culture; it is part of the multicultural history of Ireland.  It will not only benefit the Traveller community but the majority of the settled community just as much.  It will allow for a far more open discourse in the coming decade on what it is to be Irish in a continuously changing society.  Imagine if my friend could have expressed his identity, history and culture, and that we, as a State, supported and validated who he was throughout his life.  Imagine that we, as a State, had not imposed the stigma and marginalisation that we did in past oppressive policies.</p> <p>Over the last week or so, after conversations with friends and organisations in the Traveller community, a similar theme came through in what they all said.  Travellers in school are made to feel ashamed of their identity.  This happened without any of us actually taking the time to know what their history and culture is, or what it means to be a Traveller.  We have stigmatised and shamed the Traveller community out of ignorance and in an effort to force them to be us - to be settled - as if we were somehow superior.  Just as Thomas McCann said last week at the launch of the cross-party Oireachtas group on Travellers, the 1963 Government report from the Commission on Itinerancy described Travellers as &ldquo;problems&rdquo; for which there would be &ldquo;no final solution.&rdquo;  Ultimately, this State considered Travellers as failed settled people.  We must undo this.  We can begin by educating all of the generations to come on Traveller history and culture.  Education, awareness and acceptance are at the foundation of ending discrimination.  I believe the onus is on the State to be front and centre of ending that discrimination.  It was largely a State-imposed discrimination dating back over several decades.</p> <p>There is an absolute need to develop tools to include the history of Traveller culture in all parts of the primary and secondary syllabus.  We would look to include it in the CSPE programme but we can also look at social geography.  Nomadism should be included as a definition with reference to other indigenous peoples.  In the social and scientific area, the definition of family should be expanded to include the model of extended family.  Traveller music from musicians such as Johnny Doherty and Paddy Keenan should be included in the curriculum.  Regarding art, curriculum projects should include Traveller artistic contributions as one of the options alongside still life, for example.  In short, Traveller culture should be throughout the curriculum at all stages of education, not solely as a once-off module in a once a year class.</p> <p>This is one phase of addressing the inequality and discrimination for Travellers but we must be aware of the fact that we have much to do in regard to resources and accommodation.  Recognition of ethnicity does not magically bring Travellers up to a place of equity with the rest of society.  It does not erase the harm we have done to their community and their lives.  Some of the ways in which education can be a tool to achieve this are as follows: culturally appropriate primary school programmes; Traveller resource teachers to be reinstated; Traveller special needs assistants and teachers to be employed; Traveller home liaison supports; specific training projects for young Traveller men; and Traveller organisations to be resourced to develop a national network committed to supporting Traveller men.</p> <p>To conclude, we must ensure an inclusive and culturally respectful education system is available to all and it is imperative that the education sector meets that need.  This includes mandatory diversity awareness training for all educators and investment in culturally appropriate learning environments.  In addition, culturally appropriate learning materials must be developed for all sectors of the education system.  I truly regret that I spent my school years oblivious to the harm being inflicted on the Traveller community and on my Traveller friends.  I hope this Bill can start to change that for Traveller children in generations to come.</p></speech>

I commend her for initiating that group and also for this Bill, which is very important.  As others have described, the policy of the State for far too long, and made very explicit in the 1963 policies, was a policy of absorption and assimilation - of effectively disappearing Travellers and their contribution and history within the State.  For far too long, many Travellers who have attempted to navigate the education system, which has at times been openly hostile, have felt they had to choose between prejudice or invisibility, a tension which nobody should be asked to face, rather than having the opportunity to be recognised, celebrated and supported in the fullness of their identity.</p> <p>That invisibility has also done damage to the wider community and has made our history incomplete.  When we talk about our history and culture in Ireland, Travellers and the Traveller community have made a huge contribution and are part of that history and culture, part of the fabric of what has made us.  In our recent commemorations, we have been looking at how we mark history and looking, for example, at the contribution of women in shaping our State and ensuring that is written in.  This is not simply important for women; it is important for us to really understand who we are as a nation and all of the facets of that.  If we look at a particular area of culture such as music, at times when elements of Irish culture and music were banned and under pressure, and when we had gaps over centuries, it was Traveller culture that kept alive much of Ireland's musical tradition.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, when these aspects of our culture re-enter the mainstream, the contribution and work of many Travellers, whether the Doran family or the Dunne family, can be lost.  Travellers have contributed not only to our national culture and history but also to Ireland's international connections.  I have in mind, for example, the travels of Pecker Dunne in Australia and the connections he made at that time.  I applaud the University of Limerick, which has done great work to highlight Traveller culture.</p><p>This is a chance to ensure our education system truly reflects and supports all who participate in it.  It is important for the rights of the child and of indigenous persons, which are enshrined as UN principles, and for having a good education system for everyone.  We should look to the role of history across all aspects of our education system, although I recognise this Bill seeks to ensure these issues are reflected in many strands.</p><p>As I stated previously in the House, the former National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism sought to work across all Departments to ensure we turn these principles and high-level statements on ethnicity into real action.  I would like this Bill to be an opportunity to reignite a positive constructive questioning across all Departments about how we can do better to integrate and recognise the Traveller contribution across society.</p><p>In recognising culture and history, we empower the next generation of young Travellers in our education system to take ownership and be proud of their culture and to shape its future because it is an evolving and changing thing.  That is important to recognise.</p></speech>

The approach encapsulated in this draft legislation is a very good and one we should adopt.  The education system in Ireland operates, or at least should operate, on an inclusive basis in keeping with our obligations under the Constitution and national and international law.  An ESRI report from 2017 entitled "A Social Portrait of Travellers in Ireland" was commissioned by the Department of Justice and Equality drawing largely on data from the census of 2011.  The report highlighted the lower levels of educational attainment among Travellers and the unsurprising fact that greater chances of gaining employment are associated with higher educational attainment levels.  The report also references the withdrawal of educational supports following the austerity budget in 2011.</p> <p>While Traveller children are more likely to attend a Developing Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, school than non-Travellers, and thus avail of additional supports in these schools, the report references that not all Travellers attend DEIS schools.  In particular, it states that mainstreaming without specific intervention for Travellers may result in Traveller needs not being met.  It is intended the learning from the ongoing cross-sectional pilot, which was proposed under the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy and led by TUSLA, will address some of these issues.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's comments on the pilot.</p> <p>In accordance with the Government policy of inclusion, the policy on Traveller education is that Traveller children attend mainstream schools with previously segregated provision now funded as part of the mainstream system.  A number of Traveller-specific supports remain in the system to assist with the transition to the mainstream system of pupils previously provided for in segregated provision.  These comprise 141 alleviation resource teacher posts for schools with significant numbers of Travellers at a current cost &euro;8.46 million, additional pupil capitation for Travellers at a rate of &euro;70 per pupil for primary and &euro;201 per pupil for post-primary at a current cost of &euro;1.11 million.  In 2016 and 2017, there were 7,901 pupils in mainstream primary schools who identified as members of the Traveller community.</p> <p>The Minister will no doubt go into more detail about the DEIS plan which in 2017 recognised that engagement of Travellers and Roma in education is a continuing challenge.  Aspects of Traveller and Roma culture, together with past experiences of some parents and grandparents with education, can give rise to difficulties with school attendance, participation and retention.  It is important existing good practice and innovation in schools and ancillary support services are harnessed to improve the education experience of Traveller children in school.  The legislation encapsulates much of that.</p> <p>I support this very important legislation to which I am hopeful of a positive response from the Minister.</p></speech>

The Senator should not have to introduce legislation to have the proposed measure implemented.  It should already be in place as a structure for doing so is in place in the education system.  If the Minister and his officials were so inclined, they could issue a directive requiring that this subject be on the curriculum of primary and post-primary schools from September onwards.  I encourage him to do so.  This Bill will become law.  I very much support it and I hope, in the interests of justice, fairness, equality of opportunity and equality in general, that the Government will also support it and allow it to pass in both Houses.  Once passed in this House, it should swiftly move to the D&aacute;il and become law. </p> <p>We should educate mainstream - if one can call them that - settled children on the culture of Travellers in any case.  We have a responsibility to do that because Travellers are a recognised ethnic group in this community.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, to his eternal credit, ensured before he left office that Traveller ethnicity was recognised by the Government.  That decision changes the landscape completely.  We have now recognised Travellers as an ethnic group, which brings with it responsibilities to educate our young people about the diversity, uniqueness and rich culture of one of our traditional ethnic groups.  It is a priority that this should become part of the educational curriculum.</p> <p>I take the Bill as read because it will be passed, and rightly so.  Senator Kelleher has championed these issues since she came into these Houses, and with great success.  Education within the Traveller community has not received sufficient resources.  Schools trying to provide equal opportunity and access to education to Travellers need to be provided with the supports to do so.  The one way we see members of the Travelling community get out of poverty and get opportunities is by giving them as much access as possible to education.  It has been proved time and again that Travellers who have benefited from education have gone on to make an enormous contribution to this country and its culture and identity.  The more members of the Travelling community who have access to education, the more their abilities will be brought to the fore and they will be able to make an even greater contribution to society.  That percolates through all minority groups, but particularly Travellers.  The number of Travellers who go on to third level is very small. </p></speech>
